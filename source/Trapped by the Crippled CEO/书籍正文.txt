###Chapter 1

Stella's POV

The soft click of the door snapped me awake.

Lightning flashed. and a tall silhouette loomed in the doorway.He moved with a predator's grace. lethal and magnetic. My pulse spiked as his scent hit me-expensive cologne. subtle but unmistakable, curling into my lungs.

Years of Jiu-Jitsu kicked in. I rolled to dodge. but I was too slow. His hands clamped around my wrists like steel. slamming my back onto the mattress. His body pinned me down. heavy and hot, every hard line of him sinking into me through the flimsy silk of my nightgown.

"Who are you?" His voice was deep. dangerous, his breath scorching my neck.

A shiver raced through me-not fear, something else. I twisted beneath him, trying to break free, but he pressed closer. his thigh shoving between my legs, grinding against me slow and deliberate. His chest crushed mine, one hand sliding up to grip my breast, squeezing hard enough to make me gasp.His hips rocked forward, and I felt him-thick and rigid- pressing alminst my des througth his pants. tho heat of ft sewrbng through the thin fabric. His lips grazed my law. stubble scraping m) skin. and I couldn't stop the way my hoart F)unded, wild and unstendy.


"Let me go!" I hissed. but my voice cracked. betraying me. I yanked one arm free, shoving at him. only for him to grab my shoulder and flip me over. pinning me face-down. His mouth hovered by my ear, hot and teasing, while his groin pressed harder into me, that bulge rubbing me in a way that made my thighs clench.


Then it hit me. He was standing. Adam Lancaster-the supposed cripple-was *standing*.

He was my "groom" today. the heir to the Lancaster family.the one who'd supposedly been paralyzed in a car crash years ago.Everyone thought he was wheelchair-bound, too broken to even show up for his own wedding. But here he was, standing tall, legs working just fine, pinning me down like he owned the place.

"Damn," he muttered, low and almost admiring, as I managed to slip out from under him. ′′I7'm Mrs. Lancaster," I snapped, scrambling back to put space between us. "Leave now, or I'll call security-"A dark chuckle sliced through the room.Call\who?" The lights blazed on, and I froze, staring into the most striking green eyes I'd ever seen. He was tall, commanding, and very much in control of those legs. Before I could process it. his hand shot to my throat, shoving me against the wall.fingers brushing my pulse with a grip that was firm yet taunting.


"Weren't you calling security?" His tone was lazy. mocking. but his hold didn't budge.

I clawed at his wrist, gasping."Iwon't... tell anyone about your legs!"

"Miss Winston," he spat my name like it burned his tongue,"you,some nobody, dare to dream of being my wife?"

He let go abruptly. and I slid down the wall, chest heaving.With slow, deliberate ease, he pulled a Dunhill cigarette from his pocket and lit it, the flame casting sharp shadows over a face that could've been carved by Michelangelo.

"I'll give you a chance," he said, exhaling smoke."Pick how you want to disappear."

"Mr. Lancaster," I forced out, steadying my voice, "I'm your legal wife. You can't treat me like this!" His laugh was cold, hollow. "Miss Winston, survive the storm tonight, and I might let you keep the title of Mrs. Lancaster." A soft knock broke the tense atmosphere in the room. "Sir?"

The deep male voice came from outside the door. I felt a wave of relief.but the man before me showed no signs of relaxing.his mesmerizing green eyes still locked on me.

"Come in." Adam 's voice was like ice shattering on marble-cold and cutting.

The door opened, and a tall butler with graying temples stood in the doorway. After a moment's hesitation, he didn't step into the room, seemingly aware of an inherent reverence for this space.

"Joseph, did you let her in?" Adam's face was as dark as the sky before a storm.

Joseph glanced at me. then quickly returned his gaze to Adam,his expression revealing complex emotions. He neither denied the accusation nor immediately admitted to it.

"Sir, if I may," he took a deep breath, his voice steady and respectful, "you can't remain alone forever. Madam has always favored Miss Winston as your wife."

Adam's expression didn't shift in the slightest, as if Joseph's words were merely a breeze across water, raising no ripples in his heart.

"Joseph, this is the first and last time something like this happens," he said.

There was no anger in his tone. but this very calmness made it more chilling. Joseph slightly bowed his head and silently left the room, gently closing the door behind him.


I stood frozen, feeling like I was trapped in a predator's territory. Adam's gaze swept over my soaked nightgown. his lips curved in a mocking smile. He turned toward the floor-to-ceiling window. his tall figure showing no sign of any leg disability.


"A week ago,you were my nephew's fiancée, and now you're desperate to climb into my bed?" His voice was frighteningly calm. "Stella. your affections come cheap."

His words stabbed my heart like a knife, but I clenched my teeth, refusing to show any weakness.

"You think I want to 'climb' into anyone's bed?" I replied with equally cold tone. "The engagement was arranged between the Winston family and yours.I never had a choice." Adam turned around, his eyes flashing with surprise,apparently not expecting such a response. But he quickly regained his impassive expression. "Get out," he commanded briefly. "I don't need women throwing themselves at me. I'm not a charity."I walked toward the door with my head held high.though my heart was shattered into pieces. I refused to bow my head before him. At the doorway. I turned back, looking directly into those green eyes.


"Mr. Lancaster, you're right. I won't stay here. But I won't let the Winstons win either. No matter what, I'll keep my position as Mrs. Lancaster-" I paused, "even if it's just in name."

With that, I opened the door and walked out, hearing his cold laughter behind me,"We'll see about that."
###Chapter 2

Stella's POV

The rain lashed at me like a madman, cold droplets dripping from my hair, soaking through my paper-thin coat. The iron gates of Lancaster Manor locked behind me, silently mocking my disarray.

I looked up at the Gothic structure before me, its countless windows devouring light and hope like black holes. I knew I had to stay here, I couldn't leave.

*If I left, what would happen to Grandma?* My head throbbed as if it would explode, my body alternated between chills and fever, my consciousness began to blur, but I couldn't collapse,couldn't surrender, couldn't let the bastards of the Winston family win.

Rain mixed with tears slid down my face, and I bit my lip to keep from crying out. In that moment, all the years of bullshit from the Winston family surged up, stabbing my heart like knives. I was never their daughter, just a meticulously groomed tool, a trophy to gild the family name. I had to be home by ten, no parties with classmates, straight A's were mandatory,and I had to master a plethora of talents, always presenting perfect manners and a fake smile at social events. "Don't forget, you're just a foundling!" That curse followed me as I grew up. When I was fifteen. I accidentally discovered a DNA report and learned I wasn't a biological Winston.


That dlay. I first questioned why Anna and John Winston had adopted me. "Adopt you?" Anna's laugh was cold enough to freeze me. "You think you're the chosen one? Let me tell you.you're just a stand-in, filling the void left by our lost daughter."


Their biological daughter. Lucy, had gone missing as a child.and Anna had a breakdown. The doctor suggested adopting a child of the same age to wait for the real daughter to be found.and I was the unlucky substitute.


I could never forget the time I refused to date the "high society boyfriend" they had chosen for me. and John beat me black and blue.


Or the time I had a fever of 104 degrees. It was a winter night when I was sixteen, and the Winston house was as cold as an ice cave.I curled up on the sofa with a thin blanket, my forehead so hot you could fry an egg on it, and my lips were cracked and bleeding. Anna and John were upstairs arguing, their voices piercingly sharp, but I didn't even have the strength to call out to them. I felt like I was going to die.No one cared about me. The servants had gone off duty,and the house was empty, with only me shaking like a leaf. It wasn t until Grandma-Mrs. Winston-came downstairs and saw me in that state. Her face turned pale, and she hurriedly felt my forehead.

"Stella,how did you get such a high fever!" Her voice was trembling. but I could only look at her with a hoarse throat.

She drove me to the hospital through the snowstorm,the wind and snow so strong they could knock a person over. Her frail body managed to carry me into the emergency room. For three days and nights, she didn't sleep, holding my hand as if afraid I would disappear.

Her eyes were swollen from exhaustion, and she softly comforted me, "Don't be afraid, Grandma is here." Anna and John never came, not even a phone call. I almost didn't make it.but they didn't care. Grandma was my only warmth.

A sharp ringtone interrupted my thoughts, and my wet fingers struggled to pull out my phone. Brian Lancaster's name flashed on the screen, making me want to vomit.

Taking a deep breath, I answered. "Stella," his arrogant and sleazy voice came through, "Beg me, and I might let you stay by my side."

Nausea rose in my throat, and I nearly retched."′′Bian,a scumbag who cheats on his fiancée makes me sick!" I snarled. "I chased Lucy because you're too uptight and boring!" His tone was full of grievance and disdain. "We're engaged.and you wouldn't even let me touch you!"

I laughed in anger. Brian. Adam's nephew, was once my fiancé.The Winston family arranged for me to marry him until three months ago, when the long-lost Lucy suddenly reappeared.DNA proved she was the real daughter, and I, the stand-in.became useless.


To smoothly integrate Lucy into high society, Anna orchestrated everything, forcing me to break off the engagement and marry Brian's uncle-Adam Lancaster.

The night before the wedding, I caught Brian and Lucy embracing. At that moment, I saw through the Winston family's scheme: shove me to the "cripple" Adam and keep Brian for Lucy.

"Stella, what can that cripple Adam give you?" Brian continued to mock, "He's lame, can't even satisfy you in bed. If you want a good life, you can only rely on me." Lame? I sneered, recalling Adam last night in the bedroom,moving agilely to pin me down, his hard body pressing against mine, the memory vivid in my mind. "Brian, wake up! No matter how bad things get, I won't pick a man from the trash heap!" My voice trembled with rage,′′Oh, and remember to call me'Aunt'when you see me!" Hanging up. I felt a rush of satisfaction. Brian's father was Adam's half-brother, so by etiquette, he had to call me Aunt.The thought of that bastard having to respectfully address me as "Aunt" made me grin.

But the fleeting victory was soon drowned by physical pain.Rain pelted my face, blurring my vision, and consciousness felt like it was being swallowed by a dark tide. *No, I can't fall!* I clung to consciousness, thinking of Grandma who had taken her last pill today. Only I could buy her new ones, only I visited her regularly, bringing her favorite snacks and flowers.

In the pouring rain, I stubbornly stood outside the locked gates of Lancaster Manor, occasionally glancing up at the lit window on the second floor. I knew Adam was there, probably watching my sorry state with cold eyes. *He wants to see me kneel? No way!*

After an indeterminate amount of time, I locked eyes with a shadow on the second floor. In the dim light, his tall, stern silhouette looked down at me, the drenched wretch. I smiled at the shadow, though he probably couldn't see my face clearly, I still defiantly raised my hand and gave a simple wave.*I will hold onto the position of Mrs. Lancaster, whether you like it or not!* The shadow seemed to hesitate, then retreated behind the curtains. Shortly after, the light in that window went out, and the entire manor sank back into a deathly darkness. The rain continued to pour, and I stood there. letting the rain wash away my body heat and hope. I didn't know how long it had been when a pale dawn light appeared in the east, and the rain finally stopped.


My lips were numb, my limbs felt like they were filled with lead.but I still stood, my back straight as a rod, holding onto my last shred of dignity.


The manor gates slowly opened, and a uniformed servant walked out, his face a mix of surprise, confusion, and pity as he saw me. "Madam... are you alright?" he asked cautiously.

I was about to speak when a familiar figure appeared at the door-Adam Lancaster, sitting in a wheelchair,pushed by Joseph. He was impeccably dressed in a perfectly tailored dark gray suit, his hair neatly combed, exuding a cold aura like a blade. His mesmerizing green eyes stared straight at me, as if piercing my soul.

Seeing him, my head spun, but I forced myself to stand firm, a smile tugging at my lips. "Good morning, Mr. Lancaster!" My voice was hoarse from the rain, but I maintained a facade of politeness. Adam's brow furrowed slightly, a flash of undisguised surprise in his green eyes. He clearly hadn't expected me to endure a whole night of torrential rain and still stand to greet him. *Damn,you think I'd collapse and beg you? Dream on!*"Sorry to disappoint you. Mr. Lacaster!" I continued, my voice weak but defiant.


He didn't respond immediately, signaling Joseph to push the wheelchair closer. In the sunlight. I could see his chiseled face-high cheekbones. tightly pressed thin lips. and those eyes that seemed to see through everything.


I suddenly felt like laughing, *Disappointed? I held on this long just to show you how tough I am!*

Adam suddenly reached out and gripped my chin, not hard but firm enough that I couldn't break free. His hand was scorching hot, a stark contrast to his icy gaze. Forcing me to look down at him, his voice was low and dangerous, "Stella,do you want so badly to be my woman?"

Those green eyes flickered with something I couldn't decipher-mockery? Curiosity? I clung to the wheelchair's armrest to steady myself, the cold metal numbing my fingers, but his hand was hot enough to melt my frozen skin.

I fought to steady myself, my head pounding like it would burst, his image starting to blur. *I can't show weakness in front of him, never!* "No, Mr. Lancaster," I forced a smile, my voice soft but firm, "I don't want to be your woman, I just want the position and dignity I deserve."

Surprise flashed in Adam's eyes, quickly replaced by his uisual icy demeanor. He released my chin, leaning back in the wheelchair, his gaze still fixed on me. *Damn,you think I'm crazy? Even if I am. I'll hold on!*

"Joseph," he suddenly spoke, his voice frighteningly calm,"Take my wife inside."


Wife? I almost thought I misheard. Joseph hesitated for a moment but quickly recovered, extending a hand to me.

At that moment, all my strength and stubbornness seemed to drain away, the dizziness from the fever finally overwhelming me. My vision darkened, my knees buckled, and I fell forward uncontrollably.
###Chapter 3

Stella's POV

I woke up in the morning. the heat of Adam's touch still branding my skin like a lingering burn.

His wheelchair sat abandoned by the door, a prop in a performance growing more tangled by the minute. Every move he made radiated raw power, pulling my eyes like a damn magnet. Stop staring, Stella. He's just a stranger. I scolded myself, but my gaze wouldn't quit.

"Your skin's burning up." His voice was dark honey-smooth.dangerous, dripping into my ears. Those sharp green eyes locked on me, so intense my breath snagged. One big hand brushed my forehead, the casual intimacy spiking my pulse like a live wire. "How... inconvenient."

I couldn't pin down his tone-annoyance laced with what?Curiosity? His jaw tightened, like he was wrestling something inside himself. I opened my mouth to reply, but my legs gave out, too weak to hold me. Strong arms caught me before I hit the floor, and suddenly I was pressed against a wall of hard muscle.His cologne flooded my senses, thick and dizzying. So much for the paralyzed act-this guy's all man. "Does it hurt?" His breath grazed my ear, sending a shiver down my spine. One hand slid to my waist, gripping me tight.his heat searing through my nightgown and sparking jolts across my skin. "If a little fever's too much for you, Mrs.Lancaster,how're you gonna handle me in bed?"

The words were harsh. but his voice dropped to a husky whisper that set my heart racing. His hands trembled faintly,betraying the cool front he was trying to keep. My face went hot, palms flat against his chest-I could feel his heartbeat,pounding faster than his icy vibe let on. He's not ascalm as he looks.

"I... I can learn," I stammered, my voice breathy and embarrassing as hell. "In bed, I... I don't mind a little pain..."

The second it slipped out, I wanted to die. Fever's fried my brain-what the hell am I saying? But something dark and ravenous flashed across his face before he could hide it. His grip on my waist tightened, thumb rubbing slow, maddening circles over my hip, and I swear I heard him suck in a sharp breath. "Shameless," he growled, the word cutting, but that thumb kept circling, teasing my skin like he couldn't help himself. My mind spun-He's calling me out, but why's he still touching me?Pushing me away or pulling me in?-and my body melted into him,traitorously soft against his heat. "Mr. Lancaster," I tried to claw back some dignity, even as my voice sounded like a damn purr."Im looking forward to your...future guidance."

Oh God, kill me now-what am I even saying? I cringed inside.but the words were out, hanging between us. His eyes dropped to my lips, and my heart stopped-Is he gonna kiss me? My head went fuzzy with pink-tinted panic, picturing his mouth crashing down, hard or soft, maybe biting, tasting me right there.


But then darkness crept in, my vision blurring. The last thing I saw before blacking out was the conflict twisting his perfect face-torn,almost pissed-and the gentle way his arms cradled me as I went limp, like he didn't want me to break.


\---

I woke to the soft beeping of medical equipment. The bedroom had been replaced by an elegantly appointed guest suite, all neutral tones and discrete medical monitoring devices. My skin still tingled where Adam had touched me,the memory making me flush despite my best efforts to forget.

"The fever's breaking," someone murmured. "She'll need rest and fluids."Rest. Right. As if I could rest with the phantom sensation of those strong hands still burning into my skin.His eyes dropped to my lips, and for a heart-stopping moment, I thought he might... but then darkness creeping my vision again. The last thing I saw before consciousness fled was the conflicted expression that flashed across his perfect features.and the gentle way his arms cradled me as I fell.

But fate, it seemed, had other plans.


\---


"Miss Winston." Adam's voice broke the silence of the manor's storage room. The barely contained fury in his tone made me stiffen. "Care to explain this?"

I turned from where I'd been examining my items, only to freeze at the sight of what he held. The rage in his eyes was at odds with the deadly calm of his stance, and something in my chest tightened painfully at the disgust written across his features.


Photos- dozens of them - showing me in various intimate poses with him. Except I'd never taken those photos. The girl in them wore my face, but the body language was all wrong.


My stomach churned as understanding dawned. Lucy put them.Of course. My dear sister's parting gift."These were found among your belongings." He tossed the photos at my feet, followed by what appeared to be love letters and... other items I couldn't bring myself to look at directly.His tall frame caged me against the storage shelves, that intoxicating scent of his filling my lungs again. Despite his obvious anger, the air between us crackled with something dangerous and electric.

"Tell me, were you so desperate to climb into my bed that you had to resort to such disgusting tactics?"

The venom in his voice stung, but it was the flash of betrayal in his eyes that truly hurt. Somehow, in the span of a morning.I'd managed to make him feel something beyond mere indifference - even if that something was hatred.

"Mr. Lancaster," I kept my voice steady through sheer force of will, trying to ignore how my body responded to his proximity,"I had no knowledge of these items before this moment."

I met his gaze directly, letting him see the truth in my eyes.For a moment, something shifted in his expression - doubt?Interest? - before the mask of cold disdain slammed back into place.

His laugh held no humor, but the sound still sent shivers down my spine. "Bringing another man's keepsakes to our marriage.Impressive, Miss Winston."The pieces clicked together in my still-recovering brain. Lucy hadn't just set me up to take her place - she'd made sure to poison the well completely. "Don't think that simply walking through those doors makes you secure in your position as Mrs. Lancaster." He leaned closer.one hand braced beside my head. "Many women would kill to be in your place."

I watched him leave, my hands clenched into fists, my heart racing from more than just anger. Lucy. I will make you pay.

In the doorway, Adam paused. "You know what your greatest flaw is, Miss Winston?" His eyes raked over me one last time,leaving trails of fire in their wake. "You're utterly uninteresting.11


The door closed behind him with a quiet click that somehow hurt more than if he'd slammed it.


Uninteresting, am I? A smile curved my lips despite everything.We'll see about that, Adam.
###Chapter 4

Stella's POV

The phone rang relentlessly, pulling me back to reality from my dreams.

I squinted at the incessantly buzzing phone and saw Sam's name flashing on the screen. Before I could even say"hello."her voice blasted through my foggy consciousness like a cannonball.


"Stella! Lucy sabotaged all those fashion design collaborations you were working on. They've hired other stylists instead."Sam's voice carried undisguised anger. "You need to handle this ASAP."


The news hit me like a bucket of ice water, instantly washing away any trace of sleepiness. Sitting up, I rubbed my eyes as my brain kicked into high gear.

"Got it. I'll look into it," I said, pushing my hair away from my face. "I'll contact them today."

"Still in bed?" Sam's tone suddenly turned suggestive.′′Was your night life too intense? How's married life treating you?" I rolled my eyes, grateful Sam couldn't see my expression through the phone. "You're imagining things." I spoke while getting out of bed, my throat feeling desert-dry.Slipping on my slippers, I decided to go downstairs for water.

"That bastard..."

The words died on my lips as I reached the staircase landing.my gaze falling on the figure in the living room. My heart skipped a beat.

Adam.

He wore a perfectly tailored designer suit, looking like he'd stepped straight off the cover of a high-fashion magazine. He glanced up briefly, his eyes cold as a frozen lake in winter.

Shit, did he hear me?

"Sam, something's come up. I'll call you back." I hastily ended the call,my mind racing to formulate an explanation for my words.


But Adam didn't even give me a chance to speak. After that single glance, he turned and walked out, the front door closing with a dull thud behind him. I exhaled in relief, figuring he probably hadn't heard what I said. Still, calling him a "bastard" might have been excessive.Considering our current marital arrangement, "stranger" might be more appropriate. Regardless, at least now I could get my water in peace.

Back in my room, I opened my laptop while sipping the water I'd retrieved from the kitchen, checking my work emails.

Seven fashion studios that had previously committed to working with me had all backed out in less than a wweek. Their emails were politely worded but utterly insincere, making excuses about "scheduling conflicts" or "sudden adjustments"forcing them to terminate our collaboration.

Do they think I'm an idiot? Someone's obviously interfered.

My phone pinged with a news notification. I glanced at it,"Lucy Winston Stuns in $800,000 Couture, Dominates Event!Solidifies Socialite Status!"


Clicking the link, my blood instantly froze-Lucy was wearing the limited-edition gown I had specially commissioned from my friend, Dior's head designer, three months ago! It was something I'd been saving for this year's fashion gala, with a completely unique design.

I stared at the photo, anger burning in my chest. What is this?Not only sabotaging my work, but wearing my clothes too? Thirty minutes later, I stood outside the Winston mansion,dressed and ready for confrontation. I rang the doorbell,but no one answered. I easily entered the security code, and the door opened immediately. Eighteen years of living habits are hard to break.

As soon as I entered, I heard movement from the dressing room upstairs. I quietly climbed the stairs and pushed open the half-closed door. The scene that greeted me made my anger explode.


Lucy was wearing another of my haute couture gowns-it had been custom-made for me just three months ago. She stood before the full-length mirror, admiring herself and taking photos.

"Taking without asking is called theft!" I said coldly.

Lucy jumped, startled. When she turned and saw me, her eyes first lit up, then filled with anger. "Stella,how did you get in?"


I walked into the dressing room, looking around. At least a dozen of my haute couture dresses hung there. These were pieces I'd carefully collected over the past few years, each worth a small fortune.

"My clothes. Take them off," I said directly.

Lucy lifted her chin defiantly. "Stella, watch your attitude! I'm the Winston daughter-who are you? Just some adopted trash!" She stepped closer, her voice filled with hatred.′′Ifyou hadn't stolen my life, I would have been the Winston heiress from birth. I would be New York's premier socialite! The fact that l haven't made you pay with your life for this theft shows how kind and merciful I am!"


Lucy pointed at the dresses hanging in the closet. "As for the clothes-what I'm wearing and what's hanging in the closet-they all belong to me! Don't even think about taking them!"

"Lucy, understand one thing," I said calmly. "From the day I married Adam, I no longer owed you anything." After a pause.I added, "So you won't take it off?"


I walked to the vanity, taking out a sharp pair of tailor's scissors. Under Lucy's horrified gaze, I approached the rack and began cutting through those expensive haute couture dresses.


"My dresses!" Lucy screamed, rushing toward me. "My limited edition... This is the head designer's work... Stella,stop it!Have you lost your mind?!"

My hands didn't pause for a moment as I continued turning one priceless dress after another into scraps of fabric. "Sorry,my hand slipped." Finally, I walked over to Lucy and violently tore the dress she was wearing. The exquisite fabric made a ripping sound as it tore. She stood frozen in shock, her face pale. I shrugged helplessly. "I told you to take it off, but you wouldn't listen." Lucy's eyes flashed with malice, her voice trembling. "Stella, is this how you thank me for my wedding gift? I specially prepared it for you and that cripple, considering Adam's...problem down there. Did you like it?"

She narrowed her eyes maliciously. "Or are you jealous that Adam is my boyfriend now?"

I forced a smile. "No, congratulations to you."

At the door, I turned back to add. "By the way,if you dare sabotage my career again, you'll see what happens!"

Congratulations on finding my garbage in the trash can!

A few days later, I was browsing through a high-end Manhattan mall, looking for ready-to-wear pieces that could replace my destroyed couture dresses.

Just as I was about to enter the Chanel boutique,I heard familiar laughter.

"Look! Isn't that Stella WVinston?"

"Oh wow, it really is! Her socialite status might be fake, but her beauty is real! That face!" An oily male voice chimed in,"Brian, honestly, I've dreamed about sleeping with her, but she was your fiancée then, so I didn't dare.But now...heh!" I wasn't surprised to hear Brian respond,"Sleep with her all you want! She's not my woman anymore, so why should I protect her?"

"Thanks,Brian!"

"After you're done with her, pass her to me? That woman looks like she'd be amazing!"

Hearing these words, I felt nauseated. This was the so-called "high society," discussing how to take turns "sleeping" with a woman right in front of her, as if she were an object to be passed around.

Fucking disgusting.

I took a deep breath, planning to ignore them and walk away.However, Brian had already blocked my path, his gaze shamelessly roaming over my body with revolting desire.

"Stella, you heard what they said. With just my approval, there are plenty of men who would treat you as their plaything.Your only choice is to beg me-"

SLAP! My palm connected solidly with his face, the sound echoing through the mall corridor. Everyone around us stopped, their attention focused on us. Brian held his cheek, staring at me in disbelief. "Stella, you dare slap me?"

"Brian," I said with a cold smile, "I didn't slap you to hurt you.just to help you wake up. Are all men in the world dead that I'd have to beg you? Who gave you such confidence?"

His face twisted with anger, but I didn't stop.

"Isn't my husband a thousand times better than you? Hmm?Dear nephew?"

"You-Stella, you've lost your mind!" Brian shouted. "He is crippled, he has problems... down there!"

My eyes narrowed as I suddenly realized this was a perfect opportunity to humiliate this arrogant jerk. Although my marriage to Adam was just a transaction, at this moment,I was willing to give everything for this performance.

"Brian, in my eyes, my husband is the best!" MIy voice carried clearly to those around us. "Besides, whether he can perform or not, wouldn't I, the one who's been naked in his bed, know better than anyone? Or has you also tried him out too?"

Brian's face turned purple with rage. "You're the one who-damn it!" He suddenly looked past me, his voice becoming respectful."Uncle, what are you doing here?" Uncle?
###Chapter 5

Stella's POV

I turned around, my heart nearly stopping.

Three meters away. Adam sat in his wheelchair, his assistant Taylor standing behind him. Those mesmerizing green eyes stared directly at me. his gaze cold enough to freeze me in place.

This is the second time Adam has heard me talking "nicely"about him behind his back.


I could almost hear fate laughing at my stupidity. The expression on his face seemed to say. "You really do have a death wish."

"Come here." His voice carried that silken danger.

I hesitated, thinking he was addressing Brian. But then those eyes locked onto mine with laser focus, and I realized with growing horror that he'd heard every word.


"Weren't you so eager to be in my bed?" His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. Those green eyes darkened as they traced over me, making my skin tingle. "Come here, Miss Winston. Don't make me ask a third timne." My cheeks burned as I forced myself to move forward,each step feeling like an eternity under the curious stares of mallpatrons. My fingers twisted nervously in the fabric of my dress as I approached his wheelchair. Without warning, his hand shot out to grasp my chin, forcing me to meet those piercing green eyes.

"Tell me, Mrs. Lancaster," his thumb brushed across my lower lip, the gesture somehow both threatening and sensual despite our public setting, "did you enjoy your little reunion with my nephew?"

I forced myself to meet his gaze steadily, though my pulse raced beneath his touch. "Mr. Lancaster,I-"

"Uncle," Brian's voice dripped with false concern; he apparently forgotten his earlier humiliation to Adam. His eyes raked over me with undisguised contempt before settling on his uncle."You can't seriously be keeping her as your wife?"

Adam's grip on my chin tightened fractionally. "And why is that?"


"Everyone knows she's just trash the Winstons picked up and She's the most boring woman I've ever dated. Like a dead fish in-"


The words died in Brian's throat as Adam finally turned to look at him. Whatever he saw in his uncle's expression made him take an involuntary step back.

*Just perfect to show up.* "Brian, darling!" Lucy's voice dripped honey-sweet venom as she emerged from a store in a white designer dress. She wrapped herself around Brian's arm like an expensive accessory. "Stella, aren't you ashamed? Coming to see your ex-fiancé when you're married now?"

"Oh my," she gasped with obviously fake surprise. "Adam, you're even more handsome than the photos! No wonder my dear sister was so... *eager* to marry you."

The accusation hung in the air like poison, drawing more spectators to our little drama. I could feel Adam's fingers tensing on my skin, his breath ghosting across my/ cheek as he waited for my response. My heart thundered against my ribs as I made a split-second decision.

*Forgive me, Mr. Lancaster.*

I turned my head and pressed a quick, soft kiss to his cheek.The contact lasted barely a second, but I felt him go absolutely still beneath my lips. His skin was warm, and that intoxicating cologne of his filled my lungs. "I∘m so sorry," I whispered, just loud enough for him to hear,my voice trembling with genuine nervousness. Then louder,to Brían. "Only my husband has the right to judge my performance." I managed a smile that I hoped looked more confident than I felt. "Though you seem to have me confused with Lucy. But then again, you were quite... *preoccupied*with her while we were still engaged." Lucy's face twisted with rage.′′YOu−′′

"Mrs. Lancaster." Adam's voice was deadly quiet, but it carried in the now-silent atrium. "Did I allow you to kiss me?"

My blood ran cold. But before I could stammer out another apology,he continued.

"Brian." The temperature in his voice could have frozen hell."Care to repeat what you were saying about my wife?"

Lucy's perfectly manicured nails dug into Brian's arm. "He didn't mean-"


"Whether I'm interesting or not," I cut in smoothly,′′isfor my husband to judge. Right, darling?"

The corner of Adam's mouth twitched. "Indeed." His thumb traced slow, deliberate circles on my neck, each movement sending sparks of electricity down my spine. His other hand settled possessively on my waist, drawing me closer until I could feel the heat radiating from his body.

"Though I must say, Mrs. Lancaster," his voice dropped to that velvet-wrapped-steel tone that made my knees weak, "you're proving more... *entertaining* by the minute. I wonder just how entertaining you can be in private."

Lucy's face twisted with barely concealed rage seeing this."Brian was just concerned. After all, given Stella's *history*_" "Want another slap?" I asked pleasantly, making Brian flinch.

"You dare-" Lucy started forward, but Adam's voice cut through the air like a whip.

"Brian," Each word fell like ice. "When your elders are disciplining you. you take it. Remember your place."


The gathered crowd's whispers grew louder,and I could practically see Lucy calculating how much damage control she d need to do.


Lucy's perfectly painted smile wavered for a fraction of a second before she recovered, pressing herself closer to Brian's side."Uncle Adam," her voice dripped with false sweetness. "I ve heard∗SO∗much about you! Though the photos really don't do you justice... especially the ones from Stella's *private items*.11


The mall was buzzing with tension. Adam's eyes flicked over Lucy,like he was sizing up a pesky bug. The look he gave me sent my heart racing-not the cold anger I expected, but a knowing disdain.
 
*Interesting. He really doesn't like her.* Adam's lips curved into a fake smile. "Have you?" His voice carried somewhat dangerous meaning. "How... fascinating."I fought to keep my expression neutral. but inside, my mind raced.

"My dear nephew." I cut in with sweet venom, "you really should keep better control of your...girlfriend. Given how easily she could jump from your uncle's bed to yours."

Brian's face flushed an interesting shade of purple. "You-"

"Mrs. Lancaster." Adam's hand found my waist, the touch sending electricity through my body despite the layers of designer fabric between us. "Shall we?"


Lucy's eyes narrowed at the casual intimacy of his gesture."But Uncle Adam," Lucy's voice turned sickly sweet, "we barely got to chat! And there's so much I'd love to tell you about your dear wife's... nocturnal activities. The videos are quite...educational."


′′Previous activities?" The corner of Adam's mouth twitched. "Like sleeping with engaged men? Oh wait..." His eyes flickered meaningfully between her and Brian. "That would be your area of expertise,wouldn't it?"

The gathered crowd's whispers grew louder. Lucy's face went from perfect porcelain to blotchy red in seconds. "I... that's not..
11

"Come, Mrs. Lancaster." Adam's grip on my waist tightened fractionally. "I believe we have more interesting matters to attend to."
As we moved toward the exit. I couldn't resist one parting shot."By the way, *dear nephew*, do remember to teach your girlfriend some basic manners."


The last thing I caught a glimpse of before we turned the corner was Brian's face twisted in helpless anger, and Lucy's perfect mask breaking to show the fury underneath.

*Just wait and see, Lucy,my dear sister.*
###Chapter 6

Others'POV

"Don't be angry. honey." Lucy's voice dripped honey-sweet venom as she traced Brian's jawline. The shopping mall's ambient noise provided perfect cover for their hushed conversation. but the tension between them was palpable.

"That useless cripple." Brian spat. his face twisted with hatred."And that bitch-"


"Shh." Lucy pressed a perfectly manicured finger to his lips. "Patience. darling. Let them go for now." Her eyes gleamed with calculated malice. "After all. what's a wheelchair-bound cripple going to do against the true heir of Lancaster Group?"


Brian's anger melted into a predatory smile as he pulled her closer. "You're right, baby." His eyes glittered with malice.′′Let the cripple play with his bride. Once I take over the company,"his lips crashed against hers in a deliberately vulgar display,′′I′Il make sure they both end up in a bad state."

Lucy giggled against his mouth, though her eyes remained cold and calculating. "That's my man. Show them all what a real Lancaster can do."




Stella's POV The privacy glass rose with a soft whir. and suddenly his car became our own dangerous little universe. His cologne- subtle.masculine, maddening - filled the space between us. I stared determinedly at the passing Manhattan skyline. but every breath drew me deeper into his gravity.


"I wasn't looking for Brian." The words tumbled out before I could stop them, my voice embarrassingly breathy.′′Ijust needed-"


Why I should explain to him? It seems I truly betray him.

"To buy a dress?" His voice held that dangerous amusement that made my heart race. "Or to put on a show about our...marital activities?" The way he drew out those last two words sent a shiver down my spine.

Heat crept up my neck as I remembered my earlier performance.the way his skin had felt under my lips. "That wasn't-I didn'
t mean to kiss you." Liar, a voice in my head whispered. "No?" He caught my chin, the contact sending sparks of electricity through my body. Those piercing green eyes captured mine, which made my breath catch. "Then what exactly did you mean. Mrs. Lancaster?" His thumb brushed my bottom lip. the touch feather-light but somehow burning. My breath hitched at his proximity. That cologne of his seemed stronger now, mixing with the natural heat of his skin to create something dizzyingly intoxicating. Every breath filled my lungs with his scent. making it impossible to think straight.′′Iwas just trying to-"


"To what?" His thumb traced my lip again, more deliberately this time, the gesture sending liquid fire down my spine.′′′TO prove our relationship to that bastard?" His other hand found my waist, fingers splaying possessively against my hip.

The mention of that bastard seemed to make the heat between us only intensified. I watched the muscle in Adam's jaw tick dangerously. The look in his eyes reminded me of a predator calculating the most efficient way to destroy its prey.

"I didn't-"I started, then gasped as his grip tightened fractionally, the pressure just shy of painful but sending thrills of something decidedly not unpleasant through my body.

My God.why he is so strong?

"You didn't what?" His voice dropped to that dangerous whisper that made my knees weak and my heart race. The hand on my waist slid up slightly, thumb brushing the sensitive skin just above my hip. "Consider the consequences of your little kiss." Before I could response, he closed the remaining distance between us. His lips covered mine with force, nothing like the chaste peck I'd given him earlier. This kiss held possession and punishment.that made my head spin and my body melt. His tongue traced the seam of my lips, demanding entrance that l was helpless to refuse.


A small moan escaped my throat as his teeth grazed my lower lip.The hand on my waist pulled me closer while the other tangled in my hair, tilting my head to deepen the kiss. My hands found their way to his chest of their own accord,feeling the rapid beat of his heart through the expensive fabric.

I need to confess. I can't refuse his touch. And quite enjoy.

Just as suddenly as it began, he pulled back. though his hands remained possessively on my body.′′Driver," his voice was perfectly steady despite his racing heart and the slight tremor I could feel in his fingers. "Stop the car."

The car glided to a smooth halt. Those green eyes studied me for a long moment, something dark and hungry flickering in their depths. His thumb brushed my now-swollen lip one last time, and I had to bite back another embarrassing sound.

"Get out."

I blinked, still dazed from the kiss and the lingering heat of his touch.""What?"


"Get. Out." Each word fell like ice, though his eyes still burned in anger."Now." The door opened automatically, letting in a blast of afternoon air that did nothing to cool my burning skin or calm my racing heart.


As I stepped onto the sidewalk on shaky legs.I saw something in his eyes like regret - or was it desire?


What the hell just happened?

One moment he was interrogating me about Brian, the next...God. the way he'd kissed me. Like he was claiming territory.Like he was punishing me. Like he couldn't help himself.

And then he'd thrown me out of the car.

"Bastard," I muttered. earning strange looks from passing pedestrians. The late afternoon sun beat down on the designer boutiques lining the street. their windows reflecting my disheveled appearance.


My carefully styled hair was slightly mussed - courtesy of his fingers tangling in it during that kiss. My lips were still swollen.

It was just a kiss that probably meant nothing to him.

My phone buzzed with an incoming call. Is that bastard's calling?
###Chapter 7

Stella's POV

For a wild moment. I thought it might be him. But no- the screen displayed "Anna Winston" with its usual cold formality.

Perfect timing, "Mother."

I took a deep breath, forcing my voice into perfect social-butterfly sweetness."Hello?"

"Stella." Her voice dripped with venom. "How dare you humiliate my Lucy in public?"


Ah. News travels fast in our circles. "I wasn't aware telling the truth counted as humiliation these days."

"You ungrateful little-" She took an audible"Truth?" She barked out a harsh laugh.′′The truth is that you're nothing but a trash. We gave you everything - education, status,opportunities- and this is how you repay us? By stealing Lu1cy's fiancé and then slandering her in public?"The familiar pain bloomed in my chest, but I refused to let it show in my voice."First, I didn't steal anyone. Lucy made sure of that when she jumped into Brian's bed while we were still engaged. Second," I continued, " I'm Mrs. Lancaster now." Breath."Well, Mrs. Lancaster, do you know how's your dear grandmother doing in that nursing home? It would be such a shame if something happened to her care arrangements..."

Ice settled in my stomach. "Leave her out of our issues."

"Then apologize to Lucy. Publicly. Admit you lied about her and Brian."


"No." My fingers curled into fists, nails biting into my palms. "Twenty years of your 'generosity' were repaid the moment I married Adam. Your threats have no power anymore."


"What?" Her laugh turned ugly. "That old woman means nothing to me. If she suffers because her fake granddaughter couldn't keep her mouth shut... well, that's hardly my concern.is it?"


The line went dead before I could respond. I stared at the phone, my hand shaking with suppressed rage.

Deep breaths, Stella. Don't let them see you crack.

A text from Sam popped up: "Stella, what happened? The society blogs are buzzing about some drama at the mall!" I ignored it, already pulling up the ride-sharing app. I had somewhere more important to be.Brooklyn Nursing Home looked exactlyas depressing as it had last week. The walls were an institutional shade of beige scemed universal to all budget care facilities.

"Grandma?" I knocked softly on her door, my heart clenching at how small she looked in that narrow bed.


Her face lit up when she saw me. "Stella! What a lovely surprise." She patted the bed beside her with one frail hand."Come. tell me how your husband treating you."

I perched carefully on the edge of the bed, taking in the new lines around her eyes. the way her hospital gown hung looser than before. I need to get her out of here.


"He is...good." I forced a smile. not wanting to worry her."The Lancaster mansion is beautiful. Very grand."

"Stella."Her hand found mine. still steady despite her age.′′Tve known you since you were five years old. What's wrong?"


"Nothing!" I said too quickly. At her knowing look, I sighed. "It's complicated, Grandma. The marriage... it wasn't exactly a love match."


"Few marriages in our circles are, dear." She squeezed my hand gently. "Your grandfather and I barely knew each other when we married. But we grew to love each other deeply."

"That's different." I bit my lip. "Adam... he doesn't even want me there. Today he-"I cut myself off, not wanting to worry her with details of our comnplicated relationship.

"He kissed you."

Heat flooded my cheeks. "How did you...?"

She chuckled. "Your lips are still a bit swollen, dear. And you've touched them three times since you sat down."

"Oh God." I buried my face in my hands,mortified.

"Was it a good kiss?" The mischief in her voice made her sound decades younger.

"Grandma!"

"Well?"

"It was..." Devastating. Completely confusing. "Unexpected."

"The best ones usually are." Her smile turned wistful. "Your grandfather surprised me with our first kiss too. Right in the middle of an argument about another man."

"Grandma, please let me move you to a better facility. St. John's has an excellent geriatric wing, and-" "No." Her voice was firm despite its weakness. "I'm fine here." "But-" "Stella." She fixed me with that look that had stopped my childhood tantrums in their tracks. "I won't have you spending your money on me. Save it for my great-grandchildren instead."


I choked on air. "Grandma! We're nowhere near-I mean,Adam and I aren't-"


Her laugh was worth all the embarrassment. "Not yet, perhaps.But I've seen how you blush when you talk about him." She patted my hand again. "Just promise me one thing?"

"Anything."

"When you do have children, bring them to visit me. I'd love to hold your baby before I go."


My throat tightened. "Don't talk like that. You're not going anywhere."


"Everyone goes somewhere eventually, dear." Her smile was gentle. "But I'd like to stick around long enough to see you happy. Really happy, not just playing the perfect society wife."

I had to swallow hard before I could speak. "I promise."




The neon sign of Rouge cast a red glow over the upscale Manhattan street. I pulled my baseball cap down over my eyes as I walked up to the VIP entrance; the last thing I wanted was to be recognized after the drama at the mall today.
###Chapter 8

Stella's POV

The bass thrummed through my bones as I made my way to the hidden back entrance of the VIP area. Sam was already waiting in our private booth. a bottle of ridiculously expensive champagne chilling beside her.

"Spill!" She practically bounced in her seat. "Congratulations on your marriage." The way she said the word dripped with sarcasm.


I slid into the booth,gratefully accepting the glass she pushed my way."Please, let's not discuss that bastard tonight."

"Then what happened at the mall? The gossip sites are going crazy!"


"I met Lucy. And Brian. And..." I touched my lips again without thinking.

Sam's eyes narrowed. "What was that?"

"What was what?" "You lips. Did something happen with-"Her eyes went wide."Oh my God. Did he kiss you?" The champagne suddenly became fascinating. "Maybe?" "Details! Now!"

"It wasn't... I mean, he was angry about the mall incident, and then suddenly he just..." I took a large sip of champagne. "Then he kicked me out of the car."


"He what?" Sam's perfectly sculpted eyebrows shot up. ′′Wait,start from the beginning. What mall incident?"

I was starting explaining

Sam's expression softened then she changed a topic.′′Bythe way,still no leads on your real parents?"

The question hit a raw nerve, as it always did. "Eight years of searching." I said quietly. "The DNA test that proved I wasn't a Winston was just the beginning. I've hired private investigators,enen bribed hospital staff." A bitter laugh escaped me. "All I know is that I'm definitely not their daughter, and someone hid where I really came from."

"And the Winstons never suspected?"

"Oh, they knew." I forced myself to relax. "Why do you think they were so eager to marry me off to a 'cripple'?" Sam's hand covered mine. "Hey, their loss is my gain. Without their idiocy, I'd never have gained such an amazing business partner." She gestured around us at the opulent VIP room."Look what we've built together! Last month's revenue was up 4 0% from last year."

I pulled out my tablet, bringing up the latest financial reports,"the new offshore account Structure is working perfectly."


A notification popped up on my screen: Lab Report-Experiment 247 - FAILURE

"Damn." I quickly closed the notification, but Sam had already seen it.


"Still no breakthrough?" Her voice was gentle.

I shook my head, pushing away memories of endless nights in the lab, failed test after failed test. "The cellular regeneration rate is still too unstable. I need to recalibrate the entire parameter set..."

"Stop please, I can't understand." Sam's mock confusion made me smile despite my frustration.

"Sorry." I rubbed my temples, feeling the familiar tension headache building.Sam studied me for a long moment. "You know, most people would be satisfied with being a successful nightclub owner and society darling. But no, you had to add groundbreaking medical researcher' to your resume." "What can I say? I'm an overachiever." The attempt at humor fell flat even to my own ears.

"Stella." Sam's voice turned serious. "You don't have to prove anything to them. The Winstons, the Lancasters- they don't define who you are."


Before I could respond, a commotion erupted from the hallway.The VIP floor manager's voice carried through the door.uncharacteristically flustered."Sir,r, you can't enter this area-"

"Is it?" The tone was unmistakable. "I wasn't aware any part of New York was restricted to me."


Shit.

Sam's eyes widened. "Is that-"

"My dear husband? Yes." I smoothed my expression into careful neutrality just as the door swung open.

Adam filled the doorway in his wheelchair. Those green eyes landing on me. The corner of his mouth curved into a dangerous smile.


"Mrs. Lancaster." The way he said my title made me shiver -and not entirely unpleasant ones."What a... coincidence."

"Mr. Lancaster." I matched his tone,cool.′′Iwasn't aware you frequented nightclubs."

His eyes flickered to Sam, then back to me. The intensity of his
gaze made my skin tingle. Stop looking at me like that. I can't think when you look at me like that. "I just come usually."

He took a step closer. and I fought the urge to retreat. "But when I see my wife sneaking into here..." Another move."Let's just say my curiosity was piqued."


Sam rose smoothly, her posture relaxed but ready to leave. "Samantha Torres," she introduced herself with a predatory smile of her own. "Stella's friend. We are just have a drink here.11


"Oh?" Adam's eyebrow arched.

My heart skipped a beat. Had he heard something?

"Come here." His voice dropped to that dangerous whisper that seemed to bypass my brain and go straight to my nervous system.


I hesitated, glancing at Sam. She gave me a subtle nod and she squeezed my shoulder as she passed. "Call if you need anything,honey." The dloor closed behind her with a soft click that seemed to echo in the sudden silence. Adam's presence seemed to fill the room, making it hard to breathe normally. "Well?" He was close enough now that I could smell that maddening cologne of his. "No warm welcome for your husband?"

I forced myself to meet his gaze steadily. "I wasn't aware we were at the warm welcome stage of our arrangement."


"Arrangement?" His laugh held no humor. "Is that what you call it?" His hand shot out, faster than I could dodge, gripping my chin. "Tell me. Mrs. Lancaster, what other secretes are you hiding?"


The heat of his touch sent sparks of electricity through my body,making it hard to think straight. "I'm not hiding anything."

"No?"His thumb traced my bottom lip, the gesture somehow both threatening and sensual. "Then why you come here?”

I am the owner. But I couldn't say that. "Just have fun."

"Try again." His other hand found my waist, drawing me closer until I could feel the heat radiating from his body."The truth this time."

My pulse raced beneath his touch. "Why do you care? I thought I was 'utterly uninteresting'?" Something dark and hungry flashed in those green eyes. "You're quite interesting than I thought, Mrs. Lancaster." His grip tightened fractionally. I was afraid that he would discover my secrete if we continue this talking.


"I have to go." I tried to step back, but his grip remained firm.


"Running away?" His voice carried a somewhat charm. Our gazes met.
###Chapter 9

Stella's POV

Even in this position. he exuded an aura of controlled power that made my pulse quicken. Stop it. He's the one who basically threw you out of the car after that kiss.


"Adam!" A familiar voice cut through my thoughts. "Been waiting for you!"


I froze. Mark Anderson. Hollywood's golden boy and CEO of Anderson Media Group. Interesting. The great Mr. Anderson actually showing respect to someone.

His smile dimmed when his gaze landed on me. "Well. well. If it isn't Miss Winston." The way he drawled my name dripped with barely concealed disdain. "Heard you went into hiding after Brian called off the engagement. Found yourself a new...patron'already?"

Heat crept up my neck. Deep breaths. Don't let them see they've hit a nerve. "Mr. Anderson, you're mistaken." "She's just tonight's companion." Adam's voice carried a dangerous meaning. The casual explanation stung more than Mark's obvious contempt. "Nothing more." Of course. What else did you expect. Stella? He is just a bastard. Taylor cleared his throat softly. "Mr. Anderson, Mrs. Lancaster is the Boss's legal wife."


The silence that followed was absolute. Mark's practiced charm cracked. genuine shock bleeding through as his head whipped between Adam and me. "What? You... when did you...?"


"A few days ago." Adam's tone could have frozen hell. "Just a business arrangement."


I fought to keep my expression serene as the words hit like physical blows. Just a business arrangement. Of course. But something in my chest still twisted painfully.

Mark's eyes narrowed thoughtfully. "Adam, you never mentioned-"


"Shall we?" Adam cut him off. gesturing toward the entrance.The finality in his tone made it clear the topic was closed.


I moved to push his wheelchair, only to have him catch my wrist. His grip was gentle but immovable, thumb pressed against my pulse point in a way that felt deliberately intimate.

"Mrs. Winston." His voice dropped to that dangerous whisper that always made my heart race."Itrust you'll... have fun tonight."

The implication hung in the air between us. I met his gaze steadily, refusing to back down. "Of course, darling. Whatever you need."

Something dark flickered in those green eyes before he released me. Mark watched our exchange with poorly concealed fascination.


The VIP elevator ride felt endless. I could feel Mark's calculating gaze bouncing between us. Judge all you want.

When the doors opened, the whispers started immediately at the Rouge's VIP room.

"Lancaster's here!" Then, inevitably, "Wait, isn't that the gold-digger who got dumped by his nephew?"

"Oh my God. she actually showed her face here?"

"How desperate do you have to be to go from the nephew to the crippled uncle?"

Smile. Stella. Let them talk. The thought of their faces if they knew Rouge's true owner almost made the humiliation worth it.Almost.


I recognized most of them - Wall Street sharks and trust fund babies who'd once smiled at my society events. James Morgan, the famous conductor, raised a perfectly groomed eyebrow. "Adam, darling, slumming it tonight?" His cultured voice carried just far enough to make several people titter. "Though I suppose even you must get bored of the usual quality of company."

"The entertainment industry's standards really have dropped."a socialite stage-whispered. "First she fails to keep Brian interested.now she's working as an... lover?"

If they only knew how much of their dirty money passes through my accounts. But the barbs still landed, each one precisely aimed at my old wounds.


"Mr. Lancaster." I kept my voice low, fighting to maintain my composure, "ifthere's nothing else, I'd like to leave."

"Sit." The command held no room for argument. His hand found my wrist, the touch deceptively gentle but impossible to break. Damn him.


"Everyone, what would you like Miss. Winston to play with you?" The emphasis on my name made several people laugh outright. Damn Adam. I'm your wife, even if you are not willing to admit it.

"Mr. Lancaster." I tried to keep my voice low to whisper in his ear. "I am your wife." The corner of his mouth twitched. "Are you?" His hand found my knee under the table, the touch sending electricity through my body despite my anger. "My my. look who we have here!" James Morgan's voice dripped with fake surprise. "Miss. Winston. You've certainly...changed since schoo1."


I kept my face perfectly blank. "James. Still conducting. I see.Though word is your lastshow was a bit... off-key?"

His perfect eyebrow twitched.

"At least I earned my spot," he sneered. "Unlike some people who sleep their way through the Lancaster family tree."


More laughter. Someone made a comment about my "going rate" that made my cheeks burn. Remember who you are,Stella. Remember what you've survived. These people? They're nothing.

"How thoughtful of you to bring entertainment, Adam,"a hedge fund manager called out. "Will she be performing for us later?"


I felt rather than saw Adam's minute tension, his fingers tightening fractionally around my wrist. Interesting. So you don't like them insulting your"companion" after all. Mr.Lancaster?


"Her duties are not your concern," he said, his voice arctic. But the lack of denial only seemed to encourage them.

"At least Brian had the sense to dump her before the wedding," a woman in Chanel observed loudly. "Can you imagine someone like her in the Lancaster family?"

"Careful" her friend giggled. "She might try to trap you next.
Adam. She does seem to have a thing for Lancasters."

If they only knew how hard I tried to avoid them. The irony almost made me laugh. Almost.


"Speaking of Brian." James Morgan smiled like a shark scenting blood. "I heard the most fascinating rumors about why he really called off the engagement. Something about compromising photos with the gardener? Or was it the chauffeur?"


"Mr. Morgan." I finally spoke, my voice carrying just enough edge to turn heads. "I find it fascinating that you like talk nonsense. It seemed you really care about my affairs."

The room went deadly quiet. James' face flushed an shade of red. But it was Adam's reaction that interested me most-that slight twitch at the corner of his mouth. Well. Do you actually enjoy watching me bite back, Mr. Lancaster?
###Chapter 10

Stella's POV

The air in Rouge's VIP room crackled with tension. Adam's fingers still circled my wrist like a band of fire.


"You indeed have a sharp-tone. Miss Winston." His voice dropped dangerously low, thumb pressing against my pulse point. The pad of his thumb pressed deliberately against my pulse point. and I knew he could feel my heartbeat betraying my composed exterior.

I met his gaze head-on. "Thanks. I just said the truth. I can't let him slander me as your 'companion' tonight."


His eyes flashed, but before he could bite back, someone else decided to join our little drama.


James waved at a waiter. "Bring us some dice and vodka. Let's see how our social climber entertains herself."


"How original," I drawled. "What's next, spin the bottle?"

"The usual stakes," he recovered smoothly. "Loser drinks." "Scared, Stella?" His smile was fake. More snickers from our audience. Scared? Oh honey, you have no idea what I can do.
"You know what?" I smiled sweetly. I felt Adam's warning squeeze on my wrist but plowed ahead anyway."Loser removes an article of clothing. Unless you're scared...?"

The crowd collectively gasped. That got their attention.

"Miss, Winston." Adam's warning tone just made me want to push harder.

I turned to him with wide-eyed innocence.′′What's wrong,honey? Isn't this what a good companion does - entertain your friends?"


James laughed out loud. "Well! Stella, are you sure you want to play such a... dangerous game?"

"Aww, is the big bad conductor afraid of me?" I batted my eyelashes innocently. "Don't worry, I'll try not to humiliate you too badly."


I was totally going to humiliate him.

The dice arrived on a silver tray. Time to show these snobs my ability.

"Ladies first," James pushed the dice toward me. "Try to keep up with the rules, sweetheart." I picked up the dice, letting them dance between my fingers.Ten years of practice in sketchy bars about to pay off. "Big or small,James?"

"Small." He practically oozed confidence.′′Do try to understand -that means less than seven, dear."


I let the dice roll. "Eleven. That's big." I batted my eyes at him."Your jacket looks expensive. Shame to lose it so soon."


Ten rounds later. James sat in his silk boxers, face redder than a summer tomato. I hadn't lost once.


"You're cheating!" he sputtered as the dice betrayed him again."No one's this lucky."

"Oh?" I did my favorite trick, walking the dice across my knuckles. "Lucky? Oh sweetie, this is pure skill."

"You... you're a professional?" He made it sound like the dirtiest word possible.

"Guess." I stood. enjoying how he flinched. "Though I should thank you for making my evening so... entertaining. It's not every day I get to see a young man in his underwear. But,it looks so small." Though honestly, he should hit the gym more if he's going to be this cocky. "You little-""Careful now." I cut him off with a sugar-sweet smile."Though I must say, for someone who loves looking down his nose at others. you deserve this."

"Mr. Lancaster?" I kept my voice soft, deliberately vulnerable."Should I continue... playing? He is just left an underwear." The slight pause before the last word drew several sharp intakes of breath from our audience. "I'll do whatever you1 want."


James nearly choked on his drink. He glanced between Adam and me, clearly scandalized by my suggestive tone. That's right,darling. Let them think what they want.


Adam's expression remained unreadable, but something dangerous flickered in those green eyes. Without breaking our gaze,he reached for his jacket and tossed it to James."Put it on."

The crowd's giggles turned nasty to James. "I... I should go."James gathered his clothes and what was left of his dignity,about to leave.


"Well, darling?" I let my voice carry sweetness.

His grip tightened. "You even want to continue?" "Aw, what's wrong?" I traced my vodka glass with one finger."Don't tell me you're scared?"The look he gave me promised trouble later, but honestly?Worth it. I announced to the room, eyes locked on Adam, "So... who's brave enough for round two?"


Dead silence. Even Mark Anderson looked like he was reconsidering some life choices.

"No one?" I stood up, smoothing my dress."Pity. I was just warming up."

The other guests scattered like roaches in sunlight, leaving me alone with Adam. The silence stretched between us, charged with something that definitely wasn't just anger anymore.

Seeing James at the door, I couldn't resist one last shot."Oh,James?" I called out.′′Maybe stick to conducting - you're better at waving your hands around than... other activities."

The relief on James' face was almost comical.

"That was quite a show." His voice held that dangerous amusement that always did funny things to my pulse."Where exactly did a society princess learn to play dice like that?"

"A lady never tells." I met his gaze steadily. "Though I do hope you enjoyed the entertainment, darling." His mouth twitched. "Entertaining indeed." His thumb traced slow circles on my wrist."Though I can't help but wonder what other surprises you're hiding." I pulled my hand free, "You'll never find out."Checkmate, Mr.Lancaster.


I rose smoothly, ready to leave. "If there is nothing more-"

His hand shot out, catching my wrist in an iron grip that sent electricity racing up my arm. "Going somewhere?"
###Chapter 11

Stella's POV

"I thought..." I gestured vaguely with my free hand to signal I want leave.


"You thought wrong." He pulled me closer, until I could smell that maddening cologne of his."Sit."

I sank back into my seat. What are you playing at, Mr.Lancaster?


"Tell me. Mrs. Lancaster." His voice dropped to that dangerous whisper that seemed go straight to my nervous system."Exactly how eager are you to please me?"


Heat crept up my neck. "Mr. Lancaster, I do whatever you ask.Aren't I being obedient enough?" I let a hint of breathiness enter my voice. "You're such a demanding husband."

His grip tightened fractionally. "Tonight," he murmured, just loud enough for our audience to hear, "you'll have a chance to prove that eagerness. Didn't you want to be in my bed?" My face flamed. Oh, no,I don't want. It was my first time to have sex. I could feel his gaze returning to me periodically, each glance leaving trails of fire on my skin. The car's interior somehow felt smaller than usual, the space between us charged with dangerous electricity. The scent of expensive wine hung heavy in the air, making my stomach turn slightly. I pressed myself against the door, trying to put as much distance as possible between us.

"Mr. Lancaster." My voice sounded steadier than I felt.′′Ifyou hate me,why did you agree to this marriage?"


He didn't open his eyes, his head tipped back against the leather seat as if meditating. The streetlights painted shifting patterns across his proud features, highlighting the sharp line of his jaw and the slight tension in his shoulders.

My phone buzzed with a message from Sam: "Stella, you okay?Also... does his 'disability' affect, you know... everything?"

I snuck a glance at Adam, but his expression remained impassive. "Better than expected," I typed back carefully."Though I don't totally get to know him. He moves... differently than I expected."

"Oh? Do tell me! Anything... interesting to share with me?" Heat crept up my neck as I remembered that devastating kiss in the car. "Sam! Not like that!""Sure, sure. But I do want to know - does the height thing apply? You know... proportionally?"

I glance at his lower body for just one second, then my cheeks flushed. It seemed his cock was quite big. Damn man.

I couldn't help but giggle, then immediately tried to cover it with a cough when Adam's eyes opened.

Damn it. How sharp are his eyes?I angled the screen away quickly,but not before catching Adam's slight smirk.

"Something amusing?" His voice held that dangerous edge that made my pulse jump.

′′Iheard," I ventured, desperate to break the tension, "that men's height correlates with certain... other length of the body?"The words tumbled out before my brain could stop them.

Before I could react, he moved with that deadly grace of his,closing the distance between us in an instant. His cologne wrapped around me like a physical touch, making my head spin. One broad hand gripped my chin, forcing me to meet his gaze. "Curious about someone specific?" His voice dropped to that dangerous whisper that always made my pulse race. "Brian,perhaps?" "Brian's body is... bad,maybe." I fought to keep my expression neutral. "And I don't know his." The muscle in his jaw ticked. His thumb traced my bottom lip.the touch sending sparks of electricity down my spine. For a heart-stopping moment. I thought he might kiss me again. His eyes certainly lingered on my lips long enough to make my breath catch.


"Bad?" The word rumbled through his chest, and I suddenly realized just how close we were. "It seems he didn't satisfy you?11


"Mr. Lancaster-" I started, but the rest of my words died as his other hand found my waist, pulling me even closer.

"Tell me, Mrs. Lancaster," his breath ghosted across my lips,"just how much my body is you planning to... investigate?"

The innuendo in his tone made my cheeks burn."Iwasn't-"

His lips crashed into mine with bruising force, cutting off my protest. Unlike our previous kiss, this one held pure possession and barely contained anger. His hand tangled in my hair,tilting my head to deepen the kiss as his other hand maintained its possessive grip on my waist. A small, embarrassing sound escaped my throat as his teeth grazed my bottom lip. The taste of expensive wine lingered on his tongue, but somehow I didn't mind the alcohol so much anymore.Just as suddenly as it began, he pulled back, though his hands remained exactly where they were. The look in his eyes made my heart race.


"Interesting reaction." His thumb brushed my now-swollen lip.drawing another embarrassing little gasp from me.


\---


The car pulled up to Lancaster Manor's imposing gates.I moved to exit quickly as to escape,but Adam remained seated.

"Taylor." His voice cut through the night air. "What do you make of Mrs. Lancaster's performance tonight?"


"Sir?" Taylor's professional mask slipped slightly, revealing genuine uncertainty.


"Her presence at Rouge. Her little show with the dice." Adam's eyes remained fixed on the manor ahead."Quite coincidental,wouldn't you say?"

Ice settled in my stomach. He suspects something.

"I want everything on her connection to Rouge." The command held no room for argument. "Every visit, every interaction.Understood?" "Yes,sir." I had slipped out of the car before he could turn that penetrating gaze on me again. But I could feel his eyes following me all the way to the door.

Let him look, I thought with grim satisfaction. He'll never guess the truth.


Behind me. Adam watched my retreat with narrowed eyes."Interesting." he murmured, almost to himself.


A predatory smile curved his lips. "Let's see how long she can keep up the act."
###Chapter 12

Adam's POV

I was going through the quarterly reports when Joseph knocked on my study door.

"Come in." I kept my eyes on the laptop screen.

"Sir, Mrs. Lancaster's new dress just arrived at the gate. Should I have it sent to her room?"


Her new dress. Doesn't she have clothes? I pushed away thoughts of how she might look in it. "Handle it however you want."


"Yes, sir." Joseph cleared his throat. "Can I say something..."

That made me look up. Joseph never hesitated."What?"

"The staff... we're not quite sure how to treat Mrs. Lancaster."He shifted slightly. "With no lady of the house for so long,and now with your... unclear position on her..."

"Unclear?" I stopped typing. What the hell does that mean? "Well, sir... You kicked her out on your wedding night. Got rid of her things." Joseph kept his tone respectful but firm.′′And Taylor mentioned you throw her out of the car the other day.The staff's wondering about her status here." "Taylor said what?" I shot an icy look at Taylor.

Taylor stiffened by the door. "Just part of my daily report,sir."

"Right." My voice could have frozen fire. "So now my staff gossips about my marriage?"

"They just need an order, sir," Joseph pressed on. " Well,before this wasn't an issue because..."


"Because there wasn't one." My jaw clenched at old memories."And?"


"And now I saw Mrs. Lancaster takes taxis to go out these days." Joseph's disapproval was clear. "It doesn't look good for your reputation."

I drummed my fingers on the desk, fighting down an unexpected surge of irritation. It seemed I treat her so bad.

"Sir?" Taylor spoke up. "Should I arrange a car for Mrs.Lancaster tonight?"

"No." The word came out sharper than I meant it to. The thought of her climbing into a taxi made something dark twist in my chest. "I'll take care of it."Time to remind my wife of her place. And maybe...remind myself too. "Will there be anything else, sir?"

I glanced at Joseph. "What specifically are you suggesting?"

"Perhaps..." He chose his words carefully. "Mrs. Lancaster might need her own space in the manor. A dressing room,private study, the usual arrangements for a lady of the house."
U
I leaned back. "You think she's staying that long?"

"Aren't you married,sir?"

Marriage. What a joke. "Fine. Set up whatever's appropriate for Mrs. Lancaster."


Joseph nodded and left, but not before I caught his slight smile.


Stella's POV

"Mrs. Lancaster, the car is ready."

I glanced up from my phone to find Joseph hovering in my doorway. "Car? I didn't order one."


"Mr. Lancaster's instructions." His expression gave nothing away. "He was quite... insistent."

Of course he was. I checked my reflection one last time. The black dress fit me perfectly, though something felt missing. No time to worry about that now. I headed downstairs, my heart doing an annoying little skip when I spotted Adam waiting in the foyer. Damn him for looking so good. The tailored suit emphasized his broad shoulders and that commanding presence that always seemed to fill any room he was in.

His eyes traveled slowly up my body, the intensity of his gaze leaving trails of heat on my skin. I fought the urge to fidget under his scrutiny. Why is he looking at me like that?

"Going somewhere?" His voice held that dangerous edge.

"Just a party." I kept my tone light, though my pulse was anything but steady.′′Don't worry.I'll graba-"

"Get in the car."

"Really, it's fine. I can-" Stop staring at his lips, Stella.Remember how that ended last time?


"Stella." The way he said my name, low and commanding.made heat pool in my stomach. "Don't make me repeat myself."

I lifted my chin, trying to ignore how his presence seemed to make the foyer smaller. "Since when do you care how I go out?11 "Since my staff started gossiping about taxis." His eyes darkened as they dropped to my lips for a fraction of a second."It seems I've been... negligent in my duties as a husband." "Negligent?”I couldn't help the sarcasm, "You mean like throwing me out of the car the other day?"

A muscle ticked in his jaw. "Get. In. The. Car."

Something in his tone made it clear this wasn't up for debate.Fine. Let him play the controlling husband if he wants. Just stop looking at me in a hot... I cut that thought off quickly.

As I passed him, his hand shot out to catch my wrist. The contact sent sparks of electricity racing up my arm, and I had to bite back a gasp.

"You're missing something." His voice dropped to that dangerous whisper that always made my knees weak.

I glanced down at my outfit."What?"

"Joseph." Adam's voice carried that tone that made everyone jump to attention. "Set up Mrs. Lancaster's dressing room.Full appointments -jewelry, accessories, everything she needs."

My head snapped up. "That's not-"

"Necessary?" His eyes held mine.′′Oyou'd prefer to keep playing the neglected wife?" "Okay,do whatever you want." I pulled my hand free."Good." His smile held a dangerous edge. Oh, my God, so strange of him today. The Met Gala was exactly as pretentious as I expected. I'd barely made it past the photographers when I heard the whispers start.

"Oh my God, that's her - the adopted daughter who-"

"I heard she trapped Lancaster's nephew first, but he-"

"Poor Lucy,having to deal with such a-"

Deep breaths, Stella. They're not worth it.

"Stella!" Lucy's voice dripped fake sweetness. She stood with her usual crowd of socialite followers. "How... unexpected to see you here."

One of her friends - Chelsea? Chloe? - gave me a look of exaggerated pity. "Lucy, isn't this the one who stole twenty years of your happy life?"

"Now, now." Lucy's smile could rot teeth. "She is just daddy's...charity project."


I kept my face perfectly pleasant. "Sweet of you to meet you,sis. Your necklace looks great." Lucy's hand went to her neck, drawing attention to her necklace. "Like it?" She preened. "The latest one. Mother had it specially made. It's completely unique."

"Oh my God, Lucy!" A voice practically squealed.It absolutely divine on you!"


"Trust the Winstons to put you at the core," another socialite gushed. "I heard the waitlist for the unique design is practically impossible to get on."


"Lucy, darling. you are the most pretty one tonight," a redhead simpered.


Just as Lucy was immersed in their flatters, a different voice chimed in.


"Oh my God, wait." Some socialite grabbed her friend's arm,pointing at Lucy. "That necklace she's wearing - look at the signature mark!"

Lucy's hand flew to her neck. "What are you talking about?"

"Right here,see?" The woman peered closer.′′Those tiny letters...SW and ST? Stella Winston and Samantha Torres?"
###Chapter 13

Stella's POV

I saw Lucy's face went from porcelain perfect to ghost white in about two seconds flat.


What she wore was my necklace - or more accurately, the one I'd designed for Sam's birthday.

I raised my glass in her direction, enjoying how her hands shook as she practically ripped off the necklace.

"You..." Lucy looked like she was about to have an aneurysm as she stuffed the necklace into her clutch.


"Something wrong with your necklace, dear?" I kept my voice sweet. "It looked so lovely on you."

Her glare could've melted steel, but we both knew she couldn't make a scene now.


\---

"Well, look who showed up." Mark's voice dripped with his usual smugness. He was leaning against a column,phone in hand.


I ignored him and sipped my champagne. Let him watch.

His fingers flew across his phone screen. Of course he's texting Adam. I hid my smile behind my glass.

\---

"Your work is incredible," a famous designer was saying as we discussed fall collections. "The metalwork especially..."

"Thanks." I smiled. "Though lately I've been more interested in sustainable materials. The environmental impact of luxury goods is something we need to talk about."

The conversation flowed easily among us.

I stepped out to the courtyard for some air. The stars were barely visible through New York's light pollution, but the break from the circus inside was worth it.


Deep breaths, Stella. Round two is coming up.




The violin's last note faded out in Lucy's hand, and right on cue, John stepped up to perform his proud papa act.

"Everyone," his voice boomed through the hall.′′tOInight isn't just about art. It's about family." He wrapped an arm around Lucy's shoulders like she was some prize poodle. "My daughter Lucy-has brought such joy to our lives."


“I heard there is only one daughter in the Winstons, is it Miss Stella?" A voice break the harmony. John pretended to show a sad expression." Lucy never had formal training, yet her current level of skill comes purely from her natural talent. As for Stella... her musical abilities have long been neglected, maybe her current level is now inferior to Lucy's.

Well. "Dad". I will show you latter. Just wait and see.

Anna clutched Lucy's hand, their matching bracelets catching the light. She also sighed. "If it weren't for that accident back then, and if Lucy had been raised by our side, she would certainly be even more accomplished than she is now."

The perfect family portrait. I wanted to gag. It seemed I was the outsider.


"Such a talent," someone whispered nearby. "Have you seen her latest collection?"


I had to bite my tongue to keep from laughing. My collection,you mean. Every single piece of it.

"The Winston artistic legacy lives on," John continued.

Wow. He might as well have just pointed and yelled "fraud.""If only we'd spotted Lucy's potential earlier," Anna chimed in.voice dripping fake regret.11SOmuch time wasted on... other person." Twenty years of their "generosity" summed up in three words.Nice, "Mom".


Great. I pressed myself deeper into my corner of the Met's ballroom,watching Lucy enjoy herself in the crowd like she was born to it.

"Stella!" Lucy's voice made me wince internally. "Why are you hiding back there? Mom and Dad have been looking everywhere for you!"

Yeah, right. Like a shark looks for its next meal. She successfully attracted all attention to us. But I plastered on my society smile anyway. "Lucy. Having fun?"

The whispers started immediately. God, these people never get tired of the same old gossip, do they?

"Did you hear about her and Brian-"

"Can't believe she showed her face-"

"That dress is definitely last season-"

Deep breaths, Stella. Don't let them see you sweat. She was wearing white again - her attempt to look innocent probably. The irony almost made me smile. My own black gown suddenly felt like armor."Stella." Anna's voice hit me like ice water. "Come here, dear." Oh hell. One look at Lucy's smirking face told me everything.They had something planned. My stomach churned. Just smile and nod.


\---

Adam's POV

I watched her from the private balcony, my fingers drumming against the armrest of my wheelchair. Stella stood alone by a painting, somehow making her isolation look deliberate, even elegant


"Quite the show down there." Mark joined me, scotch in hand."Starting to think we might've gotten your wife all wrong."


I remained silent, my eyes fixed on Stella. The way she held herself, chin lifted slightly, shoulders back - a perfect mask of indifference. But I'd seen beneath that mask.


"Did you know about her experience with the Winstons?" Mark swirled his scotch, the ice clinking against the glass.′′Pretty poor woman." "Explain." I could hear the edge in my own voice, a dangerous undertone that made most people flinch. Mark, unfortunately,wasn't most people.  "Your wife's been suffering more than anyone realized." Mark paused, and something in his tone made my muscles tense." Did you know the Winstons had a son?"

That caught my attention."Had?"

"Died young. They were old school -you know, daughters for marrying off, sons for inheriting." Mark's voice carried an unusual note of sympathy. "By the time they lost him,they'd already adopted Stella. Took forever for them to see Lucy as more than just a backup plan."

I watched as Lucy preened under the attention of her socialite circle,while Stella maintained her careful distance. Always on the outside. Something twisted in my chest-an unfamiliar sensation I chose not to examine too closely.

"Interesting." I kept my voice soft, controlled, even as my mind raced through the implications. So that's why you're sO determined to stand on your own, Mrs. Lancaster.

"And that necklace drama?" Mark grinned, oblivious to my thoughts. "Just proof of ownership. Your wife had signed every piece Lucy's claiming she designed. That's just the start."

You've been underestimated your whole life, haven't you?

"She's more... resourceful than I thought." The words came out before I could stop them, my eyes still tracking her movements.

"Oh?" Mark's eyebrows shot up, his grin widening. "From you,that's practically a love confession."
###Chapter 14

Stella's POV

I made my way forward,feeling the weight of hundreds of judgmental stares.


"I knew you used to play violin quite well," Anna's smile wouldn't have looked out of place on a cobra. "Why don't you perform for everyone as well?"


Seriously? That's their big play? "Oh, I'm afraid it's been too long-"


"Such a shame." Anna's voice dripped fake concern. "Though I suppose that's what happens when you take in... strays. Not like Irena Lancaster- now there was a true lady. Though even she had her... failures."

The room went deadly quiet. To insult Irena Lancaster,Adam s mother, at a public event...

Something in my chest went ice cold. They could insult me all they wanted, but Irena? The woman who'd shown me more kindness in our few meetings than the Winstons had in twenty years? I changed my mind suddenly. If you want see, then I will show you my ability. "Actually." I heard myself say, fury making my voice steady, "J would love to perform. On the piano, the one at the entrance,okay?"


Anna burst out laughing."Piano? Oh, this is impossible. First you waste our money on violin lessons, now you're pretending to be a pianist?"

"Mother,be nice," Lucy's voice carried across the now-silent room. "These orphanages do love pretending they have culture 11


Ignore them, Stella. Don't let them look down you.

"We give you everything." John Winston spat, "and this is how you repay us? By embarrassing our family?"

Lucy twisted the knife. "Maybe she learned from those musicians she used to sneak out to meet. Though I doubt music was what she was practicing on her knees."

That's it. My nails dug into my palms. You want a show? I'll give you a show.

"The only piano here is Irena's," someone pointed out with obvious disdain. "And we all know that's strictly off-limits."

They were right. That piano wasn't just any instrument - it was Irena's pride and joy, a custom-made concert grand worth millions. She'd performed on it at countless charity events before her... disappearance.

"Besides," Lucy's smile was pure poison, "that piano has history. It wouldn't be right to let someone like you touch it."


A distinguished-looking woman in Chanel nodded. "Darling,maybe try the other piano? That's more... appropriate for your level."


"Actually," Mark Anderson stepped forward, his usual playboy smile firmly in place, "as tonight's host, even if she is your wife,I'd normally have to decline-"


Just when Mark was about to signal a waiter to refuse me, he heard Adam said.


"Let she use Mother's piano."

Even Mark looked stunned.

"But Adam," Lucy protested, "you can't seriously-"

One look from those green eyes shut him up mid-sentence.

Then the waiter told us that I could use that piano. How lucky I am,I thought.

Lucy choked on her champagne. Everyone knew Irena's piano was off-limits. Like, "touch it and die" off-limits.


As I passed Adam, his hand caught my wrist. The touch sent electricity through my body. "Don't disappoint me," he murmured, voice low enough to make me hear. Right, it was his mother's piano, I would not let him down.

"Never," I whispered back. Something dark flashed in his eyes before he let me go.

Focus,Stella. Show them what you can do.

The opening notes filled the hall. Every key stroke carried years of late nights practicing in empty music rooms,of proving myself over and over. Take that, my dear family.

When the final note faded, the silence was deafening. Then...

"Holy shit," someone whispered1. "That was..."

"Extraordinary!" An old lady was actually crying. "Such passion!"

"Even professionals struggle with that piece," one famous musician sounded like admitting it physically hurt him.


I caught Adam's reaction through my peripheral vision. His face was stone, but those eyes... they burned. His grip on his wheelchair's armrest was white-knuckled. "Simply magnificent!" Some guy I didn't know practically bounced up to Adam. "Your wife is incredible! She must play at our next gala!" I rose, straightening my dress. Time to twist the knife. "A tribute to Irena Lancaster- the only true Mrs. Lancaster of her generation. She is my idol and my teacher. And she is not someone you can slander casually!" I let my gaze sweep meaningfully over certain faces.

Lucy and Anna looked like she'd been slapped. Worth it.

Walking past Adam again, his hand shot out, pulling me close enough to smell his cologne."Impressive," he breathed against my ear.

Stop it, heart. Stop racing like that.

I turned to find Adam watching me with that unreadable expression.

His eyes tracked over my gown. "Most women here went for...flashier options."

"Some of us don't need to scream for attention." I met his gaze."Depends what kind of attention you're after, doesn't it?"


Something dark flashed in his eyes. His hand found my waist,sending sparks through my body even through the fabric. "And what kind of attention are you after, Mrs. Lancaster?" I gave him my sweetest smile.''Wouldn't you like to know?" His mouth twitched."Maybe I would." Lucy's fake laugh rang out behind us. John was still going on about "family legacy" and "true talent."

Adam's grip tightened slightly. "Your... family seems invested in their story."

"Oh?" I kept my voice light. "Which story is that?"

"The prodigal daughter returns." His thumb traced circles on my hip. Probably didn't even realize he was doing it. "Though the timing's interesting."

I turned to face him fully. Watched his pupils dilate.′′MrLancaster," I kept my voice low, just for him, "are you actually interested in my family drama? Or is this just another way to investigate your mysterious wife?"

The smile he gave me was pure predator. "Why not both?"

He leaned in close, lips brushing my ear. "Though I have to say,Mrs. Lancaster, you get more... intriguing every day."

I couldn't stop the shiver that ran through me.

Behind us, Lucy was having some kind of meltdown,but I couldn't care less. Let her throw her tantrum. I'd made my show.
###Chapter 15

Stella's POV

"Miss Winston?" The Waiter's voice caught me just as I was preparing to leave the gala.′′M. Anderson is waiting for you outside."


I paused, adjusting my evening gown. The night had been...interesting, to say the least. I remembered I just had met him once,why he waited for me?


The cool night air hit my face as I stepped outside, a welcome relief after the stifling atmosphere of the gala. Mark stood by his car, looking impeccable as always in his tailored suit. His usual smirk was replaced by something more contemplative.


"Thank you for letting me use that beautiful piano tonight," I said carefully. It had been exquisite - the kind of instrument most musicians only dreamed of touching.


Mark's eyebrow arched. "Mrs. Lancaster, you're thanking the wrong person." My heart skipped a beat at the title."What?" Not him? Then Who? Adam? Impossible. "That piano?" His smile turned knowing.′′Ionly agreed because your husband insisted." Husband. The word still felt foreign. "Adam... asked you?"

"First time he's ever requested something like this for anyone."Mark studied me with new interest.′′Don't worry, I'll keep your marriage quiet. Though I must say..."He paused meaningfully. "Adam's never gone to such lengths for anyone before."


My mind raced. Is he so kind to me ? A secret marriage? But why would Adam want to keep it hidden? Unless...

\---

The sleek black car was impossible to miss in the parking area.Before I could think better of it, I stepped into its path.

"Sir," Taylor's voice carried a note of surprise.′′It7's Mrs.Lancaster."


"Blocking my car?" Adam's voice held that dangerous edge. "Do you have a death wish, Miss Winston?"


"Weren't you waiting for me?" The words tumbled out before I could stop them. "Mark told me about the piano."

His jaw tightened almost imperceptibly. "And?" "I... wwanted to thank you." Why did my voice sound so breathy?"For letting me use it.""Just a thank you?" He practically purred the words, making my skin tingle. "Such empty words, Miss Winston."

Heat crept up my neck at his tone. MMaybe I should invite him to dinner? At least that would show some real gratitude.

The thought of sharing a meal with him made my heart race in a way I refused to examine too closely. He probably wouldn't even accept.

"I... I could treat you to dinner?" The words tumbled out before I could stop them, my voice embarrassingly uncertain."To show my appreciation properly?"

"Dinner?" His hand shot out, catching my wrist and pulling me closer until I was practically falling against him. "How...innocent." His breath ghosted across my ear, making me shiver."I can think of more... interesting ways for you to show your gratitude."


His other hand traced a deliberate path from my shoulder to my waist, each touch sending sparks of electricity through my body. I tried to steady my breathing, but being this close to him made it impossible to think straight. "Mr. Lancaster-" I gasped as his fingers found the sensitive spot just above my hip. "Yes?" His voice dropped to that dangerous whisper that always made my knees weak. "Something wrong, Mrs.Lancaster?" The way he emphasized my title sent heat pooling in my stomach.

"I... I should go," I managed, though my body betrayed me by meltinng further into his touch.

"Get in." His command left no room for argument, though his hand remained possessively on my waist.

"What?"

"Now." His eyes flickered past me, and I caught a glimpse of familiar faces approaching- the Winston crowd. "Unless you'd prefe another meeting with them?" He knew I hate that family.

I slipped into the car just as Lucy's shrill laugh carried across the parking lot. The leather seats embraced me like liquid silk,and that maddening cologne of his filled the enclosed space.


"Playing the victim at the gala?" His voice dropped dangerously low. "Is that your new strategy?"

I met his gaze steadily. "Mr. Lancaster, when have I ever lost my composure? Everyone knows I'm the epitome of grace." A small smile curved my lips. "Besides, they didn't get the better of me, did they?" Something dark and hungry flashed in those green eyes before he could mask it. The manor's study always felt like Adam's personal domain.Even at this late hour, papers were spread across his desk.I heard Mark's voice from his phone, curiosity burning through me.


"Adam!" Mark's voice carried clearly through the speaker. "First time asking for something from me-starting get soft for your wife?"


"Bored?" Adam's tone impatient.

I slipped away before I could hear more, my mind whirling.What exactly was Adam planning?

The kitchen staff had not retired, so I asked them to make some dishes for Adam and prepared to send them to his study.
My cooking is so ...Uh, everyone has something they can never do well.

"A midnight snack?" I placed the tray on his desk."Joseph mentioned you like these."

His eyes narrowed slightly.′′Using my own chef's cooking to thank me?" A dangerous smile curved his lips. "How...resourceful." Heat crept up my neck. Of course he'd know his own kitchen's style."Ijust wantedtO−′′ "To what?" His fingers wrapped around my wrist as I turned to leave, spinning me back against him with surprising strength.
The sudden movement knocked the breath from my lungs.leaving me pressed against the solid wall of his chest. "Show your gratitude? Or is this another one to please me?"

How shameless! He even force me straddle on him, I just wanted to eat with him. How can he have that thought?

His free hand slid up my spine, leaving trails of fire in its wake."You know," his lips brushed my ear, making me shiver, "if you really want to thank me,there are more... entertaining ways than cooking."

I tried to steady my racing heart. "Mr. Lancaster-"

"Stella." The way he said my name, low and commanding,made my heart race. "When will you learn?"

His each movement making it harder to think straight.′′Iwasn't trying to-"

′′Deceive me?" His other hand found my waist, drawing me closer until I could feel the heat radiating from his body. "How about I teach you tonight?" "I just wanted to thank you properly." My God, why his word is so ambiguous? "I just wanted to thank you properly." My God, why his word is so ambiguous? Before I could respond, the door barely clicked shut and he grabbed my chin to face him. His green, smoldering gaze locked onto mine, and the tension that had been simmering between us all evening reached its breaking point. I wanted to resist.but my voice faltered, and my heart melted as his lips crashed down on mine-demanding and hungry.

I gasped against his mouth, my hands instinctively reaching up to grasp his shoulders. I clung to him as he pressed me back against the wall. My mind was blank at the moment Adam deepened the kiss, his tongue sweeping into my mouth...
###Chapter 16

Stella's POV

Just when I was lost in his passionate kiss, even expecting his hands to slip under my dress, he suddenly pulled away.The abrupt loss of contact left me feeling strangely empty and frustrated.


Damn it. Am I not attractive enough? Why did he stop?I fought down the irrational surge of disappointment. Bastard,playing with me like this.

"I..." I cleared my throat,trying to steady my voice.′′Ican only make salad. If you want anything else, I can try-though I can't guarantee the taste."


Adam's mouth curved into that dangerous smile that always made my pulse skip. "The famous New York socialite can't even cook? What did the Winstons teach you?""Mr. Lancaster." I met his gaze steadily, despite the lingering effects of his kiss. "Since when does being a socialite require culinary expertise? That title was given to me, not something I chose. Besides," I lifted my chin, "I am not belong to the Winstons anymore." ′′Diid you?" His thumb traced my bottom lip, still sensitive from his earlier assault. "Then what do you belong to now, Mrs.Lancaster?" 
Before I could answer, he released me and turned to his desk."If you're so eager to show gratitude, perhaps you can make yourself useful." He pulled out a stack of documents. "These need translating."

I moved closer, curiosity getting the better of me. The papers were filled with complex financial data in multiple languages.My blood ran cold as I spotted familiar account numbers.Rouge's offshore accounts.

"Something wrong?" His voice held that dangerous edge again.

"No," I kept my tone light, "just surprised by the complexity."Stay calm. Don't give anything away.

I started translating, hyper-aware of his eyes on me. The documents revealed a tangled web of shell companies, all designed to obscure the true ownership of Rouge nightclub.Thank God there's nothing directly linking it to me.

"Impressive." Adam's voice cut through my concentration.′′FOr someone with no business experience, you understand financial documents remarkably well." shrugged, pretending to keep casual. "Basic business knowledge is essential for anyone in New York society. You pick things up.11 "Do you?" He leaned forward, and that maddening cologne of his made it hard to think straight. ' l
ike how to run a successful nightclub. perhaps?"

My heart nearly stopped. He knows it is me running Rouge?"I don't know anything about that."

"No?" His smile turned predatory. "Perhaps I should buy Rouge as a wedding gift for you. What does Mrs. Lancaster think about that?"


"That's not necessary." I kept my voice steady despite the panic clawing at my chest. "I've never had any interest in any nightclub. I wouldn't even know how to manage one."

"Really?" His fingers wrapped around my wrist, sending sparks of electricity up my arm."For someone with 'no experience,'you handled those dice like a professional that night."

Don't react. Don't give him the satisfaction. "Mr. Lancaster,are you suggesting I learned to play dice in nightclubs? I thought you had a higher opinion of your wife."

His grip tightened fractionally. "My wife seems to be full of surprises lately. The piano performance tonight, for instance."

"I thought you'd appreciate that." I met his gaze. "After all,you did allow me to use your mother's piano." Something unsure flickered in those green eyes. "Mother taught you well, it seems." "She was kind to me." I softened my voice. "Unlike some people."

His jaw ticked. "And what exactly did my mother teach you,Mrs. Lancaster?"


"That some secrets are worth keeping." I held his gaze.

For a moment, neither of us moved. The tension crackled between us like lightning before a storm.

"Interesting philosophy." His thumb traced circles on my inner wrist. "Though I prefer a more... direct approach."

′′Dco you?" I fought to keep my voice steady as his touch sent shivers down my spine. "Is that why you're so interested in Rouge?"

"Perhaps I'm more interested in its mysterious owner." He whispered in my ear and I could even feel the heat radiating from his body.

He's fishing. He doesn't have proof. "Sounds complicated.I prefer simpler investments."′′Dco you?" His lips brushed my ear, his voice dropping to that dangerous voice. One hand tangled in my hair, tilting my head back. "And what pleasures interest Mrs. Lancaster?" "Art." I tried to sound composed, but my voice betrayed me with a slight tremor as his other hand traced dangerous patterns on my hip. "Fashion. Things I.. actually understand."

"Hmm." His teeth grazed my neck, making me gasp. "And yet you read those financial documents so... fluently."

His tongue darted out to soothe the spot he'd just bitten."Makes me wonder what else that clever mouth of yours can do.11


"Mr. Lancaster." I pushed against his chest, needing space to think clearly. "What exactly are you implying?"

He released me suddenly, leaving me cold despite the room's warmth. "Nothing at all, Mrs. Lancaster. You may go."

The dismissal stung, but not as much as the loss of his touch.I gathered what dignity I had left on shaky legs and headed for the door.


"Oh, and Stella?" His voice stopped me in my tracks.′′Nxt time you want to thank me... skip the amateur cooking attempt. I prefer... other forms of gratitude."

Heat flooded my cheeks as I fled to my room. I collapsed onto my bed, mind racing. He suspects something about Rouge. But how much does he know? The memory of his kiss still burned on my lips, making it hard to focus. Stop it. He's just trying to throw you off balance.

I touched my wrist where his fingers had been, remembering how easily he'd seen through my attempt at gratitude. All I wanted was to quietly run my business and live freely. Why won't they let me?


A bitter laugh escaped me. Here I was, supposedly one of New York's most eligible socialites, sneaking around like a criminal just to maintain my independence.

My phone buzzed with a message from Sam: "Everything okay?
You look stressed in the photos from the gala."

"Adam knows something about Rouge," I typed back. "He had the offshore account documents."

"Shit. How much?"

"Not sure. But he's definitely suspicious."

I stared at the ceiling, exhaustion settling into my bones. I just wanted a simple life. Was that too much to ask?
###Chapter 17

Stella's POV

One notification. Two. Ten. A hundred.

My phone wouldn't stop buzzing as I scrolled through Instagram the morning after the gala. The hashtag Lancaster Piano was trending, with video clips of last night's performance flooding social media.

"Did anyone else catch that piano performance at the Met?Who knew Stella Winston had it in her?"


"Technical precision + emotional depth. This isn't amateur hour - years of serious training evident in her fingering technique and pedal control. Lancaster Piano"

′′Lucy Winston claims to be the artistic heir but can barely handle basic pieces. Drama Lancaster Pian1o"

I couldn't help but smile at the close-up video someone had captured of my hands flying across the keys. The comments below were...interesting. "That's not just talent - that's years of dedicated practice. Look at her hand position!" "Former piano teacher here - her technique is conservatory level, This isn't something you can fake."The satisfaction was almost worth the incoming storm I knew was brewing.

Sam's message popped up:"Stella, you're EVERYWHERE!Even my doorman is talking about Lancaster Piano!"

I started typing a reply when another headline caught my eye:

"EXPOSED: Lucy Winston's 'Natural Talent' Called into Question After Rival's Stunning Performance"

\---

The video clips kept spreading. Someone had helpfully edited together Lucy's stilted performance with my piece,complete with professional musicians' critiques in the comments. The contrast was... stark.

"Basic posture mistakes throughout..."

"Rhythmic inconsistencies indicate lack of proper training..."

"This is what happens when you prioritize Instagram likes over actual practice."


A text from Sam made me snort coffee through my nose:"Your sister's having a total meltdown on her stories. You might want to check this out." Sure enough, Lucy's Instagram was a masterclass in social media crisis management - or rather, how NOT to handle it. "I've ALWAYS been musical," she insisted in one clip, voice slightly shrill. "Everyone knows the Winstons have artistic talent in our BLOOD_"

The comments were merciless:

"In your blood? Girl, you're adopted too ?"

"Someone's pressed about not being daddy's favorite anymore"

"Can we talk about that violin performance tho? My 6yo nephew plays better"

I couldn't help but laugh seeing them.


\---

"Miss?" Joseph's voice interrupted my scrolling. "There seems to be some... commotion at the Winston residence."

I raised an eyebrow. "Commotion?"

He cleared his throat delicately. "The staff gossip network suggests Miss Lucy is getting mad and throwing all things in her bedroom."


The mental image of Lucy rage-destroying her precious designer collection almost made me laugh. "How unfortunate." I kept my voice neutral. "I trust the cleaning staff will handle it discreetly?" "Maybe." Was that a hint of amusement in Joseph's voice?"Though they mentioned Mr. and Mrs. Winston seemed...rather preoccupied with their own discussion."

Now that caught my attention."Oh?"

"Something about reconsidering past decisions?" He adjusted his perfectly straight tie. "The exact phrase used was 'maybe we backed the wrong horse."

Interesting.


\---


That afternoon, I got some interesting information from my contacts at the Winston mansion (it's amazing how chatty the staff becomes after receiving good tips). According to them,John and Anna had a major argument in their private sitting room,all caught on the security cameras.

"She made us look like fools!" Anna's voice carried even through the thick doors. "Our own daughter, upstaged by that...that..."


"That remarkably talented young woman who we raised for twenty years?" John's tone was uncharacteristically sharp.  "She deceived us all the time!" Anna's voice rose another octave. "Did she?" John cut her off, "Or did we just assume that because it was easier than admitting we might have...miscalculated?"


The silence that followed was deafening.

"But she's not our blood," Anna finally said, but her voice had lost some of its certainty.

"No." John sounded tired. "But she might be the better investment."


\---

The GT Group's HR department would probably be surprised my application for Fashion Director to land on their desk that morning. But timing was everything in both fashion and warfare.


I recieved the message from he HR manager sent messages."Mrs. Lancaster. Your application has been received."

I looked up from my laptop, where I'd been reviewing the latest Rouge numbers. Already? That was fast.

"Will there be an interview process?" I kept my tone professional in message. "The interview will be held next week." I couldn'at help but smile."Got it,thanks," Just as I was about to prepare for my interview when Joseph appeared with an envelope on a silver tray. It was a formal invitation.


I scanned the ornate text. "Lancaster Manor dinner party?"
"The old manor," Joseph clarified.′′Mr. Henry Lancaster is hosting."

The family patriarch himself. I heard Adam was not getting well with the members in the old Lancaster Manor. Well. This should be interesting.

"When?"

"Tomorrow evening." Joseph's expression gave nothing away.

\---

Adam'POV

I waited in the foyer, watching the shadows lengthen across the marble floor. The dinner at the old manor wasn't something I particularly looked forward to, but certain obligations couldn't be avoided.

The sound of heels on hardwood made me look up. And for a moment, I even forgot to breathe. Stella descended the stairs in a modern gown of pale moonlight silk, subtle patterns shifting like water with each graceful movoment. The dress hugged every curve while remaining perfectly modest.

She looked every inch the proper wife. No one would guess this was the same woman who could hustle professional gamblers at dice or play the piano gracefully.

But perhaps that was what made her so... intriguing.Every time I thought I had her figured out, another layer emerged.Like now - she'd chosen an outfit that was impeccably appropriate while being absolutely impossible to ignore.

Too eye-catching, a dark voice wvhispered in my head. The thought of others staring at her made me strange in my heart.

I rarely paid attention to someone. But Stella...she commanded attention without even trying.

When she was quiet and composed like now, she radiated a gentle elegance that drew the eye. When angry, she carried herself with an icy pride that demanded respect. And when she chose to be charming... the effect was devastating.

The memory of Brian's continued obsession with her darkened my mood. I could not tolerate others coveting what was mine.

Since when do you care who looks at her? In the car, I felt her studying me, no doubt noting my deliberately casual attire. A silent rebellion against the old manor's stuffiness.

"Mr. Lancaster." The way she said my name still felt like a challenge. "I'm not dressed like this to curry favor with your family."

I raised an eyebrow, waiting for her explanation.

"Perfect etiquette is the foundation for justified retaliation," she continued, a spark of that hidden fire in her eyes.′′Any breach in proper behavior gives them an opening to attack."

Her lips curved in a small smile. "Besides, maintaining an impeccable image is basic professional courtesy for a stylist."

Clever girl. Using their own rules as both shield and weapon.

I let my gaze trail deliberately over her form again, enjoying how her breath caught slightly. The way the silk hugged her curves was definitely going to be a test of my self-control tonight. "So, these are your reason?"

"Mr. Lancaster." The formal address was pure provocation now."Are you saying I've managed to capture your attention?"

The smile I gave her was all predator. "Careful, Mrs. Lancaster.You might not know what will happen later."
###Chapter 18

Stella's POV

The car ride to Lancaster Manor felt endless. I'd spent the entire afternoon memorizing every Lancaster family member's background like I was cramming for finals. Their connections,businesses,scandals.


"Your head's going to explode if you keep thinking so hard,"Adam said, breaking my concentration.

I shot him a glare, which probably looked about as threatening as an angry puppy. Without warning, he reached over and flicked my forehead with his knuckles.

My heart did that annoying little skip it always did around him. The touch hadn't hurt- if anything, it had been oddly gentle.

"Mr. Lancaster." I kept my voice steady despite my racing pulse. "I'd appreciate it if you didn't treat me like a child."

"You look like you're planning world domination instead of attending a family dinner." "Well,with your family, what's the difference?" I muttered. His mouth twitched."Point taken." Before I could decode that cryptic response, the car turned onto a winding driveway lined with ancient oaks. Lancaster Manor loomed ahead, a sprawling testament to old money and even older power.


Taylor got Adam's wheelchair ready. and I noticed how the ramp was just steep enough to be annoying. Classic William-doing the bare minimum while making sure everyone knew what an inconvenience it was.


About forty family members were already gathered - women gossiping over cards on one side. men talking business on the other. What a joke.


"You're late." William's voice carried across the room like he was addressing a misbehaving child.

"Traffic." Adam's tone could've given everyone frostbite. "The wheelchair takes some time to manage. Unless you'd prefer I didn't come at all?"


William's jaw ticked, but he could hardly criticize his son's disability in public. Well played, Mr. Lancaster.

"Adam." Thomas stepped forward,oozing fake brotherly concern. "You should've called if you needed help. As your older brother-" "Brother?" Adam cut him off with a smile that was pure venom. ′′Mymother only gave me one brother, and you're definitely not him."Oh snap. Everyone knew about Irena 's two sons (one deceased) versus William's illegitimate kid Thomas, but nobody ever mentioned it out loud.


"Mrs. Lancaster." Thomas's wife practically spat my title.′′Oshould wre still call you Miss Winston? We were so surprised to hear about the...arrangement."

"Mrs. Lancaster works just fine," I said sweetly."The Winston name is just a bonus at this point."

"A temporary bonus, from what I hear."

"Not at all. Being Adam's wvife is perfectly official." I smiled. "Unlike some other family situations."

Her face went from fake tan to angry red real quick.

"Speaking of temporary," Brian chimed in, "isn't this just another one of your games, Stella? Like our engagement?"

I felt Adam go absolutely still beside me - that dangerous stillness that always preceded a storm. His knuckles went white on his wheelchair's armrest. Before I could respond, Brian smirked and added, "What's wrong, Uncle? Truth hurts?" Just couldn't stand it anymore, I retorted, "Brian, maybe show some respect to your uncle's wife?""Respect?" Thomas's wife actually laughed. "You are just Brian's leftovers."

She stepped toward me with her hand raised. But before she could get near me, a coffee cup went flying - right into her silk dress.


"Adam!" She screeched, pawing at the stain. "How dare you-"

"How dare I?" Adam's arm wrapped around my waist with possessive force, pulling me firmly behind him. When he spoke his voice was pure ice, but I could feel the rage vibrating through his body where he touched me. "Who do you think you are, trying to touch my wife?"

My heart did a weird flip at the way he said "my wife."

"Now, Adam." William tried to play peacemaker. "There's no need for-"


"No need?" Adam's smile was terrifying. "Should I remind everyone who I am? Your only legitimate heir." He paused. "Want me to show you what that means?" The emphasis on'legitimate' made Thomas flinch. The threat in his voice was unmistakable. The tension in the Lancaster Manor's dining room could have been cut with a knife. For the first time, I glimpsed the ruthless power hiding behind his carefully controlled facade. "I think," his grip tightened on my waist, "we need some fresh air. Mrs. Lancaster?"

He guided me toward the terrace, and I was super aware of his hand still on my waist. Behind us, William was doing damage control while Thomas's wife kept whining about her dress.

"How dare that cripple..." Thomas's words faded into angry mutters.


"If only Mother had succeeded in driving Irena out before..."His wife's poisonous whispers carried just far enough to make their intent clear.


"Enough!" Henry Lancaster's voice cut through the whispers."This is meant to be a family dinner!"

Adam's hand tightened imperceptibly on his wheelchair's armrest, but his face remained impassive.

All I could think about now was how Adam's hand felt through my dress, and how he'd said "my wife" like it actually meant something.

Stop it, I told my treacherous heart. He's just keeping up appearances. "Mr. Lancaster." I tried to sound normal despite his thumb doing distracting things to my hip."′′That was quite the knight in shining armor act." He laughed darkly. "Not even close. That was pure self-interest.
" His eyes locked onto mine. "Nobody touches what's mine."

Yours? I wanted to ask, but the way he was looking at me made it impossible to think straight. Instead. I found myself leaning into him like an idiot.

Dangerous, my mind whispered. But as his other hand came up to trace my jawline, I couldn't bring myself to care.
###Chapter 19

Stella's POV

I was the arranged in the east wing guest suite. I tried to lose myself in a book after Adam left for some urgent matters,but my mind kept circling back to the family drama I'd witnessed.

A knock interrupted my thoughts.

"Stella?" Brian's voice made my spine stiffen. "Can we talk?"

I considered ignoring him, but that would only encourage more attempts. "What do you want?"

He closed the door behind him, looking oddly serious.′′There are things you should know about Adam."

"Like what?" I kept my voice bored, though something in his tone made my pulse quicken. Why does he suddenly want to play concerned ex-fiancé?

"Did you know he had a brother?" Brian's eyes fixed on my face, watching for my reaction. "A real one - same mother and everything."


I maintained my neutral expression, though my mind raced. A brother? How had I never heard about this? Adam had never mentioned that.
 "Had?" "Died in a fire." Brian's voice dropped dramatically. "Along with three others. Very tragic. Very... convenient."

My heart skipped a beat, but I kept my face carefully blank."What exactly are you implying?"

"Uncle Adam spent some time in a very exclusive psychiatric facility after that." Brian's smile held no warmth. "Instead of prison. Funny how that worked out,isn't it?"

I studied him carefully, noting the calculated way he delivered this information. "Why are you telling me this?"

"Because I still care about you." He stepped closer,and I caught a whiff of expensive cologne. "Despite everything."

"Care about me?" I couldn't help but laugh. "Or are you just upset I married your uncle instead of you?"

His face darkened. "You have no idea what he's capable of."

"And you do?" I arched an eyebrow. "Tell me, Brian, why are you really here? Still have feelings for me?"

Behind a marble column, I caught a flash of pink designer silk.Lucy. Of course she'd be eavesdropping. "You should be careful," Brian warned, backing toward the door. "People tend to have... accidents around Uncle Adam." After he left, I sat perfectly still, processing this new information. A brother? A fire? It seemed the Lancasters had more skeletons in their closets than I'd imagined.

Could Adam really have...? No. Brian's lying. He has to be.

My mind kept circling back to all the little things I'd noticed about Adam - his carefully controlled anger, the way the family tiptoed around certain topics, those moments when something dangerous flickered in his eyes.


What if Brian's telling the truth? What if I've married someone capable of... I couldn't even finish the thought.




Dinner started. The traditional seating arrangement -just like most of the attitudes in the living room.

"Can you believe she actually showed up?" A perfectly manicured woman whispered just loud enough for me to hear."I mean, after that whole Brian scandal..."


"Well, she's certainly... resourceful," her companion replied with a smirk. "First the nephew, now the crippled uncle? Talk about working your way through the family tree." "The way she holds herself- like she actually belongs here."Thomas's wife's voice carried deliberate venom. "Some people just don't know their place." I maintained perfect posture and impeccable table manners.ignoring the whispers and pointed looks. Across the room.Adam sat apart from the others, his wheelchair settled aside.Our eyes met briefly, and something electric passed between us before he looked away.

Lucy kept shooting me calculating looks between her attempts to copy my etiquette. Amateur. She still held her soup spoon like she was digging for gold.

After dinner, I noticed Adam and Thomas being summoned to William's study.


"Mrs. Lancaster." Lucy's voice stopped me in the hallway as I headed back to my room. Her heels clicked against the marble floor as she approached. "A word?"

I turned slowly, studying her face. Something about her expression set off warning bells.

"If you want to know the truth about how Adam's brother died." she lowered her voice conspiratorially, "meet me at eight."

I narrowed my eyes. Lucy had only been back in New York society for a few months- How did Lucy, of all people, know about such a closely guarded family secret? "Does it matter how I know?" Her smile turned vicious. "Of course.you don't have to come. But..," she paused for dramatic effect, "can you really afford not to? What if that psycho Adam decides you're his next target?"

I studied her in silence for several long seconds, noting the calculated gleam in her eyes. Interesting choice of words.

"Of course." I smiled sweetly. "I'm always eager to learn more about my husband's family. Which room?"

"West wing guest suite." She practically preened at my apparent acquiescence.

As I watched her sashay away. I couldn't help but smile slightly. DDid she really think I'd believe Adam was some unhinged killer waiting to snap? Please. If he were truly unstable, would someone like Mark - arguably the most shrewd businessman in entertainment-trust him implicitly?


Still, I was curious. What game was Lucy playing? And more importantly, who was feeding her information about the Lancasters' closely guarded secrets?

Time to find out what little show you've prepared, dear sister.
###Chapter 20

Stella's POV

I made my way down the west wing hallway. my heels sinking into the thick carpet.

"Right on time." Lucy's smile was pure sugar as I entered the room. "Come in, come in! I have the most amazing wine."


I studied her practiced movements as she poured two glasses of what appeared to be extremely expensive red wine.


"You said you had information about Adam's brother." I kept my tone neutral, watching her hands carefully.

"Ohyes." She handed me a glass with practiced grace.′′It7quite the story. But first. a toast? To... family secrets."

"You know," she continued, swirling her wine,"it's fascinating how history repeats itself in this family. Accidents, convenient deaths..."


She definitely added something in my glass.
 
 I accepted the glass, raising it to my lips. Then I suddenly paused, looking toward the doorway. "Did you hear something outside?" Lucy's reaction was instantaneous-and telling. She practically jumped, setting her glass down and rushing to check the 
hallway. "I don't see anyone..."

Too alert. dear sister. What are you planning?

While she was distracted, I quickly swapped our wine glasses.By the time she returned. I was exactly where she'd left me.wearing my best innocent expression.

Lucy took a deep drink from what she thought was her glass."I have my sources." Her smile turned predatory. "Though I must say, the fire that killed Adam's brother was particularly...tragic."

I felt my head starting to spin. No - not my head. I was pretending my head was spinning.

"You don't look well," Lucy's concern was as fake as her designer bag knockoffs. "Maybe you should lie down?"

I stumbled slightly, grabbing the back of a chair for support. "I feel... strange."

"Oh dear." Lucy's smile widened as she backed toward the door."Maybe you should rest. Don't worry, I'll make sure no one disturbs you." The lock clicked with finality, and I heard her heels clicking away down the hallway. Once her footsteps faded, I straightened up and surveyed the room.

A soft groan from behind an ornate screen caught my attention.I approached cautiously. then had to bite back a laugh. There.passed out cold, was a drunk man.


Oh Lucy. How predictable. Drug me, lock me in with a compromised family member. then "discover" the scandal.Amateur hour.


I checked my phone. No signal- of course. The west wing was notorious for its thick walls. Which meant...


I moved to the window, examining the three-story drop. Below.the Lancaster's prized fountain sparkled in the moonlight. The pool was deep enough, if you knew where to aim.

Well, Stella, time to run.

I kicked off my shoes and climbed onto the window ledge. The cool night air whipped at my dress as I calculated trajectories.

I chose the closest spot to Adam's room to get ouIt of the water.

Being soaking wet made me uncomfortable, so I opened the door and headed straight for the bathroom to take a shower. Who knew when I opened the door- I was so startled my eyes went wide, my mind went blank, and for a moment I forgot how to react.Through the white mist of steam, at eye level I saw the Adam's well-defined, firm chest, and my gaze unconsciously drifted downward-eight-pack abs, sexy Apollo's belt, and further down...


"Like my body?"

Just as his icy voice rang out, a gray towel flew over and covered my eyes.


I suddenly snapped back to reality, blinking dumbly as my thick eyelashes brushed against the towel with a tingling sensation. The scene I had just witnessed still floated in my mind.


Ah... height and that thing really do seem to have a positive correlation.


"You're didn't lock the door," I muttered after coming to my senses.


My voice sounded steady, but only I knew my heart was racing uncontrollably.


The next second, my vision cleared again - Adam now had a towel wrapped around his waist, covering his lower bodly. But his face was terrifyingly dark, like a silent threat, as if one more word of backtalk from me and he would throw me out. I awkwardly rubbed my nose, "I wasn't looking anywhere inappropriate just now."

Obviously no one believed that.

Feeling Adam's chilly gaze, I lowered my head to stare at the patterns on the floor tiles, pondering if I could salvage the situation somehow, when suddenly the man's voice came from above.


"You're my wife, so naturally it wasn't inappropriate looking."

I felt him take a step closer.

Sensing danger, I instinctively wanted to step back.

But before I could, my wrist was firmly grabbed by the man.

Male body temperature was higher than female's, and I felt the scorching heat through the delicate skin of my wrist.

It was especially hot.

"Ada-!" Before I could finish speaking, my palm was already placed on the towel at his waist, with my ring and middle fingers even touching his abs. The sensation at my fingertips was especially sensitive-I could clearly feel his powerful muscle definition and burning body heat.

My nerves tensed up like a cat whose tail had been stepped on.

I wanted to yank my hand away. but my wrist was firmly locked in his grip with no way to break free!

"You can not only look. but touch as well." Adam said as he watched me open my doe eyes wide like a startled animal.

"No touching, no touching!"

Who wants to touch you!

My head shook like a rattle drum."Y-you let go of mne!"

I struggled hard but unexpectedly slipped-

"Ah-!"

I crashed headfirst into a wall of flesh. To maintain balance.my hands instinctively searched for support, one hand climbing onto the man's broad shoulder, the other grabbing his upper arm.

His skin still had water droplets that hadn't been dried off. Our bodies were pressed together face to face, and I could clearly feel every part of his front..."Is it feel well?" He just stood like a pillar, making no move to help steady me.Without looking up. I could imagine Adam's black face and contemptuous gaze.

"How much longer do you want to touch?" Adam's voice sounded even more impatient.


I cursed internally, wanting to find a crack in the ground to crawl into.


I awkwardly withdrew my hands as if electrocuted and stood steadily to the side,'"Y-you told me to touch."

If my voice hadn't been as quiet as a mosquito's and somewhat stuttering,it would have sounded more righteous.

Adam withdrew his gaze, looking me up and down in my soaking wet state, and said with disgust, "Clean yourself up.You're dirty."

Then he walked out of the bathroom.

I locked the bathroom door, leaned against the wall facing up,and sighed in despair.

Why did I rush straight to the bathroom? Even if I was going to the bathroom,why didn't I knock? I finally got myself cleaned up, but when it came time to get dressed, I discovered something even more desperate I hadn't brought any change of clothes!

Well.shit.
 ###Chapter 21

Adam's POV

I downed another glass of scotch, but it wasn't helping. The scene from earlier kept playing in my head - Stella stumbling into me, her hands catching herself on my chest, that little gasp she made...


Get it together. I told myself. She's just part of the plan.A convenient solution. Nothing more.

But my mind had other ideas, replaying how she'd looked up at me with those big eyes, how her fingers had traced over my-

A knock interrupted my thoughts. Thank God.

"Mr. Lancaster?" Stella's voice came through the bathroom door."Um, I have a small problem..."

"What now?"

"I... kind of forgot to bring clothes in with me." She sounded embarrassed. "Could you maybe help me out?"I couldn't help but smirk. "You could always come out like that,Mrs. Lancaster. I won't mind."Ha ha, very funny." I could practically hear her eyes rolling. "Come on, I'm getting cold in here.""Oh? Weren't you just calling me a bastard earlier?"

There was a pause, then in the sweetest, most obviously fake voice. "Oh Mr. Lancaster, how could I ever say such a thing?You're so successful, so handsome, so talented... just absolutely perfect in every way."

I actually had to bite back a laugh.

Then I called a servant to bring her clothes. Found the shortest silk nightgown to her.

"...Why do I feel like you're up to something?"

"No idea what you mean." I walked to the bathroom door.nightgown in hand. "Just helping my dear wife."

The door cracked open just enough for her arm to reach out. I held the nightgown just out of reach.

"Really?" She made another grab for it."Please?"

"There, was that so hard?" I let her snatch it, catching a glimpse of bare shoulder as she pulled back.A few minutes later she came out, and I immediately regretted my choice of nightgown. The silk clung to every curve,making it really hard to remember why this was supposed to be just business.She plopped down on the edge of my bed like she owned it.'1tImay have... fallen into the fountain," she admitted, interrupting my dangerous train of thought.

Before I could process that concerning piece of information,we heard shouting from the guest wing. Doors slamming, people yelling.

Stella's face lit up like Christmas had come early. "Oh, this is gonna be good."


Before she could move toward the sound, I maneuvered my wheelchair to block her path. "Going somewhere?"

"To watch the show, obviously." She grinned. "Come on, I'll push your chair. You know you want to see this."

"You look way too happy about this."

I studied her face- the barely concealed amusement, the calculating intelligence behind those innocent eyes. "Lead the way." I gestured to my chair's handles. "Since you're so eager to be helpful."

Her hands were surprisingly gentle as she guided my chair through the manor's halls. The contact shouldn't have affected me, but every slight adjustment of her grip sent awareness skittering down my spine.As we approached the guest wing, volces carried clearly through the omnate hallway.

"Damn i.c. who's knocking?" A male voice, thick with alcohol.groaned from behind one of the dloors.

"It's all Stella's fault!" Lucy's shrill accusation rang out. "She was meeting a man in the guest room at this hour!"


My jaw clenched involuntarily. The thought of Stella with another man...


"Is this the kind of behavior we should expect from the Winston's adopted daughter?" Thomas's wife's voice dripped venom.


Stella chose that moment to make our presence known,her voice carrying that perfect blend of aristocratic disdain and innocent confusion. "My, what a gathering! Who's having secret rendezvous in our family's guest rooms?"

Lucy whirled toward us, her face flushing an unattractive shade of red. "Stop pretending! Everyone saw you entering this room!""Me?" Stella's laugh was pure silk. "Lucy, you must be mistaken. I've been with my husband all the night."Thomas's wife sneered. "Adam' room? We all know how...enthusiastic you are about Lancaster men. First Brian, now"Stella." Brian stepped forward, his face a mask of false concern. "If you're in some kind of trouble. you can tell me."

I felt Stella's hands tighten slightly on my wheelchair before she replied. her voice arctic. "Brian, remember your place. I'm your uncle's wife now. Such concern is... inappropriate."

"Though I did get my clothes changed." she continued thoughtfully, her tone taking on a suggestive edge that made my blood heat. "The bathroom activities were rather... vigorous.My husband can verify that."

"My wife's clothes were just delivered to our room 20 minutes ago," I cut in coldly, enjoying how the crowd shifted uncomfortably.

Lucy's face contorted. "But I indeed saw-

"Oh, darling." Stella's smile was pure poison honey."It's so easy to mistake things in the dark. Should we schedule an eye exam for you?"
###Chapter 22

Stella's POV

"Well?" Adam's voice could have frozen fire. "We're waiting for your explanation, Miss WNinston."

Lucy's perfectly manicured fingers twisted in her lap. "I... I may have been mistaken about what I saw."


"Mistaken?" I kept my voice light and pleasant. "That's quite different from your earlier certainty about seeing me in a...compromising position with an unknown man."

She shot me a venomous look, but I noticed the slight sheen of sweat on her forehead. Her breathing seemed unusually rapid,and a flush was creeping up her neck.

Interesting side effects, I thought. Looks like someone's own medicine is coming back to bite them.

"Perhaps," I continued sweetly, "we should discuss your vision problems? After all, making such serious accusations about me as Mr. Lancaster's wife... that's quite concerning if you're having trouble seeing clearly."Lucy's hand flew to her throat, tugging at her designer collar."I... I'm not feeling well.""Really?" I tilted my head.'"You seemed perfectly fine when you were spreading those rumors earlier."

Brian stepped forward, ever the wannabe knight in shining armor. "She's obviously unwell. We should-"

"Stay exactly where you are." Adam's command froze Brian mid-step. "Your... girlfriend has made serious accusations against my wife. I want to hear her explanation."

Thomas cleared his throat from his corner of the room. "Now,Adam, surely we can handle this as a family-"

"As a family?" Adam's smile was pure venom. "Interesting choice of words from you."

Lucy swayed slightly in her seat, her face flushing darker."Brian, I feel strange..."


"An apology is okay," I suggested mildly. "Both to me and to Mr. Lancaster, whose reputation you've attempted to damage."

"I... I apologize if there was any misunderstanding," Lucy managed through gritted teeth.


"Misunderstanding?" I echoed. "That's not quite the same as admitting you lied, is it?"Lucy's hands were shaking now, and her breathing had become distinctly labored. Karma's quite the bitch, isn't it, dear sister?"I'm sorry," she finally ground out. "I was... mistaken about what I saw."

"And?" I prompted.

"And I shouldn't have spread false rumors." Each word seemed to physically pain her.

"Mr. Lancaster?" I turned to Adam. "Do you accept her apology?"

Adam's expression could have cut diamonds. "Get her out of my sight."

Brian practically lunged forward to help Lucy up. She stumbled against him, her usual grace completely absent.

"This isn't over," she hissed as Brian led her past my chair.

"Oh, I think it is." I smiled serenely. "Unless you'd like to continue this drama? You seem a bit... hot. Perhaps some wine would help?"

She blanched, nearly tripping over her own feet in her haste to leave.


Thomas's wife lingered, clearly torn between following the drama and maintaining her dignity."Well, I never-"

"Exactly," Adam cut her off."You never. Now leave."The room cleared quickly after that, leaving just Adam and me in the oppressive silence.


\---

"Want to explain what really happened?" Adam's voice carried down the dimly lit hallway as we made our way back to the east wing.


I considered my options carefully. "She tried to drug me earlier,"I watched his expression carefully. "Invited me to her room for a 'chat', then offered me some suspiciously special wine."

The muscle in Adam's jaw ticked and the temperature in the hallway seemed to drop several degrees.′′Dug you?"

"Don't worry, I switched our glasses when she wasn't looking."I couldn't help but smile.

"You should have told me immediately." His voice had gone dangerously quiet.

"This time." His hand shot out, catching my wrist and pulling me to face him.′′Ianything had happened to you-"You'd what?" I challenged, pulse racing from his proximity."Defend my reputation?"You'd what?" I challenged, pulse racing from his proximity."Defend my reputation?"recovered."

The casual way he delivered that threat made my breath catch."Mr. Lancaster-"


"You're mine," he stated simply, like it was an immutable fact. "An attack on you is an attack on me."

Yours? My treacherous heart skipped. "How... possessive of you."


His other hand came up to trace my jawline. "You have no idea."


---

Back in the room, I surveyed Adam's suite with carefully hidden apprehension. The massive custom bed dominated the room, specially designed to accommodate his supposed disability.

"I'll take the bed," I announced quickly, diving for the center before he could protest. "You can use the guest room."


′′Myroom," he reminded me, wheeling closer."My rules."

I buried myself deeper in the ridiculously comfortable mattress."Weren't you just defending me downstairs? How ungentlemanly to make your wife sleep elsewhere."

"Who said anything about sleeping elsewhere?"The bathroom door clicked shut behind him, and I heard water running. I had just enough time to process his words before panic set in.

He wouldn't actually... would he?

The bathroom door opened, releasing a cloud of steam. Adam emerged,wearing only silk pajama pants that rode dangerously low on his hips.

My smug smile froze as he approached the bed with predatory grace.

What does him want to do?

The massive custom bed seemed to mock me as I tried to maintain my composure. Adam's presence,fresh from his shower with water still glistening on his bare chest, made the room feel impossibly small.

My eyes darted to his silk pajama pants riding dangerously low on his hips, then quickly away - only to land on something that made my heart stop.

A box of condoms on the nightstand.I immediately regretted my earlier bravado about claiming the bed. Two weeks ago, I'd been adamantly against this arranged marriage. Now here I was, in his bedroom, with him looking at me like...
###Chapter 23

Stella's POV

"Eager to fulfill your wifely duties?" His voice held that dangerous edge that always made my pulse race. He just stopped beside the bed, close enough that I could smell his cologne.


"I'm just tired!" I burrowed deeper into the ridiculously comfortable mattress, turning my back to him. Maybe if I ignored him, he'd leave me alone.

The bed dipped behind me.

His hand caught my wrist before I could retreat, pulling me back until I was practically in his lap. The heat radiating from his bare chest made it impossible to think straight.

"Running away, Mrs. Lancaster?" His thumb traced circles on my inner wrist, sending shivers down my spine.

′′I2m not-" But before I could finish, his lips claimed mine with devastating precision. Unlike our previous kisses, this one held no anger, no power play - just pure, dangerous desire.One of his hands tangled in my hair while the other traced down my spine, leaving traiIs of fire in its wake. A small,embarrassing sound escaped my throat as his teeth grazed my bottom lip.When he deepened the kiss, my mind went completely blank.His tongue swept into my mouth, tasting of expensive scotch and something uniquely him. My hands moved of their own accord, sliding up his chest to his shoulders.

Then I felt his hand slip under the hem of my nightgown.

Oh God. He wants to... The realization hit me like a bucket of ice water. Images of the condoms on the nightstand flashed through my mind.


Panic seized me. In my haste to escape, I practically threw myself backward. My feet tangled in the sheets and I fell on the carpet.

"Escape again, Mrs. Lancaster." His amusement was obvious.

"I'll take the couch!" I scrambled up, trying to salvage what dignity I had left.


He didn't respond, just watched me with those intense green eyes as I settled onto the leather sofa. The light from his laptop cast shadows across his features as he began working on some emails.My mind wandered to Brian's words about Adam's past. A brother, a fire, a psychiatric facility... Could any of it be true?I studied Adam's profile, trying to reconcile the controlled businessman with the dangerous person Brian had described.
"Keep staring and you'll face the consequences." His voice cut through my thoughts without looking up from his screen.

I quickly averted my gaze, but the damage was done. The lingerinng scent of my perfume seemed to agitate him - he shifted restlessly on the bed, unable to get comfortable.



\---

Adam's POV

The soft padding of footsteps caught my attention. I looked up to see Stella emerge from the bathroom,her movements unsteady with exhaustion. The silk nightgown I'd chosen clung to her curves, making something possessive stir in my chest.She hesitated, glancing between the couch and the bed.

Don't you dare, I thought, watching her internal debate play across her face. But of course, she did.


She crawled under the covers, her movements slow and dreamy.The mattress dipped slightly under her weight, and her scent -that maddening mixture of expensive perfume and something uniquely her-enveloped me.Stella." I kept my voice level despite the way my pulse quickened. "What are you doing?"She mumbled something unintelligible, and before I could stop her,she was pressing against my side. Her small body radiated warmth as she nuzzled into my chest, completely oblivious to what she was doing to my self-control.

I went absolutely still. In all my calculations, all my careful plans. I hadn't accounted for this - her soft breath against my skin, the trust in her unconscious movements, the way she fit perfectly against me as if she belonged there.

"Stella." I tried to make it sound like a warning. but my arm was already curving around her of its own accord. "You'll regret your movement in the morning."

She made a small sound of contentment that shot straight through my defenses. My heartbeat betrayed me, picking up speed as she settled more firmly against me. She wasn't supposed to affect me like this.

Against my better judgment, I pulled her closer, my fingers threading through her silk-soft hair. She was already drifting off, her breathing evening out in sleep.

"Troublesome woman." The words came out softer than I intended, almost tender. "What am I going to do with you?"She didn't respond, already lost to dreams. I studied her peaceful face, my mind racing with all the complications this would bring. She trusted me- me, of all people -enough to fall asleep in my arms. The irony wasn't lost on me.Maybe I should get her tonight. But I wanted to protect this moment, this inexplicable peace I felt with her warm weight against me.

Dangerous thoughts. For now, she was here, she was mine,and I would guard her sleep.

She felt impossibly small curled against me, her breath evening out in sleep. The scent of her perfume that had been driving me crazy all night was softer now.mixed with something uniquely her.

I should wake her. Make her move back to the couch. But my arms tightened instinctively when she made a small sound in her sleep.

How could I keep restrain my desire? I even felt her knee rub against my thigh, which was unconscious against my...
###Chapter 24

Adam's POV

I traced the curve of her cheek with my eyes, noting how the moonlight turned her skin almost translucent. As she slept, her lips parted slightly, and her cheeks glowed with a rosy tint,exuding an allure that was undeniably captivating.

My gaze instinctively landed on the condom at the bedside.Can I...


After half a second. I forcefully shut my eyes. No, at least I need her to willingly offer herself to me while she's awake...

I ground my molars, feeling an urge to kick her off the bed.

For the rest of the night, I was almost entirely awake, finally experiencing the sensation of burning desire.

\---

Stella's POV Consciousness returned slowly, accompanied by an overwhelming sense of warmth and security. I was surrounded by an expensive cologne that wasn't my own, and something solid and warm was pressed against my side. My eyes flew open as reality crashed in. This wasn't my room. This wasn't my bed. Anad that most definitely wasn't my pillow I was cuddling.

′′Ohmy God!" I jerked upright, heat flooding my face as I realized I'd spent the night practically wrapped around Adam like some kind of octopus. "You... how did I... why am I..."

"Finally awake?" His voice held that dangerous edge that always made my pulse race. "Sleep well, Mrs. Lancaster?"

I scrambled back, nearly falling off the bed in my haste.′′Iwas supposed to be on the couch! Why didn't you wake me up?"

"And miss this charming morning panic?" His smile was pure predator. "Besides, you seemed quite... comfortable."

The memory of how I must have looked, curled up against him like some touch-starved cat, made me want to crawl under the bed and die. "I was asleep! I didn't know what I was doing!11


"Clearly." His eyes tracked over me lazily, and I suddenly remembered I was still wearing that ridiculous excuse for a nightgown. "Though I have to say, your unconscious self seems much more... honest about what you want." ′′Idon't want anything!" The denial came out too quick,too defensive. "I just... got confused after using the bathroom." "Did you?" He sat up, and I tried very hard not to notice how the morning light played across his bare chest. "So you regularly crawl into strange men's beds when confused?"

"You're not a strange man." I pointed out, then immediately regretted my words when his eyes darkened. "Imean,you're my husband! I mean... oh God, I'm making this worse, aren't I?11


"Much worse." But there was something almost like amusement in his voice. "Now, how do you plan to make up for this... invasion of my personal space?"

I backed away as he leaned closer, my legs tangling in the silk sheets. "It was an accident! I didn't mean to-"


"Intentions," he caught my wrist before I could retreat further,"are irrelevant, Mrs. Lancaster. Results are what matter."


His hands wandered on my body, sending shivers down my spine. "And the result is that you spent the night in my bed,practically begging to be-"

A knock at the door saved me from hearing the end of that sentence. "Mr. Lancaster?" A servant's voice carried through the wood."The family meeting begins in thirty minutes." Adam's grip tightened fractionally before releasing me.′′W711continue this matter later." I fled to the bathroom before he could see my blush, his low chuckle following me all the way.


\---

The Lancaster family hall looked just like I'd expect from wealthy families trying to stay important-full of marble columns and oil paintings, but with a few modern updates to show they weren't entirely old-fashioned.


I pushed Adam's wheelchair down the long gallery of family portraits, noting how the faces grew progressively more severe as we approached the present day.

"Stop." Adam's command came just as we passed an empty space on the wall-a conspicuous gap in the carefully arranged timeline of Lancaster faces.


Before I could ask about it, Brian's voice rang out behind us. "Grandfather, why isn't Grandmother's portrait here? She deserves her place in the family gallery!"


William stepped forward, his face tight with some emotion I couldn't quite read. "Brian, now isn't the time-" "When is the time?" Brian's voice carried that perfect blend of righteousness and hurt. "Father is your eldest son!Grandmother gave everything to this family! Why isn't she honored like everyone else?" "Because she was nothing but a home-wrecking mistress."Adam's voice could have frozen hell itself. "Try to hang that woman's portrait, and I'll personally ensure it burns."

The temperature in the room dropped several degrees. William's face contorted with rage. "You heartless bastard! She was more of a mother to this family than-"


"Than my mother?" Adam's smile was pure venom.′′he woman you married for her money and connections? The one you drove to madness?"

"Your mother," William spat, "was nothing but a cold.calculating-"

"Careful." Adam's voice dropped dangerously low. "You might not like what happens if you finish that sentence."

The tension crackled between them like lightning before a storm. I found myself holding my breath, waiting for the explosion.

God, no wonder Adam's so messed up.

"You ungrateful-" William started, but Adam cut him off with a laugh that held no humor. "Ungrateful?" His eyes glittered with something dangerous."Should I be grateful that you tried to replace my mother with your mistress? That you paraded that woman around while Mother was still alive?"

"She had taken care of you!" William's composure cracked."She tried to be a mother to you, but you-"

"Tried to be a mother?" Adam's voice could have cut glass.By systematically destroying my actual mother's confidence? By whispering poison in your ear about how unstable she was?"


My hand found Adam's shoulder without conscious thought,feeling the tension vibrating through him. He didn't acknowledge the touch, but he didn't shrug it off either.

"That's enough!" William voice cut through the tension.′′T}his is a family meeting,not a circus!"

The rest of the family had arrived, clustering in small groups and pretending they hadn't been eavesdropping on every word.Thomas's smirk suggested he'd particularly enjoyed the show.


I squeezed Adam's shoulder gently, trying to convey...something. Support? Understanding? I wasn't quite sure myself.

As we left the family hall after the meeting, a small boy came tearing around the corner. Before Icould shout a warning,he crashed into Adam's wheelchair.
###Chapter 25

Stella's POV

The impact sent the chair rolling backward toward the marble stairs. My heart stopped as I saw Adam's eyes widen fractionally- the first real expression of surprise I'd ever seen on his face.


In that split second, all I could think was: Not him.Please, not him.


I kicked off my heels and ran. The gravel bit into my bare feet,but I didn't care. All that mattered was catching that chair before it hit the stone steps.

"Almost there..." I stretched out my hands, fingertips just brushing the handles. One more step...

Got it! But physics wasn't on my side. The momentum sent me tumbling,my knees scraping hard against the ground. Paín shot through me, but the only thought in my head was-

"Are you okay? Are you-"Ipushed myself up, ignoring the stinging in my knees as I checked Adam for injuries. His eyes locked onto mine with an intensity that made my breath catch. "Are you crazy?" "Excuse me?" I blinked, thrown by his reaction. ′′Ijust saved you from-"

Before I could finish, his hand shot out and grabbed my wrist,pulling me up with surprising strength. I stumbled forward.catching myself against his chest. For a moment, neither of us moved. I could feel his heart racing under my palm.

"Your knees are bleeding," he said flatly, though his grip on my wrist remained gentle.


"It's nothing," I started to pull back, but his other hand caught my waist, holding me in place.

"Oh my goodness!" A shrill voice broke the moment.′′YOu naughty boy! You could have hurt your Uncle Adam!"


The temperature seemed to drop as Thomas and his wife hurried over, dragging their little son.

"No harm done," Thomas waved dismissively. "Adam's fine,aren't you?"

I felt Adam go perfectly still beneath my hands. That dangerous stillness that always preceded a storm. "Mrs. Lancaster," he said quietly, ignoring the others."Please take a seat." "What? I don't needtO−′′"Sit." The command in his voice brooked no argument. 
I found myself being settled into his wheelchair before I could protest further. His hands lingered on my waist a fraction longer than necessary.


What happened next was both terrifying and oddly satisfying.

Adam. supposedly disabled, executed a perfect turn of the wheelchair. "Oh dear," his voice dripped false concern as the chair surged forward. "It seems to be malfunctioning."


The wheelchair clipped Thomas's wife's legs, sending her sprawling into a rosebush. Thomas, rushing to help her,somehow ended up with a bloody nose from the wheelchair's back support.

"My sincerest apologies," Adam's smile could have frozen hell."These mechanical devices can be so unpredictable. Much like children on scooters."


Everyone suddenly remembered urgent appointments elsewhere.

\---

"This is ridiculous." I squirmed as Adam's fingers traced over my bandaged knee. "It's just a scrape!" "Several deep lacerations," the family doctor corrected."You'll need to stay off these feet." "See′!I shot Adam a look. "Just rest. I don't need-" "Use my wheel." Adam's tone meant business. Then his eyes locked onto mine, and something in them made my breath catch. "Unless you'd prefer I carry you everywhere?"

My face heated at the thought."I can walk-"

The words died as he simply scooped me up. one arm under my knees and the other around my back. I grabbed his shoulders. startled by both the sudden movement and how...right it felt.

"Mr. Lancaster!" My voice came out embarrassingly squeaky."What are you-"


"Since you insist on being difficult." He settled me into what had to be the fanciest wheelchair ever mmade.


His hands lingered longer than necessary, sending little sparks of electricity everywhere he touched. "Stay put."

"Or what?" The challenge slipped out before I could stop it.

His eyes darkened as he leaned close- way too close. "Test me and find out." My heart did a weird flip. "Is that supposed to be threatening?Because you're not as scary as you think." i′NO′?′′His thumb traced my jawline, making it really hard to remember why I was arguing. "Then why is your pulse racing?" Because-"I swallowed hard as his other hand found my waist. "Because you're in my personal space!"

His laugh rumbled through his chest. "Your personal space?"His lips brushed my ear. "Mrs. Lancaster, I don't think you understand how this works. You're mine now. Everything about you is my personal space."

Before I could come up with a response that wasn't just incoherent sputtering, he straightened up.

"Taylor." His voice carried that dangerous edge again.′′Mrs.Lancaster needs a reminder about following medical advice."

Taylor's lips twitched."Yes,sir."

"I don't need a wheelchair!" But my protests fell on deaf ears as Adam took control, steering me through the manor.

Joseph appeared, concern breaking through his professional mask. "Mrs. Lancaster! Are you alright?"

"She needs rest." Adam's hands tightened on the wheelchair handles. "And that bone broth you make."

"Of course, sir." Joseph nodded."Right away." "And Joseph?" Adam's voice dropped low. "Make sure she actually stays in bed these days." I waited until Adam left before turning to Joseph. "Come on this is crazy! It's just a scraped knee!"

"The doctor's orders were quite clear." Joseph's eyes held genuine worry.


I just recalled seeing the sparkling drink with lemon slices on the island before entering the room. "Could you please bring me that jug of drink to my room, please?"I perked up." Maybe I can sleep well after drinking it."

Something like amusement crossed Joseph's face. "Of course,Mrs. Lancaster."

As he left, I couldn't help touching my jaw where Adam's fingers had been. The memory of his touch still burned, along with that look in his eyes when he'd seen me hurt...


But my treacherous mind kept replaying how quickly he'd moved to defend me, how gentle his hands had been checking my injuries, the way his heart had raced when he held me...

"Your drink, Mrs. Lancaster."

I grabbed the glass maybe a bit too eagerly, trying to focus on the drink.
###Chapter 26

Stella's POV

I stretched out my legs carefully, mindful of my bandaged knees as I settled onto the plush rug. The drink Joseph had brought looked absolutely divine- amber liquid garnished with fresh lemon slices and crushed mint.


"More ice, Mrs. Lancaster?" The younger maid, hovered nearby with obvious concern.


"This is perfect." I took another sip, savoring the complex blend of flavors.


"It's working." I smiled, already feeling a pleasant warmth spreading through my limbs. The tension from earlier-the accident, Adam's intense reaction, that moment in the wheelchair-began to fade into a soft blur.

The maids exchanged glances as I reached for the pitcher to refill my glass. "Mrs. Lancaster, perhaps you should rest..."

′′Iam resting." I gestured to my reclined position."Very comfortably, I might add."

By the time I'd finished half the pitcher, the room had taken on a dreamy quality. The crystal chandelier sparkled like stars,and even my injuries felt pleasantly distant. "I should probably shower," I announced to no one in particular. pulling myself up using the sottee for support. The silk nightgown I'd grabbed fet impossibly soft against my skin."A nice hot bath sounds amazing right now."


"Mrs. Lancaster!" Both maids stepped forward as I swayed slightly. "Let us help you-"


"I'm fine!" I waved them off, making my way to the en-suite bathroom with only minor assistance from the furniture. "Just going to sonk another knee a bit. Doctor's orders. right?"

\---

Adam's POV

The mahogany grandfather clock in my study chimed seven.pulling my attention from the quarterly reports. Dinner would be served soon.


Joseph appeared in the doorway. "Sir. dinner is served."
 
"Where is my wife?" "Mrs. Lancaster is resting in her room." Joseph's professional mask slipped slightly. "She seemed... quite relaxed when I last checked." Relaxed. Coming from Joseph. that word carried volumes of meuning. I made my way to her room, noting the unusual quiet. No sound of running water. no movement behind the heavy oak door.


"Stella?" I knocked sharply. No response.

The door was unlocked. Inside, the first thing that hit me was the smell - sweet and citrusy, with an unmistakable undertone of alcohol.

A half-empty crystal pitcher sat abandoned on the carpet.Beside it, a tumbler still held traces of what looked like an innocent enough drink.

But the scent... Long Island Iced Tea. Someone had served my injured wife-one of the most deceptively potent cocktails possible.

A splash and muffled thud from the bathroom broke through my rising anger.

"Stella?" I crossed the room. Still no answer.

The bathroom door was locked, but that hadn't stopped me before. One sharp kick near the handle, and the antique wood gave way. Steam billowed out, thick enough to momentarily obscure my vision. When it cleared, my heart nearly stopped. Stella was submerged in the massive marble tub, the crystal-clear water doing little to conceal her slender form. The steam had left a rosy flush across her delicate collarbones, and droplets traced tempting paths down the graceful curve of her throat.


Her perfectly proportioned figure - the swell of her breasts just breaking the water's surface, the elegant arch of her waist disappearing beneath- was enough to make any man forget how to breathe. Her injured leg was propped awkwardly on the rim, the bandages soaked through, while her eyes remained closed, lips parted slightly in peaceful abandon.

Focus, damn it. She was drunk, injured, and potentially in danger. This wasn't the time to let base desires cloud my judgment, no matter how tempting she looked.

"Stella!" I reached into the water without hesitation, pulling her up against my chest. Her skin was flushed from the heat,droplets running down her bare shoulders.

Her eyes fluttered open, unfocused but somehow still managing to look annoyed. "I was relaxing," she protested as I wrapped her in a thick towel. "Joseph!" My voice carried enough command to bring him running. "Get the doctor. Now." "I'm fine," Stella mumbled against my shoulder. "Just a little... 
floaty."

The towel was already soaked through, clinging to curves I was trying very hard not to notice. "You ,come in!" I called for a maid. "Bring me one of my shirts. Now."

"Your... shirt?" Stella's brow furrowed adorably in confusion.

I ignored the way my pulse jumped at the thought of her in my clothes. "You need something dry."

The maid appeared with impressive speed, a crisp white shirt in hand. "Sir,should I...?"

"Help Mrs. Lancaster change." I reluctantly transferred Stella to the maid's care. "I'll wait outside."


Stella's voice drifted through the door as the maid helped her dress. "Everything's spinning... bu like, in a nice way?"

I pressed my fingers to the bridge of my nose, torn between concern and an inexplicable urge to laugh. Of course she'd be a chatty drunk. "Ready, sir." The maid opened the door, revealing Stella perched on the edge of the bed. My shirt swallowed her small frame,falling to mid-thigh. Something possessive stirred in my chest at the sight and my cock was somewhat hard. The doctor arrived moments later, checking the state of her knees. The gauze was unwrapped, revealing a gruesome wound beneath. The flesh, after being soaked in water, had turned a ghastly white, appearing even worse than before.

The doctor said. "The bandages are ruined. We'll need to clean and rewrap these."

"No!" Stella tried to pull away as he reached for her leg. "Hurts!、


"Stella." I caught her hands before she could swat at the doctor."Let him work."


She turned those huge eyes on me, glazed with alcohol but still somehow deadly effective. As she spoke, she curled her legs inward, her body gradually collapsing into my embrace with the movement. "But it hurts."

"I know." I found myself speaking more gently than I had in years. "Just for a minute."

She had such a delicate side that I had not seen before. Maybe I should get tot know her more. Of course,she is my wife now.
###Chapter 27

Adam's POV

"No more treatment!" Stella's voice carried that dfstinctive whine of the thoroughly intoxicated as she tried to squiEm1away from the doctor. My oversized dress shirt rode up dangerously high on her thighs with each movement.

I caught her just before she could tumble off the bed.pulling her back against my chest. The scent of her perfume mixed with alcohol wapped around me. oddly intoxicating.

"Stay still." I tried to keep my voice stern dospite how distracting it was having her pressed against me like this. She looked impossibly fragile like this, all huge eyes and flushed cheeks.


"Don't wanna." She burrowed deeper into my chest, then let out a small whimper of pain that made something in my chest tighten. "You said it wouldn't hurt!"

"Mrs. Lancaster," the doctor's professional tone carried barely concealed frustration, "if you'd just hold still-" "No!" She buried her face in my shirt, her breath hot against my skin. "Make him stop please!" I tightened my grip instinctively as she tried to wiggle free. "The sooner you let him finish, the sooner it's over," One small finger poked accusingly at my chest. "You can't tell me what to do! You're not my man!"

"Actually." I couldn't help the dangerous edge that crept into my voice, "as your husband. I am."

She pulled back just enough to glare up at me with those impossibly big eyes. The effect was more adorable than intimidating. "Husband? Ha! You're just a... a bossy meanie!"

Something dangerously close to amusement tugged at my lips. "A bossy meanie?"

"Yes!" She nodded emphatically, then immediately winced."The bossiest,meaniest-OW!"

The doctor had taken advantage of her distraction to clean one of the deeper cuts. Tears sprang to her eyes, and something protective and violent surged through me.

"Careful." I didn't recognize my own voice, but the doctor's hands froze instantly. "Unless you want to be fired."

"I apologize, Mr. Lancaster." His hands became noticeably gentler. "But these cuts need proper cleaning to prevent infection." A small sniffle drew my attention back to the woman in my arms. Before I could think better of it, my hand came up to stroke her hair. She leaned into the touch like a content cat. "Stella." I softened my voice, trying a different approach. "Let's make a deal. Be good for the doctor, and I'll buy you a bag you like."

She considered this with adorable seriousness, her bottom lip caught between her teeth. "Don't want a bag."

"No?"I let my thumb trace circles on her hip, noting how her breath caught slightly. "What do you want then?"

Her face lit up. "Want that sparkly drink! With lots of ice!"

My jaw clenched. The last thing she needed was more alcohol."Absolutely not. You've had enough to drink."

"Then I won't cooperate!" She tried to cross her arms but mostly just tangled herself further in my shirt. The sight of her wearing my clothes did dangerous things to my self-control."No drink, no deal!"


I studied her for a long moment, weighing my options. She stared back with surprising stubbornness for someone who could barely sit straight.′′One glass. After the doctor finishes."

"With ice?"

"Yes, with ice." "Promíse?" She stuck out her pinky finger with exaggerated solemnity. The gesture was so unexpectedly childlike that I had to fight back a smile as I linked my pinky with hers. "Promise."

Satisfied, she settled back against my chest, her eyes heavy-lidded as she watched the doctor resume work. The trust in that simple action did something strange to my chest.

"You smell nice," she announced suddenly, nuzzling into my neck. "You're staring," she stared at me with her big eyes.

"You're drunk."

"Mm. Maybe." Her thumb traced absent patterns on my palm."Your hands are nice. Strong. Safe. Like when you grabbed me in the car that time..."

Something in my chest tightened at her words. She wouldn't remember any of this tomorrow, but I would. Every unguarded moment, every soft confession.

My breath caught as her lips brushed my skin. "Stella..."

Her fingers traced my jawline with surprising delicacy."Can I kiss you?" Before I could process that dangerous question, she pushed herself up and pressed her lips to mine. For one heart-stopping moment, I froze, caught off guard by her boldness. Then her small sound of contentment broke my control. My hand tangled in her hair as I deepened the kiss, claiming her mouth with a possessiveness that surprised even me.

When we finally broke apart, her lips were swollen and her eyes were glazed with something besides alcohol. The sight sent heat pooling in my stomach.

"Doctor." I barely recognized my own voice. "Are you finished?"

"Yes, Mr. Lancaster. Just keep the bandages clean and-"

"Out." I couldn't take my eyes off Stella. "Everyone out."

As the staff filed out, she waved cheerfully. "Bye bye! Thanks for the band-aids!"


The door clicked shut, leaving us alone. Her skin felt impossibly soft under my hands, the thin fabric of my shirt doing nothing to hide her curves.


"You should go too." Her attempt at a stern tone was ruined by how she was practically purring as I held her hip. "This is my room now." ′′Isit?" I couldn't resist tracing her bottom lip with my thumb,still slightly swollen from our kiss. "And what makes you think I'm going anywhere after that little performance?" "What performance?" She blinked up at me with exaggerated innocence.21Ijust wanted to kiss a pretty man." Something dark and possessive surged through me at her words. "Stella." I watched her shiver at how I said her name."You're playing with fire."

"Am not." She snuggled deeper into the bed, wrapping herself in my sheets like she belonged there. The sight was oddly satisfying. " I just stating facts. You're pretty and you smell good and-"

I cut her off with my mouth, unable to resist any longer. I leaned on her to kiss her, teasing her tongue in a wet, hot kiss.She melted into the kiss immediately, making those small groans that drove me crazy. I kissed her like I wanted to devour her, marking her as mine.
###Chapter 28

Adam's POV

Her lips were soft and pliant, tasting of expensive alcohol and something uniquely her. This wasn't like our previous kisses-this was pure, unrestrained need.


"Mrs. Lancaster." My voice came out rougher than intended.betraying how badly I wanted her. "I want you. Now."


She tried to respond. but I was already capturing her mouth again,swallowing whatever protest she might have made. Her fingers tangled in my hair as I deepened the kiss. drawing a small sound from her throat that sent heat pooling in my stomach. The feeling of her pressed against me. wearing nothing but my shirt. was driving me insane.


When I finally pulled back, she sagged against my chest.her breathing ragged. The flush across her cheeks and the way she swayed slightly reminded me she was still drunk. but that knowledge did nothing to calm my racing pulse. My hands slid lower of their own accord, tracing the curves of her breasts I'd been trying so hard to ignore. Another kiss.deeper this time, had her sinking into the mattress beneath me.The sight of her there, dark hair spread across the pillows.tested what remained of my self-control."Wait-" She gasped as I found that sensitive spot below her ear. But her protest died as I grazed the skin with my teeth,drawing another of those addictive little sounds fromn her.

I shifted, trying to ease the growing ache in my groin, but the movement pressed me harder against her thigh. Her eyes went wide,and in her drunken state, she blurted out, "Your cock is digging into my leg!"

I froze for a fraction of a second before a dark laugh escaped me. The innocent way she'd said it, like she was complaining about the weather... "And whose fault is that?"


"'M sleepy," she mumbled, pushing ineffectively at my chest.Her eyes were already starting to drift closed. "Let me sleep..."

"Fuck." A string of curses escaped me as I forced myself to pull away. I scooped her up in my arms and carried her outside as I noticed that the bed was wet, making it impossible to sleep there any longer.

"What-"She squirmed in my grip, nearly making me lose my balance."Put me down!"


"Stop squirming." I tried to make my voice threatening, but it came out gentler than intended. "Or I will fuck you tonight."

"You wouldn't." But she stilled anyway, her small body fitting perfectly against my chest.

"Try again." I felt my voice rumble through my chest where she was pressed against me. "One more wiggle and we'll find out if you can handle my size."

I carried her into my bedroom, hyper-aware of every point where her body touched mine. The king-sized bed seemed to mock me as I deposited her carefully onto sheets.

"Don't move." I needed her to stay put while I got myself under control. The bathroom called like salvation - I needed a very cold shower.

\---

By the time I stepped out of the shower, her breathing had already evened out into sleep. Damn it all to hell.

But my body still thrumming with need despite the cold water.The sight that greeted me nearly broke what remained of my self-control.

Stella lay sprawled across my bed like she belonged there, my shirt riding dangerously high on her thighs. Her hair fanned out across my pillows, and her lips - still swollen from my kisses- were parted slightly in sleep. "Damn it." I ran a hand through my damp hair, torn between frustration and an inexplicable urge to touch her. A small sound escaped her as she shifted, unconsciously seeking warmth. Before I could stop myself, I was sliding into bed beside her. She immediately curled into me like a heat-seeking missile.

"Sam..." she mumbled, nuzzling into my chest. "Sleep time..."

Something hot and possessive surged through me. "Mrs.Lancaster." I caught her wandering hands before they could travel lower. "Look at who I am."


She made a small sound of protest as I trapped her hands above her head. "Stop moving."

Her leg hooked over mine, bringing our bodies flush together.The thin fabric of my shirt did nothing to hide her sexy curves."Or what?"


The innocent question, delivered in that sleep-rough voice,nearly snapped my control. "Or I will enter your body.”

Another wiggle had me gritting my teeth. One more movement like that and I wouldn't be responsible for my actions.′′I7going to take another shower."

This time, the water was ice cold.


\--- Stella's POV Consciousness returned slowly, accompanied by a pounding headache and an overwhelming sense of disorientation. This wasn't my room. These weren't my sheets. And this definitely wasn't my shirt.

"Good morning, Mrs. Lancaster."

I bolted upright, immediately regretting the sudden movement as my head protested violently. Adam stood in the bathroom doorway, watching me with dangerous amusement.

"Why am I in your room?" My voice came out embarrassingly squeaky. "And wearing your... clothes?"

"You don't remember?" His smile held a predatory edge that made my pulse jump. "You were quite... enthusiastic last night.11


Horror dawned as fragments of memory surfaced. The "lemonade" that had tasted oddly strong. The bath. The kiss.Oh God, the kiss.

"That drink..." I pressed my fingers to my temples, willing the room to stop spinning. "It wasn't just lemonade, was it?" "First time I've seen anyone mistakse it for lemonade." He moved closer, and I became acutely aware of how high his shirt had ridden up on my thighs. "Though I have to admit,drunk you is... entertaining." More memories hit me like a freight train. Had I really told him he smelled nice? Had I actually kissed him first?"Did we... I instantly pulled open my shirt to take a look, relieved to find no other kiss marks and let out a heavy sigh.


As soon as I made this move, regret washed over me, and when I looked up, I caught Adam's eyes fixed on me with a bemused expression.

Was that bastard mocking me?

Isn't it perfectly normal to check myself after a blackout?

"No." Something dark flashed in his eyes. "Though not for lack of trying on your part."

Heat flooded my face as another memory surfaced - of his hands on my waist, his mouth on mine, the way I'd melted into him like ice cream on a hot day.


"Ishould go." I shifted slightly, trying to get out of bed, but as soon as I put weight on my knee, a sharp pain shot through me. The room tilted alarmingly.

Strong hands caught me before I could face-plant onto his obscenely expensive carpet. "Careful, Mrs. Lancaster." His breath ghosted across my ear, sending shivers down my spine."We wouldn't want a repeat of last night's injuries."

The way he said"Jast night" made heat pool in my stomach. How much exactly did I do while drunk?

"Though," I could feel the heat fro his hand where he steadied me holding my hip, "if you're planning another performance like last night's kiss. I might be persuaded to catch you again."

Oh God. I definitely kissed him first. "I was drunk!"

"Mmm." His other hand came up to trace my jawline. "And now you're not."

The look in his eyes made my breath catch. "Mr. Lancaster..."

"Yes?" His thumb brushed my bottom lip, as he put me on the bed and climbed over me, his larger frame enveloping mine and my treacherous body swayed toward him like a flower seeking sun.

What am I doing now? Do I like this bastard? I didn't hate his touch instead expect.
###Chapter 29

Stella's POV
"Mr. Lancaster..." I shifted uncomfortably on the bed.′′need to..."


His eyebrow rose as he studied my squirming.'′YS?′′

"The bathroom," I finally managed, mortified. "I can't really walk with these knees."

A dangerous smile curved his lips. "And?"

"And..." I gritted my teeth. "I need help getting there."

Without warning, he scooped me up like I weighed nothing.The sudden movement sent my heart racing, though whether from surprise or something else, I refused to examine too closely.


"Don't squirm." His voice held that commanding edge that always made my pulse jump."Or I am not sure what will happen later." Last night. The memories hit me like a tidal wave-my drunk self's boldness, the way I'd practically thrown myself at him.those kisses that had made me forget my own name... "Stop thinking so hard." His thumb traced circles on my hip as he carried me to the bathroom. "You'll give yourself a headache. "I'm not-" But the protest died as he set me down with surprising gentleness.

"Can you manage from here?" His eyes held an unfamiliar warmth. "Or do you need more...assistance?"

Heat flooded my face. "I can manage!"

His laugh rumbled through his chest. "Is Mrs. Lancaster being shy?"

"You're my husband," I shot back with more bravado than I felt. "What do I have to be shy about?"

Wrong thing to say. His eyes darkened as he stepped closer,backing me against the mnarble counter. "Careful, Mrs.Lancaster. That almost sounds like an invitation."


My heart did that annoying little skip it always did when he got too close. "I didn't mean-" ′′NO?′′His fingers traced my jawline, making it really hard to remember what I was protesting. "Then maybe you should be more careful with your words." "Maybe you should stop being so..." I gestured vaguely at all of him. "So what?" His smile was pure predator. "Handsome? Charming? Irresistible?"

"Insufferable!" But even I could hear the breathlessness in my voice.


"Yet you couldn't resist kissing me last night." His thumb brushed my bottom lip, making me shiver. "Multiple times. if I recall correctly."

"1was drunk!" The memory of my boldness made me want to crawl under the sink and die.


"Was it?" He leaned closer, his cologne making it impossible to think straight. "Should I help you recall it?"

Before I could come up with a coherent response, he pulled back with that infuriating smirk. "Take care of your needs, Mrs.Lancaster. I'll wait outside."


The door clicked shut behind him, leaving me alone with my mortification and racing heart.

--- "Make sure Mrs. Lancaster doesn't attempt any more drunken adventures." Adam's voice carried through the bedroom door as he prepared to leave for his morning meetings. "And change her bandages every four hours." 
 "Of course, sir." Joseph's voice held barely concealed amusement. "Shall I have the maids prepare Mrs. Lancaster's room?"


"No need." Adam's tone brooked no argument.′′Mywife will be staying in my room."


The emphasis he put on "my wife" sent an inexplicable shiver down my spine.


"Very good. sir." Was that a hint of approval in Joseph's voice?"And regarding last night's... incident?"

I buried my face in the pillows, wishing the earth would open up and swallow me whole. The entire staff had witnessed my embarrassing behavior?


"It doesn't matter." Was that actual fondness in Adam's voice?

Kill me now.

After Adam left my room, I could heard some whisper outside.

"Oh yes!" A younger maid couldn't contain her giggling. "And when she refused the expensive bag offer because she wanted more of that 'sparkly drink' instead!" "The same drink that led to her falling asleep in the bathtub?"The older maid's voice carried motherly disapproval. My entire body felt like it was combusting from embarrassment, I'd fallen asleep in the bath? And Adam had found me there?"Though the cutest part," the young maid continued, oblivious to my silent prayers for death, "was when she wouldn't let the doctor treat her unless Mr. Lancaster held her hand!"


That's it. I'm never leaving this room again.

\---

"You can't hide in here forever." Sam's voice carried clearly through the phone. "Though I have to say, drunk you sounds hilarious."


"Not helping." I buried deeper into the absurdly comfortable mattress that still smelled like Adam's cologne. ′′Imade a complete fool of myself!"

"Please. From what I hear, you finally showed some genuine interest in your husband. About time, if you ask me."

"I did not-"

"Oh really?" I could practically hear her smirk. "So you didn't kiss him first? Or tell him his muscles were-"

"Can we please talk about something else?" I interrupted desperately. "Like, I don't know, the weather?" "Fine," Her tone turned serious. "But you might want to hear this-two of Thomas's strongest supporters just got hit hard. mysterious funding issues in the Cayman Islands."

That caught my attention. "GT Group?"

"It seemed to be." She paused meaningfully. But I could not consider the reason why GT Group would target at Thomas.

Before I could process that news. Taylor appeared in the doorway. "Mrs. Lancaster? Mr. Lancaster asked me to inform you he'll be leaving for London tonight. Business at the UK branch requires his immediate attention."


The relief that flooded through me was probably inappropriate for a wife hearing her husband would be away. But at least now I could leave this room without dying of embarrassment.

"It's fine," I told myself as I finally ventured out of the suite. "We're married. Married people do... married things. Nothing to be embarrassed about."


But my treacherous mind kept replaying the feeling of his lips on mine, how safe I'd felt in his arms...

Stop it, I told my racing heart. It doesn't mean anything.

\--- Adam's POV The quarterly reports from London demanded immediate attention, but my mind kept wandering to more... distracting matters-all was Stella.

"Mr. Lancaster?" Taylor's voice broke through my thoughts."Your mother's doctor is on line one."


Mother. The word hit like ice water. After five years of carefully maintained fiction, why was she suddenly demanding to meet Stella?


′′PLut him through." I kept my voice controlled despite the anger simmering beneath the surface.

The doctor's words confirmed my suspicions - someone had deliberately ensured news of my marriage would reach Mother's facility. Someone who wanted to destabilize her carefully managed condition.

"Mr. Lancaster?" The doctor's voice carried barely concealed worry."She's quite insistent about meeting your... wife."

Wife. The word still felt strange on my tongue.

"Tell her we'll visit when Mrs. Lancaster's injuries have healed."The memory of Stella's scraped knees made something dark twist in my chest. "And find out who's been feeding her information." As I prepared for the London trip, my eyes kept straying to the bed where Stella had spent the night. The sight of her curled up in  my sheets, wearing my clothes, had done dangerous things to my self-control.

"Your flight is ready, sir." Taylor's voice pulled me back to reality. "Shall I have the car brought around?"

I nodded, gathering the last of my papers. Part of me-a larger part than I cared to admit - was reluctant to leave while Stella was still recovering.

Besides, I had other matters to attend to. Like ensuring Thomas and his supporters understood exactly what happened to those who threatened what was mine.
###Chapter 30

Stella's POV

A few days after Adam's departure.

My phone buzzed with a calendar reminder: GT Group Fashion Director Interview - 9:00 AM. My knees still ached from the recent injuries, but the opportunity was too important to pass up.

"Mrs. Lancaster, you can go out." Joseph's disapproving voice carried across the breakfast room. "The doctor specifically advised rest for at least three more days."


I adjusted my dress, making sure it fell perfectly. "Some things are worth the risk, Joseph."

His expression suggested he strongly disagreed, but he knew better than to argue.′′Aleast allow me to arrange the car."

"No need." I checked my reflection one last time. The dress was perfect -professional enough for a fashion director interview."I'll take a cab."

"Mr. Lancaster won't be pleased." I couldn't help but smile. "Mr. Lancaster is in London. He won't know." The GT Group headquarters dominated the Manhattan skyline.The marble lobby echoed with clicking heels and purposeful footsteps as I made my way to the elevator.

"Floor?" The security guard asked after checking my interview pass.

"Twenty-eighth floor, for an interview."

The testing room was already filled with candidates when I arrived - at least a hundred people vying for one position. The air practically crackled with nervous energy.

"First round will be a written examination," the HR manager announced. "You have ninety minutes."

I scanned the questions, letting a small smile play across my lips. Luxury brand history, international fashion trends, brand image development-this was my territory.


Two hours later, my hand cramped from writing, but satisfaction hummed through my veins. I knew these answers.

"Time's up!"

I handed in my paper with quiet confidence. Around me, other candidates were still frantically scribbling. The results came faster than expected.′′The following twenty-nine candidates have qualified for the second round..." My name was among the first called if they only knew.

Adam's POV

The documents blurred before my eyes as I reviewed the latest revisions. Something about the numbers wasn't adding up,but my mind kept wandering to how Stella had looked that morning, curled up in my sheets, her hair spread across my pillowS...

"Sir." Taylor's voice interrupted my dangerous train of thought."There's something you should see."

I didn't look up. "Unless it's the London merger documents, it can wait."


"It's about Mrs. Lancaster."

My fingers stilled over the keyboard as a mix of concern and irritation stirred in my chest. "What about her?"

He handed me his phone, and my jaw clenched as I scrolled through the employee chat photos. There she was, looking impossibly elegant in a pale blue dress,clearly participating in the Fashion Director interviews. "She's supposed to be on bed rest." The words came out in a dangerous growl. The sight of her standing on those injured knees made something protective and violent stir in mny chest.

But beneath the anger was something else - reluctant admiration for her determination. Of course she wouldn't let her injuries stop her. When had Stella ever backed down from a challenge?


"The interview is nearly finished." Taylor offered carefully."Should I have someone escort her up?"


"No." I leaned back. plans already forming. Let her finish what she started. "Have another secretary bring her up after the results are announced. And Taylor?"


"Sir?"

"Get every brand of sparkling water you can find. Imported only."


He hesitated.′′Sir?′′

I felt my lips curve into a smile that would have sent lesser men running. "Hearing problems, Taylor?"

"Right away,sir."

As his footsteps faded, I found myself studying the photos again. The determined set of her jaw, the perfect posture despite her injuries, the fire in her eyes that had drawn me from the start.
My troublesome wife clearly needed a reminder about following medical advice. Though something told me she knew exactly what she was risking - and had decided it was worth it anyway.

\---

Stella's POV

The fashion studio for the practical test was a designer's. Each finalist was assigned a station and given their challenge: Create three complete looks for a luxury brand's spring campaign.

I moved through the racks with practiced efficiency,my trained eye immediately cataloging possibilities. A whispered conversation from nearby caught my attention:

"That's her-the one in the blue dress!"

"She looks more like a model than a stylist..."

"I heard she finished the written test in record time..."

I kept my expression neutral as I selected pieces. Let them talk.I was here to prove myself. The looks came together exactly as I'd envisioned - modern sophistication with subtle edge, perfect for the target demographic. My presentation was concise and professional,emphasizing market positioning and brand DNA. Just as I finished, a sleek woman in a designer suit appeared."Mrs. Lancaster? The CEO would like to see you."

The room went dead silent. I kept my voice carefully neutral."I'm afraid there must be some mistake. I don't know your CEO.11


"Mr. Lancaster specifically requested your presence." Her smile didn't reach her eyes. "Thirty-eighth floor."

Lancaster? My heart skipped a beat. Is him Adam? No,it is impossible. He was supposed to be a normal manager in The Lancaster Group.
###Chapter 31

Stella's POV

"Please wait here. Miss Winston." The secretary gestured to an imposing office door on the 38th floor. "The CEO had an urgent meeting, but he'll be with you shortly."

I hesitated at the threshold. GT Group's CEO was notoriously private-few claimed to know his true identity. The fact that he wanted to meet me personally after a preliminary interview was...unusual.

"I'll have refreshments brought up," the secretary added with a professional smile that didn't quite reach her eyes.

The office that greeted me was a statement in power and understated wealth. The massive desk seemed to dwarf the rest of the room, its surface cleared except for a sleek laptop and a single fountain pen.


I moved to the window, careful not to put too much pressure on my still-healing knees. The afternoon sun caught the edges of nearby skyscrapers. My phone buzzed with an HR notification:′′Congratulations on advancing to the final round. Please return in three days, same time and location, for your interview with the executive team."Before I could process this development, voices approached from the hallway.

"Mr. Lancaster, regarding the Australian energy cooperation project-" A man's voice, crisp and deferential.

Lancaster? My head snapped up just as the office door opened.

"The numbers don't add up." That voice - so familiar it made my pulse skip - cut through the conversation like a blade. "Have them recalculate and-"

Adam stopped mid-sentence as our eyes met. For a moment,neither of us moved.


"Mr.Lancaster?" The CFO glanced between us, clearly confused by his boss's sudden silence.

The door opened, and there he was-Adam Lancaster,looking every inch the corporate shark in a perfectly tailored Tom Ford suit. Our eyes met, and for a moment, neither of us moved.

"Clear my schedule," he commanded without breaking eye contact. "Everyone out." The executives filed out quickly, though not before I caught their curious glances. The CFO in particular seemed to be doing some rapid mental calculations as he studied my presence in his boss's office. The door clicked shut, leaving us alone in the vast space "You're... GT Group's CEO?" The words came out barely above a whisper.

His smile was pure predator. "Surprise, Mrs. Lancaster."

Well,shit.

Adam moved toward me with that always made my skin tingle."And you're supposed to be on bed rest."

"I didn't know-" But the pieces were suddenly falling into place. Morgan's deferential treatment. The Lancaster Manor's obscene luxury. Mark Anderson's careful respect. How had I missed this?


"Clearly." His eyes dropped to my knees, and something dangerous flickered in their depths. "Since you're still determined to disobey doctor's orders."

"The interview was important." I lifted my chin, refusing to be cowed. "And I passed, by the way."

"Did you?" His mouth curved into that infuriating smirk as he invaded my personal space. "And what makes you think the CEO's wife needs to interview for anything?"  "Because I earned it!" The words came out sharper than intended."]∘m not going to use our... arrangement for professional gain." Something shifted in his expression - approval? Amusement? "
Even don't care who I am?"

"Yes." I met his gaze steadily. "I won't give anyone reason to question my capabilities."

"No?" His hand came up to trace my jawline, making it really hard to maintain my demeanor. "Not your husband could give you anything you want."

"Mr. Lancaster." I tried to sound stern despite how his proximity made my pulse race. "I'm here as a candidate, not your wife."

His laugh rumbled through his chest. "Are you sure about that,Mrs.Lancaster?"


Before I could respond, a knock interrupted us.

"Enter." Adam's voice carried that edge of command.

Taylor appeared, carrying a tray laden with what looked like every premium sparkling water brand in existence. "As requested,sir."


I couldn't help but laugh. "Really? Is this your idea of punishment?"

"Consider it a reminder." Adam's smile held equal parts threat and amusement. "Since you seem to have trouble distinguishing beverages."

I caught whispers from passing employees:

"Did you see her?"

"The CEO's woman..."

"He's never shown such consideration..."

"Your shoes." Adam's voice cut through my mortification."Take them off."

"Excuse me?"

But he was already kneeling again, replacing my heels with what had to be the most comfortable ballet flats I'd ever seen. "These will be easier on your knees."

"I don't need-"

"You are my wife." The way he said this words sent shivers down my spine. "For once in your life. accept the help."

I tried the sparkling water to hide my confusion at this gentler side of him. The fizzy sweetness was perfect-exactly what I'd been craving since that night. "Taylor will drive you home." His tone left no room for argument.′′′Γynot to start any revolutions on the way." "Of course, sir," Taylor's professional mask didn't slip, but l swore I caught a hint of amusement in his eyes.

"Mrs. Lancaster." His voice stopped me at the door. "Three days."

I turned. confused."What?"

His smile was pure predator. "Your final interview. Don't be late."


\---

Adam's POV

The office felt strangely empty after she left, though her scent -that maddening mix of expensive perfume and something uniquely her- lingered in the air. My eyes fell on the array of sparkling waters Taylor had brought, noting which bottle she'd chosen.


With a mixture of curiosity and something dangerously close to fondness, I picked up the same brand. The taste was cloyingly sweet.

Troublesome woman. Even her choice in beverages was complicated.

"The female market segment does show promising profit margins," I muttered, trying to justify my inexplicable urge to understand her choices.The laptop screen still displayed her interview results-top scores across every category. Of course she'd excel. When had Stella ever done anything less?


My phone buzzed with a message from the CFO: "Sir, about the Australian project..."

Work. Right. I had a multinational corporation to run,merger deals to negotiate, competitors to crush. I couldn't spend all day thinking about my wife's infuriating determination to prove herself.

But as I turned back to the endless stream of reports and meetings, I found myself smiling. She hadn't even considered using our marriage to her advantage. My troublesome wife,always insisting on doing things her way.

The sparkling water's sweetness lingered on my tongue, much like the memory of her surprised expression when she'd realized who I was. How many more layers of her were still waiting to be discovered?


"Sir?" Taylor's voice interrupted my dangerous train of thought."The board is waiting."

Right. CEO mode. But first... "Taylor, make sure every floor has a supply of that brand she chose."

"The overly sweet one, sir?""All of them." My smile probably sent chills down his spine."My wife might need... She may work there soon."
###Chapter 32

Stella's POV

The setting sun cast long shadows through the study windows as I pored over fashion industry reports. Three days until the final interview. Despite Adam's position. I was determined to earn this on my own merit.

"Mrs. Lancaster." Joseph's voice interrupted my concentration. "
Mr. Lancaster has returned."

I looked up just as Adam appeared in the doorway,his presence immediately filling the room. Even after discovering his true identity as GT Group's CEO, he still had that effect on me.


"Still studying?" His eyes fell on the scattered papers,something unreadable flickering across his face.


"The final interview is important." I shuffled the papers, trying to look more organized. "I want to be prepared."

"Joseph." Adam's attention shifted to the butler hovering in the doorway. "What's the update?"Joseph cleared his throat delicately. "Sir, the facility called again.They mentioned Madam had another... episode last night."What Madam?IS there someone I don't know?
Something dark passed over Adam's face. The temperature in the room seemed to drop several degrees


"Tell Stella we're going out tomorrow." His voice carried that edge of command that brooked no argument. "And contact the facility. in advance."

Facility? My curiosity piqued, but Adam's expression warned against questions.

"Of course. sir." Smith bowed slightly. "I'll make the arrangements."


After Smith left, Adam's eyes found mine. "Get some rest. We have an early start tomorrow."

"Where are we going?"

"You'll see." His smile held secrets. "Wear something...appropriate for meeting my impotant family."

My heart did a weird skip. Meeting his family? But before I could press for details, he was already heading for the shower.The next morning found me scrutinizing my reflection with unusual care. Adam had said family, but which family member?I finally settled on an outfit that straddled the line between elegant and approachable-flowing wide-leg pants in a soft cream, paired with a silk camisole and an oversized cashmere cardigan.

"Those aren't suitable." Adam's voice cut through my thoughts as I reached for my favorite heels.

"They match perfectly!"I defended, clutching the heels.′′And they're not even that high."


"Your knees haven't fully healed." His tone left no room for argument. "Flat shoes only."


"Adam." I tried for reasonable. "Why are you so fixated on this tiny injury?"

"Tiny?" His eyes darkened. "You saved my life."

"]was just-"

′′I2'm just care my savior." His hand came up to trace my jawline, making my breath catch. "Is that so hard to accept?"

"But it's meeting your family!" I couldn't quite keep the whine out of my voice. "I don't want to look sloppy."His thumb brushed my bottom lip, effectively derailing my train of thought. "Trust me."Those two words shouldn't have affected me so much. But something in his eyes made my protests die in my throat."Fine." I sighed dramatically. "But if your family thinks I'm some poorly dressed nouveau riche..."


His laugh rumbled through his chest. "Nobody who's met you could ever think that."


\---

The VIP parking area of Manhattan's most exclusive shopping district was deserted when we arrived. Taylor was already waiting, several shopping bags arranged carefully on a marble bench.


"Sir." He nodded respectfully. "As requested."

I peered into the nearest bag. my eyes widening. Inside were at least half a dozen pairs of designer flats.

"You bought out the entire flat shoe section?" I couldn't help but laugh.


"Choose." Adam's voice held that dangerous edge of amusement. "Unless you'd prefer I carry you."


The memory of being in his arms sent heat flooding my cheeks."I can walk!"I settled on a pair of intricately embroidered ballet flats that perfectly complemented my outfit. "See? These work much better with this look than those plain ones from earlier."Adam's blank expression clearly said he saw absolutely no difference.


"You really are hopeless with fashion." I couldn't help but smile at his obvious confusion. "'How did you even become CEO of a company with such major fashion brands?"

"I hire people who understand these things." His hand found the small of my back. guiding me toward the car. "Speaking of which..."


But whatever he was about to say was cut off as Taylor opened the car door. The drive that followed was filled with a tension I couldn't quite name - anticipation mixed with something deeper.

When we finally turned onto a private drive. my curiosity got the better of me. "Mr. Lancaster, where exactly are we going?"

"Just wait a moment." His eyes remained fixed on the road ahead, but his hand found mine, squeezing gently.


The facility that emerged through the trees took my breath away. It looked more like a luxury resort than any kind of medical center- pristine gardens, a man-made.A nurse in an impeccably pressed uniform met us at the entrance. "Mr. Lancaster. She's been asking for you all morning.11"Her condition?"

"Much better today. She had her hair done first thing this morning, insisted on wearing the emerald silk dress." The nurse's smile held genuine warmth. '"Said she needed to look perfect to meet her son's wife."


Son? My heart started racing. But hadn't Adam's mother...died?

"This way, please." The nurse led us through marble hallways.

We emerged onto a terrace overlooking the lake. And there,standing by the ornate railing in a flowing emerald dress,was a woman I'd only seen in old society photos.

My breath caught in my throat.

"Mom." Adam's voice carried a touch of tenderness.

The woman turned, and I felt my world tilt sideways. Because there, very much alive, stood Irena Lancaster.

"You finally brought her." Her smile was radiant as she studied me.′′Myson's savior."How is this possible? The words stuck in my throat as I struggled to process what I was seeing. Everything I thought I knew about the Lancasters' history suddenly needed rewriting.
 Adam's hand tightened on mine, and when I looked up at him,
his eyes held a clear message: There's so much you don't know yet.

"Welcome to the family, my dear." Her eyes. so like Adam's.sparkled with something that might have been tears.
###Chapter 33

Stella's POV

"Come closer. dear." Her voice carried that perfect mix of warmth and authority. "I missed you so much honey.

I was so excited but thought of Adam was still here. I glanced at him, but his face remained carefully neutral as he guided me forward with a gentle hand on my lower back.

"Mrs. Lancaster,I-"I began, but she cut me off with a warm laugh that seemed to brighten the entire terrace.

"Oh no, that won't do at all!" She reached for my hands,her grip surprisingly strong. "You're married to my Adam now.You must call me Mom!"


Something in my chest tightened at the eager hope in her eyes.I forced a smile, trying to hide my confusion. "Of course...Mom."


"Come, sit with me." She patted the chair beside her."Tell me everything about your marriage. How is he treating you? Is he being romantic enough? Adam can be so cold sometimes - just Jike his father."I saw Adam's jaw ticked at the mention of William, but he remained silent. I saw Her smile was radiant but somehow fragile."He's..." I scrambled for words that wouldn't be lies but wouldn't upset her either. "He's very attentive."

"Attentive?" She leaned forward conspiratorially. Her eyes narrowed at Adam. "You better be treating her well. A girl like this-how many prominent families were lining up to court her? You'll end up alone forever if you don't treasure her properly!"

"Mom." Adam's voice held a warning, but she ignored him completely.

"Don't 'Mom' me in that tone!" She wagged a finger at him. "I know you, always so focused on work. When was the last time you took her dancing? Or surprised her with flowers?"

I couldn't help but smile at her motherly scolding, even as my mind raced with questions. Why had everyone believed she was dead? Why was she here in this facility? What other secrets was Adam keeping?

"Look at her- so beautiful, so elegant! And saving you from that accident..." She turned back to me. "You must be exhausted,dealing with my stubborn son all day."

I felt my face heat. "Well, sometimes it can be... tiring."Her eyes lit up with something that looked disturbingly like mischief. "Tiring? Oh my! Adam, you should let your wife rest more at night!"Heat flooded my face as I realized what she was implying.Behind me. I swore I heard Adam make a strangled sound.

"Mom." His voice was strained. "Perhaps we should discuss something else."


"Why? It's perfectly natural!" She patted my hand sympathetically. "Don't worry, dear. The exhaustion is normal at first. Though you really should pace yourself better. Adam.The poor girl looks tired!"

I wanted to sink through the floor. "That's not... we haven't..."

"Oh. you don't need to be shy with me!" She leaned closer. her voice dropping to a stage whisper. "When William and I were first married..."


"Mrs. Lancaster." A nurse appeared with perfect timing.carrying a small tray. "It's time for your medication."

Irena's entire demeanor changed in an instant. The warmth vanished from her eyes. replaced by something wild and frightened."No." She crossed her arms like a petulant child. "I don't need those. I'm perfectly fine today - look how well I'm doing! Tell him, Stella. Tell himI don't need them.""Mrs. Lancaster-" The nurse started.-I suna mob, Woh ome swcift mooredmemt. she kmocked ahe trak вwcx_ Phlls simtoened ωcπoss the πaπbbe bemTはce I ncomn taよe chheom, Doon wmoin WhiMbana cocmers to see mne WWhene is he?

Exerything happened so fast after that. Nurses appeared froans momcthere. Actum's arm shor out, palling me back as his mosher troed to grab snoeching shamp froon the tea tray.


”yWīlliam!' She was sobbing now. fighting against the murses witho tried to restrain her. "I can be better! I'll be perfect.just pbease_--pbease come bock..."

A doctor appeared with a syringte. and within moments. Irena's struggles began to weaken.


"I'll be good," she mumbled as they helped hor to her feet. "Tell William I'll be good..."

\-

The drive back to the city was silent. I stared out the window.trying to process everything I'd witnessed. The gardens of the facilry gave way co highway scenery, but I baraly noticad. God.what kind of twisted family drama did I marry into?

"Mrs. Lancaster." Adam's voice carried that dangerous edge that always made my pulse jump. "You're thinking too loud."


Easy for you to say. Mr. Ice Prince. I thought sourly. Some of us actually process emotions instead of pretending they don't exist. I turned from the window to study his profile.


"Why did the Lancasters spread rumors about her death?" The question slipped out before I could stop it. "She is clearly still alive.so why-"

"Curiosity killed the cat. Mrs. Lancaster." His voice could have frozen hell itself. "Some questions are better left unasked."

And satisfaction brought it back." I couldn't quite keep the challenge from my voice. "She's my mother-in-law now. Don't I have the right to know?"

The temperature in the car seemed to drop several degrees.For a moment, neither of us spoke.

"She has bipolar disorder." Adam's voice cut through my thoughts. "Exacerbated by my father's... treatment of her."I turned to study his profile. He was grinding his teeth."How long?"The symptoms started when I was young." His eyes remained fixed on the road ahead. "Father's affairs even make her condition worse."


"So why..."

"What if," his voice dropped dangerously low, "those rumors came from within the family itself?"


The implication hit me like a physical blo. "That's...that's horrible. A woman like her deserves better than to be erased like that."


His jaw tightened almost imperceptibly.-"Better than being the subject of endless society gossip about her condition."

I wanted to reach for his hand, offer some comfort, but something in his posture warned against it."Mr..."


The car swerved suddenly, pulling onto a scenic overlook.Adam killed the engine and turned to face me, his eyes dangerous.

"I'm sorry." The words felt inadequate. "I shouldn't have-"

"No." His hand came up to trace my jawline, the gesture at odds with the darkness in his eyes."You shouldn't have. But you did. Just like you shouldn't have married into this family, but here you are."YOU-""My mother likes you." His thumb brushed my bottom lip.making my breath catch. "She hasn't liked anyone since before the illness took hold. Do you know what that means?"

I shook my head slightly, afraid to break whatever spell had him talking so openly.

′′It means you're stuck with us now." His smile held no humor."Welcome to the family, Mrs. Lancaster. God help you." His gaze locked on mine making my breath nearly stop.

Ma heart racing, damn, how charming he is!
###Chapter 34

Stella's POV

′′Fcor the final test," the HR director announced, "each candidate will style a randomly assigned model. You'll have two hours to create a complete look that embodies GT Group's luxury aesthetic."


My heart skipped when I drew my assigned model -a petite intern. While the other candidates got professional models with standard measurements, I'd haveto work harder to achieve the same impact.

Perfect, I thought with a slight smile. A real challenge.

I surveyed the available pieces with practiced efficiency. My mind was already constructing the perfect look.

"She seems quite confident," one of the other candidates whispered, not quite quietly enough. "Though I suppose having connections helps."

Let them talk. I'd let my work speak for itself."Time's up!" The HR director called. "Candidates, present your concepts."When my turn came, I spoke with quiet confidence about my vision.The judges' expressions remained carefully neutral, but I caught the fashion director's slight nod of approval.

"The scores have been tabulated," the HR director announced after what felt like hours.′′Infirst place-"

The boardroom doors burst open.

Lucy strode in like she owned the place, designer heels clicking against marble. "I hope I'm not interrupting anything important?"

The room temperature seemed to drop several degrees.

"Miss Winston." The fashion director's smile didn't quitereach his eyes. "This is a closed interview."

"Oh, I know." Lucy's smile was pure sugar as she pulled out a contract. "But I have a proposition that might interest GT Group."

My stomach clenched as I read the terms. Lucy was offering to be the face of GT's luxury brands at a 30% discount - with one condition- not hire me."Of course," she added with false sweetness, "this offer is contingent on certain... staffing decisions."The judges exchanged glances. Even in luxury fashion, a 30%discount on a high-profile spokesperson was significant.After careful consideration," the HR director cleared his throat,"we've decided to offer the position to our second-place candidate."


I kept my face carefully blank as whispers erupted around the room. "I understand. Thank you for the opportunity."

Lucy's triumphant smile as I gathered my things made something cold settle in my chest. Just wait and see, dear sister.

"Mrs. Lancaster." The fashion director caught up with me at the elevator. "You should know - your work was exceptional.But Miss Winston is the Winston family's daughter, and with the reduced contract fees..."

"It's alright." I smiled slightly. "I understand business decisions.11


Her face paled slightly as the doors closed.




Adam's POV

I was reviewing the latest merger documents when Taylor's voice interrupted my thoughts."Sir." His carefuly neutral tone immediately put me on edge. "The merger summit begins in ten minutes. However, Mrs.Lancaster's final interview is scheduled for the same time slot."My fingers stilled over the keyboard as an inexplicable tension coiled in my chest. The thought of Stella down there, being judged by people who had no idea who she really was... My jaw clenched involuntarily.

"The acquisition team is waiting for confirmation," Taylor continued, clearly choosing his words with care. "Shall I reschedule?"


I fixed him with a look that would have sent lesser men running. The Australian merger could wait. Though I'd rather die than admit it, the thought of missing Stella's interview made something restless stir in my chest.

"Understood, sír." Taylor adjusted his tie, reading my silence perfectly. "I'll inform the team we'll begin in ten minutes."

As he left, I found my thoughts drifting to the interview floors below. Not that I was concerned - my troublesome wife had proven more than capable of handling herself.


\---

Every minute in this conference room felt like an eternity.Damn it. I never had trouble focusing on business before.A sudden burst of laughter from downstairs made my jaw clench. What was happening down there? Why hadn't Taylor sent any updates? The pen in my hand creaked dangerously as my grip tightened.-and that concludes our financial projections for the Australian-" The CFO's voice cut off abruptly as I stood.

"Meeting adjourned." I didn't recognize my own voice. "Taylor.find my wife. Now. How is the interview?"

Taylor murmured timidly. "Another was chosen. yet I hnd clearly inquired just days before that Mrs.Lancaster was undoubtedly formidable enough to prevail."

"What happened?"I slammed my hand onto the table with force. The room cleared with impressive speed.


\---

Stella's POV

Back at Lancaster Manor. I stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows. watching the sunset paint the gardens in shades of gold. My phone buzzed with another notification - Lucy's contract announcement was trending on social media.

"I hope you're not too disappointed." Lucy's voice dripped false sympathy through the phone. "But really. did you think GT Group would choose an adopted nobody over the real Winston heir?"I ended the call without responding, a slight smile playing at my lips as I pulled up the recording app on my phone.Sometimes the best revenge required patience.The door opened behind me. and I feit Adam's presence before I heard him. His reflection in the window looked thunderous.


Nrs. Lancaster." His voice carried that dangerous edge that always made my pulse jump. Care to explain why my wife is trending on social media?"

I turned. meeting his gaze steadily. "Just business. Mr.Lancaster. Nothing for you to concern yourself with."

"Nothing?" His eves darkened as he moved closer. "You do realize who you're married to?"


"Of course." I kept my voice light. "But I prefer to handle these matters my way."


Something shifted in his expression - surprise? Approval?And what way is that?"


My heart raced with anticipation as I pulled up the recording on my phone. This is it. Stella. Show him what you're made of.I watched Adam's expression carefully as Lucy's voice filled the room:"Of course, this thirty percent discount comes with certain...conditions. GT Group simply can't hire someone like Stella Winston. An adopted nobody with questionable connections?Think of the brand image!"Adam's jaw tightened almost imperceptibly as the recording continued. The board member's response was crystal clear:"Given the significant cost savings, we've decided to offer the position to another candidate..."

I stopped the recording, keeping my voice professionally detached. "Interesting business practices. wouldn't you say?Using personal connections and financial leverage to manipulate hiring decisions?"
###Chapter 35

Stella's POV

I stopped the recording, watching Adam's face for any reaction.His expression remained carefully neutral, but I noticed the slight tightening of his jaw.

"Interesting timing," he finally said, his voice dangerously soft."Bringing this to me now, after everything's settled."

"Is it?" I kept my tone professional despite the way his proximity made my pulse quicken. "I thought the CEO might be interested in potential reputation risks to his company."

His laugh held no humor. "Reputation risks?" He moved closer,backing me against his mahogany desk. "Are you threatening GT Group,Mrs. Lancaster?"

"Pure business." I met his gaze steadily. "Your board accepted a bribe to override merit-based hiring. The implications for GT Group's corporate governance-"

"My troublesome wife." His fingers traced my jawline, the gesture at odds with the dangerous edge in his voice."Always making things so complicated.""I prefer thorough." I tried to ignore how his touch sent electricity dancing across my skin. "Would you like to hear the rest of the recording?"His other hand found my hip, effectively trapping me against the desk. "What exactly do you want?"

"Two things." I forced myself to focus despite his distracting proximity. "First, terminate all contracts with Lucy Winston."

"And second?" His thumb traced circles on my hip, making it really hard to maintain my professional demeanor.

"Compensation." I pulled out a folder containing detailed calculations. "For lost opportunities and potential damage to my professional reputation. After all, talent should be rewarded on merit, not family connections."

"Interesting perspective." His thumb brushed my bottom lip.making my breath catch. "Tell me, Mrs. Lancaster, did you plan this from the start?"

"Plan what?" I blinked up at him with perfect innocence. "I simply participated in a fair competition. Everything else was Lucy's doing."

His laugh rumbled through his chest. "My troublesome wife.Always finding new ways to keep me entertained."

"So you'll handle it?" I tried to sound businesslike, but it came out breathier than intended.

"Handle it?" His smile was pure predator.Lucy's POV

My heels struck the marble floor of GT Group's reception area like gunshots. Each click echoed my mounting rage as I stormed through the lobby, ignoring the way other visitors scrambled out of my path. How dare they?

"This has to be a mistake." I thrust my phone at my agent,displaying the contract termination notice that had ruined my perfect morning. The screen's harsh light illuminated her carefully neutral expression. "Call them again. Right now!"

"Lucy..." Her's professional calm was cracking- I could hear it in the slight tremor of her voice. "I've already called three times.The decision is final."


"Final?" My laugh sounded strange even to my own ears. Stay composed, I told myself. You're Lucy Winston. You don't lose control in public. "Do they have any idea who I am? The Winston name-"


"Means nothing to GT," She cut in, her voice barely above a whisper. The pity in her eyes made my blood boil."Please,we need to handle this professionally. Making a scene will only-""Making a scene?" My voice rose despite my best efforts to maintain composure. "They're terminating my contract without cause! After I offered them that ridiculous discount that you insisted would seal the deal!"

Movement caught my eye - the receptionist's perfectly manicured hand inching toward what I knew was the security button.

"Lucy." My agent's fingers dug into my arm as she pulled me aside, her voice dropping urgently. "Think carefully. GT Group isn't just another fashion conglomerate. They have influence in every major market. If you antagonize them-"


But I wasn't listening. My mind was already racing with possibilities for revenge. Stella might have won this round, but she had no idea what I was capable of when cornered.

"Just wait," I whispered to myself. "Ill make you regret ever crossing me, dear sister."

The elevator's soft ding cut through my fury like a knife. My words died in my throat as Stella, that bitch,emerged,looking infuriatingly perfect in her designer suit.Of course she's behind this, I thought, watching her glide across the lobby like she belonged here.She's probably loving every second of my humiliation. My nails dug crescents into my palms as I fought the urge to wipe that subtle smile off her face.I wanted to tear her off instantly!
###Chapter 36

Stella's POV

"Well, if it isn't the adopted trash." Lucy's voice dripped venom as she blocked my path. "Enjoying your little victory?"

I maintained my fake smile despite her obvious attempt to provoke me. "Lucy, what a surprise. I thought you'd be busy with damage control after your contract termination."


Her perfectly manicured nails dug into her designer handbag."We both know how you got this position. Did you enjoy crawling into the boss's bed?"


Several heads turned at her raised voice. Perfect - just the audience I needed.


"Actually," I kept my voice measured but clear enough to carry,"I earned this position by myself. Though I suppose that concept might be foreign to someone who relies on family connections and blackmail."

Her face flushed an unattractive shade of red. "You little-"Miss Winston." Taylor's crisp voice cut through the tension. "Security will escort you out. Unless you'd prefer we release the full recording of your... business negotiations?"I watched with carefully concealed satisfaction as Lucy was led away,hor throats fading into incoherent sputtering


\---


The contract signing room felt oddly intimate despite its corporate sterility. I reviewed each clause carefully.years of business experience making me wary of fine print.

"Everything appears to be in order." The legal representative's professional mask didn't slip. but I caught the slight tremor in his hands as he processed my paperwork. "Though there is one... additional requirement."

I raised an eyebrow. "Oh?"

"All department directors must be personally approved by the CEO." He wouldn't quite meet my eyes. "It's a new policy."

"Is it?" I couldn't quite keep the amusement from my voice. "How convenient."


"The CEO is available now. if you'd-"

"Lead the way." I gathered my things, already planning exactly how to handle my dear husband's latest power play.Taylor was waiting by the executive elevator, his expression carefully blank. "Mrs. Lancaster. The CEO will see you now."The ride to the 38th floor was silent, but I caught Taylor's subtle smirk in the mirrored walls. At least someone was enjoying this litle drama.

\---

Adam's office seemed different in the morning light - less intimidating, more... purposeful. The man himself stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows. his reflection watching me with that dangerous amusement I was starting to recognize.

"Mrs. Lancaster." His voice held that edge that always made my pulse jump. "I believe we have some business to discuss."

"The contract issigned." I kept my tone professional despite how his proximity affected me. "Was there something else?"

His smile was pure predator. "Actually. yes. As CEO. I need to ensure our Fashion Director can deliver results."


"I assure you my portfolio-"

"Theory is one thing." He moved closer, and I caught the scent of his expensive cologne. "But I prefer practical demonstrations.:1


I raised an eyebrow. "Meaning?""Style me." His eyes held a challenge. "Prove you deserve this position.""Now?"I couldn't quite keep the disbelief from my voice. "You want me to be your personal stylist?""Consider it your first executive task." His smile shouldn't have affected me so much. "Unless you're not up to the challenge?"

Twenty minutes later, I surveyed the selection Taylor had brought up. Suits in various cuts and shades lay carefully arranged. alongside an impressive array of accessories.

"The charcoal Brioni." I stepped closer, unable to resist running my fingers along the fine wool. "With the pale blue shirt. The combination will highlight your..." I caught myself before saying 'gorgeous eyes' and quickly amended, "professional image."


Adam's eyes darkened as he watched me assemble the look, his gaze following my every movement. "Quite confident in your choices, Mrs. Lancaster. Though I wonder what other combinations you find... appealing."

"The subtle herringbone pattern adds depth without being flashy." I selected a deep navy tie. "Perfect for today's board meeting."

"Is it?" His voice dropped lower as I adjusted the tie's length.I tried to focus on the Windsor knot, but his proximity was impossibly distracting. The heat radiating from his body and his intoxicating scent made my fingers tremble slightly as I worked."The tie knot should be proportional to your collar spread," Imanaged, desperately maintaining my professional tone. "It's simple geometry."

"Is it?" His breath ghosted across my ear as he leaned closer,ostensibly examining my work in the mirror. His hands caught mine as I finished the knot, fingers intertwining with mine.

The suggestive undertone in his voice made heat pool in my stomach. I made the mistake of meeting his eyes in the mirror,and the intensity of his gaze took my breath away.

Heat flooded my face."How did you-"

"I make it my business to know everything about my executives." His thumb traced circles on my wrist. "Especially ones who threaten me with corporate scandals."

"I didn't threaten," I protested. "I simply presented a record."

His laugh rumbled through his chest.′′Mytroublesome wife.Always finding new ways to surprise me."

"Mr. Lancaster." I tried to sound stern despite how his touch made my pulse race."It is time to work now.""I'm the rule here." His thumb brushing across my bottom lip in a way that made me shiver. "Then perhaps we should discuss proper work attire." His eyes traveled down my body with dangerous intent. "That skirt is rather... distracting. The way it clings when you walk..."I swallowed hard as his hand slid to my hip. fingers sploying possessively across the fabric in question. "The length is perfectly appropriate for the office."


"The length?" He pulled me closer. untilI could feel the heat of his body through my silk blouse. "I'm more concerned about how it makes me want to-"


"The length is perfectly appropriate!"' I stepped back. smoothing my pencil skirt self-consciously. "And you're changing the subject."


"Am I?" His smile held secrets. "Or am I simply ensuring my Fashion Director maintains proper standards?"


Before I could formulate a suitably professional response.Taylor appeared in the doorway. "Sir. the board is waiting."

"Okay." Adam's voice held a promise that made heat pool in my stomach. "I expect a new style tomorrow. my little stylist."

I felt speechless. I was the Fashion Director. Can't he wear a tic himself?


But also not much angry. to match people's clothes. to make the best appearance. was my job responsibility. but also my enjoyment.
###Chapter 37

Stella's POV


"Perfect! The photographer's enthusiasm echoed rhroo ghh 《aīGroup's state-of-the-ant studio. "Nrs. Loncasuer, yoar saxlung ns simply impeccable!

I smiled slightly. making a final adjustment to the model's pre

"That's a wrap. everyone!" The photographer glanced an hes watch in disbelief. We're done an hout and a haif ahead of schedule.Incredible!


The model practically bounced over. her eyes sporkling wàn excitement. "Mrs. Lancaster, you must join us for dinner!We need to discuss future collaborations!"


"I appreciate the invitation." I began diplomatically, but l'mn afraid I have other plans this evening."

With my infuriatingly handsome CEO husband. I added silently. The thought of Adam waiting for me at our favorite restaurant brought an inexplicable warmth to my chest.As I exchanged contact information, my phone vibrated. Luci s name flashed on the screen, instantly souring my good mood."Stella." Her voice was as sweet as poisoned honey. "Be smart and resign from CT Group while you still can."I couldn't help but laugh. "Really. Lucy? After your disastrous contract debacle. you still dare to threaten me?"

"You have no idea what you're dealing with." Her tone turned ugly. "My family's power-"

"Is nothing compared to GT Group." I cut her off coldly. "You`ve already lost once. Do you want another round?"

I hung up before she could respond. but her tone left me uneasy. Lucy wasn't usually so direct with her threats.

Before I could analyze further, my phone rang again. Seeing the number from Brooklyn Nursing Home, my blood ran cold.

"Mrs. Lancaster?" The nurse's voice was barely concealing panic."Your grandmother... she's gone missing. We've searched everywhere, but in this storm-"

Thunder rumbled outside, emphasizing her words. My hands shook as I grabbed my things and rushed to the exit without even taking an umbrella.

Raindrops pelted down like icy needles, soaking my designer suit in seconds. Lightning cast stark shadows on the deserted streets as I desperately tried to hail a cab.Need a ride?"I turned to see Brian's car idling by the curb, his perfectlypracticed concerned expression clear through the window.

"No." The word came out sharper than intended. "I'll find my own way."


"In this storm?" He raised an eyebrow. "Come on. Stella.Whatever our past. I won't let you freeze out here."

Another clap of thunder made my decision for me. Every wasted minute increased the danger to my grandmother.

"Fine." I slid into the passenger seat, keeping as much distance as possible. "Brooklyn Nursing Home. Quickly.please."

"The great Stella, accepting my help?" His smile held something I couldn't decipher. "How the mighty have fallen."

I ignored his jibe, focusing on my phone, trying to call the nursing home again. No answer.




Adam's POV

"Sir." Taylor's cautiously neutral tone immediately put me on alert. "The restaurant called to confirm your reservation with Mrs. Lancaster..."

I didn't look up from the merger documents. "Amd?"

＂She left the studio early. She was savm geing Agohesitated. "Your nephew's car."

My pen snapped in two.

"Brian's car?" The words came out as a dangerous growl."Why would she be in Brian's car?"

"Unclear, sir. But given the storm-"

Lightning illuminated my office, casting sharp shadows on the walls. The thought of Stella with Brian sent a dark, violent emotion surging through me.

"Find them." The command was almost inhuman. "Now."




Stella's POV

The fluorescent lights of the nursing home cast sickly shadows in the empty corridors as I practically ran through the building.

"We've already called the police," the head nurse wrung her hands nervously.′′But in this weather..."

"Show me the surveillance footage." My voice was steadier than I felt. "Now."But the grainy video revealed nothing useful-just my grandmother resolutely heading towards the garden entrance before the storm cut the power, turning the screen to static.I was moving before the footage ended,ignoring Brian's calls to wait, heading straight for the garden. The rain had turned the ground into treacherous mud, but I couldn't stop. Every second could mean...


There. A flash of familiar emerald green by the rose bushes.

"Grandmother!" My heels sank into the mud as I ran towards the fallen figure."Oh, God,please..."

She lay there motionless, silver hair mingling with rain and blood. My hands shook as I checked her pulse, nearly collapsing with relief at the faint beat.

"We need an ambulance!" I shouted towards the building,cradling her head gently. "Now!"


The next few hours blurred into a haze of sirens and hospital corridors. Words like "subdural hematoma"and"criitical window" floated through the urgent whispers of doctors.

"She needs surgery." The neurosurgeon's voice broke through my daze. "Within 72 hours. But given her age and condition..."

"I know a doctor, Dr. Weber, who can save your grandmother."Brían's voice carried that perfect blend of concern and authority. "But his schedule..."I understood immediately. Of course-the specialist who could save my grandmother was only accessible through Brian's
connections.

"What do you want?" My voice was hollow.

Brian's smile in the harsh hospital lights was chilling. "You know what I want, Stella. You've always known."

"She's your grandmother too, and you're marrying Lucy."I reminded him, though I knew it was futile.


"Speaking of Lucy." His laugh was devoid of humor."Did you really think the timing of your grandmother's 'accident' was a coincidence?"


Something in his tone made me pause."What?"

"Oh, you haven't heard?" His laugh was icy. "Lucy has been quite... chatty with your grandmother. Telling her you were forced to marry Adam. That he can barely stand to look at you.That you're a laughingstock."


The realization hit me hard. This was Lucy's threat. She wasn't just targeting me-she was targeting my grandmother.

"That's why she's been so agitated lately." My hand clenched."Lucy has been feeding her lies.""Smart girl." Brian stepped closer."Though I must admit, Lucy does have a flair for drama."My blood ran cold. "Why would she do this? To mygrandmother?"

"Your grandmother?" Brian's smile was venomous. "Funny you still call her that, given everyone knows you're just an adopted nobody."

My hands balled into fists. perfectly manicured nails digging into my palms. "Why are you here? To gloat?"

"Actually." he moved closer, trapping me against the wall,"I'm here to offer you a deal."

"Share a night with me." His fingers brushed my cheek,sending a shiver down my spine. "That's the price to save her life. Quite a bargain, isn't it?"
###Chapter 38

Stella's POV

I jerked away from his touch, bile rising in my throat. "You're insane."


"Am I?" His fingers tightened painfully. "We both know why you married Adam. Playing the dutiful adopted daughter.sacrificing yourself to repay the Winston family's kindness."

"Yes. I was forced into marriage." My voice could have frozen hell itself. "And where were you when that happened? Oh right.in bed with someone else!"


Movement caught my eye. Adam stood at the corridor's turn.his face unreadable. How much had he heard?


He turned and walked away without a word.

"Mr. Lancaster!" I tried to follow, but Brian held me back. "Adam.wait!


"Come on, Stella." Brian's voice dropped to a seductive whisper."We both know you deserve better than a crippled old man who can't even-"I yanked my hand free. "Want mne ? Sorry, dear nephew, you're just a bastard."His face contorted with rage. "Then I hope you're ready toplan Grandmother's funeral."

"Is that a threat?"

"Just reality." He straightened his designer jacket with exaggerated care. "The specialist who could save her? Only operates on my recommendation. Tick tock, Stella. How much is Grandmother's life worth to you?"

After he left, my trembling fingers found my phone. One call to John Winston- surely my adoptive father would help?

"Stella? It's the middle of the night."

"Please." I hated how desperate I sounded. "I need help.Grandmother-"


"Already bringing shame to the family name wasn't enough?"His cold voice made me flinch.′′Now you want to waste our connections on a dying old woman?"

The line went dead, leaving me alone in the sterile hospital corridor.Dawn painted the hospital windows in shades of gray as I sat vigil outside Grandmother's room. The hospital corridor was too quiet at this hour.My rain-soaked clothes had mostly dried, leaving wrinkles inmy suit. Not that I cared right now - every beep from Grandmother's monitors kept me on edge.


From my reflection in the window. I could see dark circles shadowing my eyes- testament to a sleepless night.

"Mrs. Lancaster?" The chief surgeon's voice pulled me from my exhausted daze. "We need to discuss treatment options."

I straightened, forcing myself to focus. "Of course."

"There are two possibilities." He consulted his chart. "Dr.Weber could operate tomorrow - he's highly qualified for this type of procedure."

Brian's smirking face.flashed through my mind. "And the second option?"


"Dr. Luke Morgan." The name sparked a memory - James Morgan's brother. The name sparked a memory. The same James Morgan I'd humiliated at Rouge nightclub last month.

"He's one of the best neurosurgeons in the country.Unfortunately, his earliest available slot is next month."

A month. Would Grandmother even survive that long?I need to make some calls." My voice sounded distant to my own ears.My phone felt like lead as I pulled it out. One call to Adamcould fix everything. He had the influence to expedite Luke Morgan's schedule, to override Brian's trap.

Behind me, nurses whispered as they passed:

"That's her-a crippled man's wife..."

"I heard she was seen with his nephew..."

"Such a scandal..."

I barely heard them, my mind racing through possibilities.
There had to be a way out of this trap. There had to be...

Time was running out, and with it, Grandmother's chances of survival. Brian's ultimatum hung in the air like poison.

Through the hospital room's window, I watched Grandmother's chest rise and fall with mechanical precision. The usually proud woman looked impossibly fragile against the stark white sheets.


"I'm sorry," I whispered, pressing my palm against the cold glass. "I'll find a way to fix this. I promise."

"Taylor." Relief flooded through me when he answered. "I need to speak with Adam. It's urgent."A long pause. "I'll relay your message, Mrs. Lancaster."Minutes stretched like hours before Taylor's response came: "Mr. Lancaster says... to get lost."

My heart stuttered. What? He must be upset about missing our dinner plans. "Taylor, please. This is about my grandmother.She needs-"


"I'm sorry. Mrs. Lancaster." His voice held genuine regret. "His exact words were Tell her to get the hell out of my life.'"

My heart clenched. He must be angry about missing our dinner date. If only he knew the real reason...

"Could you possibly tell me where he is? If heis busy, I can wait for him," grandmother's life not permitting delays.

After a brief pause. he provided an address, "Santorini Resort."

The Santorini Resort lived up to its reputation as New York's premier luxury destination.


I smoothed my silk dress. mentally rehearsing what I needed to tell Adam about Grandmother's condition. The VIP floor's security recognized me immediately- Miss.Winston, they called me with careful deference that still felt strange.

Voices and laughter drifted through the partially open door of the Vip room. I hesitated for a fraction of a second before knocking.I'm scared for a whole night, while him? I was about to leave
but the thought of grandmother made me stay. Fine, I had no choice.


“Can I...”I entered in it.

The scene that greeted me made my carefully prepared words die in my throat.
###Chapter 39

Stella's POV

Adam sat at the center of an elegant gathering. flanked by two stunningly beautiful women.

Two women, one pouring wine for him and the other whispering sweetly, looked up in startled unison as she unexpectedly pushed the door open.

"I wondered who could be so thoughtless," the elegantly composed lady remarked, seemingly coming to a sudden realization. "It turns out to be Miss Winston!"

Her tone dripped with sarcasm as she said my name.

Mark caught my eye from across the room, something like sympathy crossing his face. James suddenly found his drink fascinating.

"Mr. Lancaster." I chose to pretend I had not heard her words,instead gazing intently at Adam. I kept my voice steady despite the way my stomach churned. "I need to discuss something with you. Do you have a moment?""Well, well." One of the woman's perfectly painted lips curved into a cruel smile. "Has Miss Winston truly become so attached to Mr. Lancaster? Darling, don't you know real ladies make appointments instead of barging in like a waiter?"The other woman-twirled a strand of hair around her finger."Though I suppose we can't expect proper manners from someone who was engaged with Brian. How...shameless!"

I forced my face to remain neutral despite the blatant disrespect. "Mr. Lancaster. if you're busy. I can wait outside.As long as necessary."

"Outside?" The woman's laugh dripped acid honey. "Sweetie,the servant's entrance is downstairs. Though I suppose you're used to... backdoors, given your history with Brian."

The crystal glass in Adam's hand shattered.

Silence fell as blood dripped from his clenched fist. When he spoke, his voice could have frozen hell itself. "Get. Out."

The speaking woman was paled. ""Mr. Lancaster, surely you don't mean-"


"Now." The single word carried enough command to send both women scrambling.

I moved to follow them, but his voice stopped me."Not you."

"I'll wait outside." I kept my tone carefully neutral. "Until you're enjoying yourself."His jaw tightened, but Mark chose that moment to stand."Actually,we were just leaving. Come on, James- that new clubwon't review itself."

The room cleared with impressive speed. leaving only the lingering scent of perfume and the sharp tang of spilled scotch.

"Third floor." Adam's voice carried that dangerous edge that always made my pulse jump. "Room 308. Now."

I hesitated. "Mr. Lancaster. I can wait-"

"Now." His eyes promised consequences for defiance.

\---

Upon reaching the third floor, a profound silence enveloped the space,broken only by the faint sound of footsteps on the carpet.

Adam opened one of the doors and, seemingly impatient with my slow pace, grasped mny delicate wrist and propelled me inside.


I stumbled awkwardly, falling directly onto the carpet.

The door slammed shut.

”You-"I had barely started when Adam in the wheelchair stood up,grasping my chin and forcing my gaze upward to meet his.A surge of annoyance coursed through me, yet I had comehere with an ulterior motive.

"Care to explain," his voice dropped to that dangerous register that always spelled trouble, "why you stood me up last night?"

Last night? The dinner reservation- I'd completely forgotten in the chaos with Grandmother.

"I can explain-"

Taking a deep breath, I endeavored to temper my tone.′′Mr.Lancaster, I truly had an urgent matter that required my abrupt departure yesterday evening. It was my fault to stand you up, and I apologize. I need to talk with you because it's vitally important, and I-"

"Is it?" His fingers traced my jawline, the gesture at odds with his cold tone. "Then what about your date with Brian?"

Suddenly, I felt light as a feather, Adam lifting me effortlessly with one hand.


The world spun before me, and in an instant, I found myself pinned against the sofa.

My posture was awkwardly contorted; an even greater discomfort surged through me as he firmly grasped my jaw.I felt like prey caught in his grip, a mere catch on his board."You really had followed me?" I could hardly believe it, shockand fury mingling within me. "Adam, do you understand what it means to respect my privacy?"

My brows knitted in irritation, my delicate features appearing even more constrained in my anger.

The more furious I became, the cooler he remained.

"Is marrying me so degrading?" Adam's face hovered dangerously close as he recalled my words from the hospital."Are you still pining for Brian? Did you marry me out of obligation? Because he betrayed you? Hmm? "

"Yes! I barely know you. If it weren't for dire circumstances, if it weren't to sever ties with the Winston family,why would I suddenly agree to marry a complete stranger?"

Hadn't we both been forced into this marriage?

The temperature in the room seemed to drop several degrees.

"Forced?" His voice was barely human. "Then let me show you what being forced really means."

What does he want to do ? Before I could process his words,he was backing me against the wall, his larger frame caging me in. One hand gripped my hip while the other tangled in my hair,forcing my head back.Mr. Lancaster, I married you because of the Winston family;you marry me to appease your mother. We are merely a couple in name-you-" My words abruptly ceased as soft lips enveloped mine, my eyes widening in shock at the sight of his handsome face looming over me.

"You're not satisfied being just a name on paper?" His voice was pure sin against my skin. "Then I'll make you my woman tonight."

I could distinctly feel the curve of his warm mouth, but that softness quickly transformed into something far more aggressive. "Let go-!"

His hand slid down my side, bunching the silk of my dress as he pulled me closer and the unfamiliar, searing sensation coursed through me, igniting a tremor deep within my soul.

"Adam, let go! What are you doing?"

The air conditioning brought a chill that grazed my skin,making me shudder. But what chilled me more was the trepidation gripping my heart.

"Adam! Release me! What on earth has gotten into you?!"I clawed at him, nearly shouting in desperation.

"Mrs. Lancaster, this is your duty as my wife." He was unmoved.


Then his mouth claimed mine with bruising force,swallowing
whatever protest I might have made. This wasn't like our previous kisses - this was pure possession. a claiming that left no room for resistance.


I tried to turn my head away, but his grip in my hair held me still. My hands pushed ineffectively against his chest as he deepened the kiss, his tongue sweeping into my mouth with devastating skill.


"Adam, I am just an unknown woman. Do you not feel a loss of dignity engaging with me?" His movements were swift,rendering my fighting skills utterly ineffective against him.

Moreover, the inherent strength difference between us only exacerbated my predicament.

Adam scoffed dismissively, a cold laugh escaping him. My resistance meant nothing to him.


I could sense the hardness of his cock, akin to the tolling of a death knell, heralding an inescapable danger closing in.

As his large hand grazed the zipper of my dress, panic surged within me.Oh God, he's actually going to...
###Chapter 40

Stella's POV

"Adam, please..." My voice trembled as his grip tightened on my wrists."Not here."

His laugh was devoid of warmth. "Suddenly shy, Mrs.Lancaster?"


As he leaned closer, I could smell the Scottish whiskey on his breath. His usual self-control was crumbling at the edges.

"You're drunk," I tried to reason with him, even as his other hand traced down my side. "You don't want to-"

"Don't tell me what I want." His voice dropped to that dangerous register that always made my pulse race, but this time from fear rather than attraction.′′You seemed to know exactly what you wanted with Brian."

"That's not-" But my protest died as his hand slipped under my dress, forcing me to meet his gaze. The hurt beneath his anger made me catch my breath.

"Please," I whispered, hating the tremor in my voice."Can we go somewhere else? At least somewhere different."

Otherwise, I felt no differentfrom those prostitutes.

Something flickered in his eyes at my words. When he noticedthe tears threatening to spill from my eyes, his grip loosened slightly. Without warning, his hand covered my eyes.

"Mr.Lancaster?"

"Don't cry," his voice was tense.

A plan formed through my panic. If I could just get him to listen... "I'll do anything you want. Just... help me save Grandmother. Please."

His hand dropped from my eyes, but his body still trapped me against the wall. "Anything?"

I nodded desperately, clinging to this thread of hope. "Luke can save her. You could-"

"Luke." His laugh held no humor. "Why would I help? I'm not a charity."

Adam took a drag from his cigarette, blowing out a smoke ring."Miss Winston, that's not how business is done."

He wasni't calling me Mrs. Lancaster anymore, but Miss Winston. He was mocking my earlier refusal.If I had been willing earlier, naturally I could have gotten Luke's contact information. But now, the negotiation dynamics had changed. He could demand more in return.I silently stared at him, waiting for his price - his demands.Whatever he asked. I would try to meet it.

When he finally pulled back, his smile was pure predator."Dance by the window. If your auction price reaches a hundred thousand. T'll convince Luke for you."

I knew the Santorini Resort held dancer competitions every Saturday night, with the most popular dancer receiving extra rewards. But for him to make me dance...


"What?"

Horror washed through me as his meaning sank in. "You're auctioning off your own wife?"

"My wife?" His smile could have frozen hell. "Who knows whose woman you'll end up being? Brian's perhaps?"

The slap echoed through the suite before I could stop myself."You bastard!"


His jaw clenched, but he didn't retaliate. Instead, he stepped back, gesturing to the windows overlooking the club below."Your choice, Miss Winston. Dance, or find another way to save your grandmother."My hands shook as I reached for the zipper of my evening gown. The silk whispered against my skin as I modified it into an off-shoulder piece that would allow movement."Time starts now." Adam's voice carried that edge of command that always made my pulsc jump. "Make it worth their money."

Years of dance training took over as I began to move. The music from below provided a sensual beat as I flowed through a modern dance routine. Each movement was precise.calculated to draw the eye without being vulgar.

Through my tears. I caught glimpses of Adam in the window's reflection. His expression remained carefully neutral,but his hands gripped the chair's armrests with white-knuckled force.

I finished my final pose, still catching my breath. Suddenly.Adam stood and wrapped an arm around my waist, which he could easily control with one hand.

I was so shocked I almost stopped breathing, looking at Adam in bewilderment. The scorching heat from his palm invaded through my skin, leaving me too rigid to move.

His gaze traveled from my face down to my neck, and lower...That blatant stare made me feel exposed, as if I'd lost all my clothing under his scrutiny.Mrs. Lancaster, have I failed to satisfy you, leaving you so desperately eager to sell yourself? Hmm?"The last syllable lifted slightly as he leaned in close.I could feel his warm breath mingling with my pants against my face. I could see his eyelashes, long and thick but straight,not appearing feminine. Yet those deep dark pupils were like an unfathomable lake, making one's heart tighten, afraid of drowning in them.

"How could that be?" I finally came to my senses, looking directly into his eyes so close to mine, forcing a smile. "Mr.Lancaster isn't really disabled in his legs, so how could he fail to satisfy me? I'm quite content."


See, this was my training as the former top socialite. Even after dancing such an alluring dance, I could still say such things with an unchanged expression!

"Perhaps I should let my mother see how proper and dignified her daughter-in-law is."

At the mention of my respected elder, my expression finally changed slightly, revealing some embarrassment as an uncontrollable awkwardness crept onto my cheeks.

"Adam, you're disrupting my clients' bidding. If no one bids over a hundred thousand, wll you take responsibility?" I tried to push him away, but my strength seemed insignificant before him."So you'll go with whoever's willing to pay? Hmm?" Adam's voice contained hidden danger and warning."Isn't that what you wanted to see?" I countered. What nonsense! I secretly laughed to myself.I started struggling, saying coldly: "I've danced. yon ve humiliated me, shouldn't you let me go now?"

I was eager to check the bidding situation in the hall. but was shocked to find the auction had already started, with bids reaching one hundred and thirty thousand.

Yet, the people downstairs seemed unable to see my struggle with Adam? Could they...really not see?

This realization and speculation left me stunned, unable to react quickly. "How could they possibly-"


"Taylor will contact you tomorrow." He cut off mv words releasing me.

I wanted to ask for clarification. but Adam's emotionless face clearly said "Better leave while I'm in a good mood."




As I wont downstairs, I had cursed Adam as a bastard countloss timew in my mind.


Forcing his wife to dance in public. making me an auction fom.Calling bim a bastard was putting it mildly!

Walking from the third floor back to the firat, the deafening munle hit me again, the dance floor a blur of lighte and color

A polo dancer war porforming on stage. mot with cheers from
the men below, the atmosphere electric.

And about five or six meters above the stage was the room where Adam and I had just been!


Looking out from the third floor, those were transparent floor-to-ceiling windows. But from the first floor, they were one-way mirrors. My dance had been invisible to those below.and the auction's subject wasn't me at all, but the dancers downstairs.I hadn't been put up for auction like merchandise.

At least he was still a man after all.

\---

The next morning, the hospital corridors seemed endless. My body ached from tension, my mind replaying last night's events like a broken record.

"Mrs. Lancaster?" A nurse appeared beside me. "Dr. Morgan's team has arrived."


Relief made my knees weak. He'd actually done it. Despite everything, Adam had kept his word.
###Chapter 41

Stella's POV

At ten o'clock in the evening, the doors of the operating room finally swung open.

Luke emerged, clad in green surgical scrubs. He removed his mask with one hand, revealing his refined features and gold-rimmed glasses.

"Mr. Morgan..." I hurried to him, my voice laden with worry.

"The surgery was a success," Luke announced before I could ask, aware of my anxiety.

I exhaled deeply, feeling an immense weight lift from my shoulders.

"Mr. Morgan, thank you so much." My gratitude was evident.

Luke recalled Adam's serious demeanor when he sought help the previous night. Despite his apparent displeasure, Adam had still come to Luke, which was unusual.

"You should thank Adam, your husband," Luke said thoughtfully."You... know about Adam and me...?" I was taken aback."Even James doesn't know, how did you...?""My brother is clueless." Luke said, mocking James.

The entire Morgan family attended Johns Hopkins Universíty for medical school. James, who spent his time with music and never visited the campus, was the odd one out.

In truth, Luke and Adam were close friends, with James tagging along because of Luke.

"Once your grandmother's condition stabilizes, you can visit her,
" Luke said, handing me a business card. "I have another surgery soon. If you have any questions, call me."

I thanked him again.

For the next two days, I stayed at the hospital until my grandmother's vitals returned to normal.

As the 72-hour mark approached, Brian stormed into the hospital just as I returned from a high-end medicinal cuisine restaurant with porridge for my grandmother.

"Stella, why didn't you answer my calls?" Brian's anger quickly turned to mockery. "You claim to care about the old lady,but in the end, you abandoned her for your own sake!"

I looked at him, irritation evident. "My grandmother is out of danger, so there's no need for your concern, dear nephew. As for the calls-"After a brief pause, I remembered, "OOh, sorry, I blocked you."

"You blocked me?" Brian was incredulous, as if deeply offended.

吕
I retorted, "Why keep a cheating scumbag unblocked?"

Luke happened to be at the hospital for a follow-up on my grandmother and nearly burst out laughing at my words.

"Mr. Lancaster, what a coincidence!" Luke greeted Brian politely.

Brian immediately understood that I had sought Luke's help.

With a cold glance at me, Brian turned and left.

"Sorry you had to witness that," I said, unreservedly comparing Brian to trash.


Luke chuckled, "No need to be so formal."

Satisfied with my grandmother's recovery, Luke left after his examination.


\---

Adam's POV"Who would have thought your wife could be so witty? The rumors about her were clearly unfounded!" Luke mused.glancing at me."Hey! I'm complimenting your wife, what's with the reaction?"Luke looked at me quizzically. "Could it be possessiveness?"

Possessiveness implies affection. Could a man as detached as I truly have feelings for Stella?

Luke shifted the topic.

"Speaking of which, it's odd that John shows no concern for his own mother's well-being, while Stella, an adopted daughter,is the one running around. And that newly returned Lucy-she could have asked Brian to get the doctor, but she stayed out of sight, giving Brian the chance to manipulate Stella."

I frowned at this. "Manipulate?"

"Yes, only Mr. Weber and I could perform that surgery domestically," Luke said, puzzled. "Didn't you know? Didn't you call me to help Stella?"

Because Stella and I had made a deal. I had nearly trampled on her dignity to strike that bargain.

"You can leave now," I said coldly, suddenly dismissing Luke.

Luke,"?"I summoned Taylor to investigate what had transpired between Stella and Brian at the hospital. Indeed, Brian had threatened Stella, and she had retorted sharply before coming to me.Rubbing my temples, I recalled the lookin Stella's eyes when T forced her to dance by the floor-to-ceiling window-disbelief,a blend of sorrow and forced resilience, helpless yet isolated.bearing it all alone.

I felt a wave of irritation.

Lighting a cigarette, I mused that even if I had wronged her, I shouldn't feel guilty. Survival of the fittest is the law of this world. But why was I so unsettled?

Returning to the Lancaster manor, Joseph greeted me cheerfully.Not seeing Stella, he asked, "Mrs. Lancaster didn't come back with you?"

I frowned. "She's not home?"

Joseph replied, "Madam hasn't been back for several days,saying a relative is ll. I assumed you were with her."

I clicked my tongue inwardly. She was indeed devotedI to her grandmother. Were the Winstons all dead, leaving her to care for the old lady alone?

Joseph cautiously inquired, "Did you have a quarrel with Madam?"

"No," I scoffed.

Joseph remained silent.I was a light sleeper. but that night I barely slept at all. Every time I closed my eyes. Stella's helpless and aggrieved expression haunted me. So pitiful.

I sat up in frustration. Damn it!

\---

The next day.

After Taylor briefed me on the day's schedule, he noted. "Sir.you didn't sleep well last night. Shall I make you a coffee?"

I didn't respond.

"Get me the personnel and activity schedule for Project C." I ordered.


Taylor immediately arranged it.

By the time I reached the office, the schedule was already on my desk. I quickly scanned it and asked, "Stella hasn't been working lately?"

"According to protocol, Madam's work with our company is a mutual selection, so her assignments aren't managed by PR.But this can be changed! I'll consult the planning department!"I nodded in satisfaction, pausing as my fingers tapped the document. "Assign this project to her."I wanted her to be the styling director for the group's promotional ambassador event. Despite her limited experience.I had an inexplicable trust in her.

"I'll arrange it right away."

\---

Stella's POV

When I received a call from GT's planning department at the hospital, I didn't immediately agree. I called back, explaining that I had personal matters to attend to and couldn't take on work at the moment.


I knew the project was a rare opportunity, and as a collaborator, I had an obligation to support GT Group's initiatives. If I leave, who would take care of my grandmother?

"Stella, seize the opportunity. There are doctors and nurses here,don't worry about me," grandmother urged. "The Winston family already owes you a lot."

"Grandmother, but I owe you too." She had taken care of me when I was young. Without her, I might not have survived.

In the end,grandmother persuaded me, and I started working that afternoon.The promotional ambassador for GT Group was a nearly fifty-year-old international film star. Following his preferences,I selected a pinstripe bespoke suit.

Styling a male star was easier than a female star, but it required meticulous attention to detail.

As I was choosing the final accessories for the actor. Adam arrived.


"Sir, what brings you here?" The planning manager was startled, quickly approaching him.

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw him in the wheelchair enter.His presence was commanding, impossible to ignore. Even in a wheelchair, he was so handsome. Why was he here?

The room fell silent.

I immediately refocused on my work, finishing the actor's styling. I was the only one who remained composed and continued working.

"Just looking around," Adam replied. The planning manager dared not speak further.

"That lady looks unfamiliar," Taylor pointed at me deliberately.

I rolled my eyes inwardly. Unfamiliar, my foot!She's our seasonal guest stylist, a talented young professional,"the planning manager explained respectfully. "Shall I have hercome over to meet you?"

Adam said nothing, and Taylor couldn't discern his intentions.

The planning manager stood there, anxious.

Even with my back to him, I couldfeel his intense gaze.

Just as I turned, Adam wheeled around and left.

Taylor hurried after him.

I slowly straightened up, glancing in the direction Adam had left.


Why was he here? Inspecting his territory? But I distinctly felt his gaze like a thorn in my back. I thought he would call me over to make things difficult,yet he left without a word? ###Chapter 42

Adam's POV

My schedule was packed, and next up was a multinational conference with Europe.

As usual. I berated every participant without exception.

Mark came to GT Group to see me.

"Adam, are you in a bad mood lately? Your executives have been complaining to me, saying their boss is utterly inhumane."

A few of the higher-ups, knowing Mark's close relationship with me, had sent him to probe and find out if someone had offended me.

I glanced at him indifferently, "None of your business."

Mark said, uninvited, as he sat in the chair opposite me. "After all, I'm your friend."

I was losing patience. "If you have nothing to do, get out."

"Did you have a fight with Stella? Dior has just released two new rare leather bags. Women love these things; it would be easy to appease her!" Mark suggested. I looked at him. Dior? It probably wouldn't be as effective as a ten-dollar drink from a street vendor.

I nodded towards the door, signaling Mark to leave.

Mark shrugged. gave an "OK" gesture, and quickly left.

The office fell silent. I opened the drawer on my right,revealing two auction invitations.

I called Taylor. "Tell Stella to accompany me to an auction tonight."

Perhaps she would be interested.

\---

Stella's POV

"An auction?" I looked at the gown Taylor brought and didn't take it. "I am busy."

Taylor continued holding the large box with the gown. "Madam, Mrs. Winston's condition has stabilized. and Adam has informed the Winston family to take over her care. You can leave without worry. Additionally, whether as GT's collaborating stylist or as Mrs. Lancaster, Mr. Lancaster wishes for your attendance." There were two implications. First, the Winston couple would arrive soon, and if I didn't leave, I would have to face those repulsive people. Second, if I didn't cooperate. he would use my role as a collaborating stylist to compel me to go.

I almost laughed in anger. "He has trained you well."

Taylor felt a chill down his spine and nodded. "You flatter me.Madam."


A familiar Bentley with a recognizable license plate approached.It was the Winston family's car.

I frowned, not expecting them to arrive so quickly!

I truly didn't want to see them, and my grandmother... she probably wanted to see her son more now.

"I don't like the designer of this gown," I said, glancing at the gown before putting it back.

Taylor immediately understood. "Winter's owner is on good terms with Adam. Madam can go there now to choose."

Winter was one of Manhattan's top styling studios,usually serving only elite socialites and a few top actresses. Located in a Western-style building in the city center, it had a "closed"sign at the door. Taylor led me directly upstairs, where we were greeted by a young,mixed-race man in his twenties with dyed silver-gray hair and a trendy, avant-garde style.

"This is Cyril." Taylor introduced the silver-haired man without further explanation.

I was well aware of Cyril's identity-one of the leading young designers, who had won numerous awards by the age of twenty-five and was hailed as the future of personal styling in the fashion world.


Cyril was very friendly, giving me a gentlemanly bow. "Miss.you can choose any gown here. What style do you prefer? I would be honored to serve such a beauty!"

"No need, thank you," I raised my hand to decline. "Ican manage on my own."

I didn't like others styling me; I was a stylist myself. In less than an hour, I had put together a look that was both comfortable and appropriate.

Adam's POV When I arrived at Winter, I saw Stella standing by the floor-to-ceiling window, overlooking the bustling streets below.She wore a dreamy purple gradient gown, her hair styled in loose,elegant waves, mostly gathered on the left side, both graceful and convenient. Her exquisitely beautiful face was lightly made up, not overly refined, but just enough to make her look stunning and cool.giving off an aura that invited admiration from afar.


I recalled hearing people describe Stella: she was otherworldly.a dream unattainable.


"Miss. you are simply a muse sent from heaven! Not only are you beautiful. but you also have impeccable taste and style!"Cyril's eyes sparkled as he looked at Stella, as if he had discovered a treasure. "Miss. may I have your phone number?Or Facebook? It would be my greatest honor!"

I frowned in displeasure. Why was she so popular?

"Sir," Taylor was the first to notice me.

Stella turned at the sound. seeing me in an iron-gray bespoke suit, seated in my wheelchair. This was the first time she had looked at me directly since our unpleasant encounter at the Lancaster estate.


Her gaze was calm to the point of indifference, as if she were merely seeing a business partner, not the one who had defended me at the Lancaster mansion.


"Mr. Lancaster, taking me to an auction, be careful not to embarrass yourself," Stella reminded me. Before I could respond, Cyril interjected, "Miss, your presence will be the crowning glory of the event. How could it be embarrassing?"

He persisted, "-May I have your Facebook?"

Stella readily agreed, "Of course."

She really dared to add him, and right in front of me.

Just as she took out her phone. before she could unlock it, my hand reached over, and her palm was empty.

I held Stella's phone, turned off the screen lock, and looked at Cyril expressionlessly.“Should I send you back to Europe?"

Cyril shook his silver-gray head like a rattle. "No! If I go back,I'll be forced into the family business! I won't go back!"

I gave Cyril a cold glance, then turned my gaze back to Stella,signaling her to follow me as I wheeled myself away.

My woman would always and only be mine.
###Chapter 43

Stella's POV

The evening air buzzed with the gentle purr of luxury engines as a parade of high-end vehicles pulled up to the mansion.

Women draped in designer gowns and men in impeccable suits flowed through the grand entrance like a river of wealth and prestige. I sat beside Adam in his wheelchair, feeling the weight of countless stares as we made our way inside.

"Nervous, Mrs. Lancaster?" Adam's voice held that hint of amusement that always made my pulse quicken.

"Hardly," I replied, keeping my voice low. "Though I'm curious why you suddenly wanted me at this auction."

"Perhaps I enjoy watching you make others uncomfortable."His thumb traced small circles on my wrist where his hand rested."You have quite a talent for it."

The whispers followed us like persistent shadows:

"Did you hear? That's Adam Lancaster..."

"And that woman with him..."

"Isn't she Brian Lancaster's ex-fiancée?"
 
I kept my expression neutral, channeling years of social 
training into maintaining a facade of elegant indifference.

"Their words bother you?" Adam asked, his voice carrying that dangerous edge I was starting to recognize.

"Not at all," I smiled sweetly.′′Istopped caring about others'opinions when I learned how easily they could be bought."

His low chuckle sent warmth spreading through my chest. "My clever wife."


The auction hall was a masterpiece of modern luxury. We were seated in the front row - prime position for both viewing and being viewed.

"Well, if it isn't my *dear* adopted sister."

Lucy's voice cut through the general murmur, dripping with fake sweetness. She stood before us in a designer gown, Brian hovering at her shoulder like an expensive accessory.

"I trust Grandmother is doing better?" Her smile was razor-sharp. "Though I suppose you wouldn't know, being so *busy*with your new... husband."

I felt my fingers curl into fists, but Adam's hand found my knee under the table, his touch both warning and reassuring. "Getting angry?" he whispered, his breath warm against my ear."Don't let her have that satisfaction." "Lucy," I matched her saccharine tone, "how thoughtful of you to ask about Grandmother. I'm sure she'd be touched to know you even remember her."

Brian stepped forward, his practiced charm failing to mask the predatory gleam in his eyes. "Stella, if you need any help with the bidding tonight. I'd be happy to-"

"My wife doesn't need your help," Adam's voice cut through the air like ice.


"Here." He handed me a bidding paddle, hisfingers lingering against mine. "Use it as you see fit. "

I raised an eyebrow. "And if I bankrupt your company?"

His smile was pure sin. "Then I'll have to think of creative ways for you to repay the debt."

The heat in his gaze made me catch my breath, but Lucy's shrill voice interrupted before I could respond.

The first item was a limited edition bag-one of only five in existence. I noticed Lucy's eyes light up as the bidding began.

"One million dollars," Lucy called out immediately, her voice carrying that entitled confidence I knew so well. "Waiting to strike?" Adam murmured as I remained still. I smiled slightly. "Every predator knows timing is everything." I wnited until the bidding reached three million before raising my paddle. Lucy's head snapped toward me, her expression darkening.

"Three point five million." she countered.

"Four million." I replied smoothly.

"Four point five!"

"Five million."

Lucy's face was flushed with determination. "Five point six million!"


I lowered my paddle, catching the flash of satisfaction in her eyes. She thought she'd won. not realizing I'd never wanted the bag in the first place.

"Well played." Adam's voice held genuine appreciation."Though I'm curious - why stop there?"

"Because," I leaned closer, lowering my voice, "sometimes the sweetest victory is watching someone else pay for their own defeat." His laugh was barely audible. "Remind me never to get on your bad side, Mrs. Lancaster."The pattern continued through the next several lots. Every time Lucy showed interest in an item, I would drive up the price before gracefully bowing out. By the time she won a diamond necklace for five million over its estimated value, Brian's face had turned an interesting shade of gray.

"You're enjoying this," Adam observed during a brief pause between lots.


"Shouldn't I?" I challenged. "You allowed."

His smile was dangerous. "But you haven't bought a single item."


"And now, ladies and gentlemen," the auctioneer's voice carried across the hall, "the third-to-last item - the historic vineyard in Bordeaux."


The starting bid was one billion. A respectable sum for such a prestigious property, though still well below its true value to the right buyer.

"Ten billion."

Adam's voice cut through the shocked silence like a blade.I turned to stare at him, unable to hide my disbelief."Mr. Lancaster," I whispered urgently, grabbing his arm, "that vineyard isn't worth more than five billion at most! Have you lost your mind?" His hand covered mine, his touch sending electricity through my skin. "Tell me, Mrs. Lancaster, do you think I'm the type of man who doesn't know exactly what he's buying?"

"But-"

"Or perhaps," his voice dropped lower, eyes dancing with that dangerous amusement I was starting to recognize, "you're worried about my financial situation?"

I flushed. "Of course not, I just-"

"Then trust that your husband knows what he's doing." His thumb traced my bottom lip, making my breath catch.

Across the room, Lucy's face had lost all color. Brian's expression was a study in barely contained fury. The auctioneer.recovering from his shock, began the countdown.

"One hundred billion going once... going twice... sold to Mr.Lancaster!"

As applause filled the hall, Adam leaned closer to me. "You see.Mrs. Lancaster, there are times when the price of something isn't about its market value." "Now then," his voice dropped to that dangerous register that always made my pulse jump, "shall we discuss how you managed to cost Lucy over ten million dollars tonight without spending a cent?" 
I couldn't quite hide my smile."I have no idea what you mean,
Mr. Lancaster. I simply participated in the auction as any good wife would."

"Is that so?" His laugh rumbled through me where our shoulders touched. "My troublesome wife. Always finding new ways to surprise me."

"Speaking of surprises," I ventured, "are you going to tell me the real reason you bought that vineyard?"

His eyes held secrets I couldn't begin to decipher. "Perhaps.Over a glass of wine from our new vineyard?"

"Our vineyard?" I echoed, startled by his choice of words.

His smile turned wicked, "I thought you would like it."

I suddenly remembered that Brian had a penchant for collecting wine, and sure enough, when I turned my head,I saw him gnashing his teeth, clearly reluctant to let go of the vineyard.

I instantly felt the same joy as Adam.
###Chapter 44

Stella's POV

"Lot 157- A limited edition car. Only three exist worldwide."The auctioneer's voice carried crisp authority."Opening bid at fifty million dollars."

Brian's paddle shot up immediately. "Sixty mmillion!"

Really? Starting with such an aggressive raise? I felt Adam's subtle gesture beside me more than saw it. A slight tilt of his head - our prearranged signal. Keeping my expression neutral,I raised my own paddle. "Sixty-one million."

Brian's head whipped around so fast I thought he might give himself whiplash. His polished facade cracked, revealing the petulant child beneath. "Stella, are you sure you have enough funds?"


"Dear nephew, you seem awfully concerned about my finances."I twisted the paddle with deliberate grace. That's right,dance to my tune. "How... touching."

"Add another million!" Brian's voice carried an edge of desperation that made me want to laugh. Oh, this is better than I expected. "Then we'll add one as well." I maintained my serene smile,though inwardly I was running calculations. His properties are mostly illiquid assets, and after Lucy's earlier shopping spree...

As the bidding continued, I leaned slightly toward Adam. "His liquid assets are nearly depleted, aren't they?"

Adam's eyebrow rose fractionally. "How did you arrive at that conclusion?" His tone held genuine curiosity.

"Lucy just spent several hundred million trying to outbid me earlier. Brian has considerable assets, but not much liquidity."

A ghost of amusement crossed Adam's face. "You seem to enjoy watching Brian squirm."

"Me? Never." I kept my voice innocent, but couldn't quite hide my satisfaction as the hammer fell at one hundred and ninety million dollars, with Brian's final desperate bid. His triumphant grin looked strained around the edges. Checkmate, dear nephew.


\---

"The final lot of the evening - an exceptionally rare Colombian emerald bracelet, previously owned by European royalty." Before the auctioneer could finish his introduction, Adam's voice cut through the murmurs like a blade. "Two hundred million." The room fell silent. Even the auctioneer seemed momentarily stunned. Show-off, I thought, but couldn't help feeling impressed by the casual display of power.

Brian's laugh held a bitter edge. "Ten billion for a winery,and now this. Uncle Adam, you certainly know how to spend money." His emphasis on 'uncle' dripped sarcasm.

Oh,you petty little man. "Not as generously as your girlfriend,"I interjected smoothly. "Lucy, you spent an extra hundred million today just to outbid me, didn't you? Such dedication to art appreciation."

"What do you mean? Clearly, you were outbidding me!" Lucy immediately retorted.

I smiled, not denying it.

\---

In the contract signing room, Adam held out the emerald bracelet. "For you."

"Idon't need it." I kept my voice firm, though the bracelet was stunning. I won't be bought with jewelry, no matter how exquisite.

"Taylor." Adam's tone was dangerously calm. "Throw it away." "Wait!" I grabbed his arm, mentally cursing his stubbornness."You could give it to someone else." Like your mother, you impossible man.

"Playing hard to get?" Lucy's sneer carried across the room."So pretentious!"

I ignored her, worried that Adam might really smash the jade.

After all, keeping the jade jewelry at Adam's Lancaster Manor would still be his.

I signed the papers.

A staff member approached Brian hesitantly.

"I apologize, Mr. Brian Lancaster, but your account balance appears insufficient for the vehicle purchase. Would you prefer to use a different card or write a check?"


Brian's face drained of color. "That's impossible!" Oh, but it is.And it's absolutely delicious.

"It's only twenty million dollars - what kind of joke is this?"Lucy's voice rose shrilly.

I couldn't quite suppress my smile. "Don't worry. The penalty for breach of contract is only forty percent." Time for the coup de grâce.

"Stella, what are you saying?" Lucy was about to retort but noticed Brian's grim expression. She whispered, "Brian, you really..." "Shut up!" Brian snapped.

Lucy's faceturned red with anger.

"Does Brian really not have that much money?" someone couldn't help but gossip.

"Who knows. nineteen billion isn't nineteen dollars," someone else chimed in. "You only know who's really broke when it's time to pay."

"Stella,you should worry about your husband's payment,"Brian didn't believe Adam could come up with that much money. After all. Adam had spent twenty billion in total.

"This gentleman has already settled the payment," the waiter said.


Brian's face turned ashen, pointing at Adam in disbelief, "You...how could you..."

"Brian, he is your uncle. How dare you point at him?" I interrupted him lightly.

Brian reflexively withdrew his hand, his face alternating between green and white, his eyes still fixed on Adam. The underground parking garage felt cavernous at this hour.our footsteps echoing off concrete walls. The familiar scent of
expensive leather and Adam's cologne filled the car's interior.

"Ineed to speak with Lucy." I touched Adam's arm lightly,feeling the tension in his muscles.

His eyes narrowed. "Alone?"

"Don't worry, I have no interest in your nephew. This is between Lucy and me." Though I wouldn't mind if he happened to overhear what I'm about to say to his precious girlfriend.

After a long moment, he nodded. "I'll wait in the car." The unspoken warning in his tone made me want to roll my eyes.As if I needed protection for this.

Lucy was already walking toward her vehicle when I caught up to her, her heels clicking rapidly on the concrete.′′Come to apologize for tonight? Save it! I'll make sure my parents know exactly how heartless you are!"

"You don't deserve an apology." I kept my voice level,though anger simmered beneath the surface. "I'm here to remind you that if you don't want to be labeled as unfilial, you should visit Mrs. Winston in the hospital." "Why should I visit that old woman? What can you do about it-ah!" Before she could finish, I grabbed her and slammed her onto the hood of a nearby car.I looked at her with a cold expression, my eyes sharp. My voice was calm but commanding, "Lucy,you should call her Grandma!"


"That 'old woman'is your grandmother!" I tightened my grip slightly, channeling years of martial arts training into precise pressure.

"Let go! You're just a bitch-ow, that hurts!"

"Say it." My voice dropped dangerously low."Say'grandmother.' Can you manage that simple word?"

Lucy struggled, but I pressed her head harder against the wall,making it impossible for her to break free.

I increased the pressure and slowly taught her, "Grand-ma,can you say it?"

If not, I'll teach you until you can!

###Chapter 45

Stella's POV

"Just say it!" I pressed Lucy harder against the car hood,my voice dangerously calm. "What should you call her?"

Lucy's perfectly styled hair was now a mess, her designer dress wrinkled against the cold metal. Her previous arrogance had dissolved into panic as she realized I wasn't the pushover she'd assumed.


"You're crazy!" she shrieked, struggling uselessly against my grip. "Brian! Help me!"

I caught Brian's reflection in the car's window.

He took half a step forward, then stopped, uncertainty written across his face. The same man who'd tried to blackmail me at the hospital now seemed unsure whether to intervene.

"I asked you again," I maintained steady pressure, years of self-defense training evident in my controlled movements. "What do you call her?"

Maybe this wasn't how a proper lady should behave, but I was done playing nice. "Gran... Grandmother!" Lucy finally choked out. "Good girl." I released her with a slight push, watching her stumble away. "See? That wasn't so hard."

Lucy's face was a mottled red as she tried to salvage her dignity, frantically smoothing her ruined dress. "You'll regret this! Mom and Dad will-"

"Will what?" I cut her off coldly. "Tell everyone how their precious daughter got manhandled in a parking lot? Go ahead."

The sound of an approaching engine made us all turn. Adam's Bentley glided to a stop nearby, Taylor emerging to open the passenger door.

I could feel Adam's gaze through the tinted windows,though I couldn't see his expression. Had he witnessed my little display of temper?

"This isn't over," Lucy hissed, retreating to Brian's side.

"It never is with you." I straightened my own dress, which hadn't wrinkled despite the altercation."Now if you'll excuse me, I have a grandmother to visit."

\--- The car's interior was silent as we pulled away from the auction house. I could feel Adam's unspoken questions hanging in the air. "I apologize for making a scene," I said finally, staring straight ahead. "But she owns it."

Adam remained quiet, his eyes closed as if meditating. Just as the silence became unbearable, he spoke."The hospital?"


I nodded. grateful he wasn't pressing for explanations about the parking lot incident. "Please."

The rest of the ride passed in silence, but it felt less tense than before. Maybe he understoodI that sometimes. even a lady needs to fight back.

\---

The hospital corridors seemed colder than I remembered. Or maybe it was just the icy stare Anna Winston, my adoptive aunt, gave me as I approached Grandmother's room.

"What are you doing here?" She planted herseIf firmly in the doorway. "Haven't you caused enough trouble?"

Through the partially open dloor, I could see Grandmother surrounded by "real" family members. She was smiling - a rare sight these days - as Lucy's mother showed her something on her phone.

"I just want to check on her," I kept my voice low, professional."Five minutes."

"She's with family now," Anna's emphasis on 'family' cut like a knife. "She was asking for Lucy earlier. Her real granddaughter.11


Real granddaughter. Right. Because fifteen years of love meant nothing compared to DNA.

Each word was carefully chosen to wound.

"I see." I took a step back, my heels clicking softly on the linoleum. "Please tell her I came by."

"Oh, we will." Anna's smile didn't reach her eyes. “You can go now.”


I turned and walked away, my spine straight, my steps measured. I wouldn't give her the satisfaction of seeing me run.

It was me who asked the doctor to save her,now they even would not let me see grandmother.How heartless!

Adam was waiting by the elevator, exactly where I'd left him.One look at my face told him everything he needed to know.

"They wouldn't let you in?"

"They let me know where I stand." I pressed the down button perhaps harder than necessary. "Apparently blood is everything.
11

"Is it?" His voice held an odd note I couldn't quite read. "Isn't it?" I laughed without humor. "Even Grandmother smiles more for them now."


The elevator arrived with a soft ding. As we stepped in. Adam's hand found the small of my back, steadying me.

"Until you find your real family," his voice was low, meant only for me, "your only family is me."

The words hung between us as the elevator descended. They should have sounded possessive, controlling. Instead, they felt almost like...comfort.

\---

The Lancaster manor was silent when we returned, most of the staff already retired for the night. I made my way to my room on autopilot, my mind still processing the evening's events.

Lucy's spite. Anna's cruelty. Grandmother's smile- not for me.

And Adam's warm words:your only family is me.

We had a deal, didn't we? A transaction, clean and simple. He'd helped save Grandmother. Now it was my turn.

I opened my wardrobe, fingers trailing over silk and lace. The deep crimson negligee I'd never dared wear caught my eye. Who was I kidding? Nothing with Adam was ever simple.
I changed quickly, before I could overthink it. The mírror showed exactly what I'd hoped - the perfect mix of elegance and seduction. The negligee slipped over my head like liquid fire. The silk clung in all the right places, the hem hitting mid-thigh. I looked... dangerous.

Each step toward Adam's study felt like a choice. Not just fulfilling a deal, but maybe... starting something new.

Three doors down. Two. One.

Well, Mr. Lancaster, let's see if you meant what you said about family.
 ###Chapter 46

Adam's POV

I stared at the untouched whiskey in my glass, still calculating the auction numbers from tonight. Twenty billion in one night.Tomorrow's news would surely explode.

"Sir," Taylor cleared his throat, "Several Lancaster Group directors were at tonight's auction. They might have recognized you..."

A slight smile played at my lips. Let them wonder. These old men had grown too comfortable.

A knock interrupted Taylor's report. When the door opened, all my carefully constructed thoughts vanished.

Stella stood there in a deep red silk robe that made my throat tighten. Her hair was still damp from bathing, a few strands clinging to her neck. The robe had slipped slightly, revealing her delicate collarbone, and my gaze involuntarily followed a water droplet as it slid along that elegant line.

"I'll... report back later," Taylor said quietly, practically fleeing.Stella walked deliberately toward my desk. Each step made the silk ripple, and despite my efforts to maintain composure, my gaze was inexorably drawn. "Working so late?" her voice was honey-sweet,with a hint of teasing. She leaned against my desk, dangerously close. "The auction must have left you...exhausted?"

"Mrs. Lancaster." I forced my voice to remain steady, though heat was rising within me. "What brings you to my study so late?"


She leaned forward slightly, her post-bath fragrance wafting subtly - an expensive yet understated scent that made my pulse quicken involuntarily. "Can't a wife come see her husband?"


I stood, unconsciously moving behind her. Close enough to feel the warmth radiating from her body, yet not quite touching. "Of course she can," I murmured near her ear, "But we both know this isn't our reaI relationship, don't we?"

Her breath caught. I watched goosebumps rise on her neck as my breath stirred her hair. "This isn't..."

"Isn't what?" I let my fingertips ghost over her shoulder,feather-light. She trembled. "Choose your words carefully, Mrs.Lancaster." She turned to face me, the silk robe opening slightly. My wwatch fell to the carpet as I finally gave up pretending I could resist touching her.Every inch of her body seemed to be G od's finest work, perfect to the point of challenging one's senses and., my primal desires.


One hand settled on her waist, the other threading through her damp hair. When I pulled her close, she gasped, her hands climbing to my shoulders. The silk beneath my palms was maddeningly thin. Leaning in-

"Someone might see-" she protested weakly as I lifted her.

"Then let them," I growled against her neck, but still wrapped my suit jacket around her as I carried her to the bedroom.

Her nails dug into my shoulders through my shirt. Each small gasp, every tiny movement made it harder to maintain clear thought.

The master bedroom was lit only by city lights through the floor-to-ceiling windows. I set her down but kept one hand at her waist, unable to completely break contact.

My tall frame blocked the ceiling light.

What covered her changed from my jacket to my shadow.

"Nervous?" She propped herself up with one hand while theother hooked around my neck, kissing me. She said,"Who's nervous?" I froze for a moment, then counterattacked, blocking both her defiant lips and her retreat.

"I'm grateful for what you did for my grandmother,so I'll keep my end of our deal,I-"she said softly.

Ice flooded my veins. My hand left her waist as if burned."Deal." The word was ash in my mouth. She had come to him to fulfill their transaction. Nothing like what I had thought.

I turned sharply and walked to the bathroom, needing space to cool down before saying something irretrievable. The door closed wvith more force than necessary.

Her voice came through the door: "I'm sorry, I... give me some time,please? I just... just need to adjust."

The shower did nothing to cool the anger burning in my chest.I wasn't angry at her, but furious with myself. For thinking this could transcend the boundaries of a deal. For daring to hope she might want to give more.

She was here out of obligation. Because she felt she owed me for helping her grandmother. This realization stirred something dark and possessive in my gut. I had once negotiated billion-dollar deals without flinching.But this woman... she made me feel out of control. Made me want things I had no right to desire. The soft rustle of silk came through the door. She was still there.Waiting.

My hand tightened on the tiles. I could stay here until she left.Continue playing this careful game of distance and restraint.

Or, I could make her understand that we had long since moved beyond the realm of mere transaction.

The water stopped. I grabbed a towel, not bothering to dry completely. Water droplets ran down my chest as I opened the door.


Stella stood by the window, silk robe pooled at her feet. Her nightgown could barely be called coverage. Hearing the door,she turned, and I watched her eyes widen as they took in my bare torso.

"Mr. Lancaster,I-"

"Don't mention the deal again." I crossed to her in three strides,pinning her to the window. My hand threaded through her hair, tilting her face up."Tonight, either be my real wife,or leave.Choose."


Her pupils dilated, breathing quickened. "Your wife," she said softly."Say it again." I moved closer, trapping her between the cold glass and my body. The water on my chest soaked through her gossamer-thin nightgown. "I am your wife." Her voice trembled slightly, but her hands slid up my chest with newfound boldness.

The last thread of self-control shattered. I kissed her with bruising force, swallowing her gasp. Her nails scraped my shoulders, her body arching into mine, the silk of her nightgown creating maddening friction.

Stella's POV

Adam grasped my hips, laying me down on the bed.positioning himself between my legs. I could feel his erection pressing against me.

"Gently."

I tried to push him away, but his lips found my jawline, and my body responded to his kisses. It seemed I had fallen for him unwittingly.

Our breaths mingled as he planted a series of fervent kisses along my neck, causing my body to arch involuntarily.

"Don't resist me."

With that, he pulled down my panties, exposing my trembling chest.When I felt his teeth on my breast, I squirmed; though it stung.his tongue glided over the bite, soothing the pain. The intense pleasure nearly drove me mad.

But he merely pressed his hardness against my thigh, rubbing slowly without entering.

I writhed, looking at him with a mix of shyness and frustration.

"Why are you looking at me like that?"

My cheeks flushed instantly.

"Please..."

"You're killing me," he whispered, attempting to enter until he succeeded. Then he pushed slowly, penetrating me with excruciating slowness. I felt a sharp pain.

He groaned, pushing deeper into me. I clung to his body,burying my head in his shoulder, my nails digging into his back. Each inch he advanced brought pain, and I moaned,stifling my screams against his neck. He groaned, delving deeper and deeper.

"So tight..." he gritted his teeth. "Are you okay?" He studied me, still inside, not moving. Of course, I wasn't okay. He was too thick. "It feels so good, so hot and tight." He exhaled, pushing in further,slowly but steadily, without stopping. He tried to kiss me while I suppressed a scream, tearing at his back with my nails. Damn! I opened my eyes. Too big. I thought,shifting my hips slightly, trying to adjust.


′′Ithink this is the limit... for now."

"Damn..."
###Chapter 47

Stella's POV

He smiled at my expression of suffering. The pain was transforming into something between heaven and hell. Feeling him inside me was so hot.


Then, he slowly pulled out, making me moan, then pushed in again, and I barely felt the pain anymore until he decided to move faster.

"Slow..." I whimpered.

′′I2'm sorry. But you really are killing me. I'm using one hundred percent of my self-control right now," he whispered.

I breathed. Right. I had to give him that because he had already given me so much. So, I nodded, capturing his lips.

Then he went faster, and it was both good and painful. It didn't take long before I wanted it faster, wrapping my legs around his hips, feeling him go deeper.

"Damn, you're so wet," he said. He increased the pace even more. The pain was almost imperceptible now, and the pleasure mixed with it was incredible. He was going so fast and was so big that it hurt delightfully. I hugged him tightly, trying to make him slow down.

"Please..."

He didn't stop; on the contrary. he held me tight. going even faster. Crushing my body with his weight. I couldn't take it anymore. I couldn't; I screamed and monned loudly.

My body was breaking apart again. He increased the force of his thrusts. I was almost begging him to stop. I screamed his name. and he buried his face in my neck. penetrating me with such force that I felt my muscles contracting inside me.

I could not remember how many times we had done until I fell in sleep.


\---

Morning light streamed through the window, casting a warm glow on my face. I groaned and turned over, reaching out to the other side of the bed. only to find the sheets cold where Adam should have been.


Memories of last night flooded back, causing my cheeks to burn. I buried my face in the pillow, inhaling the lingering scent of his cologne. It was so good, too good. I actually slept with him. Where did all my restraint go? In a moment of impulse, all the defenses I had meticulously built crumbled. And the way he looked at me, as if I were some precious treasure.

No, stop thinking about it, Stella.

"Good morning, madam." Joseph's cheerful voice nearly made me jump. "Mr. Lancaster left for the company early this morning."

The knowing smile on his face made me wish I could disappear. Did everyone in the manor hear us last night?Thinking about the sounds Adam made me utter...

"Thank you, Joseph," I tried to keep my voice steady, "I'll have breakfast in the garden."

\---

"What did you do?!" Sam's shriek nearly burst my eardrums.She had rushed over right after breakfast, eager to share the gossip.

"Keep your voice down!" I glanced around nervously,′′NCneed to let the entire manor know!"

′′P1lease, they probably heard everything last night." Sam raised an eyebrow suggestively,"So... how was it? I mean, considering he's in a wheelchair..." "Sam!" felt my face heat up again,'"He's perfectly normal,okay?" "I bet he is 'perfectly normal'." Her grin was infuriating.′′Bthe way.you're glowing. Last night must have been spectacular."


I threw a pillow at her face. "Can we change the subject?Please?"


"Alright, alright. But you should hear what people are saying.Poor Stella, climbing up to a disabled billionaire.' The old money crowd is having a field day."

I rolled my eyes. "Let them talk. They're more concerned about Brian's debacle at the auction."


"Oh my god, yes!" Sam leaned forward excitedly,′′Isit true he couldn't even afford that car? And Lucy! She spent so much just to outbid you - only to find out you were playing her! You're wicked,and I love it."


"Seeing her face was worth it." My smugness faded a bit,"But Adam spending billions on that vineyard was... unexpected."

"Unexpected?" Sam scoffed, "Darling, that man was marking his territory. Dropping three billion in one night - the entire elite circle is buzzing. Speaking of which, how's the Winston family?" My smile vanished instantly,′′Atoxic as ever." As if on cue, my phone buzzed: a message from the hospital saying Grandma could be discharged. Below that was an "invitation" from Anna for dinner. My stomach churned. More like a command.


Returning to the Winston estate after months, I felt nothing but alienation.


I deliberately arrived empty-handed. No matter what I brought,Anna would criticize it. Last time, I brought an expensive vase,and she called it a "cheap knockoff." The time before, it was premium tea, and she said I was "pretending to be cultured."

"No gift?" Predictably, Anna's tone was snide as she opened the door,"No manners. Then again, what can you expect from a stray?"

I bit my tongue until I tasted blood. "How's Grandma?"

"Expensive," she sneered, "But you probably have no idea how much proper care costs, do you? Living in a nursing home."

I followed her inside, counting my breaths to stay calm. They had placed Grandma in a small room next to the storage area,barely big enough for a bed and a tiny dresser. My blood pressure soared, but I maintained a neutral expression. This was their idea of "proper care"?

"Stella!" Grandma's face lit up, though she looked so frail, "You came!" "Of course I did." I took her hand, finding it icy cold. The room didn't even have heating. "How are you feeling?"

"Better than before. it's good to be home." Her smile trembled. "The family has been so kind, letting me stay here..."

Letting you stay here? I wanted to scream. In a place worse than a storage room, while Lucy had three guest rooms for her shopping hauls?

Dinner was pure torture. Lucy's smug face.John incessantly asking, "Where's Adam?", and Anna's endless lectures on family duty. I focused on my food, silently counting to ten.

"Three hundred thousand dollars." Anna's voice cut through dessert, as if discussing the weather. "Per month. For Grandma's care,of course."

So, this was her real intention. How greedy. I carefully set down my fork, resisting the urge to stab someone. "I see."

"That's the bare minimum," Anna continued, inspecting her manicure,"You know how expensive good care is. Just the heating for her room... and special dietary needs, medications... Special dietary needs? They fed Grandma reheated leftovers while they dined on fresh salmon."If it's too much?" Lucy's faux concern made me want to throw my wine in her face,′′Iknow a fashion director's salary might not cover it, but your husband is wealthy..."

"Money isn't the issue," I kept my voice steady, "But I have a condition."


Everyone stared at me. "Return the silver pendant you took.Lucy. Give it back, and the money is yours."

Lucy's face darkened, "That old thing? Why do you want that-"


"Deal or not?"

The pendant was the only thing my birth mother left me. Lucy knew that when she borrowed it for a photoshoot and never returned it.


"Fine." Her smile turned vicious, "But I don't see why you'd want a discarded trinket. Maybe we should charge for storage all these years?"

"Great idea!" Anna's eyes lit up, "Let's add another fifty thousand a month. Family heirloomns need special care..." I stood up, the chair scraping loudly against the floor. Better that sound than the scream building in my throat."I'll transfer the money tomorrow. Thanks for the dinner."
###Chapter 48

Stella's POV

After dinner, I went upstairs to pack my belongings.

The familiar scent still lingered in my old room, but everything else had changed. Lucy had shredded all my designer dresses thousands of dollars' worth of fabric now lay scattered like confetti. The sight pained me more than I cared to admit.

"Looking for something?" Lucy leaned against the doorframe,toying with my pendant, a mocking smile on her face.′′O-right, there's nothing here that belongs to you anymore."

I bit my tongue and continued packing the few remaining items into a cardboard box. An old photograph caught my eye-it was taken when I first learned I was adopted, a picture of me with my grandmother. God, we both looked so uncomfortable.


"Must be hard," Lucy drawled, "coming back to clean up the remnants of your fake life."

"Not as hard as watching you try to imitate me," I retorted,carefully wrapping my mother's music box. "Still playing dress-up in my old clothes, Lucy?" Her fingers dug into the doorframe. "These are my things now.Myroom.My family." Of course." I smiled sweetly. "But those dresses really don't suit you. They make your hips look huge."

Lucy's face turned crimson.′′At least I don't have to sleep with a cripple to maintain my lifestyle."

Her jab at Adam made my blood boil, but I kept my voice steady. "Yeah, you're just draining Brian's accounts. How's that going?"

"You little-" Lucy took a step forward but then stopped abruptly. A sinister smile spread across her face. "Actually,since you're leaving, let me see you off."

There was something in her tone that set off alarm bells. Lucy only used that voice when she was planning something particularly nasty.


\---

I had just reached the courtyard when Lucy stormed out,furious.


"I have a sapphire brooch missing. Did you take it?" she demanded angrily. It was evening, and neighbors were out for their post-dinner strolls. Several women turned to look at us. "Mom, have you seen my sapphire brooch? The one from my birthday last year?"

Damn. I knew that innocent tone too well.

Anna's hand flew to her throat, her performance Oscar-worthy."No,dear,what's wrong?"

"It's just..." Lucy's eyes filled with tears right on cue. "The last time I saw it was when Stella was in my room..."

The whispers started immediately:

"I knew there was something off about her..."

"These adopted kids..."

"And now she's married to that cripple man..."

Seeing those familiar faces from the social circle, I finally understood why Lucy had suddenly gone mad-she wanted to ruin my reputation through these ladies!

"We should check your box," Anna said firmly. "Just to be sure.11


Before I could stop her, Lucy had already upended my box onto the ground. The music box shattered, and there, among my belongings, lay a sapphire brooch I had never seen before. "Oh my God!" Lucy gasped."Mom,isn't that-" "My brooch!" Anna clutched her chest. "Stella, how could you?" 
I stood there, my mind racing. This was clearly a setup, but how could I prove it?

"Lancaster's wife."

The room fell silent. Adam appeared in the doorway, looking murderous. My savior had arrived, and he looked incredibly handsome!

"Mr. Lancaster!" Anna's voice turned sugary sweet. "What a surprise-"

"Save it." Adam's voice could freeze fire. "You're accusing my wife of theft?"

Lucy stepped forward. "Uncle Adam,we didn't mean-"

"Uncle?" He laughed coldly. "Funny, I don't know you.But I do remember your family's furniture import contract. Taylor?"

"Yes, sir." Taylor produced a tablet. "Shall I contact legal to terminate the contract?"

John practically ran into the room."Wait,Adam-"

"Wait?" Adam's smile was deadly. "Like you waited before accusing my wife in front of them?"
"Didn't I?" His eyes met mine.>hey were trying to destroy your reputation. You think I'd stand by and do nothing?" "I can handle it." John looked like he was about to faint. "We can discuss-"

"Can we?" Adam looked at me. "Ready to go?"

I nodded, my throat tight. As Taylor gathered my things,Adam's hand found mine.


"Oh, and Lucy?" Adam said as we left. "Next time you frame someone, don't use such an obvious fake."


\---

In the car, I finally exhaled the breath I'd been holding.Manhattan blurred past the window as I tried to process everything that had just happened.

"How did you know?" I finally asked.

"Someone was bullying my wife?" Adam squeezed my hand."I have my sources."

"You mean Taylor?"

He actually laughed. "He might have overheard a few things."

I studied his face. "You didn't have to do that. Threaten to terminate their contract." "I know." His thumb traced circles on my palm. "But you don't have to handle everything alone."

The impact of his words was greater than I expected. I thought of last night, how different things were now compared to our initial arrangement.

"Thank you," I whispered, leaning against his shoulder. There was a strange sense of security, a warmth in my heart.

His other hand stroked my hair. "No one can bully what's mine."

It should have sounded possessive. But somehow,for the first time,I felt protected.

\---

Lucy's POV

I watched their car disappear from sight, my nails digging into my palms.

"Bastard!" Dad was trembling with rage. "Lucy, you said he was just putting on a show-"

"I was wrong." The words tasted bitter. "He wasn't putting on a show at all."

He had effortlessly dismantled our plan... I had severely underestimated that man in the wheelchair. He had more power than anyone I knew.

"What do you mean,wrong?" Mom's voice turned sharp. "You said he was just a puppet!"

Dad slumped into a chair. "The penalty fees alone would bankrupt us. And our stock..."

"Maybe he's just bluffing." I said firmly.

Mom narrowed her eyes. "What if he's serious? Let that bitch and the cripple win?"

The fake brooch felt heavy in my pocket. It had been a perfect plan until Adam showed up.

Seeing the way he looked at Stella, as if he would destroy the world to protect her... This was no longer just about business.We had attacked someone he considered his.

I lowered my gaze, remaining silent.

If Adam was really just a pawn, could he have thrown around two billion dollars recently?

Even Brian's family suspected that Adam might be the president of another conglomerate.But I wouldn't remind them of this. I didn't want to admit that I had handed Stella over to a powerful, wealthy,and handsome man. Stella, just wait. Dad and Mom's love will always belong to me.
###Chapter 49

Stella's POV

My fingers lingered on the jewelry box for a moment, the events of last night still feeling like a dream-the auction, the confrontation with Lucy, and everything that followed...

I shook my head, trying to dispel those particular memories.This morning had already been awkward enough; I couldn't even look at Joseph without blushing.

"Mrs. Lancaster," speaking of Joseph... "Mr. Lancaster asked me to inform you that he is waiting for you in the garage."

What now? I wondered as I followed Joseph down to the underground garage. Just when I thought I was beginning to understand Adam Lancaster, he would do something completely unexpected.

It was my first time in the garage, and I was stunned the moment I stepped inside.

The lights flickered on, revealing a collection that would make any car enthusiast's heart race. Rolls-Royces, Bentleys,Lamborghinis-all with New York plates, all immaculately maintained. "For someone who claims to need a wheelchair,your taste in cars is quite extravagant," I couldn't help but tease. "Just a collection." Adam replied, but I noticed that familiar smile spreading across his face.


Then I saw it-the limited edition supercar that Brian couldn't afford at the auction. I couldn't help but laugh.

"What's so funny?" Adam stepped closer.

"Just imagining Brian's face when he finds out where his dream car ended up."

"Speaking of which..." He pulled out a car key. "Your driver's license is still valid, right?"

I blinked. "Yes, but-"

The key landed in my palm.

"Adam, I already have a car."

"Better than this one?"

"That's not the point-”

"Then it's settled." He reached out and gently brushed my hair,a gesture that felt inexplicably intimate. "Consider it a gift from your husband."

My heart started to race uncontrollably."You can't just-" "Can't I?" His voice dropped, and suddenly the temperature in the garage seemed to rise. "Last time you said I could do anything I wanted with my wife."

The possessiveness in his words should have infuriated me.Instead, it sent a warm flutter through my stomach. You're falling,Stella.




That evening, I finally had a chance to examine the silver pendant Lucy had "returned." The oxidized surface had darkened with age. The back bore a simple blessing-no indication that it was a Winston family heirloom.

Could this realy be a clue about my biological parents? So many years of questions...

I took several photos, trying to capture every detail, and sent a message to an old acquaintance: Need help tracing the origin of a pendant. Urgent.

As it neared eleven, I yawned and prepared to head to my room.


When I opened the door, I was shocked-my bedroom had been cleared out. Even the skincare products on the bathroom counter were gone. I found Joseph, who was overseeing the evening cleaning."Where are my things?" "Ah." Was that a hint of a smile in his eyes? "Your belongings have been moved to the master suite. Since you and Mr.Lancaster spent the night together..."

My face burned. "That was-I'm not-we didn't-"

I couldn't exactly explain that, despite being married to Adam,last night was an accident.

"Mr. Lancaster is in the study if you'd like to discuss the arrangement."

Great. Just perfect.

When I found Adam, he was on a video call, his fingers tapping the armrest of his wheelchair in that familiar way that indicated someone was testing his patience. I waited, rehearsing what I would say in my mind. How do you tell your pretend(but possibly not entirely pretend) husband that you're not ready to permanently share his bedroom?

He ended the call abruptly. "Is there a problem?"

"My things have been moved to your room."

"Our room," he corrected. "Unless Mrs. Lancaster has objections to my arrangements?""Mr. Lancaster," I struggled to keep my voice steady. "You can't just make these decisions without asking me." "Can't I?" His wheelchair rolled closer, and my heartbeat quickened. "If I recall correctly,you seemed quite comfortable in my bed last night."

My face burned even hotter. "That was different! I was-we were-"
"Were what?" His smile should be illegal.′′Do tell, Mrs.Lancaster."


I just wanted to confirm if letting me sleep in the master bedroom was really his idea.

"You're impossible," I muttered, turning to leave. He caught my wrist.


"Stella." All the teasing vanished from his voice."Stay."

One word. Just one simple word. But why did it feel like he was asking for so much more?




The master suite was beyond extravagant. The walk-in closet alone was larger than some apartments I had lived in. Seeing my clothes hanging next to his expensive suits made everything suddenly feel real and daunting. I saw my toiletries and skincare products placed next to his,and for a moment, I felt disoriented. After two months of marriage, I finally felt the reality of being married.


This feeling of having my private space invaded was completely new.


I was arranging my skincare products on the second vanity(yes, of course there were two) when warm hands settled on my waist.

"How can someone in a wheelchair walk so quietly!" I jumped,nearly knocking over an expensive serum. "Could you make some noise or something!"

"And miss this reaction?" His breath brushed against my neck."Never."


I turned to face him, determined to set some basic rules for personal space."Adam-"

His strong hand cupped my chin, tilting it up.

Soft lips met mine, cool and commanding. My eyes widened in surprise. His kiss silenced whatever I was about to say. One hand tangled in my hair, the other pulled me closer, and suddenly.rules seemed far less important than kissing him back. I don't know how long it lasted. He finally released me, wiping a trace of moisture from the corner of my mouth. How embarrassing-he was too good at this!

I stood there, still frozen, my mind blank. If last night's kiss was a calculated move on my part, what was this?

But I had to admit, his kissing skills were amazing,and his prowess in bed was top-notch.

When I finally regained my composure, I said, "This isn't fair."

"Who said anything about fair?" His thumb traced my lower lip. "Welcome home, Mrs. Lancaster."
###Chapter 50

Stella's POV

I stood at the entrance of the walk-in closet, my mind struggling to comprehend the sight before me. The entire left side was filled with brand new clothes-all in my size, all from top designers, with the tags still attached.

Fingering a silk dress, I wondered to myself: How did he know my size? But then again, this was Adam; of course, he could find out.


"Don't like them?"

His voice startled me, making my heart race. Damn it, how does he always manage to appear so silently?

"These are..." I gestured at the clothes, immediately wanting to kick myself for asking such an obvious question.

"For you?" His voice carried that infuriating mix of amusement and authority that always made my heart beat faster. "Unless you think I've suddenly developed an interest in women's fashion." He walked past me towards his own wardrobe area, his proximity in the confined space making me acutely aware of his presence. When I saw him reach for a pair of black boxer briefs, my face instantly flushed. Memories of the previous night flooded my mind. and I quickly averted my gaze.

"I had them prepared beforehand," he said nonchalantly.

The sound of water trickling from the bathroom reached my ears. I lay on the oversized bed, feeling a bit uneasy.

I had thought that Adam and I would just be a couple in name, not sharing a bed.

The sound of the bathroom door opening interrupted my thoughts. Adam emerged, wrapped in steam, wearing only those damn black boxer briefs, with water droplets still clinging to his shoulders.


My throat went dry. For someone who claimed to need a wheelchair, his physique was impossibly perfect.

"Why aren't you wearing any clothes?" I sat up abruptly,staring at him in alarm.

"I sleep naked," he announced matter-of-factly, his expression innocently suspicious."Don't you dare!" My voice came out more breathless than I intended. His smile should be illegal. "Scared, Mrs. Lancaster?""In your dreams." I tried to sound dismissive, but clearly failed.

"Help me out." He gestured to his damp hair with a towel.Seeing my hesitation, he added,′′Or would you prefer I catch a cold?"


I rolled my eyes but knelt on the bed to help him dry his hair.His hair was softer than I had imagined, and this domestic intimacy made my chest tighten.

I couldn't resist making a face at him in the mirror-only to find him watching me through the reflection.

"Having fun?"

"I_" Before I could finish, he turned and pulled me onto his lap. The towel fell aside, and I found myself straddling him,feeling his impressive size, his skin still warm from the shower.

"Perhaps," his voice dropped to that dangerous tone that always ignited a fire in my belly, "you need a reminder of who you're dealing with?" His lips found that sensitive spot behind my ear,and despite my efforts to resst, I melted in his arms. One hand tangled in my hair, the other slid under my nightgown, tracing patterns on my thigh that made coherent thought impossible."Adam..." My voice was a mix of warning and plea. "Yes. Mrs. Lancaster?" His teeth grazed my neck, making me shiver involuntarily. "What do you want to say?"

God, he was infuriating. But as his kisses trailed downward,I found myself lost.

His hand slid over my breasts and down my belly until it brushed over my clit. Yes. Right there... Damn it. Just the brushing almost made me lose my mind. His eyes were fixed on my face. But his hand disappeared.

I closed my eyes, wanting to immediately feel him bury himself inside me, my muscles pleading within me. I felt his wet and warm tongue on one of my nipples, sliding gently, and then his fingers in a slow and torturous touch around it.

I arched my bodly on the bed, moaning. I felt his fingers sink into my thighs. I heard him groan, satisfied, with his mouth still on one breast. His fingers grazed my thighs, teasing me,slowly moving up to my groin.

I wanted to scream and beg, but I felt my breath escape as his fingers slid over the bundle of nerves. He was driving me crazy with that teasing.

"Damn it. You're so wet..." He whispered, studying my face.I felt his mouth on my neck again, giving soft kisses, sliding his lips, and gently biting my ear. His fingers parted me, and then I felt his lips brushing against my clit. A loud moan escaped me, and I tried to involuntaríly close my legs, but he held them firmly. His tongue hit me for the first time, slowly. Damn it, there was no sensation in my life that could be compared to that.

I tried to control myself, but soon his tongue became insistent.I lost my mind quickly, moaning with pleasure from his hot and wet moves. His mouth was like heaven and hell at the same time.


\---

When I woke up, sunlight was already flooding the room, and I found myself unable to move.

At some point, Adam had wrapped himself around me like an octopus. One arm was draped under my chest, pinning my right hand, while the other was tangled in my hair,his warm chest pressed against my back.

This felt... too right. The thought scared me more than anything.

"Good morning." His voice, deep and husky from sleep, sent a shiver down my spine. I tried to move, but he tightened his grip.′′Mr.Lancaster,I need to get up." 
"Do you?" His lips landed on my shoulder, slowly kissing up to my neck. "I can think of a better way to start the day."

He guided my hand downward, and suddenly getting up didn't seem so urgent. Damn morning wood, this sexy man. I never thought I'd find myself wanting to stay in bed for a man.


\---

By the time I finally made it to the dining room,my right hand was nearly numb, and there were a few suspicious marks on my neck that no amount of concealer could hide. My legs felt like jelly.

Joseph's knowing smile as he served the coffee made me want to crawl under the table. "Would madam prefer breakfast in bed tomorrow?"

I nearly choked on my croissant. "No, thank you."

"Of course, madam." His tone was clearly disbelieving."Though I did notice you were using your left hand this morning..."

I focused intently on my coffee, refusing to acknowledge the heat rising to my face. Last night's "activities" had left my right hand embarrassingly weak. Damn Adam.
###Chapter 51

Stella's POV

The private dining room provided the perfect intimate setting for my lunch with Luke. He stood to greet me.

"What a pleasant surprise," he smiled warmly.

I placed a carefully wrapped gift on the table. "A small token of appreciation for saving my grandmother."

His eyes lit up at the sight of the tie-subtle enough for hospital wear, yet perfectly matching his elegant taste.

I feared he might refuse the gift, so I added, "I designed this tie myself."

His interest piqued, and he immediately accepted the gift. "Thank you, Mr. Lancaster!"

As we left, he noticed the car I was driving.

"Mr. Lancaster, this car is quite beautiful and... familiar."
 
I admitted, "I took it from Adam's collection." "I begged him to sell me this car, but he refused. Now he just gives it to you. He must love you so much!" he remarked."I begged him to sell me this car, but he refused. Now he just gives it to you. He must love you so much!" he remarked. 
Would you like to test the speed, Mr.Morgan?"

I believed no man could refuse such an invitation.


\---

Adam's POV

I wheeled myself into the VIP room, maintaining the facade I had grown weary of over the years. Mark and Luke were already there, wearing those irritatingly smug smiles.

"Why bother with the wheelchair when it's just us?" Luke teased,raising his glass.

"Our friend here is just too lazy to walk," Mark added, clearly enjoying the joke.

I shot them a cold glance. "Is there a reason for this meeting?"

"Do friends need a reason to get together?" Luke's smnile deepened as he signaled the waiter for another round. This guy always loved to stir things up.

I couldn't be bothered with their idle chatter, responding only when necessary. Let them think what they wanted; I had more pressing matters to attend to. After three drinks, Luke dramatically pulled out a gift box. "Take a look at this. What do you think?" He opened the box to reveal a silk tie. Deep green with subtle vine patterns.

"It's fine," I said, barely glancing at it. The sooner this tedious meeting ended, the better.

"Just fine?" Luke's tone held a hint of mischief. "This is a special thank-you gift from your wife, designed just for me."

My fingers tightened around the armrest. Stella had designed a tie for Luke.


"The pattern is unique," Luke continued, seemingly oblivious to the shift in atmosphere. "She even cleverly incorporated my name into it-"

I reached out and took the tie. It was mine now.

"Hey!" Luke protested. "That was a gift from her to me! I just wanted to show you-"

"Has Stella ever given you a gift, Adam?" Mark's question made my jaw clench.

"I'll compensate you," I forced myself to stay calm."Pick a car from my garage." Luke's eyes lit up, but I added,"Or you can try to take the tie back." He looked at me, then at the tie, and finally sighed. "Fine, keep it. Though I would have preferred the tie..." "Then no car." I said. stuffing the tie into my pocket, ignoring their knowing glances. My wife's first gift was not going to another man.


Taylor refilled our drinks, and the conversation shifted to other topics. But my thoughts remained on the tie in my pocket and Stella. It seemed she had time to design gits for others.


\---

Stella's POV

I finally sent off the last email to the GT Group's planning department at 11:30 PM. After staring at spreadsheets all day.my eyes were sore. All I wanted now was a hot bath and sleep.

The master bedroom still felt a bit strange-my things mixed with Adam's, my skincare products next to his aftershave. But the bed was so comfortable that I didn't have the energy to think about it.


I must have fallen asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow because the next thing I knew, the blanket was being pulled away, and a cold draft hit me, followed by someone pinching my nose.

"Stop it..." I mumbled, trying to burrow deeper into the covers. A strong hand grabbed my wrist, and something lightly tapped my cheek. "Stella, are you hibernating?" "Mr. Lancaster," I gritted my teeth and opened my eyes."You are the most annoying man in the world."

I tried to pull my hand away, but accidentally brushed against his cock... Oh. My. God.


"Sorry!" I immediately retreated under the covers, feeling my face burn.


"Mrs. Lancaster," his voice carried that dangerous tone that always made my heart race. "Where's my gift?"

I peeked out from under the covers, confused. "What gift?"

"You designed a tie for Luke."

Was he... jealous? The mighty CEO of GT,jealous over a tie?

"That was a thank-you gift for saving my grandmother!"I tried to hide under the covers again, but his grip tightened.

"One week."

"What?"

"You have one week to prepare my gift," his thumb traced circles on my wrist, sending shivers up my arm. "Make it special." I stared at him in disbelief. "Are you seriously jealous over Luke's tie?" He didn't answer, pulling me into his arms instead. His body heat seeped through my pajamas, and despite my annoyance, I couldn't help but relax.

"One week, Mrs. Lancaster," he whispered, his breath tickling my ear. "Don't disappoint me."

I could feel him fiddling with something in his pocket-probably Luke's tie. Such a possessive man. But as sleep began to claim me again, I couldn't help but smile. Who would have thought that the high and mighty Adam could be so childish over a small gift?

His arms tightened around me, and I heard him mutter something that sounded like "mine." Maybe I should indeed prepare a special gift, just to see that possessive gleam in his eyes again.
###Chapter 52

Stella's POV

I had been summoned to handle a high-profile styling task-evidently, one important enough to require my personal attention.


A young assistant spotted me and hurried over, clutching a clipboard. "Mrs. Lancaster! Thank you for coming on such short notice. The team is ready in Studio Three."

"Here we are," the assistant indicated a door. "This is for the new MOON Jewelry ad shoot. Their representative is already inside."


I pushed open the door and immediately froze.

Susan Miller lounged lazily on the luxurious studio sofa,expertly scrolling through her phone. The MOON Jewelry collection displayed on the nearby table explained everything-Lucy had been replaced.

The staff member behind me cleared his throat. "Miss Miller,this is our styling consultant, Mrs. Stella Lancaster. She will be handling your red carpet look today." Susan didn't bother to stand.′′NOneed for introductions. We know each other." "What a coincidence." I replied coolly.

Susan and I had a history-we attended the same elite private school. Despite her family's wealth. she always lingered in my shadow.


Her eyes narrowed slightly as she assessed my appearance. "I heard you're working at GTnow. but I didn't believe it. Quite a... surprising career choice."

I noticed everyone around Susan treated her with unusual deference. This level of respect was uncommon. even for a brand ambassador. Something was off.

"Of course." I conceded.

Susan's smile didn't reach her eyes. "While we wait, have you seen the latest social media buzz? Quite interesting."

She turned her phone screen towards me. displaying a provocative forum post: [Shocking! Stella Winston Climbs Another Ladder, Alleged Homewrecker!] Below was a photo of Luke and me getting into Adam's limited-edition supercar.

Damn. The angle made an innocent test drive look incredibly intimate.It must be Lucy fellow me and took this photo! "Seems you've been busy socializing," Susan said with feigned concern. "'First Brian, then Adam, now Dr. Morgan? You've always been an overachiever, Stella." I noticed the room's atmosphere shifting. Assistants exchanged knowing glances. and the makeup artist suddenly found her brushes very interesting.

Susan set her phone down with dramatic disappointment. "Miss Winston... oh. sorry. with these scandals... I simply can't risk my reputation. Can we get another stylist?"

The staff looked awkward. caught in a dilemma. Technically,Susan was the client. but I was the boss's wife-even if most didn't know Adam's true identity.

I remained calm. casually leaning against a nearby table."Susan, are you a photographer, or do you know the men in the photos?"

Her perfectly groomed eyebrows arched slightly. "I have more important things to do. But I must say, the man in the photo isn't the same one you were seen with last week."

"Interesting," I replied calmly. "So you judge me based on unverified gossip? Has your time in the entertainment industry affected your intelligence?"
 
Susan's cheeks flushed with anger. "You-" "Isn't there another styling task today?" I interrupted,turning to the project manager. "Can we switch?" The manager looked uncomfortable,"Well, yes, but...the other project is a lower-tier product. The spokesperson is an esports player, far below Miss Miller's status. As our collaborative stylist. we aim to provide you with our premium opportunities..."


Susan's smug smile told me everything-she expected me to back down. After all. what stylist would voluntarily downgrade from a major jewelry ad to an unknown gamer?

"Perfect. I'll take that task." I announced. gathering my portfolio.

"What?" Susan's composure faltered. "You'd rather style a nobody than be part of MOON's ad?"

"Absolutely." I began packing my tools. "Quality work speaks for itself. regardless of the project."

Susan's jaw tightened. realizing her plan had failed. "You'll regret this."


As I reached the door. I couldn't resist a parting shot. "Susan.your face is sagging a bit. If you knew you'd be representing a luxury brand. you should have scheduled fillers in advance.The camera captures everything, making the stylist's job much harder." "How dare you!" Susan leapt up, abandoning her pretense of elegance . "You'll see! You don't deserve Adam!"I paused at the door, turning to smile at her. "Really? Well, I guess my natural charm is more appealing to him than yours."

Her face twisted with rage as I stepped into the hallway, the door closing on her furious outburst.

Once alone in the corridor. I pulled out my phone and texted Sam:


[Ran into Susan today. She attacked me like a rabid dog for no reason.]




A sullen teenager lounged on the sofa, exuding that unique blend of boredom and hostility typical of his age.

The project manager discreetly informed me that I would be styling this teenager, known professionally as "One," a rising star in the esports world. At just sixteen, he had already won several international tournaments.


His features were striking-sharp jawline, almond-shaped eyes,and a certain intensity that reminded me of Adam. The resemblance was subtle but undeniable, especially around the eyes. "Hello," I greeted, organizing my tools. Allen looked up with obvious skepticism. "Everyone at home says gaming is a waste of time. What do you think?"

This was a test. I met his gaze steadily. "Playing games all day is a waste of time. Competing internationally and winning championships is representing your country. There's a difference."


His expression shifted-a flicker of respect, quickly masked."Then I'm representing my country. Let's get this over with."

I worked efficiently, creating a look that balanced professionalism with youthful energy.

When I finished, Allen looked at his reflection with satisfaction."Cool. Thanks."


As he left for his photoshoot, I checked my phone again. Sam had replied:

[She might not be attacking for no reason.]

I frowned at the screen. [Shelikes Adam?]

[She might not just like your husband, but be jealous of you.Remember how she always copied you in high school?] Despite my irritation, I laughed. [No wonder seeing her feels like looking into a funhouse mirror.] I stared at the screen, an uncomfortable feeling gnawing at me.Was this the reason for Susan's hostility? What was her relationship with Adam?

Don't go there, Stella. That's exactly what she wants-to make you doubt.

I forced myself to focus on packing up my tools.




Adam's POV

The emerald tie on my desk kept drawing my attention, despite the pile of reports needing review. For two days, I found myself distracted by its intricate craftsmanship, the subtle vine pattern, and the nearly invisible "Morgan" embroidery.

Stella had designed this. For *Luke*. The thought stirred an unfamiliar sensation in my chest-hot and sharp, like swallowing broken glass.

"Sir," Taylor entered with his usual efficiency,"Mrs. Lancaster is in the styling department on the fifth floor. She should be finishing up soon." I nodded, fingering the tie. I had practically stolen it from Luke,offering any car in my garage in exchange. It was an objectively terrible trade, one that had made Mark laugh for a full five minutes. "Sir, may I ask..." Taylor hesitated, eyeing the tie I had been examining for days. "Is there something special about this tie?"

"Do you think it suits me?" I asked abruptly.

Taylor's expression remained cautious."It's... a very fine tie, sir.The craftsmanship is exceptional."

Of course it was. Stella had designed it-a meticulously crafted gift for another man.

I checked my watch."Where is she now?"

Taylor swallowed nervously under my gaze."Mrs. Lancaster left about ten minutes ago."

The room's temperature seemed to drop. "Left? Without coming up?"

"Yes, sir." Taylor shifted uncomfortably under my scrutiny.

"Find her." My voice was sharper than intended. "Now."

Taylor practically sprinted out of the office. I turned to the window, the agitation in my chest growing. She had come to GT−∗my∗company-and didn't even bother to come up?
###Chapter 53

Stella's POV

I followed Taylor through the GT building, my mind still on Susan's insinuations about Adam. The whole situation felt off.Why had Adam summoned me?


"Taylor," I asked as we entered the executive elevator, "does Adam know Susan?"


He hesitated. "Susan? Yes, they know each other. They've attended some events together."

"I see." My tone must have conveyed more than I intended because Taylor quickly elaborated.

"Mrs. Lancaster, please don't misunderstand. Miss Miller and Mr. Lancaster aren't close. She just-"


The elevator doors opened, cutting off his explanation.Standing in the executive reception area was Susan herself,dressed in a gown more suited for a gala than an office.She was adorned with MOON Jewelry-a gaudy diamond set,including an enormous engagement ring, matching necklace,earrings, and an overly elaborate hairpiece. "Please tell him Susan is here," she instructed the receptionist. "I brought a gift from Paris. I'll only take a moment of his time.We're friends,you know." Friends?" I couldn't help but interject. "Is t hat what you call it?"


Susan spun around, her expression shifting from surprise to hostility. "Stella? What are you doing here?"

"What a coincidence," I said coldly.'m here to see Mr.Lancaster as well."


Susan's perfectly sculpted face tightened. "Adam is very busy and selective about who he meets. You can't just show up and expect-"

"Right this way," Taylor interrupted calmly.′′Mr. Lancaster is expecting you."

Susan's shock was almost comical."What? But...how? You can't have an appointment!"

"Maybe MMr. Lancaster prefers my company," I shrugged.

Susan's composure shattered. "You? A nobody? Don't flatter yourself-a stray cat shouldn't dream of being a phoenix!"

I stepped closer, using my height to intimidate her. "Yet this'stray cat' seems to have privileges you can only dream of.Maybe my face is more to Mr. Lancaster's liking." "You-you shameless-" Susan spluttered, unable to form coherent words. "Miss Miller," Taylor interjected firmly, "Mr. Lancaster does not accept unannounced visitors. Additionally, I must report this unauthorized visit to your father."

Susan paled slightly. "But why can *she* go in?" Susan pointed at me frantically.

Taylor simply opened the door for me. I couldn't resist a final remark. "Better luck next time, Susan."


Her furious gasp followed me into Adam's office, the heavy door closing firmly behind us.

Adam sat behind his immaculate desk, his shoulders tense under his perfectly tailored suit. His dark eyes followed my movements, his expression unreadable.

"Mr. Lancaster," I kept my voice neutral,"you wanted to see me?"


"Where's my gift?" he asked bluntly.

I blinked."What?"

"My gift," he repeated, as if it should be obvious. "You designed a tie for Luke. I'm still waiting for mine." That's what he wanted? A tie? I could hardly believe it,especially with Susan fuming outside. "Susan is in the hallway," I said instead of answering his question. "Se apparently brought you something."

His jaw muscle twitched. "I didn't ask about Susan."

"Aren't you friends? She seems quite accustomed to using your name."


Adam's eyes narrowed slightly. "Mrs. Lancaster, are you jealous?"


The question caught me off guard. "Jealous? Of what? Though your precious Susan did take out her frustrations on me,affecting my work schedule and efficiency."

Adam stared at me, as if searching for something in my expression. Whatever he was looking for, he didn't find it. A flicker of something-disappointment? Annoyance?-crossed his eyes before disappearing.

Our standoff was interrupted by Taylor's knock. He entered carrying an elegant leather shopping bag.

"Sir, Miss Miller insisted I deliver this gift to you," Taylor said,looking uneasy.

"What did Susan bring?" I couldn't help but ask. Adam gestured for Taylor to open the bag. I leaned forward slightly, eager to see what this woman,who clearly wanted to be a "third wheel," had brought for my husband. "It's... a box of chocolates," Taylor said, presenting an elegantly wrapped box of black truffle chocolates, encased in gold foil.

I instantly recognized the brand-often hailed as the "Hermès of chocolates." I couldn't help but swallow involuntarily.

Adam was about to tell Taylor to take them away when he noticed my reaction. I tried to appear indifferent, but it was clear I had failed.


"Do you want some?" Adam asked, his tone casual, but his eyes scrutinizing my response.

I blinked, surprised by the offer. "You're just going to...give me Susan's gift?"

"Lady Lancaster," Adam leaned back in his leather executive chair, his fingers rhythmically tapping the polished mahogany desk. "Why the sarcastic tone?"

"I'm not being sarcastic!" I protested, though even I could hear the sharpness in my voice.

"Really?" He raised one eyebrow perfectly, challenging me.

"Fine," I stood up, taking the box of chocolates and holding it protectively against my chest. "Thank you!" Adam cleared his throat. "Are you free tonight?""Actually, I have plans with Sam," I replied, already imagining sharing these delicious chocolates with my best friend. "She loves this brand too. We'll enjoy them together."

Adam's expression darkened slightly, though he maintained his composed demeanor. I pretended not to notice and headed for the door.


"If there's nothing else, I'll be going," I announced cheerfully.

As the elevator doors closed behind me, I couldn't help but smile. The thought of how furious Susan would be if she knew her expensive gift to Adam had ended up with me was almost as delightful as the chocolates themselves.

Adam's POV

I watched the elevator doors close, my mood instantly souring.Stella had not only ditched me to have dinner with her friend but had also taken Susan's gift to share with Samantha.The thought irritated me more than I cared to admit.

"Sir?" Taylor's voice interrupted my thoughts.

"How is Susan's situation?" I asked, refocusing on business. Taylor straightened. "MOON Jewelry has chosen Miss Susan as their new spokesperson. Lady Lancaster was initially assigned as her stylist, but due to,.. mutual dislike, she requested atransfer to the Night Owl Headphones campaign."

"ONE?" I looked up sharply.

"Yes, sir." Taylor confirmed. "Oddly enough, he cooperated with Lady Lancaster today. He usually detests styling and makeup."

I picked up a cigarette and lit it expertly.′′Tell him to return to school after next month's competition. Otherwise, I'll blacklist him."

"Of course. I'll contact his team manager immediately."

Taylor hesitated before adding, "Sir, the Lancaster family has been investigating youa.recently. They have informants within GT Group, and Susan's actions today might lead them to speculate about your identity."

I exhaled a plume of smoke nonchalantly.′′It′Stime they found out."


"Are you sure that's wise, sir?"

"It's inevitable," I replied, turning my chair to face the Manhattan skyline. "And entirely within my calculations."
###Chapter 54

Stella's POV

In the following weeks, New York Fashion Week dominated social media. Susan made her debut as MOON's spokesperson,adorned with their finest jewelry, glittering from head to toe. J laughed out loud reading the comments.

The public's reaction was swift and merciless:

**@FashionInsider:** *Susan looks like a walking light bulb?Way too flashy from head to toe!*


**@JewelryLover28:***This look almost makes me not want to buy MOON jewelry.*

**@OneSupremacy:** *Check out ONE, ladies! He looks amazing today!A real sight for sore eyes!*

The contrast couldn't have been more apparent. ONE-who usually rejected styling-appeared in a simple black hoodie and perfectly fitted jeans, paired with Night Owl headphones and limited-edition sneakers. His typically soft features were subtly enhanced by makeup, and his hair was styled to perfection. **@BowlForever:** *My idol wearing makeup?? That hairstyle is killing me!* **@OnesMommy2:***Isn't he supposed to look innocent? This styling is giving me all sorts of feelings..,*

Fashion critics quickly connected the dots:

**@StyleCritic;** *ONE's stylist is the same one who created Robert's viral formal look last month. Absolutely brilliant!*

**@FashionWhisperer:** *Insider info: ONE's stylist was supposed to style Susan, but she refused. Guess who's laughing now and who's stuck with this light bulb disaster?*

Susan's team went into crisis management mode, but the narrative had already solidified-ONE's simple yet impactful look overshadowed Susan's over-the-top jewelry display.

My phone wouldn't stop ringing, with studios of male celebrities clamoring to book my styling services. After creating viral looks for Robert and ONE, I had suddenly become the most sought-after stylist.

"You should accept their offers," Sam suggested over brunch.

I sipped my coffee thoughtfully.′′I′m not sure I want to be labeled as just a men's stylist."

"Are you serious? Do you know how many stylists would kill for these opportunities?" "Iknow, I know." I pushed my eggs Benedict around my plate."But I have an exclusive contract with GT Group. It gives me the freedom to choose."

The reality was more complicated. While I enjoyed the recognition, the sudden attention made me uncomfortable. I had spent years honing my skills and building relationships.and overnight fame felt... surreal. Plus, there was the complex factor of my marriage to Adam. The less public attention on me,the better.



\---


On the first sunny weekend after winter had just set in, I lounged lazily on a chaise by the floor-to-ceiling windows of Lancaster Manor, basking in the rare winter sunlight. I was almost dozing off when Joseph's voice startled me.

"Madam, the Miller family is here to see Mr. Lancaster."

I groaned, reluctantly moving from my comfortable spot."Can7t Adam handle it?"

"Sir is in an online meeting," Joseph explained patiently.

Right. As the lady of the house, it was my responsibility to entertain guests when Adam was unavailable. "Show them in," I sighed, sitting up and adjusting my cashmere lounge sweater. I expected some distant Miller relatives involved in Adam's business. Instead. Joseph ushered in Mr. Miller and his daughter Susan, whose eyes widened upon seeing me.

"Stella? What are you doing here?" Susan's voice rose in surprise.

I maintained a calm smile, gesturing for them to sit. "Mr. Miller,Miss Susan, please have a seat. Adam is currently busy,but-"

"Stella, how dare you speak to me?" Susan interrupted, her face flushed with anger. "If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be a laughingstock these past few days!"

I gracefully settled onto the sofa, embodying the hostess role."Would you like some tea?"

Mr. Miller attempted to diffuse the tension. "Miss Winston, are you here to see Mr. Lancaster as well?"

"No." I relished watching Susan's carefully constructed composure crack. "I live here."

Susan's eyes widened further. "Stella, you shameless woman!"she spat. ′′I2've always known you were a nobody! What respectable woman moves into a man's house without explanation?"I exaggeratedly examined my nails. "Whether I have shame or not is none of your concern, Susan. Why are you so upset?"1paused, letting a small smile play on my lips. "Unless...you have feelings for Mr. Lancaster?"

"Don't be ridiculous!" Susan stammered, her cheeks reddening. "You're the one delusional about Mr. Lancaster! What do you have besides a pretty face?"

"Isn't a pretty face enough?" I asked, feigning seriousness.

Susan opened her mouth to retort, but a deep voice from the staircase interrupted her: "Have you had enough fun?"

Adam appeared, descending via the indoor elevator in his wheelchair. His white shirt buttoned to the collar gave him a stern, untouchable appearance, which only made him more attractive.


Though his expression remained neutral, there was an indulgent undertone in his voice that made Susan's eyes widen even more.

"I think so," I replied nonchalantly, standing up and heading towards the stairs. "Your guests are now your problem."

"Mr. Lancaster, this Stella-" Susan began angrily.

"Susan, shut up!" Mr. Miller hissed,grabbing his daughter's arm . Mr. Miller turned to Adam, forcing a smile.′′M.Lancaster,I sincerely apologize. My daughter is spoiled and speaks without thinking. I hope you don't mind."

Adam's gaze was icy as it swept over him. "Mr. Miller, I believe your apology is directed at the wrong person."

Mr. Miller paled, reluctantly turning to me. "Miss Winston,please forgive Susan's behavior..."


"It's fine," I interrupted from the stairs, unable to resist a final jab. "By the way, Susan, the truffle chocolates you gave Adam were delicious. Though he doesn't care much for sweets-next time, you can just give them to me directly."

Susan's face twisted with rage."My chocolates! Stella, you...you took my gift?"

I smiled sweetly and continued up the stairs, leaving Adam to deal with the aftermath.


Mr. Miller leaned closer to Adam, curiosity overcoming caution."Mr. Lancaster, Miss Winston and you are...?"

"My wife can be a bit mischievous," Adam replied calmly. "′′MMiller, please don't mind her." I froze at the top of the stairs, my heart suddenly racing. He had said it so casually, so openly. I turned, just in time to see Susan and Mr. Miller staring at Adam in shock, as if he had announced he was from another planet. Adam's voice turned noticeably colder. "Mr. Miller, I thought you came today to explain why you haven't properly managed your daughter's behavior."

Mr. Miller stammered an apology.and I continued to my room,
Adam's casual acknowledgment of our marriage echoing in my mind.


Later, as I emerged from the bedroom, I nearly collided with Adam in the hallway.

"You... you told them we're married," I said, still processing what had happened.


Adam studied me, his green eyes inscrutable. "Is there something shameful about our relationship? Something to hide?11


I lowered my head, suddenly feeling the weight of every wall I had built between us. "No."


It wasn't shame I felt. It was joy-admitting that I wanted him to publicly claim me as his wife, not just in private. Admitting that hearing him call me his wife made my heart soar.

"No," I repeated softly."Not at all." His fingers brushed my cheek lightly, the touch sending electric currents through my body. We stood there, suspended in a moment where everything felt possible, the line between pretense and reality finally, irrevocably blurred.
###Chapter 55

Stella's POV

The steam from the shower had completely fogged up the mirror, transforming the spacious master bathroom into a misty sanctuary. I had been here for nearly an hour, letting the hot water wash away the day's tension while giving me time to think.


I turned off the shower and listened carefully. The bedroom had been quiet, but now I heard the sound of footsteps entering. My pulse quickened.

"Adam?" I called softly through the door.

"Yes." His deep voice confirmed, carrying that subtle authority I had grown accustomed to.

I bit my lip, hesitating. It's now or never. "Um... I forgot to bring clothes... Could you get me some pajamas? And...underwear."


A moment of silence followed. I could almost feel his skepticism through the door-he knew I always prepared clean clothes before showering. "Which set do you want?" he finally asked, his tone  neutral but curíous. "Any set will do." I replied, trying to sound casual despite my racing heart.

As I waited, I wiped away a portion of the steam from the mirror and scrutinized my reflection. The woman in the mirror appeared confident-toned arms, a slender waist, an elegant collarbone-but her eyes betrayed a mix of anxiety and anticipation.


What am I doing?The question echoed in my mind. After that intense night following the confrontation with the Winston family, something had shifted between us. The attraction had always been there, but now it felt... different. More genuine

Three sharp knocks interrupted my thoughts.

"Coming!" I called, reaching for the door handle. Taking a deep breath, I gently unlocked the door, creating a small gap. Steam escaped like ghosts fleeing a haunted house.

Adam stood outside, a white silk nightgown with lace details draped over his arm. I didn't reach for it, instead standing behind the door, my pulse thundering in my ears.

"Stella?" His voice carried a note of confusion.After a moment's hesitation, he pushed the door open a bit wider. When he saw me standing behind the door completely naked, droplets of water still clinging to my skin, his eyes widened slightly. I summoned all my social training to maintain a composed expression, though I couldn't quell the nervous flutter in my stomach.

"You... seem to prefer this style," I commented, nodding towards the delicate white lace nightgown he had chosen.

Adam said nothing. His expression remained inscrutable, but I noticed his Adam's apple bob slightly. His lack of reaction made my confidence waver. *Was this a mistake?*

The silence stretched between us, each second growing more awkward. My initial confidence crumbled under his calm gaze,irritation replacing my nervousness. Really? No reaction at all?

Then, his lips slowly curved into that dangerous smile that always made my heart race. He stepped into the bathroom and closed the door behind him.


"What exactly are you trying to do?" he asked, his voice dropping to that silky tone that sent shivers down my spine. "Mrs. Lancaster?"


I lifted my chin defiantly. "Nothing in particular."

"Seeking attention?" His voice was pure seduction as he moved closer. "Is that it?"
  "Of course not." I leaned against the vanity, maintaining eye contact despite the blush creeping up my cheeks, I quickly grabbed his tie, pulling him down to my level. "T heard men are disposable." I whispered against his lips. "about your cock."

His eyes darkened dangerously. "And your conclusion?"

I deliberately let my gaze drop before returning to his face. "The rumors might hold some truth."

"Stella." he growled. "are you deliberately provoking me?"

Before I could answer, he lifted me onto the vanity in one smooth motion. His mouth claimed mine with a possessive kiss.one hand tangling in my wet hair, the other gripping my waist tightly.

When he finally broke the kiss, his breathing was ragged."D you feel that?" he asked, pressing against me.

"A-Adam, you..." I stammered, suddenly realizing I might have pushed too far.

He leaned in, his lips brushing my ear as he whispered, "Remember this, Stella. Whatever happens tonight-no matter how much you beg and cry-you brought this on yourself." Before I knew it, he had lifted me, his eyes filled with a hunger that made me both fearful and exhilarated. I could smell his cologne, a scent I had never experienced before, utterly intoxicating, "I can't hold back any longer. With you, I've exhausted all my self-control," he said, looking into my eyes.

"What?" I nearly gasped, swallowing hard.

He tucked a strand of hair behind my ear, his face close to my neck.

"Relax... I have many ideas..."

His lips lightly brushed my ear, making my knees weak. I wanted to kiss him, tear off his clothes, touch every part of him.let him do whatever he wanted to me.

I lost control, grabbing his neck and kissing him eagerly. He made me feel a sense of unease. I slid my hands into his hair,pulling hard, making him moan against my mouth.

He pressed me tightly against his body. I felt his erection against my abdomen. His large hands gripped my buttocks,squeezing hard, forcing me against his hips, making me moan.I feIt an unprecedented desire burning between my legs. My body was breaking apart. He started thrust in my body.I was almost begging him to stop. I screamed his name, and he buried his face in my neck, penetrating me with so much force that I felt my muscles contracting inside me. "I can't hold it..." he moaned.
 I couldn't say anything else. We were completely sweaty.our bodies sliding against each other easily. "Can you imagine how wet and hot you are?" His voice was hoarse, while I was moaning uncontrollably, wwanting to scream how good it was.how delicious I felt. Damn it, he was hitting that spot again and again.

"You're driving me crazy," I murmured. I thought the torture couldn't get any worse, until he lifted my legs towards my chest,placing them over his shoulders.

"No!" I screamed when I felt him going deep, trying to stop him,but without success.


He was going in almost all the way, and I thought he would literally tear me apart. I couldn't bear his thrusts. My body seemed to catch fire and disintegrate into pieces as I came.

But I could barely keep my eyes open. I was done for. I heard him climax a while later, with one last thrust, his body trembling over mine before my vision darkened.




Adam's POV The first light of dawn filtered through the bedroom window as I pressed the smart control panel by the bed. The automatic windows opened slightly, allowing fresh air to circulate through the room. Stella lay curled up beside me, most of her body hidden beneath the luxurious sheets, with only an arm and shoulder exposed. Even in sleep, her brow was slightly furrowed, her body exhausted from the night's activities.

I reached for the cigarette box on the nightstand but hesitated,glancing at her sleeping form. With a resigned sigh, I returned the box to the drawer. Not now. She disliked the smell of smoke.


The lights in the main house had been on almost all night.Now, in the soft morning light, I observed the marks on her exposed skin-the evidence of our passion, beyond either of our control.

Carefully, I tried to tuck her exposed arm back under the covers. Her body instinctively recoiled from my touch, even in deep sleep.

"Such a delicate woman," I murmured, gently smoothing the furroww between her brows with my thumb. "So sensitive."
###Chapter 56
Stella's POV
That afternoon, I called Sam to cancel our shopping plans,claiming I
wasn't feeling well. It wasn't entirely a lie-I could barely walk. "Are you sure you're okay?" Sam asked, her voice filled with conc
ern. "You don't sound right."
"Just tired," I assured her. "I'll call you tomorrow."
After hanging up, I sat on the living room sofa, wincing as I tried
to find a comfortable position. The events of last night replayed
in my mind, bringing both embarrassment and a strange sense of
satisfaction. What was I thinking last night? Why did I provoke him like that?
I berated myself. I could have been straightforward. After all, I'm
his lawful wife-what's there to be embarrassed about?Why did I
make things so complicated?
Recalling Adam's expression when I challenged his masculinity mad
e me cringe. No wonder he was so... determined to prove me wr
ong. Joseph appeared with a tea tray. "Mrs. Lancaster, shall I leave the
afternoon tea here?" "Yes, thank you." I carefully adjusted my position, trying not to w
ince too obviously.
Joseph's face remained professionally neutral, but I saw a hint of
knowing amusement in his eyes."Mr. Lancaster called. He mention
ed he might be late tonight-an urgent business meeting."
"Isee." I took the teacup, avoiding eye contact. "He also inquired if you needed anything special for dinner.Perhap
s... something easy to digest?"
The teacup nearly slipped from my hand. "A regular dinner will b
e fine, thank you."
After Joseph left, I buried my face in a decorative pillow. Even th
e butler knows! This was beyond embarrassing.
I thought of Adam-probably sitting in some corporate boardroom r
ight now, completely composed and authoritative,while I could bar
ely walk across the room. The unfairness of it made me chuckle
bitterly into the pillow. Next time, I promised myself, I'll make him beg. A moment later, I realized what I was thinking. Next time?When had I
started taking our ongoing intimacy for granted?
I sipped my tea slowly, watching the patterns of sunlight move across the expensive carpet. Perhaps it was time to admit, at leas
t to myself, that I had fallen in love with Adam.
I am not sure when it began, but I started to care about his feel
ings,allowing him to enter my heart. Perhaps it was his unwaverin
g support in times of need, or maybe I was simply captivated by
his charm. I find myself increasingly entranced by him. Adam's POV
As I entered the main building, I immediately sensed a different a
tmosphere. It wasn't the usual quiet emptiness I felt when I cam
e home from work. There she was-Stella, asleep on the chaise lounge by the floor-to- ceiling windows. The evening sunlight cast a warm glow on her fa
ce,highlighting her delicate profile. A high-end design magazine lay
loosely in her fingers, ready to slip to the floor at any moment. She had covered herself with a cashmere blanket,perhaps feeling
cold again. Seeing her there, peacefully asleep in my domain where I had always
lived alone, made me pause. I found myself studying her features-the
dark circles under her eyes, the slight furrow of her brows even in sleep, her long lashes casting tiny shadows on her cheeks. The irritation caused by the online rumors linking her to Luke Mo
rgan dissipated, replaced by an unfamiliar feeling in my chest. Joseph appeared silently beside me."Sir, the lady woke up around
noon. After lunch. she briefly checked her phone and then fell a
sleep again."
I approached her. reaching out to gently ruffle her hair. "What's
wrong? Lost your voice?"
"Sore throat," she replied hoarsely, her voice noticeably raspier th
an in the morning.
I frowned slightly. "Caught a cold?"
She gave me a cold look, clearly conveying,"Are you serious?After
what you did to me last night?" Realization dawned, and I could
n't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. "Such a delicate flower," I commented, enjoying the flash of anno
yance on her face. Stella glared at me for a few seconds before dramatically turning away, wrapping the blanket tightly around herself. The gesture was childish, almost petulant, but somehow, I found it...endearing? In the dining room. I watched as the staff set out an exquisite m
eal-carefully selected American seafood dishes, both nutritious and
delicious. "Sir," one of the staff approached, "the lady says she's not feelin
g well and doesn't want to move. She wishes to dine on the sof
a in the living room."
I nodded, dismissing him, and returned to the living room.Stella w
as asleep again, her breathing steady and slow. *How can she sleep so much?* I wondered. *She barely moved a
ll day, is she really that tired?* The thought that I had exhausted
her brought a sense of male pride.
I reached out, gently patting her cheek. "Stella, wake up. Eat first, then you can sleep."
"Don't want to move," she mumbled without opening her eyes,he
r brows furrowing in displeasure.
I sighed. She was truly childlike. Without hesitation, I stood up fr
om my wheelchair and scooped her into my arms. Her eyes wide
ned in surprise, but her damaged throat could only produce a sm
all gasp. ###Chapter 56
"Eat first, then sleep," I said simply, carrying her to the dining room. She looked up at me, her face only inches from mine. I could
"Not really," Stella shook her head. "He's just a good person.I don't want
to cause him trouble, especially after he helped my grandmother see the confusion in her eyes. Her weight in my arms felt... right. I found myself studying the cu
rves of her face, the way her hair fell against my arm.how her b
ody fit perfectly against my chest.
I carefully placed her in a chair, watching as she yawned again an
d listlessly picked up the ginseng chicken soup. The chef had spec
ially prepared this nourishing soup. As the meal progressed, I watched her gradually regain her energ
y. The hot soup brought color back to her cheeks
"By the way," she began, her voice still hoarse but stronger than
before, "someone's spreading rumors about me and Luke on social
media. If you see him, could you apologize on my behalf?"
I put down my utensils, feeling a chill in my heart. "I'd like to apologize in person," she continued, unaware of my ch
anging mood,"bvut I don't want to disturb his work. He's probably
busy saving lives."
"Are you and Luke close?" I asked, deliberately keeping my tone c
alm. *Good person.* Hearing those words, something darkened within
me. Luke Morgan had many qualities-intelligent,arrogant, occasional
ly useful-but hearing Stella praise him irritated me more than it s
hould. "Speaking of Dr. Morgan," she mused, tapping her chin,"does he h
ave a girlfriend? I don't think I've ever heard of him dating anyon
e."
I deliberately set down my utensils. "Your throat doesn't hurt any
more?" My tone carried a clear note of displeasure. "Gossip is human nature, you know?" Stella responded lightly,com
pletely missing the warning in my voice.
I watched her continue to sip her soup, oblivious to how her inn
ocent questions affected me. A sense of possessiveness flared wit
hin me. I didn't like this feeling. Not at all. \---The master bedroom was dimly lit by the city lights streaming t
hrough the windows. I watched Stella move around the room,fres
hly bathed and dressed in silk pajamas. Just as she was about to
climb into bed, I grabbed her from behind,pinning her wrists abo
ve her head with one hand. "Mr. Lancaster!" she exclaimed, her eyes wide with surprise.She looked 
like a startled deer caught in headlights. Hearing her formal address, I couldn't help but raise an eyebrow. Even now, after everything we've been through,she still called m
e that when she was shocked or nervous. "I'm-I'm tired!" she protested, looking up at me with wide eyes, her heart racing. "You've slept all day, Mrs. Lancaster," I replied, deliberately loweri
ng my voice to that tone I noticed made her pulse quicken. "It's
time for some evening... activities."
With my free hand, I reached for the bedside drawer. I saw her
eyes widen, probably thinking I was reaching for a condom.Instea
d, I pulled out the dark green tie-the one I had taken from Luke. "What are you doing?" she asked, genuine shock in her voice. When the silk touched her wrists, I saw the realization dawn in
her eyes. Her sudden understanding, the slight hitch in her breat
h-watching her reaction brought me immense satisfaction.
I gently caressed her cheek with my fingers, savoring her respons
e. "Binding you," I whispered in her ear."Perfectly."
We tussled under the covers and then out of them, and in the end, I
didn't let Stella escape, catching her by the ankle.
I massaged her ankle, giving it a gentle tug, pulling her back into myembrace, "Rogue! Let go of me!" she protested, but it was to no avail
###Chapter 57
Adam's POV
My hand moved downward, my fingers slipping into her panties, rubbing against her cunt. At the same time. my fingers delved deeper, mischievously stirring
inside her. The tighter her body tensed, the deeper my fingers
went. and soon I felt her wetness. Her reaction made me even more aroused. No matter how many
times we made love. Stella's shy yet enchanting demeanor always
stirred my heart. Though my erection was painfully hard. I didn't enter her immedi
ately. Instead. I continued to tease her sensitive spot with my fin
gers, torturing her and myself in the process. "Do you want it? Beg me." I nibbled on her ear, deliberately teas
ing her. At this moment, she was already very aroused, her eyes moist wi
th a hint of tears. She raised her hand to hit me a few times,but
it was as if a cat was scratching. "Say it. Say you want it."
"I... I want you," she said, and then buried her face in my chest, I couldn't hold back any longer. Retracting my fingers. I thrust my hip
s, my erection fully entering her body. "It hurts!" she cried out, her voice tinged with pain. My size was indeed too large. and she had to adjust each time we
made love.
I moved gently, kissing her chest tenderly, probing cautiously.Feeling t
he increase in lubrication, I finally let go and moved more freely. My breathing grew heavy, and soft moans escaped her lips. She opened her body completely, matching my movements, but my fi
erce thrusts were still too much for her.
I looked down at her, seeing her still holding back, and I increased
my pace. "Relax." Encouraged, her voice grew louder, and she was soon swept into a w
ave of climax. \--- Later, as we lay there catching our breath, Stella threw the tie to the floor
with all her might. She turned her back to me, her body language clearly
expressing her indignation, despite her evident satisfaction. "Not taking a bath?" I asked, feeling unusually gentle, more patient
than usual after our intimacy. My fingers unconsciously played with
her long hair.
I could sense her internal conflict, wanting to bathe but too exhaus
ted to walk to the bathroom. The thought amused me-I had indeed
worn her out. Moving to her side of the bed. I looked down at her. "Bath?"
Stella stared at me for a moment, then silently raised her arms-wor
dlessly asking to be carried. Despite the gesture, her expression rem
ained reluctant, almost petulant. "Mrs. Lancaster seems rather unwilling." I observed. unable to resist
teasing her. The look of disbelief on her face was priceless. I could almost hear
her thoughts: *I've raised my arms! How much more willing do yo
u want me to be?*
Just as she seemed ready to snap at me, I bent down and effortles
sly scooped her up, holding her close to my chest. "Such a delicate flower," I whispered against her hair,enjoying her gl
are as I carried her to the bathroom. Once we crossed the bathroom threshold, her attitude changed.She firmly
pushed against my chest, using surprising strength to shoo me out-for
someone who claimed she couldn't walk. Iretreated,perhaps fearing another round in the bathroom. While she bathed. I had the staff change the sheets and then step
ped out onto the balcony fora smoke. The cool night air brushed a
gainst my skin as I gazed at the city lights,contemplating how Stella
had quickly become an indispensable part of my life. When had that happened? When had I started feeling such a stron
g sense of possessiveness over a woman who was supposed to be
just a marriage of convenience?
Ensuring the smoke had completely dissipated, I returned inside to
find Stella already in bed, scrolling through her phone.Her hair was
still damp from the bath, and the slight blush on her cheeks mad
e her look younger, more vulnerable. "Still have energy?" I asked, my tone carrying a hint of challenge. She immediately looked up at me, her eyes filled with suspicion.Her
wary expression made me chuckle. Her defensive posture had a st
range allure, like a small animal ready to flee at any moment. "Going to sleep soon," she quickly assured, her voice even raspier t
han before. Before she could turn off the screen, I noticed the content displayed. The
words "find a lawyer" were clearly visible. Looking for a lawyer?" I asked, deliberately keeping my tone neutr
al, though a cold feeling settledin my stomach. Was she already pl
anning to end our arrangement?
When she nodded without further explanation, I retrieved a black c
redit card I had prepared for her from the bedside table."Pocket m
oney for Mrs. Lancaster," I said, handing her the card. She froze, looking from the card to my face, her expression shifting
from surprise to something akin to amusement. "Mr. Lancaster," she said slowly, "this feels like you're paying me f
or services rendered." Her words caught me completely off guard. For a moment,I was ge
nuinely speechless-unexpectedly, I found myself laughing. "Is that what you think?" I asked, still amused. "That I'm trying to
compensate you?" Her cheeks flushed with embarrassment and anger. "Handing me a
credit card right after-after what we just did, what else am I supp
osed to think?" She gestured vaguely at the bed,unable to explicitly
state what had transpired between us. My laughter subsided, but I couldn't entirely erase the smile from my
face. "You're my wife. That's a11. "And the lawyer?" she asked, watching me closely. "Aren't you go
ing to ask about that?"
"Should I?" I countered, sliding into bed beside her. "Are you pla
nning to divorce me already?"
I kept my tone light, but I found myself genuinely curious about
her answer. The thought of her ending our arrangement so soon... unsettled me more than it should. "No," she finally admitted. "The lawyer is to sue Lucy for spreadi
ng rumors about me."
A sense of relief washed over me, though I carefully concealed it. "Smart."
I reached out, tucking a strand of damp hair behind her ear.The
simple gesture felt strangely intimate. Pulling her into my embrace, I murmured,"Ifyour throat hurts, talk less. Sleep."
She hummed softly in response. \--- Stella's POV
I smoothed my skirt and glanced at my watch-fifteen minutes until the
interview with *Splendor*'sproduction team. Just enough time to
mentally review my portfolio highlights without starting to 
second-guess my design choices.Mrs. Lancaster?" An assistant appeared before me. "They're rea
dy for you now."
I followed her through the hotel corridor, clutching my portfolio. Getting an interview for Deputy Styling Director at *Splendor*
was already a small victory. This production was this year's mos
t anticipated drama, with a budget that made even veteran pro
ducers nervous. Three people sat at the conference table, my preliminary design
s displayed on screens beside them. "Ms. Winston.please-"
The interview proceeded quickly, with technical questions about
period-appropriate fabrics, aging makeup techniques,and emergen
cy costume repairs. I answered confidently. When I finished my analysis, the Director nodded with approval. "We'll be in touch within two business days, Mrs.Lancaster."
###Chapter 58
Stella's POV
"Deputy Styling Director?" I repeated, hardly believing what I'd ju
st heard. "Yes, Ms. Winston," the HR person confirmed. "*Splendor*would l
ike to offer you the position. The production begins filming next
Friday with costume fittings and promotional photos. I'll email all
the details shortly."
I hung up, a sense of accomplishment washing over me.This posi
tion wasn't connected to the Winston name or my marriage to
Adam-it was based purely on my professional skills. "*Splendor* hired me as their Deputy Styling Director," I told Sam, who was sprawvled on the couch beside me. "Congratulations! My Stella is the best!" Sam bounced up excitedl
y.
′′𝐿should definitely celebrate today! It's your birthday too-do
uble celebration!"
My smile faltered. "Sam, today might not actually be my birthda
y."
but they mattered. Sam Jeaned over and hugged me tightly. "Darling,your birthday is
whenever you want it to be."
」 knew she was right. Birthdays were just ceremonial markers,
"Someone's throwing quite an event," I remarked, scanning the
crowded lot. "Probably some corporate party," Sam shrugged, finding a spot  "You're right." I decided. "Let's celebrate today!"
I'd celebrated twenty birthdays already. Why should I suddenly sur
render this day to Lucy? Today wasn't exclusively hers. As Sam made calls to arrange our celebration, I thought about previous
birthdays-elaborate Winston family parties that were really just business
networking events disguised as celebrations.The guest lists were filled
with potential investors rather than my friends. The real celebrations had always happened afterward with Sam-mi
dnight cake in her apartment, sincere gifts,laughter until dawn. Th
ose were the memories I treasured. "I've already arranged everything at Rouge," Sam announced."The
private room is ready, and I've ordered your favorite cake."
\--- Sam's convertible pulled into Rouge's parking lot, which was unus
ually full of luxury vehicles. near the VIP entrance. The bouncer recognized us immediately-as he should-and was about to
wave us through when a group emerged from the entrance. "Stella! What a coincidence! Are you here for my birthday party?"
Lucy stood before us in a ridiculous white feathered dress that lo
oked completely out of place in a nightclub. Classic Lucy-trying to
maintain her "delicate flower" image even at Rouge. One of her friends-some reality show contestant whose name I coul
dn't remember-clung to her arm. "You're Stella.right?Rouge has been
reserved by Lucy's boyfriend Brian tonight.Everyone here is either L
ucy's friend. Someone like you..." she paused dramatically. "...doesn't
really belong here, does she?"
I felt my jaw tighten but maintained my composure. They had no
idea this was my territory-Rouge was mine. "Stella,you can see my friends feel it would be inappropriate for y
ou to join." Lucy added with fake concern. "Brian will be arriving
soon, and I know you still have feelings for him. To avoid any mi
sunderstandings, perhaps you should leave."
Her words were carefully calibrated-appearing sympathetic while
actually being malicious. Her transparent tactics almost made me laugh. "Oh my god! You're so shameless!" Lucy's friend exclaímed. "Yo
u stole Lucy's position for twenty years, and now you want her
boyfriend too?"
The small crowd at the entrance began whispering and pointing. I'd
become the villain in Lucy's little drama. How predictable. "Lucy, are you delusional? I'm not a recycling center-why would
I want your garbage?" I almost laughed at the absurdity of her
accusation. The situation was escalating exactly as Lucy wanted-creating a p
ublic spectacle where she could play victim. I had no intention
of giving her that satisfaction.
I subtly nodded to one of Rouge's security staff-indicating that Luc
y's group should be contained without making a scene. "Come on, Sam. Let's go," I said, pulling my friend away from t
he brewing drama. Once we were safely inside, Sam fumed. "Lucy's barely been ba
ck in town and she's already throwing around her 'birthday'to s
eem important!"
"Did you notice her entourage?" I asked, my irritation fading. "All
C-list celebrities and reality show contestants. I didn't see a single
A-lister. She's clearly not doing well in the industry "True," Sam admitted. "I recognized a few faces, but they were all h
anging back, doing their own thing. Lucy's trying to break into the he
ir circle, but she's nowhere close." We walked a few more steps before Sam stopped abruptly. "I still w
ant to kick them all out! It's not like we need their money!"
"Don't be angry," I said, patting her arm. "Money is money. Let's hav
e the bartenders recommend the most expensive bottles.Make them
pay." Sam looked at me incredulously. "Stella, you're loaded now.Why are
you still being so frugal?"
"What do you mean 'loaded'? Do you know how expensive research
equipment and materials are? Everything costs more than pure gold!"
I defended myself. "Especially with Adam as a point of comparison-I
feel like I'm practically broke."
"Darling, you're his wife." Sam pointed out logically. "What's his is yo
urs. If you ever divorce, you'll be incredibly wealthy!" She suddenly sat up straighter, eyes widening. "Wait! I just remember
ed something! When you brought me that scarf, you sent me a phot
o first. In the corner, I saw a man's hand wearing a watch!"
I froze, caught off guard by her observation. "That was Adam, wasn't it?" Sam's eyes narrowed suspiciously."Tell
me the truth!"
"Would you believe me if I said no?" I asked weakly. "Do you think I'm stupid?"
I never lied to my best friend. "Yes, it was him."
Sam's eyes lit up mischievously."He went shopping with you?You t
wo must be getting along well! Any... developments?"
I felt my cheeks warm. I clapped my hands together once,making
a decisive sound. "We've done it many times."
"Wow!" Sam's initial shock quickly transformed into teasing deligh
t.Despite her playful nature, Sam knew when to stop prying.She tru
ly wanted my happiness, and I could see she was genuinely pleas
ed about my developing relationship with Adam.
The private room at Rouge had been transformed with roses and baby's
breath-exactly how I liked it. A crown-shaped cake sat on the center
table, twenty-five candles waiting to be Jit. As the birthday song played, I closed my eyes and made a wish before
blowing out the candles. For once, my birthday wish wasn't about discovering my origins or finding my place.It wa
s simpler, more immediate-almost possible-to have a happy life wi
th my beloved. My phone buzzed with a text notification. "Mark says he just saw me and wants me to come out for a pre
sent." I told Sam, confused. Sam looked equally puzzled. "Mark? He and James have been inse
parable since childhood. You and James hate each other!Why woul
d he give you a gift?"
###Chapter 59
Stella's POV
Curiosity piqued, we ventured into Rouge's main hall. The club was
in full swing-lights flashing, DJ pumping music, people drinking and
dancing. Lucy's
′′explusive" party seemed to have made little impac
t on the regular crowd. We quickly found the booth Mark had mentioned, but instead of
Mark,James was slouched on the plush seats. "James? You're here too?" I asked, surprised. "Where's Mark?"
James maintained his perpetually annoyed expression." 𝐴
′′  today y
our birthday too? Why is your family only celebrating Lucy's birthda
y, not yours? After all those years at the Winston house,they treat
you this badly?"
Missing a birthday celebration hardly qualified as mistreatment in m
y book. If only he knew what real mistreatment looked like in that
household. "Aren't you here for Lucy's birthday party too?" I responded,trying t
o remain civil. I owed Luke enough not to antagonize their family
member.
"As if I'd come for her birthday! She's nobody important,"James scoffed, then abruptly cut himself off. "I tho ught you might... never mind! He produced a small jewelry box from somewhere,thrusting it tow
ard me. "Here! Your birthday present!"
"Please thank Mark for me," I said, assuming he was delivering it
on Mark's behalf. "Why thank him? It's clearly from me... forget it! Just go!"James
downed a glass of whiskey in frustration, muttering something un
der his breath. "What did you say?" I leaned closer, trying to hear him over the
music. James visibly startled at my proximity, jerking backward. "Why are
you getting so close? Trying to seduce me? I said 'happy birthda
y'! Are you deaf?"
His accusation of seduction caught me off guard. Did he not kno
w about my marriage to Adam?
How ironic-his brother knew about my marriage, yet James remain
ed clueless. Poor guy!
Throughout this entire exchange, Sam remained uncharacteristically
silent, her expression growing increasingly thoughtful. Once we were a safe distance away, she leaned close to whisper in my
ear: "Stella, doesn't James seem a bit strange to you? "He's always strange," I dismissed, examining the small box in my
hand. "I suspect that gift isn't from Mark at all-it's from him," Sam the
orized.
I gave her my best 'you've lost your mind' look. "Think about it," Sam insisted. "He said he wasn't here for Lucy's
birthday but because he thought you... then stopped mid-sentenc
e. If he finished with 'because he thought you would be here, w
ouldn't that make perfect sense?"
"No way," I was genuinely disturbed by this possibility.
′′𝐿
′𝐿 di
sliked each other since childhood!"
"The Morgans support your husband, while Lucy is aligned with B
rian," Sam continued her analysis. "Would James really attend ju1
st because Lucy invited him?"
"Even without the Lancaster connection, James is famously arroga
nt. He has no relationship with Lucy. Would he really grace her
with his presence?" Sam pressed. As I considered her surprisingly logical argument, our path was su
ddenly blocked by someone who appeared from nowhere,bringing
our conversation to an abrupt halt. "Stella, your timing is as impeccable as ever," one of Lucy's friends
approached with a venomous smile. "Why are you still here? Are you deliberately trying to ruin Lucy's birthday party?Or
did you hear Brian was coming and decided to follow him like a l
ost puppy?"
I sipped my drink slowly, refusing to give her the satisfaction of a
reaction. A few steps away, I saw Lucy clinging to Brian's arm, l
aughing too loudly within his social circle. Her dress-clearly chosen
to highlight every curve-practically glued itself to Brian. Sam squeezed my arm silently in support. "Ignore her," she whisp
ered. "Some people never learn that silence is the appropriate response
to stupidity," I replied, my voice just loud enough for everyone t
o hear. Lucy's friend's face twisted."You little-"
"Is there a problem here?" Lucy's saccharine voice interrupted,glidi
ng over with Brian in tow. Her gaze, though sweet in tone,locked
onto me. "Stella," she said with practiced sympathy,"I really don't want to e
mbarrass you, but my friends want you to leave. This is supposed
to be a celebration."
Brian stepped forward, puffing out his chest like a peacock.The cologne
he wore-clearly too expensive for his taste-couldn't mask the stench of
his arrogance. "Stella, we're over. You need to accept that," his voice carried thr
ough the VIP area. "You've missed your chance."
I could read his thoughts as clearly as an open book. Since the h
ospital incident, he realized I was no longer someone he could m
anipulate. Now he was determined to destroy what remained of
my social standing-the only currency that truly mattered in our cir
cles. Perfectly timed tears welled up in Lucy's eyes. "Stella, why can't y
ou let go? As the Winston family's favorite,you've already taken t
wenty years of my life. Now you want to take my love too?" Her
voice broke with rehearsed emotion. "Haven't you taken enough
from me?"
Sam snorted beside me. "Well, now I've seen it all. A perfect de
monstration: 'A bitch and a jerk, together forever!"
Brian's face darkened. "Samantha, don't think I won't hit a woma
n!"
"Oh, darling," Sam's laugh was sharp and clear.
′′ 
7venever made
that mistake. I've always known exactly what kind of scum you
are."
Brian's jaw tightened. He waved down a passing waiter."G the manager. Now. We have unwelcome guests here."
Sam crossed her arms, completely unfazed."Go ahead,call whoever you
want! I'm curious to see who gets kicked out. The surrounding tables had already quieted down, cocktails frozen
mid-air. The DJ lowered the volume, as if the music itself was holdi
ng its breath. \--- The manager appeared within minutes-dressed in a tailored black su
it that seemed to absorb all light. I had always admired his efficien
cy. Brian immediately launched into his tirade. "Is this how Rouge treat
s its VIP clients? I booked this entire area tonight,and these two la
dies"-he pointed dismissively at Sam and me-"are causing a disturba
nce."
"That's right," Lucy added. dabbing at nonexistent tears. "They're de
liberately trying to ruin our night."
Sam stepped forward, her five-inch red-bottom heels clicking purpos
efully on the hardwood floor. " I also find certain individuals distur
bing my night. Effective immediately. Lucy and Brian are banned fro
m Rouge. Permanently."
Brian laughed incredulously. "Who do you think you ure-"
"Understood." The manager gave Sam a slight bow.then turned to B
rian and Lucy. "Mr. Lancaster, Miss Winston. 1must ask you to leav
e."
The ensuing silence was absoluto. Evon the ice in tho glaanes seemed to stop clinking. Brian's face went from disbelief to rage in record time. "Are you
insane? Do you know who I am?" His voice nearly reached a sho
ut. "I'm Brian Lancaster of the Lancaster family!You're asking me t
o leave? Do you want Rouge to be bankrupted?"
The manager remained unflinching. "Sir, I understand your position, but I must insist. Of course, we will fully refund your reservation
fee."
"This is ridiculous! You think-"
"Mr. Lancaster," the manager's voice hardened slightly.
′′𝐼you con
tinue to resist, I will be forced to call security. I would prefer to
avoid that."
Lucy tugged at Brian's sleeve, embarrassment coloring her cheeks. The
whispers in the crowd rippled like wind through tall grass.
###Chapter 60
Stella'POV
"You can't be serious," Brian stammered, looking around for supp
ort from his social circle, but most of them suddenly found their
drinks very interesting. Sam's smile was pure satisfaction. "Brian, should I explain why yo
u're being kicked out? About how you pursued Stella for years in
college? How you practically camped outside her dorm and sent
flowers every day until she finally gave you a chance?"
Brian's face tuarned a deep shade of red. He shoved the manage
r aside roughly. "You don't know anything!"
"Really?" Sam retorted. "You imply that Stella can't let go of you, which is laughable because the one who has been obsessed is y
ou. Are you a narcissist?"
Lucy stepped forward, her designer heels wobbling slightly. "You
have no right to talk to him like that! Without your parents' trus
t fund, you are nothing!"
"How pathetic," Sam responded, inspecting her manicure. "Your o
nly-"
Before Sam could finish, Lucy lunged forward, but I was quícker. My
hand shot out, grabbing a fistful of her meticulously styled hair and
yanking her back. Lucy screamed, flailing her arms wildly. "You bitch!" Brian shouted, stepping towards me with his hand ra
ised. "Let her go now!"
Sam stood firmly between us. "Touch my friend, and you'll regret
it, Lancaster. I know your 'gentleman' act is just a facade,but hit
ting a woman? Even you should have some standards."
"Move aside," Brian roared. "This isn't your fight."
"When it involves Stella, it's always my fight," Sam replied, her ey
es narrowing dangerously. Brian's patience snapped. He grabbed Sam's arm roughly. In a blu
r of motion, Sam twisted free and landed a precise punch to his
head. Brian doubled over, gasping. Lucy broke free from my grip and lunged at Sam, her nails aimed
at her face. I intercepted her, grabbing her wrist and using her
momentum to fling her aside. Lucy stumbled into a nearby table, knocking over glasses. "You're all insane!" Brian gasped, straightening up. He looked to h
is friends, who were watching in shock. "What are you all standin
g around for? Help!"
Two of Brian's friends reluctantly stepped forward. The taller one
reached for me, but I was ready. Years of self-defense training kicked in, and I sidestepped his grasp, using his momentum to counterattack.Mystiletto heel struck his knee.sending
him crashing onto a table. "Brian," I said coldly, brushing a strand of hair from my face,"I sh
ould have done this three months ago when I caught you and Lu
cy together in the suite. At least then I would have had the satis
faction of teaching you both a lesson before ending things."
The revelation hit the room like a bomb. All eyes turned to Brian
and Lucy, who stood frozen. "Three months ago?" someone whispered. "But they only announc
ed their relationship last month..."
"She's lying!" Lucy stammered, but her flushed face betrayed her. Brian's friend-the one still standing-looked confused.
′′ ude,you sai
d Stella cheated on you..."
Things quickly deteriorated from there. Lucy lunged at me again, t
his time successfully scratching my arm with her nails.As Brian tri
ed to grab me from behind, Sam intercepted him.Within minutes, the VIP area descended into chaos. Tables overturned, champagne bottles shattered, and clothes tore
as the fight escalated. Security rushed in, but by then, I had alre
ady landed a solid kick to Brian's chest, sending him sprawling on
to a leather sofa. "Wait, is that Stella?" I heard someone exclaím. "The bookworm?
Where did she learn to fight like that?"
By the time the police arrived, Rouge's VIP area looked like a bat
tlefield. The fluorescent lights of the Manhattan police station made every
one look sickly. Our group-disheveled but still in evening attire-loo
ked out of place against the backdrop of common criminals and
weary officers. A seasoned officer, who had clearly seen it all in his twenty-year
career, looked at us with barely concealed amusement. "Alright, let's hear it," he sighed, holding a notepad. "What happe
ned? You're all adults from good families, yet you're brawling in
a nightclub like freshmen."
None of us spoke immediately. I noted with satisfaction that Lucy
's perfect hairstyle now resembled a bird's nest, and Brian's custo
m suit had a tear in the shoulder. Officer Rodriguez continued, "You realize this could have ended m
uch worse, right? The media will have a field day.'Manhattan Elit
e in Drunken Nightclub Brawl.' I'm sure your families will love tha
t headline."
Lucy finally broke the silence
Brian lunged across the table, but was immediately restrained by the Sam and me, mascara running down her cheeks. "They slandered
me and my boyfriend, then physically attacked us."
Sam rolled her eyes so dramatically I thought they might get stuc
k. "Slander? Since when is stating facts considered slander?"
"She's lying." Lucy insisted, turning to Brian for support. "They att
acked us unprovoked. Tell him, Brian!"
I leaned forward, my voice chillingly calm. "Was it slander when I
mentioned catching you and Brian together three months ago? W
hen I was still engaged to him? When you told everyone how mu
ch you missed your 'dear sister'?"
Lucy's mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water. "Or when Sam mentioned how Brian pursued me relentlessly in c
ollege? How he waited outside my classes? Sent flowers to my do
rm every day? Is that slander?" I continued, watching Lucy's face
crumble with each word. Brian finally intervened. "Stella, this is all my fault. Lucy had nothi
ng to do with it." His chivalry might have been touching if it wer
en't so transparently self-serving. "Really?" Sam drawled. "Are you suggesting you performed a solo
act in that suite? You must be quite the multitasker." "Enough!" the officer barked. "One more outburst like that,and you'l
l spend the night in a cell." He turned to his colleague
"Separate statements from each of them. I want this mess docum
ented before their lawyers arrive and spin everything."
\--- Within an hour, most of Brian's friends had been bailed out,their fa
mily's lawyers arriving with practiced efficiency. Brian and Lucy were
the last to leave, their lawyer negotiating reduced charges. As they
passed us in the hallway, Lucy's glare could have melted steel. "This isn't over," she hissed under her breath. Brian said nothing, but his expression promised retribution. I merely
smiled, which seemed to infuriate them even more. After they left, Sam turned to me with a sigh. "Well,that was more
excitement than I planned for tonight. Who should we call?"
I considered our options. Calling the Winston family was out of the
question-I'd rather spend the night in jail than give Anna and John another
opportunity to remind me of my"inferior" status. My grandmother was
too frail to handle this drama. There was really only one choice. "I'm calling Adam," I decided, pulling out my phone. After all.he
had just gotten out of my bed a few days ago, and I was his wi
fe. For the third time, I hovered my finger over Adam's contact.Twice, I had called, and both times it went straight to voicemail.With a
sigh, I put my phone away. "Are you sure you don't want to try someone else?" the officer a
sked, his tone not unkind. "It's fine," I replied,smoothing out the wrinkles in my dress.
′′ 7ll
wait."
Two officers chatted by the water cooler, their voices echoing in
the nearly empty station. "Have you heard about that Lancaster guy? The one in the wheel
chair?" one officer said, refilling his paper cup. "Iheard he showed
up at GT Group's European headquarters last week."
"Really?" his colleague responded. "My cousin was on security det
ail for that conference in Europe. He said the socialites were prac
tically lining up just to get a word with Mr. Lancaster."
###Chapter 61
Stella's POV
I found myself listening more intently,my heartbeat quickening slig
htly. "There are photos too," the first officer continued, pulling out his
phone. "'Check out this one from the gala."
His colleague let out a low whistle. "Wow, even in a wheelchair,t
he guy's got presence. Who's the blonde with him?"
The officer turned the screen,and though I was a few feet away, I recognized the familiar figure in the wheelchair,accompanied by
a tall, blonde woman. A pang of jealousy twisted in my stomach, and I frowned involuntarily. "Looks like some European duchess or countess," the officer shrug
ged.
I pulled out my phone again, this time opening Twitter.Sure enou
gh, the trending news was exactly what I feared. Headlines screamed: "Lancaster Family's True Identity
Revealed!European Socialites Scramble for Introductions!" The
accompanying photos showed Adam at the European business summit,
including several with the same blonde woman I had seen on the
officer's phone. I kept scrolling, fnding more sensational headlines: "GT Group's
Asia Division President Finally Unveiled as Adam Lancaster of the
Lancaster Family" and "Adam Lancaster Attends Summit with D
uchess, Returns to Same Hotel, Relationship Status Unclear."
I zoomed in on the photos, studying the blonde woman's face.P
erfect bone structure, flawless skin, elegant posture. The way sh
e leaned toward Adam in one photo, her manicured hand restin
g just inches from his shoulder, made my stomach churn.
Is that why he's not answering? The thought struck like a lightni
ng bolt, followed by a wave of jealousy so intense it took my b
reath away. Are they together right now?
I could almost see it-Adam and this perfect duchess, laughing ov
er champagne in some luxury hotel suite. The image made me f
eel physically ill. A sudden realization hit me: I was jealous. Intensely irrationally j
ealous. Get a grip, Stella, I scolded myself,taking a deep breath. This is ridiculous. But you were in his bed just days ago. His arms were around y
ou. He whispered your name.
I pushed the thought away. Whatever Adam was doing in Europ
e didn't matter. Our marriage was just a contract.nothing more. But despite my rational thoughts, the ache in my chest remained. "Ma'am?" The officer at the desk pulled me from my thoughts. "Are you married?"
"Yes," I answered automatically.
· "Why not call your husband to pick you up? It would be simpler. "
"No need to call," I replied, the words slipping out before I could
think. "He's no longer with us." The officer's expression softened immediately.
′′ 
′m sorry to hear
that,ma'am."
"What?" I blinked, not understanding his sudden change in demea
nor. "Your loss," he explained gently.
′′ must be recent." Oh. The officer thought Adam was dead. I should correct him,but
something stopped me. Maybe it was the sting from those phot
os, or the simple awkwardness of my situation. Whatever it was, I found myself not refuting his assumption. "Yes," I said softly, lowering my eyes as if in mourning. Sam,who had been quietly observing, caught my eye, her expression
clearly saying, Really? This is your strategy? She then gave a slight nod
of support "Poor thing," the officer murmured. "Don't be too sad. You're you
ng and beautiful-you and he were never meant to be."
I mustered a brave widow's smile, feeling a twinge of guilt for th
e deception, but not enough to correct it.
"Ms. Winston?" A different officer appeared at the door."Someone
's here to see you."
Sam and I exchanged a puzzled glance."For me?"
"He says he's your husband," the officer continued, checking his n
otebook. "A handsome fellow, waiting at the front desk."
The officer who had taken my statement looked up sharply."Your
husband? But you just said-"
"I don't know who that could be," I interrupted quickly. my mind
racing. Had Brian followed us here to cause more trouble?
"Tall, wearing an expensive suit," the officer continued. That doesn't sound like Brian... "Well, let's not keep him waiting." Sam said, standing and pulling
me along. We followed the officer down the hallway to the reception area.When I
saw him, I stopped in my tracks, Adam sat in his wheelchair, dressed in an impeccably tailored gra
y suit, a black wool coat draped over his shoulders. His hair was
slightly tousled, whether from the speed of his movement or th
e night wind, I couldn't tell. His eyes met mine.one eyebrow sligh
tly raised. Oh God. Did he hear what I said?
"Mr. Lancaster," the officer greeted with newfound respect."Your
wife is right here."
Adam's gaze never left mine, his expression unreadable. "Thank y
ou, officer. Sorry for the trouble."
"Sorry," the officer who had taken my statement appeared behind
us, clearly confused. "This is your husband? But you said he was
-"
"I apologize for the confusion," Adam interrupted calmly."My wife
has a flair for the dramatic." His tone remained casual.but his e
yes never left mine. "Well," the officer shifted uncomfortably. "Fighting in a nightclub i
s not good behavior, the place was a mess."
"I understand," Adam nodded. "We'll, of course, cover any damages."
He wheeled closer to me, his eyes scanning mv disheveled appearance. "Are you hurt?"
appearance. "You... how did you get here?"
"Where else would I be?" Adam retorted, his voice low enough for only
me to hear. "The morgue? The Lancaster family crypt?"
My face flushed with embarrassment. So he had heard. "I thought you'd send Tyler." I said, quickly changing the subject. "Let my assistant know my wife was arrested for fighting in a nig
htclub?" Adam's voice held a hint of amusement.
′′  really do thi
nk highly of my reputation."
Sam couldn't help but laugh. I shot her a glare. "I rarely go to nightclubs," I insisted, aware of how pathetic my
defense sounded. "Tonight was an exception."
"Isn't that what they all say?" Adam's lips twitched. "Let's go ho
me. You can explain in the car."
As we were about to leave, another officer appeared. "Ms.Winsto
n? Someone else is here to bail you out."
A man in a tailored suit walked in, and I immediately recognized
the manager. My heart sank. "Ms. Winston, Ms. Samantha," he greeted respectfully. "Icame as
soon as I heard." "Thank you...," I said, struggling to explain his presence. "He's...the
manager of a café we own."
"A café?" The officer looked at us skeptically.
′′ 𝑀, aren't you the r
egistered agent for the RougeClub?"
The manager hesitated, looking to me for guidance. I frowned.knowi
ng the game was up. "Yes, that's correct," he finally admitted. Sam let out a dramatic sigh."Well,our secret identity is blown,Stella. "
Adam's expression remained neutral, but I could see the curiosity in his eyes."seems we have much to discuss, Mrs.Lancaster."
###Chapter 62
Stella's POV
Outside the police station. Taylor was waiting with the car.After e
nsuring Sam's safe return home, Adam and I walked towards his
car, the silence between us palpable. "How did you know I was here?" I finally asked. Taylor,walking beside us, cleared his throat. "We received the noti
fication as soon as we landed, Mrs. Lancaster. Mr.Lancaster insiste
d on coming straight here."
"Landed?" I looked between them. "So the calls went unanswered
because you were on a plane."
Taylor nodded. "According to the report, Ms. Lucy and Mr.Brian
were hosting an event at the Rouge Club tonight and got into an
altercation with you and Ms. Samantha, which escalated into a p
hysical confrontation."
"That's not how it happened," I automatically corrected. "They we
re the ones causing trouble."
"Of course they were," Adam's voice held a hint of dry
amusement.
reason."
The way he emphasized"my wife" sent a shiver through me.
despite my irritation. As we reached the car. Taylor excused himself, saying he needed
to return to the office to handle the aftermath of tonight's event
s."You're not going to the office?" I asked Adam as our driver pull
ed away from the curb. "Why would I?" Adam replied, inspecting a small cut on his hand
that I hadn't notced before. "Mrs. Lancaster seems quite capable
of handling business. It appears to be quite profitable."
I felt my cheeks heat up, unsure if he was complimenting or moc
king me.
′′ 
′'m sure GT Group can survive one night without you."
"Indeed," he replied, his tone deliberately casual. "Stella, I believe
you owe me an explanation."
"About what?" I feigned innocence, though I knew exactly what h
e meant. "Why not start with your relationship with the manager of the Ro
uge Club?" he suggested.
"He's the club's legal representative, but he also manages a caféI own,"
I tried to explain, knowing how weak it sounded. "Try again," Adam's voice was soft but firm, I turned to look out the window, watching the city lights blur pa
st. "I don't know what you want me to say."
"The truth might be refreshing," he suggested. "Like explaining wh
y you visit the Rouge Club at least three times a month, yet reg
ular patrons have hardly ever seen you."
I whipped my head around to face him. "How could you possibly
know that?"
"I make it my business to know things," Adam replied simply. "Yo
u have a private room there, don't you? Interesting,considering Ro
uge doesn't offer private spaces to just anyone."
I remained silent, weighing my options. Clearly, there was no poin
t in continuing the charade. "Fine," I sighed. "Yes, Rouge is mine-mine and Sam's. We just wa
nted to make some extra money without anyone knowing our ide
ntities."
In the dim light of the car, I couldn't read Adam's expression,but
I thought I saw a flicker of admiration in his eyes. "Extra money," he repeated, a small smile playing on his lips. "Is your pocket money sufficient?" he asked casually. To my surprise, he didn't question why I had concealed my ownership
but instead asked an unexpected question. "Just barely." I replied, thinking about the lab expenses,though I h
ad no intention of explaining that. "You've hardly used the black card I gave you."
Not entirely true. I thought. recalling the times I had used it to v
erify the authenticity of expensive skincare products. "I'm not accustomed to spending other people's money," I said.im
mediately regretting my choice of words. Adam's brow furrowed. "Other people's?" His voice turned cold."Is
n't it normal for a wife to use her husband's money?"
Seeing that I didn't respond, he narrowed his eyes.
′′𝑀 is it that
you just don't want to spend my money?"
"It's not like that," I hurried to explain. "Even when I was engage
d to Brian, I never spent his money."
The temperature in the car seemed to drop several degrees, and
Adam's voice became icy. "Stella, do you see me as the same as
Brian?"
Before I could answer, he pulled me onto his lap and kissed me with
surprising intensity. Adam's soft lips pressed down with a chill unique to
winter. The ferocity of it left my mind blank.
I was acutely aware thatTyler was still in the driver's seat. I tried to pull away, but Adam only tightened his grip on my waist, deepening the kiss. When he finally released me, his eyes were a storm of emotions. "Stella. I am your husband," he said in a low voice. "What does
Brian matter?"
His teeth grazed my earlobe, sending a shiver down my spine.I noticed
Tyler pressing a button to raise the partition between us. "It's not about comparison," I quickly said. "I just don't spend any
one's money."
Adam's expression grew darker. I realized he was genuinely upset. "That's not what I meant," I said, placing my hand on his chest. "I'll use your card tomorrow, I promise."
"I thought nightclub owners didn't spend other people's money?"H
is tone remained cold.
I leaned closer, resting my head on his shoulder. "You're not'othe
r people'; you're my husband."
Those two words-"my husband"-had an immediate effect.The tension in
his shoulders eased, and the shadow in his eyes seemed to lift a little. Sensing the shift in atmosphere, my fingers gently traced his
jawline, feeling the slight stubble that added a rugged charm."Ada
m." I whispered, my breath warm against his neck, "you mean m
ore to me than anyone."
His arms encircled me, pulling me closer. I could feel his heartbe
at, steady and strong against my chest,calming the turmoil within
me. He buried his face in my hair, inhaling deeply as if drawing
strength from my presence. "Stella," he murmured, his voice much softer now, "I don't want
to be compared to anyone. I just want to be your one and only. "
I lifted my head, looking directly into his eyes, our faces inches a
part.d
only."
His eyes searched my face, as if seeking confirmation. In that mo
ment, the world outside the car seemed to disappear. It was just
the two of us, tightly embraced, a closeness that spoke louder t
han words. Adam's hand moved to the back of my neck, his fingers threading
through my hair. He pulled me into another kiss,this one tender yet
passionate. It was a kiss that promised understanding, forgiveness, and
a love that could weather any storm. When our lips parted, I rested my forehead against his,feeling our breaths mingle. "I love you," I whispered, the words a soothi
ng balm to our souls. "I love you too," he replied, his voice gentle as a caress.
In that moment, all jealousy and misunderstandings melted away,
leaving only the undeniable bond between us. The car continued
to move forward, but we were lost in our own world.a world fi
lled with love and intimacy.
###Chapter 63

Adam's POV

The antique clock in the study struck half past two. The Manhattan skyline glittered outside my window, with only the desk lamp keeping me company in my solitude.

My phone vibrated. It was Tyler.

"Everything has been taken care of," he reported. "The record of the incident at the police station has been expunged."

"And the nightclub?" I asked, drumming my fingers on the desk.


"The surveillance footage shows that Brian initiated the altercation. He attempted to assault Mrs. Lancaster and Miss Roberts. We have witnesses corroborating their account."

Tyler paused before adding, "Sir, you should know that for the past twenty years, Mrs. Lancaster has celebrated her birthday on this day."

My fingers froze mid-air. "Today is her birthday?" "Yes, sir. Everyone in New York knows about Lucy's birthday party at Rouge, but no one mentioned that it was also Mrs.Lancaster's birthday."No one, Including me.′′Iunderstand." I said, forcing the words out. "Thank you,Tyler."

I immediately dialed Mark's number, waiting through several rings before a groggy voice answered.


"Do you know what time it is?" Mark sounded half-asleep and very annoyed.

"I need you to set up a topic for tomorrow morning," I said,skipping the pleasantries.

"What?"

"Just say that Lucy was taken to the police station last night."

"You woke me up at three-thirty in the morning for gossip about your nephew's girlfriend?" Mark was incredulous. "You really want me to smear her in the media?"

"Just do it. Go back to sleep," I replied, hanging up before he could argue. Lucy certainly wasn't worth the effort, but Stella was. The realization hit harder than expected. When did her well-being become so important? This was no longer just about appearances. Something had changed, and I wasn't sure how I felt about it. When I entered the bedroom, the soft glow of the bedside lamp illuminated Stella's sleeping form. She was curled up with her back to the door, looking much smaller and more fragile than when she was awake.


I slipped into bed, instinctively reaching out to pull her into my arms. Her hands were cold-as they always were in winter-and she instinctively moved closer to my warmth.

I gently turned her to face me. In sleep, she had shed all her defenses-so different from the woman who had decisively subdued Brian at the nightclub just hours ago.

"Happy birthday, Mrs. Lancaster," I whispered.

After a moment, I added, "Happy birthday, Stella."

Saying her name felt surprisingly intimate, more personal than our physical relationship. Hearing her name, she didn't wake but made a small sound in response, then snuggled closer.

I studied her face in the dim light. When had I started to care about her? Was this what it felt like to love someone?


With these questions lingering, exhaustion finally caught up with me, and I drifted into sleep.


---

Stella's POV Morning light filtered through the curtains. casting a golden band across the bed. I blinked awake, puzzled by the unusual weight around my waist. Turning gently. I was surprised to find Adam still in bed, his arm possessively draped over me.

He's still here? I glanced at the clock-it was past nine. Adam was usually long gone by now.

I tried to move away. but his arm tightened. "Don't move." he murmured, his voice husky with sleep.

We were so close that my heart began to race. Waking up in someone's arms felt more intimate than sex-it was an unconscious surrender to another person's presence.

"It's already nine," I whispered. "Don't you need to go to the office?"


Adam didn't respond, instead pulling me closer. resting my head under his chin.


His phone rang from the nightstand. I nudged him. "Your phone."

"Ignore it," he mumbled into my hair. The ringing continued. "It might be important." I insisted.feeling his heartbeat against my cheek. "Turn it off," he ordered, not bothering to opon his exea. I reached over him to grab the phone, checking the caller ID. "It's Tyler," I said, answering before Adam could stop me. "Hello.Ty−′′

"Sir?" an unfamiliar male voice interrupted. "The board is waiting for the quarterly review. Will you be joining us soon?"

I froze, realizing my mistake. This wasn't Tyler's personal call-it was Adam's work phone. "I'm sorry. I thought-"

"Wait, who are you?" The man's voice rose in panic. "Tyler! A woman answered Mr. Lancaster's phone!"

There was a rustling sound before Tyler came on the line."Mrs.Lancaster? Is Mr. Lancaster awake?"

"Not fully," I admitted, glancing at Adam, who still hadn't bothered to open his eyes.

Tyler sighed. "I understand. He hasn't slept more than ten hours in the past three days during the Europe trip. After landing, he went straight to the police station to get you." I looked at Adam with newfound understanding, noticing the shadows under his eyes and the faint lines of fatigue on his face. Without thinking, I reached out to smooth the crease between his brows. "I'll reschedule the meeting," Tyler added. "Let him rest." "Thank you, Tyler." I said softly.

As I ended the call. Adam opened his eyes, finding me touching his face. His green eyes. still hazy with sleep,locked onto mine with an intensity that took my breath away.
###Chapter 64

Stella's POV

"What are you doing?"

Adam's fingers closed around my wrist. firm but not rough. I looked up into those intense green eyes-still sleepy but radiating a pressure that made my stomach flip.

My body tensed on instinct. "Uh, Taylor called, said the board didn't wait for you and might push the meeting... Can you let go?"

He stared at me for a beat before loosening his grip. Sitting up slowly, the drowsiness vanished, and he ran a hand through his messy hair, looking so effortlessly hot it threw me off.*God,how's he this gorgeous straight out of bed? Like he just stepped off a magazine cover.*

"Should I tell Taylor to keep the meeting going?"I asked. If he got up now and cleaned up, he could hit GT Group headquarters in under an hour, and they wouldn't have to reschedule. Adam glanced at me, flashing that maddening smirk. "Mrs.Lancaster, your husband skipping a day won't stop him from taking care of you." *Who needs you to take care of me?* I rolled my eyes internally, like I'm some 1950s housewife living off his paycheck. I squinted at him, suspicious. "Missing a meeting screws up a ton of company stuff, doesn't it? Aren't CEOs supposed to be workaholics?"

"Stella, you're sounding like a nagging little wife."he said.amusement dripping from his voice, smug as hell.

"What? I'm not a nagging wife!"I shot back. eyes wide with disbelief. Adam was insufferable-too cocky for his own good.I was just trying to help. and he calls me *nagging*?

He slid out of bed, stretching his tall frame. muscles flexing under the morning light. Heading to the wardrobe. he paused at the door and crooked a finger at me. "Come here."

"Picking another tie for you?"I mumbled, dragging myself off the bed, still heavy with sleep, like a lazy kitten.

I shuffled over. but before I got close, his gaze dropped to my bare feet, brows knitting. "Put shoes on." I wiggled my toes. "There's floor heating, it's not cold-ah!"Mid-sentence, his hands grabbed my waist, lifting me like I weighed nothing. My heart jumped into my throat, racing from the sudden move. He plopped me back by the bed, right in front of my pink slippers. "Wear them,"he said, voice firm, no room for debate-like he was bossing around a kid, but also kind of sweet. It all happened so fast. I blinked, dazed,slipping my feet into the slippers on autopilot. *Since when does he care if my feet are cold? Is he secretly this doting?*

Adam nodded. satisfied, then took my hand, pulling me to the wardrobe. "Help me pick clothes."

His hand swallowed mine, the rough pads of his fingers brushing my skin, sending little tingles up my arm. *Holding hands feels so intimate-his grip's so warm, like he's claiming me.* I tried not to dwell on how perfectly our hands fit,keeping my cool.

Since he was just heading to the office, not meeting clients,I went for a relaxed business casual look, pairing it with platinum cufflinks etched with a quirky pattern-something to liven up his usual stern vibe. When he saw them, his brows twitched. I could practically hear his thoughts: he sticks to dark tones, and these had been gathering dust in their box.

"They look great, Adam,"I said, unable to hide my sass. "You're only twenty-seven-stop dressing like you're fifty. Back in college, even my forty-something profs had more style than you." I regretted it the second it slipped out. His eyes darkened,and in a flash, he had me pinned against the wardrobe、arms caging me in like a trap."Stella, you think I'm old?"His voice dropped low, teasing but edged with danger.


The cool wood pressed against my back as I looked up at him.This close, my heart was pounding, but I fought to keep my face steady. *They say men peak at thirty, and at twenty-seven.he's prime-but I just hit twenty, so yeah, he's kinda old next to me.* No way I'd admit that now.

I stayed quiet, and he took it as an answer, letting out a chilly laugh. "Stella, you're begging for it."

His breath grazed my skin as his hand slipped under my nightgown, sliding up my thigh, warm and slow. *What's he doing, starting this first thing in the morning?* My brain scrambled to stay in control, but my body was already melting,tingling wherever he touched.

"Adam... mmh!"My protest died as his lips crashed into mine,his cologne flooding my senses, wiping my mind blank.

"Let go!"Ishoved at his chest, but my hands lingered,greedy for the feel of him.


His arms tightened around me like steel bands, pulling me closer. "What do you want?"I huffed,flustered. 6e murmured against my ear, voice "To show you I'm not old,"he so sultry it sent heat pooling between my legs. Before 1 could blink, his hand cupped my breast, squeezing gently through the fabric, then tugging my nightgown up. Cool air hit my skin, and I glanced down-my bare chest spilled out.full and exposed under his gaze. I wanted to die of embarrassment. *Oh God, this is mortifying-but why's his stare burning me up like that?*

He didn't stop, leaning down to kiss my neck, lips hot and wet as they trailed to my chest, sucking lightly. I gasped.arms wrapping around his neck on instinct.*What's wrong with me?I want to push him off, but I want him to keep going...*

Adam pulled back, smirking. "Looks like you want me too,huh?"

"You..."Istammered, too shy to form words, face flaming.

"Alright, let's make it even better."He scooped me up and laid me on the bed, voice husky. "Enjoy this."

His kisses poured down like rain-neck, chest, lower-dense and teasing, his tongue flicking over my skin. Big hands roamed everywhere, kneading my waist, grabbing my hips. I went limp, powerless, letting him take over. *He's too good at this-I'm done for...* When I snapped back to reality, my clothes were gone. He stripped down, his erection springing free, tip glistening. Before I could process it, he gripped my waist and thrust in, stretching me full. I moaned loud, helpless. *It's too much-my heart's gonna burst!*

He held my hips, driving deep, each thrust rocking me senseless.
I bit my lip to stay quiet, but he nibbled my ear, panting,′′Fgood?"

"You!"I clenched my jaw, stubborn, refusing to answer.

He grinned, pulling out to tease my slick entrance with slow rubs. The tingling drove me crazy, mouth dry, body moving on its own-legs hooking around his waist, need overriding sense.*I'm screwed, totally under his spell.*

He chuckled, one hand on my waist, the other on my hip,sliding back in. The rush hit hard-I cried out, legs clamping tighter. "Still think I'm old?"he teased, rubbing me again,torturing me with pleasure as he thrust, our sounds filling the room.

His heavy breaths tangled with my moans. I tried to hush myself at first, shy as hell, but the waves of bliss broke me- I couldn't hold back, my cries spurring him to pound harder.*God,I'm completely his now...*
###Chapter 65

Stella's POV

An hour later, I sprawled across the tangled sheets, watching Adam step out of the bathroom in the suit I'd picked-though,predictably, he'd swapped those fun cufflinks for a boring,conservative pair. *Figures-he's still such a stick-in-the-mud.*

His eyes landed on the little jewelry box I'd left on the nightstand last night. "What's that?" he asked, pointing.

My heart skipped-I'd totally forgotten about it.′′Agift from a friend. Haven't opened it yet." *God, I hope it's from James-he's always dropping mysterious stuff like this.*

Adam gave it a quick glance, uninterested, and turned to leave."Adam!" I called as he hit the bedroom door. I propped myself up, wincing at the ache in my body-*damn, he really wore me out this morning.* "Everything go okay in Europe?"

"Yeah," he said, short and sweet.

Just a "yeah." No details, no nothing. A cold pang hit my chest,like someone dumped ice water on me. *That's it? Can't he at least toss me a bone, say something sweet?* I'd wanted to ask about those online rumors-the pics of him with that blonde but I chickened out. *What if he thinks I'm being nosy? Better not poke the bear.* After he left, I grabbed the jewelry box and popped it open.Inside were two gorgeous pearl hairpins. engraved with "SW"
on the inner edge-subtle, elegant, and perfectly crafted.*This has James written all over it-he knows me too well.* I shot him a thank-you text. but after a few unanswered messages,my stomach sank. *Did he block me? What the hell's going on?*

My phone buzzed-Samantha:"Check Twitter trends NOW!"

Curious, I opened the app and spotted two hot topics: #LucyPoliceMidnight and #LucyBirthday. *Oh, this oughta be good.* Digging in, I saw Lucy had bought birthday hype. but it backfired hard.


#LucyPoliceMMidnight was packed with videos and eyewitness posts-Lucy got hauled off by cops from Rouge nightclub after starting a fight. Comments ranged from pity to shade:

@NYPartyScene: Lucy Winston and her boyfriend Brian Lancaster got booted from Rouge and nabbed by police on her birthday! Wild night!

@ManhattanElite: Word is she was plastered and swinging at people. Total nutcase!

@SocialCircleInsider: Anyone know who she scrapped with?

I couldn't help grinning. *Karma's a sneaky bitch--Lucy's finally getting hers.* Logging into Rouge's official accouint.1dropped a quick statement: Rouge Official Statement: Regarding last night's incident, we confirm Ms. Lucy Winston and Mr. Brian Lancaster engaged in a physical altercation with other guests and are now permanently banned. Rouge has zero tolerance for violence.

Right after. Sam texted again: "BTW, the first outlet to break the police story? Mark owns it."


I froze, piecing it together. Mark-Adam's buddy. The timing was too perfect to be random. *Did Adam set this up to stick it to her for me?* My heart warmed, like he'd slipped me a secret sweet.


*If he did, maybe I should kiss him as a thank-you-right on that smug mouth of his.* My face heated up, and I shook off the embarrassing thought fast.




Adam's POV

I sat at the head of the conference table, irritation climbing as the execs stared anywhere but the quarterly report. They swapped looks and whispers when they thought I wouldn't notice-bunch of distracted idiots.


*Bam!*

I slammed my folder down, the crack cutting off the marketing director mid-sentence. Every jittery exec snapped their eyes to me.

"What, got data on my face you're all gawking at?" I asked.voice ice-cold, tapping the table. "Zoning out in my meeting-you begging to get canned?"

Dead silence. Finally, one brave soul cleared his throat.

"Mr. Lancaster, when we called you this morning," he started.cautious as hell,"awoman picked up."

Stella answered when I was still half-asleep. I nodded casually."Problem?"


"No, no problem!" he backpedaled quick.

That little nod confirmed their morning gossip fest. I leaned back, scanning their faces. "Anything else you wanna ask?"

I was in a damn good mood today-normally, I'd have chewed them out for this crap.

"Mr. Lancaster," another piped up, ballsy enough to push it, "can we ask... who she is? The one from last time?"

I dropped my gaze, a smirk tugging at my lips. *Who else could it be but Stella?* I didn't say it out loud-my look said enough. Later in my office. I flipped through papers while Taylor hovered. explaining the execs' weirdness.

"Sir, it's not totally their fault,"' he said. "When Mrs. Lancaster picked up and said you were stil asleep... I mean, you've never had a woman around in all these years. They were floored."

"What'd they say?" I asked, pen tapping a steady beat, mind drifting to Stella's flushed face this morning. *Her voice was all soft and sleepy on the phone like a kitten purring. Damn cute.*


"They kept asking who your wife is. But I swear, I didn't spill a thing!" Taylor rushed to add. "They're dying to know what kind of woman could make you... not bolt to work."

I'm a stickler for schedules-making senior management wait over an hour today was a first. *All her fault-messing around this morning made me wanna stay in bed. Picturing her moaning under me? Screw the meeting.*

"Next time they ask, say she's gorgeous," I said coolly.

"Huh?" Taylor blinked, then caught on.′′Oh,yes,sir!"

I almost laughed. He probably thought I was showing off. *Maybe I am-who wouldn't brag about Stella? She's too damn cute to keep under wraps.*

"Cancel the rest of my day," I added.
"Everything?" Taylor's jaw dropped. "The afternoon meeting.Wall Street dinner-those can slide, but the video call with London tonight..."


"Push it," I said, firm, my mind flicking to that jewelry box on Stella's nightstand. *Did she open it yet? Who sent it-some guy?* My brows pinched. "Get the event planning team in here.11


Taylor looked baffled. The planning crew handles company parties-I barely glance their way normally.

Minutes later, the team lead shuffled in, nervous as hell,probably thinking she'd screwed up to get my attention.

"Ditch whatever you're on," I told her.′′P1lan a birthday party.Three hours."


Her mouth fell open, and I hid a grin. *Let them all guess what-or who-turned me into this guy.* Thinking of Stella's eyes lighting up when she sees a surprise made my chest go soft.
###Chapter 66

Stella's POV

I was fully engrossed in reviewing the costume photos for the "Splendor" crew when my phone vibrated. It was Adam.

"What is it?" I asked without looking up, my eyes still fixed on a problematic detail of a dress hem.

"Reserve tonight for me," he said in that unmistakable tone that brooked no argument. It was clear this was not a request but a directive.


I glanced at the pile of photos still awaiting approval on my desk. "I have a deadline to meet-"


"It's already taken care of. Taylor and the production team have been informed."


Of course, he would have everything arranged in advance.I sighed, knowing resistance was futile. "What should I wear?"

"Something beautiful," his voice dropped a notch, "though you always look beautiful."


The unexpected compliment caught me off guard. "Mr Lancaster, are you flirting with me?"

"Would you prefer I flirt with someone else,?" "You-"I felt my cheeks flush. "Just tell me where we're going."

"You'll find out soon enough," I could hear the smile in his voice. "A car will pick you up at six."

He hung up before I could respond. Typical Adam-always in control ofthe conversation.




At precisely six o'clock, I descended the stairs in a red cashmere evening gown. Joseph greeted me with his signature knowing smile.

"You look exceptionally stunning tonight, Madam," he said.

"Joseph, you're starting to soundI just like Adam with your compliments."

"I'm merely stating the truth, Madam. Though I believe Mr.Lancaster will express his appreciation in a more... direct manner."


I felt my cheeks heat up. Lately, everyone in the manor seemed overly invested in my relationship with Adam.

The car didn't head towards the financial district but drove north. When it stopped at the entrance of an amusement park,I thought there must be a mistake. But a young woman in business casual attire approached, her GT Group badge gleaming under the lights.

"Mrs. Lancaster, this way, please. Mr. Lancaster is waiting for you inside."

What on earth was Adam planning? And why was a GT employee at an amusement park?


Before I could figure it out, a little girl holding a bouquet of exquisite firebird roses appeared before me. "Happy birthday,pretty lady!" she said sweetly.

What followed was a continuous stream of bouquets-each accompanied by birthday wishes-until my arms were full of flowers. I noticed that these bouquets deliberately avoided red roses, using various other species instead.

Finally, we arrived at the castle in the amusement park. Adam sat in a wheelchair, looking strikingly handsome in a perfectly tailored black wool coat. His usual stern expression was softened slightly, and he held a large bouquet of red roses-the first I'd seen that night.

My heart pounded so hard I could almost hear it.

"Happy birthday, my dear," he said softly, his green eyes locking onto míne.

As soon as he spoke, the night sky behind the castle erupted in a dazzling display of fireworks, spelling out "STELLA 
LANCASTER HAPPY BIRTHDAY" in the darkness.

The surrounding crowd burst into exclamations and cheers:

"So romantic!"

"Another birthday surprise!"

"Happy birthday, bride!"

"May you have many children!"

"Grow old together!"

I felt my cheeks flush. "Was this really necessary... to be so...high-profile?"

Adam's lips curved into that heart-stopping smile as he pulled me closer. "Mrs. Lancaster deserves all of this." His thumb gently brushed my cheek. "And the private celebration is yet to come."


My breath hitched. "Adam!"

"What?" He feigned innocence, but the heat in his eyes betrayed him. "I was only talking about dinner."

"You're impossible," I muttered, but couldn't help nuzzling into his palm.

He captured my hand,pressing a kiss into my palm. "Only for vOI" “Just wondering if Mrs. Lancaster might mind the late hour."

I couldn't control the moisture welling up in my eyes, so l lowered my gaze and accepted the flowers."Idon't mind."

"Not happy?" he asked gently.

I looked up and shook my head. "I'm very happy. Thank you,Adam."


This was the most heartfelt birthday I'd ever had, with the most sincere birthday wishes.

In the past, birthday parties were mostly about my identity as the "daughter of the Sheng family." People said what they thought I wanted to hear, but sincerity was scarce.

The surrounding tourists began to cheer:

"Kiss! Kiss!"

"Kiss!"

"Handsome guy and beautiful lady,kiss!"

The cheering grew louder.

"Ms. Lancaster, I've told you before, thank you is not enough."His gaze fell on my lips, the implication clear. I saw a playful glint in his deep green eyes, He sat in his wheelchair, waiting motionlessly, yet he seemed to be bathed in starlight.

I had no choice but to lower my eyes and smile, bending down.

My red lips met his.




That night in the presidential suite of the hotel. Adam proved just how thorough his birthday plans were.

"I have a meeting tomorrow morning," I weakly protested as his lips trailed down my neck.

"Cancel it."

"You can't just--" My words turned into a gasp as he found the sensitive spot behind my ear.

"Can't I?" His voice carried that dangerous edge that always made my knees weak. "It's the birthday girl's privilege."

"It's not my birthday anymore," I managed to say.

He pulled back slightly to look at me, his gaze intense. "Then I'Il have to make up for the missed birthdays." He walked over slowly, his shirt half-unbuttoned, showing his firm chest. My heart raced, and my fingers gripped my skirt. "Stella,I love you," he said in a low, husky voice,leaning close to my ear, his warm breath on my skin. I bit my lip, my cheeks burning.

He chuckled, his hand sliding up my thigh, stopping at the edge of my skirt, fingertips brushing my sensitive skin. I shivered, my body already reacting. He leaned down, kissing my neck slowly,his tongue leaving a wet trail.

"Is this enough?"he murmured, his fingers slipping into my panties, parting my wet folds, touching my swollen clit. I gasped, my hips lifting. His fingers moved skillfully, sliding in and out, circling,making me weak.

I grabbed his shoulders, nails digging in, voice shaky. “Don't stop... harder." He smirked, then kissed me hard,his tongue pushing into my mouth. His fingers sped up, thrusting deep,my wet walls clinging to him, making soft sounds.

I felt completely his, each thrust pushing me closer until a wave of heat hit me. I screamed, my body tensing, legs clamping around his hand as I shook through my climax.
###Chapter 67

Stella's POV

When I woke up the next afternoon. Adam had aIready gone to work. I vaguely remembered his goodbye kiss at dawn,when I was still too groggy to properly respond. My body carried a pleasant soreness, and the sheets still held the scent of his cologne.

My phone was filled with notifications:

Birthday wishes from Manhattan's elite (probably hoping to score points with Adam)

Gossip vultures trying to figure out who arranged the fireworks

Social climbers suddenly remembering my existence

James texted: \[Is someone courting you? Your birthday was days ago!\]

\[No one is couarting me,\] I replied honestly.

His response? He blocked me. I rolled my eyes-what was his problem lately?
 
Social media was abuzz: \[@ManhattanSociety\]: All of Manhattan knows it's Stella's birthday now! \[@NYCGossipQueen\]: Who is this goddess Stella, worthy of such a romantic fireworks display?

\[@LoveGoals\]: Now we have to be jealous of other people's birthdays.

\[@WitnessingMagic\]: Saw it in person - a super handsome guy and a stunning lady. This must be what fairy tale love looks like!


I scrolled through the comments, feeling a strange unease.Last night had been perfect-too perfect. For the first time in my life,someone's kindness made me nervous. Not because I couldn't accept it, but because I was afraid of losing it.

When had I become so dependent on his presence? When had his attention become as essential as breathing?


My fingers unconsciously traced the mark he had left on my collarbone-a spot he had recently become particularly fond of.He seemed overly eager to mark his territory.


As I checked my schedule on my phone, I saw a message from Adam:


\[Dinner tonight. Wear something easy to take off, not another gown.\] I felt my cheeks heat up but couldn't help smiling. In the morning,I came to the Splender set.

"I understand I may not have enough experience for the Deputy Director position, but Stella? She only graduated a year ago! What qualifies her to be my superior?"

I stopped outside the *Splendor* production office, immediately recognizing Anny Brown's voice. Of course she was here-and predictably complaining about my appointment. Some people never change.

"Ah, Stella!" Director called out when he saw me enter. "Perfect timing! Anny has some concerns about our staffing arrangements. Perhaps you could share your qualifications with her?"


I met Anny's challenging stare, remembering our last encounter during the GT Group interviews. "Long time no see, Anny.Looks like we're moving from alumni to colleagues."


The room fell silent as I began listing my credentials. With each achievement I mentioned-ten major projects during my studies, costume design for three award-winning period dramas, full industry certifications-Anny's expression grew increasingly sour. *Still can't accept losing to me*, I thought, *just like at GT Group*. "I believe that answers your concerns about my qualifications?"I maintained a professional tone, though I couldn't completely hide my satisfaction at her discomfort.

A petite figure suddenly bounded in front of me, practically vibrating with excitement. "Oh my god, you're even prettier in person! I'm Lisa, your assistant stylist, and I can't believe I get to work with you!"


Her genuine enthusiasm caught me off guard. After dealing with Anny's hostility, Lisa's warmth was refreshing.Still,I couldn't help but wonder if she'd been assigned to spy on me.In this industry, enthusiasm often masked ulterior motives.

Throughout the day's meetings, I could feel Anny's gaze burning into my back. Every time I spoke, she'd make a small noise of disdain. By afternoon, even my legendary patience was wearing thin.

*Stay professional*, I reminded myself, *you're the deputy director now. Act like it*.


\---

That evening in my hotel room, Joseph called.

"Madam,will you be returning to the manor tonight?""No, I'm staying at a hotel near the studio. We start filming tomorrow." A brief pause. "I see. Mr. Lancaster has returned to the manor."

*Damn*. I had completely forgotten to tell Adam about this temporary assignment.

"I'll call him now." I quickly hung up.

My finger hovered over Adam's number. One ring. Two rings.Three. Just as I was about to give up, he answered. The line remained silent.


"Adam..." I began, hating the uncertainty in my voice.m sorry I didn't tell you earlier. Everything was so rushed this morning."

"So I'm just your one-night stand?" His voice was deceptively calm, but I knew that tone. He was angry.

"This is the *Splendor* project assigned by GT Group. I thought you knew." I couldn't keep the frustration from my voice. "People report to you when I have lunch with Sam,I don't believe no one told you about this project."

I heard him light a cigarette, followed by a slow exhale. Great,smoking meant he was really upset. "Besídes," I added, "you're always so busy. I didn't want to bother you." Wrong thing to say. The silence on the line grew heavier. "Get some rest." He hung up before I could respond.

I stared at my phone, torn between calling back and throwing it against the wall. Why did every conversation with him lately feel like walking a tightrope?

\---

The next morning's opening ceremony went smoothly until a commotion erupted near the private dressing rooms. Lucy had arrived, surveying everyone like a queen.

"Miss Winston!" Anny's voice dripped with honey. "What a coincidence! Did you know Stella's working here too? As Deputy Styling Director!"

I watched Lucy's hand pause on her dressing room door handle. "I'm sorry, who are you?"

Anny's eager expression froze. "I'm Anny Brown, from-"

"You want to use me against Stella?" Lucy's laugh was sharp. "Know your place."

Watching Anny's humiliation, I couldn't help but smile.*Trying to ally with Lucy? Amateur move*. By midday, Lucy cornered me near the dressing room vanity. "Stella," her voice carried that familiar poisonous sweetness,"how does someone who doesn't even know their birth parents dare to celebrate birthdays?"


I focused on organizing my makeup brushes, refusing to react to her provocation. She'd played this game too many times.


"Speaking of celebrations," she continued, "you need to have Rouge's owner apologize to me. They actually blacklisted me!"


"Sorry, that's the club owner's decision," I replied calmly. "I have no authority there."

"Then have Sam handle it! Rouge's owner clearly favors her-there must be something going on between them!"


I almost laughed at her speculation. If only she knew who really owned Rouge...


"If you're willing to apologize to Sam first, perhaps Rouge's owner might reconsider."

Lucy's face twisted with rage."You-"

"Miss Winston!" A production assistant called out. "You're needed on set!"

*Saved by the bell*, I thought, watching Lucy storm off. The afternoon shoot was torture. The temperature hovered near freezing, but Lucy insisted on having me personally handle her makeup.

"Director," she called out sweetly, "could Stella do my touch-ups? We're old friends, and I'd love to give this newcomer some practice."

For the next three hours, I stood in the biting wind while Lucy found endless faults. Her headdress was loose. Her mascara was running. Her gown had wrinkles.

Meanwhile, she had heating pads under her costume, with assistants rushing forward with down jackets between takes.I watched them fuss over her, remembering how she always played the delicate flower at the Winston house.

"Stella,are you okay?" Lisa whispered, noticing my trembling hands. "You're freezing!"


"Thanks for your hard work today, Stella!" Lucy called out as she left. "I hope you can maintain this level of *professionalism*throughout filming!"

*At least someone's enjoying themselves*, I thought bitterly.


---Back in my hotel room, I soaked in a hot bath, trying to chase away the bone-deep chill. My throat felt like sandpaper, and my head was pounding. I'd just taken some cold medicine when my phone rang.

"What's wrong with you?" Adam's voice was sharp.

"Caught a cold," I mumbled, already feeling drowsy from the medication. "Did you need something?"

"Wrong number." The line went dead immediately.

I stared groggily at my phone, unsure if I'd imagined the concern in his voice. As sleep overtook me, I thought I heard my phone vibrate again, but I was too far gone to check.

In my dreams, I felt warm hands smoothing back my hair,caught that familiar cologne that always made me feel safe.But that was impossible-Adam was probably still angry with me.
###Chapter 68

Stella's POV

"Sorry. I have a cold." I said through my mask, pointing at the clothing designs on the projection screen. "Let's continue discussing these costume designs."

A soft chuckle came from Anny's drection. After yesterday's conflict, she seemed to find my illness amusing. I ignored her and focused on my work.

"For the opening scene, we need to highlight the contrast between the main characters," I continued, flipping through the designs. "The colors should reflect their social status, but not too obviously..."

The meeting dragged on, and my head grew heavier. The cold medicine was wearing off, but I couldn't let it affect my work.This was my first major project as the deputy costume director-I had to prove myself.

After two hours of intense discussion, we finally agreed on the costume modifications. As I was packing up my files, trying to hide my fatigue, Lisa burst into the meeting room excitedly. "Stella! There's a super handsome man outside looking for you!"Her eyes sparkled. "And he's driving the latest luxury car!" My heart skipped a beat. *Adam?* But wasn't he supposed to be busy with work? And wasn't he still mad about me staying at the hotel?


"Lisa, could you please take my laptop back to my room?"I was already heading towards the door. Despite maintaining a professional demeanor, I found my steps quickening. Soon, I was almost running.

Outside, the cold winter wind hit my face. Through the falling snow,I saw the familiar luxury car with the window half-open.Cigar smoke mingled with the snowflakes in the night air.

I hurried over, slightly out of breath. Adam sat in the driver's seat, looking striking in his perfectly tailored suit. He took one last puff of his cigar and elegantly extinguished it.

"Get in," he said simply, his breath visible in the cold air.

I slid into the passenger seat, immediately enveloped by the car's warmth. His presence filled the enclosed space, making my heart race uncontrollably.

"Adam,why are you here?"

"Business trip." His gaze swept over my flushed cheeks and bright eyes, lingering in a way that made my skin tingle. I understood. He was on a business trip and decided to check on me. "Mrs. Lancaster, do you get sick when there's no one to warm your bed?"

My cheeks burned."No-it's just the cold weather!"

"It's the cold weather." I explained, my ears turning red. Seeing the car moving. I asked, "Where are you taking me?"

"Hotel."

"I have work tomorrow. I can't..."

"Mrs. Lancaster, is this what you want?" He said with a teasing smile.′′Ifyou want,I can-"

I leaned over and covered his mouth."How can you twist my words like that?"


His expression briefly froze.

"Can you keep your mouth shut in public? There are people in the car." I whispered through gritted teeth.

"Ma'am, you can pretend we're not here." Taylor said understandingly.

The driver nodded."Exactly!" How much did Adam pay them to be so dedicated? Before I could gather my thoughts, he had already driven into the hotel parking lot. 
As soon as we entered the suite, he pinned me against the door.trapping me with his body. One hand tangled in my hair,the other firmly holding my waist.

"Wait-" I tried to push his chest, but he grabbed my wrists.pinning them above my head. His other hand trailed down my neck, leaving a burning path. "I have a cold! You'll catch it!"

He ended the kiss but didn't release his hold. His eyes darkened with desire, roaming over my face. "Stella, do you remember who I am?"

His tone made my heart race."My husband!"

"You're driving me crazy,' he muttered, his voice rough, almost accusing, and before I could respond, his lips crashed into mine.
It wasn't gentle-it was hungry, desperate, like he'd been holding back for too long.

I gasped against his mouth, and he took the chance to deepen the kiss, his tongue slipping past my lips, hot and demanding.

My hands flew to his chest, fingers curling into his shirt as if I needed to anchor myself. Oh God, this is too much, I thought,but my body disagreed, pressing closer, craving more. His hands gripped my waist, pulling me against him,and I could feel the hard lines of his body through the thin fabric between us. It set my skin on fire. He tilted his head, kissing me harder, and a soft moan escaped me-I couldn't stop it. My mind was spinning, torn between wanting to memorize every second of this and just letting go completely.

I turned my head just in time to sneeze, breaking the intimate moment. Taking advantage of the distraction, I slipped out of his grasp. though my legs were still shaky.

I came out of the shower wrapped in a towel. only to find that I had no clothes, so I had to call him for help.

He got up from the sofa and came over with a bad smile:′′It looks good like this, why wear more?" I flushed and glared at him.


"Put this on and I promise you'll look sexier than me," he whispered in my ear, handing me one of his white shirts. The fabric was still warm from the dryer, carrying his familiar scent.

I took the clothes, turned and ran back to the bathroom,secretly blaming myself for liking his flirting a little.

After I changed, his laptop chimed with a video calI notification.Before I could move away, I accidentally appeared on camera. The faces of GT Group executives filled the screen, their expressions a mix of shock and barely concealed curiosity. I wished I could disappear under the bed. However. Adam remained perfectly calm. "The meeting is over.Forget what you saw."

"Why didn't you tell me you were in a meeting?" I demanded after he ended the call.

"No one recognized you." He approached with a cup of medicine,his steps predatory.′′Drink this."

I wrinkled my nose at the bitter smell. "I've already taken-"

His kiss cut off my protest, the medicine transferring from his mouth to mine. Instinctively, I swallowed, too shocked to resist.When he finally pulled back, his eyes held a dangerous glint that made my stomach flip.

"That was completely unnecessary!" I stammered, retreating to the bed. My heart pounded so loudly, I was sure he could hear it.

Seeing me cover my flushed face, Adam's smile was one of triumphant satisfaction.

At that moment, he suddenly reached for my shirt.

"Hey! Don't... I have work tomorrow, I can't be late or miss it!"I quickly tried to dodge. He pulled my collar up slightly, saying coolly, "You're overthinking." 
Was he mocking me? How could I be blamed? His shirt was way too big!

After being forced to take the medicine and teased by him, I burrowed under the covers, turning my back to him, and grumbled, "I'm going to sleep!"

He bit my earlobe. his voice dangerously low. "Mrs. Lancaster.you should be grateful you're sick. Otherwise, I'd make you cry tonight!"


As we lay in bed, I pretended to be angry and turned my back to him, but he just pulled me into his arms. His breath brushed against my ear, and he softly asked, "Still mad?"

His teeth lightly nipped my earlobe, sending shivers down my spine that had nothing to do with my fever. One hand possessively splayed across my stomach, while the other lazily traced patterns on my thigh.

"Adam..." I meant to warn him, but it came out as more of a plea.

"Hmm?" His lips found the sensitive spot behind my ear. "What's wrong, Mrs. Lancaster?"

I relaxed into his embrace, letting his warmth seep into my bones. His touch became gentler, more soothing than provocative, though the underlying tension remained.

As sleep began to overtake me. I felt his arm tighten protectively around me. His voice was so soft I amost missed it.
"Next time you're sick, just tell me. I will take care of you."
###Chapter 69

Adam's POV

The medication finally began to take effect, and Stella's breathing gradually steadied. Watching her sleep, her usual sharp expression softened in slumber. Even in her dreams,she instinctively leaned towards me.

Her phone vibrated on the nightstand. She didn't stir, but I noticed the caller ID: "Grandmother."


Carefully, I got out of bed, walked to the living room,and gently closed the bedroom door before answering the call.

"Stella, dear," the old lady's voice oozed with that insincere sweetness I found so grating, "I heard Rouge nightclub blacklisted Lucy. You should be able to talk to the owner,right?You always have such good connections..."

"Grandmother," I interrupted her incessant chatter, "this is Adam."


There was a sharp intake of breath on the other end.′′O!Adam... why... why isn't Stella answering?" "Stella is asleep," I kept my voice steady, though anger simmered beneath the surface. "Regarding Lucy, Stella can't help. I suggest you stop bothering her about this, understood?" "Understood," she stammered, her voice trembling."I understand."


After hanging up, I stared at the ironic "Grandmother" label on the screen. Remembering how Stella had once pleaded with me for this woman, who now pressured her for Lucy's sake, a chill ran through me.

Returning to the bedroom, I found Stella still peacefully asleep in the dim light. She was too kind, always willing to help those unworthy of her efforts. But that was her nature-perhaps that was why I...

I pushed the thought aside and checked her temperature. The fever had subsided, but I would ensure she took her next dose on time.


\---

Stella's POV

The morning fog in Manhattan had yet to lift as our car glided smoothly through the empty streets. Sitting in the back seat, I stifled a yawn and couldn't help but steal glances at Adam,who was diligently responding to emails on his tablet.Even at this hour, he remained impeccably focused, his profile sharp in the growing light. How did he always manage to maintain such a perfect image?

Upon arriving at the Splendor set, he retrieved a brand-new white cashmere coat from the back seat and handed it to me.


"I'm off, see you later!" I was about to step out when he draped the coat over my shoulders.

I paused, a thought flashing through my mind. This top-tier coat wasn't available in this city. Adam had said he was here on a business trip, but who brings a special coat for me on a business trip?

I turned to look at his face. "Adam... are you really here on a business trip?"

"Yes," his curt reply made me smile.

He had no reason to lie about such a thing, but my intuition told me he wasn't here for business.


"I thought if you were here just to see me, I could give you a reward."


He raised an eyebrow. "What kind of reward? A good morning kiss? Or a farewell kiss?" "A farewell kiss," I felt my cheeks heat up. He chuckled softly. "With your kissing skills?" "What's wrong with my kissing skills? My kissing skills-mmph!"

He pinched my chin and silenced my protest with his lips.I tried to push against his chest, but he easily caught my hands.When he finally let go, his thumb gently wiped away the traces at the corner of my mouth.

"Remember to take your medicine on time," he reminded softly.

\---

"Stella! Something terrible has happened!" As soon as I entered the building, I heard Lisa's panicked voice. "The director is furious because you didn't complete your work on time. You need to come quickly!"

In the meeting room, the director's face was stormy."Stella,where is the design draft for the second male lead that I asked you to prepare yesterday?"

"I left it on your desk yesterday." I replied, puzzled.

The director frowned. "But there's nothing on my desk. Are you sure you didn't put it somewhere else?" Before I could respond, the director slammed the table in anger."If you didn't do the work, just admit it! Don't think I don't know you left right after the meeting yesterday! You're young and already shirking responsibilities!" His words were harsh.

"I..."

"Stella, I'll let it slide this time since you're new. but don't let it happen again!"

′′Director, I did it." Anny's smooth voice cut in as she handed over a portfolio.

The director didn't listen to my explanation and projected Anny's draft onto the screen. sighing in disappointment. "Since you didn't prepare, let's look at Anny's draft."

The projected drafts left me stunned.

These drafts... were identical to mine!

Anny stood up and explained her creative process. The drafts were so aesthetically pleasing and historically accurate that they quickly received unanimous approval.

"Impressive!" The director praised Anny before turning to scold me. "Stella, learn from this! This task was originally yours, and now a colleague had to cover for you!"

"Director, I have a question," I said coldly. "Since I was responsible for these drafts, why did Anny prepare them?"

"Junior, you can't assume everyone is as lazy as you. l, unliko you,seize every opportunity," Anny insinuated. "Preparation?" I pointed at the projected drafts. "Your preparation involves stealing my drafts?"

The room erupted:

"Stealing? What's she talking about?"

"What does she mean by stealing?"

"What's going on?"

"You dare accuse me!" Her face turned red. "You didn't finish your work and now you're accusing me? Do you have any proof these drafts are yours?"

"Senior, when did you prepare these drafts?" I asked directly.

"Inoticed you were the first to leave the set yesterday evening,worried you hadn't completed your work, so I stayed up all night tocreate these drafts."

Anny must have prepared her excuse well in advance.

"Very well!" I took out a stack of sketches from my work bag and displayed them one by one. "Everyone, please take a look."

"These sketches... are identical to Anny's drafts!" someone exclaimed.


"Anny, you said you prepared your drafts last night. If that's true, when did I draw these sketches?" "If these sketches are sent to a professional institution for examination, it will show that the last strokes of these colors were made five days ago." I saw Anny about to speak.

"Anny, please hold your comments for two more minutes.Then you can say whatever you want."


I connected my laptop to the projector and, under dozens of eyes,typed a few lines of code.

A minute later, a new file appeared on the desktop. Opening it revealed drafts identical to Anny's!

"How... how is this possible? I clearly..."

"Clearly deleted them completely? Clearly couldn't find them in the recycle bin?" I chuckled.′′Iforgot to mention, my computer has a hidden backup feature. Did you think I would leave work files casually on the desktop?"

Anny's face turned pale as she collapsed into her chair.

Her composure finally shattered. "I... I didn't mean to... I just wanted to..."The director cleared his throat awkwardly. "Since this was a misunderstanding, let's let it go. Anny made a mistake, but it's her first offense. Let's give her a chance to correct it.""Please, Stella," Anny's voice trembled. "Iadmit I was wrong... I promise it won't happen again. We're both GT employees.you won't hold this against me, right?"

After everyone else left, her repentant facade quickly vanished."You must be so pleased with yourself. You took my opportunity at the GT interview, and now you want to overshadow me here!"


I turned to face her, my expression calm but firm. "Anny, as a designer, professional ethics are more important than skill.Your actions today are pitiful. This is your last chance. Make the most of it."


I walked away, leaving her furious figure in the empty meeting room. On the way back to the office, I touched the cashmere coat Adam had given me, still feeling his warmth. Sometimes,justice arrives in unexpected ways.

*Remember to take your medicine.* His words echoed in my mind. I took out the medicine packet he had prepared, noting the carefully marked dosage times, and felt a warmth in my heart. When had his thoughtfulness become so natural? When had his care become something I relied on? The morning fog in Manhattan finally lifted. I straightened my shoulders and walked into the office. Work awaited, and I only needed to prove myself.
###Chapter 70

Adam's POV

The untouched crystal glass in my hand refracted the faint light.reflecting my tense expression.

"Adam," Mark lounged opposite me. deliberately maintaining a casual tone, "there is a grand party next week. Old and new aristocrats will gather-a perfect social opportunity. Half of Manhattan's high society is vying for an invitation."

"Not interested." My tone was as sharp as shattered glass.

"Come on, you can't hide forever!" Mark leaned forward, "The mysterious GT's CEO finally makes an appearance-everyone's eager to catch a glimpse. And those debutantes..." He raised an eyebrow suggestively.


I glared at him coldly. "Are you here to report the investigation results, or should I find someone else to handle this?"


Mark immediately dropped his playful demeanor. He pulled out a tablet, his expression turning serious."Stella'Grandma has been quite busy. Academic competitions, private tutoring,advanced courses-she's been secretly supporting Stella all these years." "Where's the money coming from?" I pressed, "Anna Winston relies on her husband's allowance for her designer bags.Where' s the funding for Stella's education coming from?"

"That's the most interesting part." Mark lowered his voice, "The money trail is too clean. Unnaturally clean. It's as if someone meticulously erased all traces afterward."

"And the baby swap?"

"Even stranger. Who could swap a baby at a crowded party without leaving a single witness? And Lucy conveniently returning to the Winston family..." Mark paused, observing my expression, "Adam, are you investigating this because you've fallen for Stella?"


The click of high heels interrupted our conversation. A young actress sashayed over, her red knit dress more suited for a nightclub than a luxury resort.

"Mr. Lancaster," she cooed, "why so serious? Let me add some fun to your evening." She picked up the decanter,leaning forward to showcase her assets, "This vintage wine is exquisite."

Her red dress unexpectedly triggered a memory: Stella on her bírthday,elegantly dressed in red silk, her smile pure and warm. The contrast made my stomach churn."Leave," I said coldly, "and that dress-you're only embarrassing yourself. Red doesn't suit you." Watching her flee, her face flushed, Mark whistled. "Harsh. even by your standards. But I noticed you didn't deny falling for Stella."


I chose to ignore his comment. "Continue the investigation. Dig deeper. Something about this whole situation feels off."

"You're avoiding the question." Mark persisted with a grin."Admit it-Adam Lancaster has fallen for his own wife."


My gaze could freeze hell. "Focus on finding answers. Mark.Leave the rest alone."


\---

Stella's POV

I stood by the props table, the low hum of the heater making the air feel surreal.


My throat was still hoarse from coughing all night, and I rubbed my nose, grateful I didn't have to shiver today.

Lisa bounced over, her eyes sparkling like she'd struck gold."Stella, have you heard?" she whispered conspiratorially,"Someone donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to make things better for the crew! Heating, fans, even that new lounge area-all of it!"


I paused, looking down at the edge of my sweater, my fingers unconsciously tightening. Hundreds of thousands of dollars?
Who would be so generous? I forced a smile, trying to keep my voice steady. "That's vey generous. The donor must be very kind."


In the distance, the lighting crew huddled together, whispering."It must be Lucy's boyfriend," one guy said, winking at Lucy.She happened to walk by, and at his words, she gave a smug smile, shrugging her shoulders as if to confirm. "Maybe," she drawled, basking in their envious looks.

I bit my lip, pretending not to hear. Brian? The guy who only sends flowers?* I didn't believe it, but I had no interest in exposing her. The set's atmosphere warmed up, the heater making my cheeks flush, but I felt a hollowness in my chest-this kind of excitement always seemed to exclude me.

"Lucy!" someone called from across the set, "Your boyfriend is amazing! First the roses, now this!"

I watched Lucy's practiced fake smile. I had to admit, she was skilled at accepting undeserved praise.

"Brian, darling!" her voice was sickly sweet, echoing across the set, "Everyone's praising your sponsorship! They say I have the best boyfriend! I love you so much!" I rolled my eyes internally at her performance. Through the phone,I could hear Brian's confused response. *Rookie mistake*, I thought, *never claim credit for something you can't prove*. At lunch. Lucy cornered me with her bouquet, wielding it like a weapon. "About Rouge..."

"Ready to apologize to Sam on your knees?" I cut her off without looking up from my script.

"You-" she sputtered. pulling out her phone. "Mom! Hasn't that old lady talked to Stella yet? This bitch is still mocking me about Rouge!"

Though I couldn't hear Anna's full response. Lucy's shrill"What do you mean Adam said not to bother her?" made me smile into my coffee cup.

In the afternoon, the director's announcement brought new drama to the set. "Exciting news! Our generous benefactor is visiting the set today!"

"Lucy!" someone screamed. "Your Brian is so romantic!"

I watched Lucy adjust her designer coat, basking in the attention.

I tried to focus, but the surrounding chatter felt like a tidal wave, overwhelming me. Lucy was still preening, but I just felt annoyed. *Does she really think she's the center of attention?*I bit my lip, forcing myself to concentrate on my lines. Until the low rumble of wheels cut through the noise like a knife. I looked up, my heart skipping a beat. A wheelchair rolled into view, and Adam emerged, stopping in the center of the set. His face was as cold as ice, his gaze sweeping the crowd before locking onto mine.

Was he the one who donated the money? My throat tightened.and I couldn't find my voice. Lucy's smug expression crumbled 名 into panic. The surrounding chatter ceased, as if someone had hit the pause button.

Adam appeared, impeccably dressed in a perfectly tailored suit,looking devastatingly handsome.

I stood up so quickly I nearly knocked over the entire makeup table. Everyone stared in stunned silence as Adam surveyed the set.


The roses slipped from Lucy's hand. I couldn't tear my eyes away.Why had he come here, enduring the public scrutiny he despised, just to see me?

"Ladies and gentlemen," the director announced excitedly, "I'd like to introduce our generous sponsor, Mr. Lancaster of GT Group, who has generously provided funds to improve our working conditions!"

Enthusíastic applause broke out. I noticed Adam was uncomfortable being the center of attention. He made a slight gesture, and Taylor immediately stepped forward.

"Mr, Lancaster appreciates your warm welcome," Taylor said calmly, "but he's only here for a routine inspection. Please continue with your normal work."

Despite Taylor's words, I could still see curious glances directed at Adam. His green eyes scanned the crowd until they found me, and when our gazes met, I felt that familiar electric jolt.

"This is-" the director began introducing me.

"Ah yes, this is our Assistant Costume Director, Stella Winston.She's doing excellent work in our wardrobe department." His eyes brightened. "In fact, Miss Winston could perhaps show you some of her designs? She's very talented."

Panic rushed through me. This was my workplace, my professional environment. Just yesterday, I was fighting against Anny's sabotage, trying to establish myself as a professional.The last thing I needed was for everyone to think I got this position because of my relationship with Adam.

*If I acknowledge our relationship now, won't everyone think I don't deserve to be here? That I only relied on my husband's connections?*


I stepped forward with a professional expression. "Hello, Mr.Lancaster. I'm Stella Winston, Assistant Costume Director for'Splendor.' Pleased to meet you."
###Chapter 71

Stella's POV

I saw a flash of surprise in Adam's eyes, followed by obvious displeasure. His jaw tightened almost imperceptibly, but I knew him well enough to recognize signs of his annoyance.

*He's angry that I'm pretending not to know him. But what else could I do? I've worked so hard to earn my place here.*

"Miss Winston," he responded coolly, "the pleasure is mine."

The tension in the air was thick enough to cut. I maintained my professional smile, but inside I was a mess of conflicting emotions.

*What is he doing here? Has he come to see me?*

"Director," Adam suddenly said, his gaze never leaving me, "I think I'll stay here tonight."

My heart skipped a beat. *What? Is he punishing me for pretending not to know him?*

The director nearly jumped with excitement.′′Of course,Mr.Lancaster! It's our honor! I'll arrange the best suite in the hotel. We must have a welcome dinner tonight-nothing too elaborate!""Acceptable," Adam nodded, then casually added, "Perhaps Miss Winston can show me to my room."

I felt my cheeks flush.'m afraid that's not possible," I said quickly. "I have costume designs to complete for tomorrow's shoot."


*Adam,why are you doing this? You know how important this job is to me.*

Adam turned to the director, his expression unreadable."
Director, does Miss Winston have time?"

"Of course she does!" the director exclaimed loudly, giving me a warning look that said *don't you dare refuse*. "Stella, please escort Mr. Lancaster to his suite. And you'll attend the dinner tonight too!"

I wanted to protest, but the director's expression left no room for refusal. Adam made a subtle gesture to Taylor, who nodded and stepped back, leaving me as Adam's only escort.

"Please lead the way, Miss Winston," Adam said, his voice carrying that dangerous tone I knew well.

With no choice, I moved behind his wheelchair and began pushing him toward the hotel, acutely aware of dozens of eyes following our departure. Adam's POV

I watched Stella fumble with the keycard to the presidential suite, her fingers trembling just enough to betray her nerves.

The door clicked shut behind us, and I didn't waste a second-my hand shot out, clamping around her wrist, yanking her onto my lap with a force that brooked no argument.

She landed in a sprawl, legs straddling my wheelchair,her sharp gasp filling the air as her wide eyes locked onto mine.Before she could protest. I crushed my lips against hers, one hand sliding to the back of her neck, pinning her in place,while the other gripped her waist, fingers digging into the soft curve there.


Her body jolted, but I deepened the kiss, my tongue claiming her mouth with a hunger I'd kept leashed too long. *This is what you get for pretending your husband's a stranger.*

For a heartbeat, she melted into it-her lips softening,her frame sinking against me, instinct overriding her defenses. My free hand roamed up her side, brushing the swell of her breast through her thin blouse, thumb grazing the hardened peak I could feel beneath. A low growl rumbled in my chest as I pressed harder, cupping her fully, possessive and unyielding. Then lower-my fingers trailed down, slipping between her thighs, brushing her heat through the fabric of her skirt, teasing the edge of her panties with a deliberate stroke. She tensed, a muffled sound escaping into my mouth, and I tightened my hold, relishing the way she squirmed.


But then she stiffened, hands shoving at my chest,breaking the kiss. "Adam,"she panted, cheeks flushed, voice shaky, "we can't-not here-”


"Why not?"Idemanded, my grip on her waist turning iron,pulling her tighter against me so she could feel every inch of my intent.

My hand stayed between her legs, fingers pressing against her warmth, daring her to push me away again. "Imn just greeting my wife. Or should I say, Miss Winston, who pretends she doesn't know me?”


She looked away, biting her lip, and I hated how it made me want to kiss her again. "You donated tens of thousands to the set a few days ago?"she asked, dodging the real question.

"Hundreds,"I corrected, voice clipped. *All because I couldn't stand seeing you shiver. Because your damn cough kept me up at night worrying.*
now, squeezing just enough to make her flínch, "are you suggesting I'd want a mistress?" Her eyes widened. "Why the sudden interest in this production?I heard it was a private donation.” I shrugged, casual as hell, even as my thumb traced a slow circle against her inner thigh, feeling the heat radiate through her clothes. "I had spare cash."*Because I wanted you comfortable. Because I can't stop thinking about you sick.*

"Miss Winston,"I said, emphasizing her maiden name with a dark edge, "you acted like I was a stranger before. Why so curious about my money now?"

She shifted on my lap, uneasy, her hips brushing against my hand in a way that sent a jolt through me. "I... I don't know how I'm supposed to act. How was I supposed to guess you'd show up wanting me to admit we're married-or keep pretending we're just... you know."

*She thinks that little of me? After everything we've been through?* My fingers flexed against her, sliding higher, pressing firmly against her core through the fabric, and she sucked in a breath. "Just what?"I growled, voice dropping to a dangerous low.

She met my gaze at last, her expression a mix of defiance and vulnerability. "I don't know if you want me to play the wife or... or some mistress you keep on the side." Does she really see our marriage as some convenient sham? A license for me to chase other women?* She didn't answer, but the flicker in her eyes-conflict, maybe jealousy-hit me like a punch. It pissed me off. but damn if it didn't feel good to see her care,even a little.


"Your silence speaks volumes. Mrs. Lancaster,"I said, voice cold as I kneaded her chest again, thumb flicking over her nipple through the cloth, watching her squirm. "Guess you're awfully generous with your husband."

She wrenched free, slipping off my lap and standing, her sudden absence leaving my hands empty and my chest aching.

She crossed the room, flipping on the lights and cranking the heat, the hum filling the silence between us. "If there's nothing else. I should get back to work,"she murmured,already heading for the door.

*Stay. Explain yourself. Talk to me. Don't walk away like this.*I watched her go, fury boiling under my skin. I'd expected her to justify pretending I didn't exist, to apologize, to give me something. I was ready to forgive her, to understand her career concerns.Instead, she left without a backward glance. I'd cut my Europe trip short, flown across the Atlantic, exposed myself to prying eyes-all to see her. And this was my reward?A cold exit? The door clicked shut behind her, softer than a slam but louder than thunder in my ears.
###Chapter 72

Stella's POV

The hotel restaurant had been transformed for the welcome dinner. When I arrived, most of the production executives and lead actors were already seated. I deliberately arrived late to minimize interaction with Adam.

My pan failed completely. The only empty seat was next to him.

*Of course. The universe seems determined to put me in awkward situations.*

The director waved enthusiastically. "Stella! We've been waiting for you! Come. sit next to our generous sponsor!"

As I took my seat. I could feel Adam beside me, though he didn't acknowledge my presence. His attention seemed focused on his conversation with the director across the table, but his tense shoulders told me he was very aware of me.

*He's still angry. I should have explained better earlier,but l panicked.*

The director raised his champagne glass. "Let's toast to Mr.Lancaster's generosity! Stella, why don't you make the toast!"

A waiter immediately filled my glass with champagne.I hesitated, setting the glass down without drinking. "I'm sorry.
Director, but I can't drink alcohol."

"Since when?" The director raised his eyebrows in surprise."Come on. just one sip! Director's orders!"

I felt trapped. Normally, one glass of champagne wouldn't be a problem, but I was taking medication for my cold that strictly prohibited alcohol.

I glanced uncertainly at Adam, but he deliberately avoided my gaze.

*He could resolve this awkward situation with just one word,but he's choosing not to. Is he still punishing me?*

Seeing the awkward situation unfolding, unexpectedly, the lead actress came to my rescue. "Mr. Lancaster," she said brightly,raising her glass, "allow me to toast to your health and generosity!"

The director frowned slightly at being interrupted but quickly recovered. "Ah, yes! Let me introduce our lead actress, Mr.Lancaster. She's one of the rising stars in our industry!" The leading lady, a beautifully coiffed woman,gave Adam an inviting smile. "It's truly an honor to meet you, Mr. Lancaster." *She's flirting with him right in front of me. And he's not stopping her.* Adam barely glanced at her, his expression remaining impassive. The actress's smile faltered slightly at his cold response.

"Well," she recovered quickly, "it seems Mr. Lancaster is only interested in a toast from Miss Winston. I'll drink anyway!"


She took an exaggerated sip of champagne, but I could see the embarrassment in her eyes.

As dinner progressed, severaI production members raised their glasses to Adam, and each time the director gave me pointed looks, clearly expecting me to join in. My untouched champagne became increasingly conspicuous.

*This is ridiculous. I'm a professional, not a prop for social rituals.*

Finally, after the director's fifth suggestive glance, I turned directly to Adam, the first time during dinner.

"Do you really want me to drink this?" I asked quietly,my voice almost lost in the dinner conversation.

Adam finally looked at me, his green eyes unreadable.

*You bastard*, I thought.*You know I'm on medication*.With a half-surrendering, half-defiant smile, I nodded."Alright,I'll drink." I raised the glass to my lips, bracing for the burn. Something flickered in Adam's eyes-was it concern?

Just as the liquid touched my lips, a hand shot out, snatching the glass from my fingers. I stared in shock as Adam downed the entire glass of strong liquor in one go, his expression unchanging despite the alcohol's potency.

The table fell silent.

"Oh my God!" someone gasped.

Adam deliberately set the empty glass down with precision."Enjoy your evening," he said coldly.

Without another word, he pushed away from the table and maneuvered his wheelchair towards the exit.

"Stella, are you alright?" someone asked with concern.

"I'm fine." I forced a smile and stood up. "Please, continue without me. I have something to attend to. Apologies." I hurried through the hotel corridors, each step in my high heels sending sharp pains through my feet. *Where could he have gone?* I checked the bar, the lobby, even asked the valet if his car was still there. Nothing.*The presidential suite. Of courrsec∗ By the time I reached the top floor, my feet were screaming in protest. and I was out of breath. I knocked firmly on the ornate double doors. No response.

I knocked again, harder this time. Still nothing.

*Damn stubborn man!* I knew he was inside-where else could he be? I leaned against the wall, feeling frustrated and exhausted.

My aching feet finally gave in, and I slid down to sit by the door.*Fine. I'll wait. He has to come out eventually*.

Nearly an hour after I first arrived at his door, I felt someone watching me. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up, and without turning. I knew Adam was there.

For a full minute, he said nothing, just stood silently behind me. The silence was suffocating.

"Hey," he finally said.

I jumped up, completely losing my balance and landing awkwardly on the floor. "God! How long have you been standing there?" He didn't answer, just looked down at me coldly, a hint of amusement in his eyes. "What are you doing here?" I scrambled to my feet, dignity long gone. "Looking for you." His laugh was cold. "Looking for me?"

He stepped closer, and I instinctively backed up until I felt the door behind me. Adam leaned in, invading my space, his fingers gripping my chin, forcing me to meet his gaze.

"Stella," his voice dropped to a dangerous whisper, "do you think you can toy with me? What am I to you-just a plaything you can pick up whenever you want?"

"No-"I tried to turn my head, but his grip was firm.

"No? Then what?" His anger only intensified. "Suggesting I find other women?"


"I never said that!" I felt completely wronged. "When did I ever suggest such a thing?I-"

I suddenly remembered what I had said earlier that day-something about rich men and their mistresses.

Was that what he misunderstood? But... I was just stating a fact.


Taylor's voice interrupted from the end of the hallway. "Mr.Lancaster, Mrs. Lancaster, perhaps... you could continue this conversation inside?"

He swiped a key card, and the door behind me clicked open. As soon as we crossed the threshold, Adam stood up from his wheelchair with lightning speed, pinning me against the door.The impact knocked the breath out of me.


*He's really angry*, I realized in shock. I had never seen him this furious. Usually, when Adam was upset, he would become cold and silent-like locking me in a freezer to reflect on my actions.


This was different. This was pure rage.

He radiated anger, his usual control replaced by something primal. His eyes were like a wolf's-cold but with a violence that made my heart race with genuine fear.

His mouth crashed down on mine, not out of passion but as punishment. His teeth bit into my lower lip, hard enough to make me gasp in pain. One hand tangled in my hair,ruining my carefully styled updo, while the other gripped my waist so tightly I knew it would leave bruises.

I pushed at his chest, but it was useless. "Adam, stop-"
###Chapter 73

Stella's POV

He pulled back slightly, breathing heavily. "Stop? You wait at my door and then tell me to stop?"

"You're hurting me," I whispered, hating how weak I sounded.

Something shifted in his eyes. His grip loosened slightly but he didn't step back.

"Why are you so angry?" I demanded, finding my voice. "I was just trying to meet the director's expectations-"

"The director?" Adam's laugh was harsh."You think this is about the director? About you almost drinking while on medication?"


"Then what is it about?" *Why does everything with him have to be a damn puzzle?*

"You know what it's about." His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "That look in your eyes-like you're telling me to find someone else."


I stared at him, genuinely confused. "What are you talking about?" "Don't play innocent." His fingers trailed from my neck to my collarbone, pressing hard enough to hurt, "This is ridiculous! I've never said anything about other women!"I was shouting now, frustration overwhelming fear. "I can't control who you see or don't see! I've never had that power!"

I took a deep breath, finally finding the courage to look him in the eye.

"Tonight, the director specifically told me to dress nicely to entertain you. You saw how he acted-he practically wanted to gift-wrap me and send me to your room." My voice steadied."Adam,we both know you'll meet plenty of women like that."

"So what?" His face remained tense.

"So, I don't want to act possessive when I know I have no right to control what you do. Knowing one's place is important.11


Adam's expression darkened further. "Then, Mrs. Lancaster,what exactly is your place?"

I swallowed hard. "Your wife in name."

"Stella, you are my wife," he growled, his lips brushing my ear,sending an involuntary shiver down my spine. "Not just in name. My. Wife." ′′You never ask for anything! You never tell me what you want!" Tears of frustration welled up in my eyes. "I'm not allowed to make demands of you. I've been trying to give you freedom from the start, and now you're angry about it?"

"Stella," his tone softened slightly, "as my wife, what do you think you can ask of me?"

The question caught me off guard. "I... don't know."

*What is he trying to get at?*

"Try," he insisted. "What would you ask of your husband?"

I took a deep breath, considering my options. I decided to start with the basics.

"If I asked my husband to respect our marriage and not cheat,what then?"

Adam looked almost amused, as if my request was laughably simple. "Ask for something meaningful."

"For now, that's my request," I admitted, unsure of what else to say.

"Fine," he said simply."Deal."

I blinked in shock. "Just like that?"

"Just like that." *Can it really be that easy?* I wondered,skeptical of his quick agreement. Then it's settled," I said, still not quite believing it. "You can't go back on your word."

I hesitated, then added, "If you ever meet someone else you like,tell me directly. Don't deceive me."


As soon as the words left my mouth. I realized what I had just said. When did I start assuming Adam had feelings for me?

Adam's expression darkened again at my words. Before I could figure out what I had said wrong, he leaned in closer,his breath hot against my ear.

"Stella," he murmured, his teeth grazing my earlobe, his voice dangerously low, "you really should..."

*Should what?*

I never found out. Adam's lips crashed down on mine, a fierce,consuming kiss that left me breathless. His tongue invaded my mouth with a searing intensity, my heart pounding like a drum.He yanked down the zipper of my dress, the fabric slipping away, the cool air prickling my skin.

He pushed me onto the hotel's plush bed, the mattress so soft I sank into it, his body covering mine, his hands roughly kneading my breasts, fingers pinching my nipples. A sharp pain mixed with pleasure surged through me, making me gasp.my chest burning under his touch, my body arching involuntarily. *How does he always make me feel this way?* "Don't move," he growled, his voice rough like sandpaper.his hand sliding to my waist, tearing off my panties. The sound of ripping fabric made my heart skip a beat, his fingers parting my folds. his thumb pressing hard against my swollen clit.

A wave of heat exploded inside me, and I bit my lip to stifle a moan, my legs trembling, feeling like he had set me on fire. *Too fast, I can't keep up...* He grunted, withdrawing his slick fingers, unbuckling his pants, revealing his hard, throbbing cock,the tip glistening with pre-cum, making my cheeks flush.

He grabbed my thighs, spreading them wide, and before I could catch my breath, he thrust into me, filling me to the brim with a single, brutal stroke. I screamed, clutching the sheets,my nails digging into the fabric, my mind blank from the overwhelming sensation of being so completely filled.

He held my hips, pounding into me with relentless force, each thrust sending waves of pleasure and pain through my body,the wet sounds of our coupling mixing with my cries. *He's lost his mind... but why can't I stop?*

"Look at you, wanting me so badly," he bit my neck, his teeth sinking into my skin, his voice full of smug satisfaction,slapping my ass, the sting making me gasp.′′You are mine,Stella, remember that."His pace quickened, his cock driving deeper inside me, my abdomen tightening, the pressure building until I felt like l would burst, the climax crashing over me like a tidal wave, my body convulsing, legs shaking as I clamped around him.

He didn't stop, growling as he thrust harder, a final.powerful thrust sending a hot rush of his seed deep inside me,leaving me breathless and spent, my heart still pounding in my ears.
###Chapter 74

Stella's POV

I woke up with my entire body aching, sunlight streaming through a gap in the curtains. Blinking slowly, I gradually returned to reality, still reeling from Adam's "punishment"from last night.

Trying to stretch, I realized I was trapped in a warm embrace,with Adam's steady breath tickling the nape of my neck.

Suddenly, a thought hit me.

"Oh my God! I'm late!" I panicked, struggling to get up. "The style meeting-"

"You have the morning off," Adam's languid voice came from above me, hisarm showing no sign of letting go.

"Off?" I stopped struggling and glanced at the digital clock on the nightstand. 10:30. I would indeed be late if I had work today.

Adam slowly loosened his grip and sat up, his hair unusually disheveled, though his green eyes remained as sharp as ever. "I've always had mild insomnia. Usually I only need about three or four hours of sleep," he explained, noticing my confused expression."1didn't get up early today because I was holding you."

My cheeks flushed as I quickly grabbed my phone to check my messages. Sure enough, there was a notification from the director: morning meeting with the leads to discuss image design.styling and wardrobe departments have the morning off.

"It really is a day off," I murmured, then suddenly looked up at Adam. "Wait, did you arrange this?"

Adam nodded without hesitation. "Ihad Taylor notify the production team."


*So you planned to exhaust me until five in the morning from the start?* I thought to myself, though I had to admit that half of this free morning had already been wasted. It was 10:30now, with only a few hours left before the afternoon shift.

I reflected on our conflict and reconciliation last night. Despite how exhausting Adam's "punishment" had been, the feeling of being completely possessed by him somehow brought us closer.

Adam had already gotten up and was efficiently changing into his custom-tailored suit. Within minutes, he had transformed back into the cold "Mr. Lancaster" persona. Only his slightly messy hair and the faint shadows under his eyes proved he was human after all.

That's when I realized an awkward problem. "Adam, L... I don't have anything to wear." I looked at the torn dress on the floor and bit my lip in frustration.

Adam's gaze lingered on me, clearly enjoying my embarrassment as I clutched the sheets around me. He turned and walked to the living room. Moments later, he returned with an elegant shopping bag, fromn which he pulled out a red cashmere dress and what appeared to be expensive lingerie.

"You... you didn't have Taylor buy these, did you?" I asked in horror, imagining the awkwardness of Adam's assistant shopping for my underwear.

Adam raised an eyebrow, his tone carrying a hint of displeasure. "Stella, what are you thinking? Would I let another man buy underwear for my wife?"

"Then who...?"

"My personal assistant. Female." Adam placed the clothes beside me on the bed. "Now, get up. I'll help you dress."

"I-I can do it myself," I instinctively clutched the sheets tighter.

"It's nothing I haven't seen before. Why so shy?" Adam's tone was teasing, but his eyes were dead serious. Eventually, I gave in to Adam's insistence and accepted his "help." When his fingers grazed my skin, the intimacy made my heart race. This kindof care felt too intimate, reminding me of behavior only lovers or spouses would share. *But aren't we spouses?* The thought made my heart skip a beat.


After getting dressed. I suddenly remembered last night and couldn't help feeling indignant. "You hurt me last night."

"Hmm?" Adam turned to look at me, his expression impassive.

"You hurt me last night! And you haven't even apologized!"I emphasized. though I knew the passion had been mutual.

A flash of remorse crossed Adam's eyes before quickly disappearing. He clearly didn't want to apologize, believing I had brought it on myself.

"You have a college degree and got your master's early. I always thought you were smarter," he adjusted his tie, his tone cool. "Make choices, face consequences."


\---

Around noon, Adam, dissatisfied with the hotel's food, ordered takeout from a restaurant. As I was clearing the coffee table to prepare for lunch, I noticed another delivery bag.

"Sparkling water!" I exclaimed in surprise, pulling out the green glass bottle. "Did you get this for me?"Adam didn't look up, focusing on his laptop.′′Itcame with the restaurant order." I raised an eyebrow, knowing full well that this Italian sparkling water had nothing to do with the high-end restaurant's supply chain. And coincidentally, it happened to be my favorite drink, which I had casually mentioned during a dinner with Adam once.


"Are you apologizing with sparkling water?" I asked with a smirk, unable to hide my smug expression.

"Don't overthink it." Adam continued staring at his laptop screen, his tone flat.


"If it's an apology, sparkling water isn't enough," I deliberately provoked him. "You should also buy me fried chicken and fries.11


"I said it's not!" Adam finally looked up, frowning at me.

I opened the sparkling water and took a sip, the bubbles dancing on my tongue making me inexplicably happy. I realized that with Adam Lancaster, his actions always spoke louder than his words. At 1:30 PM, the 'Splendor' crew returned to work. As soon as I arrived at the makeup room, I heard cheers. "What's going on?" I asked curiously. Lisa excitedly pointed to the break area. "Someone sent fried chicken. one box for each person! Morning off, fried chicken when we start work in the afternoon-it's perfect! I wonder which crew member's family is so thoughtful!"

I froze, staring at the golden fried chicken in paper boxes,a smile involuntarily spreading across my face. I remembered what I had said this morning-"Ifit's an apology, sparkling water isn't enough, you should also buy me fried chicken and fries."

*Adam,you stubborn, soft-hearted man,* I thought silently.

Today I was responsible for styling the supporting male actor as a vagrant-a down-on-his-luck artist who needed to appear disheveled yet retain an artistic quality. I focused on my work but felt many people watching me with curious glances.

*Adam Lancaster's appearance on set probably had a bigger impact than I imagined,* I thought. From the moment Adam publicly acknowledged me as his wife, my status had completely transformed.

"Ms. Winston, what's your relationship with Mr. Lancaster?"the supporting actor suddenly asked during a makeup break.

My hand paused momentarily, but I didn't answer, just continued focusing on my work.

The actor seemed to interpret my silence as some kind of hint, his gaze turning suggestive. "Ms. Winston. I've admired you since I first saw you. Would you consider going out with me?My mother is on the Fashion Week committee, I could give you the best industry resources."

I put down my makeup brush and looked directly into his eyes."Sir. I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that, and I hope this is the last time you say something like that."

My voice wasn't loud, but my tone was resolute, my gaze uncompromising. After quickly finishing the remaining styling work, I promptly left.

Shortly after, I saw Lucy walk up to the supporting actor,deliberately examining his styling with an exaggerated expression.

"Hey, isn't this styling a bit... too detrimental to your appearance?" Lucy feigned surprise. "You have so many fans who love your looks. I wonder if Stella deliberately made you look like this?"

Lucy's voice wasn't quiet, and the crew members around could hear her clearly. The actor's expression immediately darkened. Stella's POV

"Didn't the director mention yesterday that your posture wasn't elegant enough?" Lucy continued adding fuel to the fire. "It was Stella who told the director you were hunched over with no energy, looking nothing like a proper drama actor."

The actor's eyes grew increasingly menacing.Having just been rejected by me, then hearing he'd been criticized behind his back, plus thefact that his styling was indeed a far cry from his usual polished image, I knew he might begin to develop resentment toward me.


\---

In the early evening, Lisa and I went to a nearby specialty store to purchase styling supplies. On our way back, we found a group of girls surrounding the production area, appearing to be fans waiting for certain actors.

"Wasn't the filming location supposed to be kept secret? How did fans find out?" Lisa asked in confusion.

Before I could answer, a shrill voice pierced the air, "You bitch who deliberately gave my idol an ugly styling!"

Almost simultaneously, an egg flew toward me. I reacted quickly, raising my bag to block it while shielding Lisa with my body.

"You whore!" The crazed fan continued hurling insults,her eyes blazing with fury. "You gave him a styling too ugly to be seen in public, and you badmouthed him to the director!Women like you who want to ruin his career deserve to die!"

I saw her pull a small knife from her pocket, my pupils contracting instantly.

"Stella, watch out!" Lisa screamed.

Drawing on years of self-defense training, I dodged with lightning speed while kicking at the fan's wrist. The knife went flying, and I quickly followed up with a clean shoulder throw,pinning the deranged fan to the ground.

′′Callsecurity! Call the police!" I calmly directed the stunned crowd around us.




That evening, the atmosphere in the production meeting room was tense."I'm very sorry, Ms. Winston," the actor apologized superficially,his eyes showing no sincerity.11Ihad no idea my fans would do something like this. They're just overly concerned about me.I apologize on their behalf!" I shook my head and took out my phone. pulling up a screenshot from Instagram. "Your character is a down-and-out vagrant. Did you still want to maintain your idol image? Tell me how I deliberately made you look bad?"


The screenshot clearly showed the actor's social media complaint: "Met a pretentious stylist today who deliberately ruined my image! Don't worry fans. I'll make her pay." The accompanying images showed his selfie in costume and my back as I worked.


The actor's face turned pale. "This... wasn't this deleted?"

"The internet never forgets," I replied coldly.

The director and producer exchanged uncomfortable glances.On one hand, the actor had powerful family connections; on the other hand, I was Adam Lancaster's wife-an identity that made anyone think twice.


"This doesn't need to be blown out of proportion," Lucy suddenly interjected. "Stella, you weren't hurt. Fan behavior shouldn't be tied to the celebrity. Don't be too harsh."

"Ms. Lucy," Lisa couldn't help but interject, "you weren't the one nearly attacked, so don't talk like it's no big deal!" "Assistant." Lucy glanced at Lisa dismissively, "you have no place to speak here." I looked around at everyone and decided not to pursue the matter further. 'This pointless argument would only waste time.and I didn't want to delay the entire production schedule because of one crazed fan.

"Fine, I'll let it go this time," I finally said.

The actor sighed in relief but immediately made another demand: "Then post a statement on social media saying this was all a misunderstanding. Your bag got dirty-I'll buy you a new one!"


My gaze cooled. "Sir, not pursuing this doesn't mean I'll cooperate with you. I don't think this was a misunderstanding.As for the bag? I don't need it."

The actor was infuriated and stood up, pointing at me. "Stop acting high and mighty! I'll give you a luxury car! Don't be so ungrateful!"

The meeting room erupted in commotion. I slowly pulled back my sleeve, revealing the watch on my wrist.

"Do you know how much this watch costs?" I asked calmly.

The actor was taken aback. "What do you mean?" "This is a limited edition watch, retail price $900,000." I gently rotated my wrist, allowing everyone to see the understated yet Juxuríous timepiece. "Calculate how many luxury cars that could buy."

The actor's expression shifted from anger to shock, then from shock to embarrassment. He opened and closed his mouth.unable to find an appropriate response.

"I'm sorry, I'm not trying to show off." I stood up. my tone returning to calm. "I just want to make it clear that I don't need your compensation. nor do I need your so-called resources.' I only hope to work in an environment of mutual respect. If that's not possible, then I believe we have nothing more to discuss."


With that. I picked up my bag and gracefully left the meeting room, leaving behind a room full ofstunned faces.

As I reached the door. I heard a loud scoff from behind me.

"Stella, what are you so proud of?" The male lead's arrogant voice made me pause. "Why don't you get your richhusband to deal with me if you're so offended?"

His words hung in the air, causing the entire room to fall silent.I didn't turn around, refused to give him the satisfaction of seeing my reaction. Instead, I straightened my shoulders and walked out with my head held high, though my heart pounded with anger. Back in my hotel mom. I had just kicked off my heels when 1frese, noticing a laptop on the coffee table that wasn't mine.The scent of expensive cologne hung in the nir.

"Adam?"

He emerged from the bedroom. dressed in a casual black sucater and dark kans a far crv from his usual formal attire.Despite mv exhaustion, my heart skipped a beat.


Adam, what are vou doing in my room? I thought vou'd gone back to New York?" I asked. feeling a surge of gratitude that T d upgraded from the standard room to a luxury suite.

"Staying temporarily." he replied in his usual cconomical way.his green eyes surveying me. He looked completely at home.as if it were his room I was intruding upon, not the other way around.

"I need to remain for two more days." he elaborated when I continued staring at him. "Your room is quieter."

I understood his reasoning but wasn't quite ready to accept it.But there are so many high-end hotels in Manhattan Vou could stay at!" His response was silence - that particular silence that made it clear the discussion was over. I sighed internally, knowing 1couldn't really refuse him. He was my legal husband. after all. "Have you eaten dinner?" I asked, deciding to accept the situation.

He glanced at the room service menu on the desk with disdain."The hotel's food is mediocre."

"I know a place nearby," I offered. "We could go out?"
###Chapter 76

Stella's POV

Two miles from the filming location, we strolled through New York's fashion district. Adam wore a black cashmere coat and a mask that covered half his face, yet still managed to draw attention. His height and the confident way he carried himself made him impossible to ignore.

Damn, my handsome man.

"Someone's taking pictures of you," I whispered, nodding subtly toward a woman across the street with her phone raised."This area is popular with content creators doing livestreams."

Before Adam could respond, a young woman with a professional camera approached us, her assistant holding a ring light.

"Excuse me! I'm a relationship content creator. Would you mind answering a couple of questions for my channel? You two make such a gorgeous couple!"

I hesitated, uncomfortable with the attention.′′UJm,we're not-""She's my wife," Adam interrupted, his voice leaving no room for argument.

I stared at him, momentarily stunned by his direct response. We'd never discussed how to handle such situations in public.

The blogger's eyes widened with delight. "Married? You seem so young!"

′′I′'m above the legal marriage age," I replied, fighting the urge to fidget under her scrutiny.

"That's wonderful! Here's my question for today's segment:How do you resolve conflicts in your relationship?"

Before I could formulate a safe, generic answer, Adam spoke.

"Sex."

I nearly choked, my face instantly burning. "Adam!"

The creator seemed equally shocked but quickly recovered with professional enthusiasm. "Well! That's certainly... direct! Thank you for your honesty!"

She scurried away, clearly having gotten more than she'd bargained for, while I stood frozen in mortification.


\---

"Are you out of your mind?" I hissed once we were alone again. Adam looked genuinely puzzled by my reaction. "What did 1say wrong?" "Everything!" I ran a hand through my hair in frustration."What if someone recognizes us?"

He studied me for a moment, his expression unreadable. "You don't want people to know about our marriage?"

I lowered my gaze, uncomfortable with his direct question."Keeping our marriage private... might be more convenient." *And if we eventually separate, it would be less complicated*,I added silently.

Adam's expression cooled several degrees. "The video won't be released."

The certainty in his voice should have been reassuring, but something in his tone made me shiver.


\---

We continued walking, looking for a place to eat. I suggested a well-known restaurant nearby, but Adam dismissed it with a curt,"Too noisy."

As we turned a corner, I spotted a familiar figure stumbling out of a bar ahead. My heart sank as the male lead from our production noticed us and deliberately blocked our path."Well, well," he slurred, alcohol heavy on his breath. "If it isn't the high-and-mighty Stella. You slut, in Lancaster's bed last night and with another m an tonight?" I felt Adam stiffen beside me. The male lead. too drunk to recognize Adam with his mask, continued his tirade.


"How many men are you slecping with, huh? You think you're so special because you've got connections?" He leaned closer.the stench of alcohol making me recoil. "Everyone knows you're just a worthless-"


What happened next was so fast I barely registered it. Adam moved with dendly precision. his fist connecting with the actor s stomach. As the man doubled over. Adam followed with several more calculated strikes that left him crumpled on the sidewalk.


"Adam. stop!" I grabbed his arm. "This is a public place! Calm down!"


The actor's friends rushed over from the bar, looking ready for a fight. I quickly stepped between them and Adam.

"Think about it," I warned the actor, who was still struggling to stand. "You're a public figure. How will it look if this gets out? It's better for everyone if we all just walk away now." The actor glared at us through watering eyes, clutching his ribs."Fine. But you haven't heard the last of this. You better watch out!" I pulled Adum away from the scene, not stopping until we were safely around th e corner. My heart was still racing from the confrontation.

"That idiot." I muttered, more to myself than to Adam.I glanced at him, surprised by his display of physical aggression."Don't be angry. He didn't recognize you."

Adam remained silent, his jaw clenched. He was still furious,but I couldn't understand why.




Adam's POV

I watched as Stella disappeared into the bathroom,the sound of running water soon following. Her quick exit indicated she needed space, probably to process the evening's events.

*What she didn't know was that I hadn't lashed out because that bastard insulted me. I attacked because he insulted her.*

My knuckles still ached slightly from the confrontation.That drunken fool had no idea how close he'd come to a far worse fate.

When had I started thinking of Stella as truly mine,beyond the legal arrangement? I couldn't pinpoint the moment, but the possessiveness I felt was undeniable. My phone vibrated. Taylor. "Sir, we've addressed the situation with the content creator," he reported. "She's agreed not to publish the video in exchange for an exclusive interview with one of our celebrities."


"What about the drunk?" I asked, lighting a cigarette. The nicotine helped clear my thoughts.

"His background check is complete," Taylor continued efficiently. "He's the youngest son of a Wall Street CEO. Spoiled,entitled, with a history of complaints from female co-workers that were quietly settled."

So,another privileged brat who thought he could say whatever he wanted without consequences. The type who relied on family connections to clean up their messes.

"Then take care of it," I instructed, exhaling a cloud of smoke.He would learn that some lines shouldn't be crossed, regardleSS of who his father was.

"Take care of what?"

Stella's voice startled me. I turned to find her standing in the doorway, wrapped in a hotel robe, her hair still damp from the shower. The sight momentarily distracted me from my vengeful thoughts.

"Trash," I answered simply, meeting her questioning gaze.Her eyes widened slightly, understanding dawning in them.She didn't ask for clarification, which intrigued me, Most women would have demanded explanations, expressed horror at the implied threat. But Stella merely observed, a complex mix of emotions playing across her face.

This was one of the many things that fascinated me about her -her pragmatism, her ability to accept the darker aspects of life without unnecessary dramatics.

I extinguished my cigarette, moving toward her with deliberate steps. The slight catch in her breath was satisfying.
###Chapter 77

Stella's POV

The shrill sound of my alarm jolted me awake.Groggily,I reached for my phone to silence it, every muscle in my body protesting the movement. A dull ache radiated through me as memories of last night flooded back.

*God, did we really do it three times?*

I attempted to sit up, wincing as my body reminded me exactly how vigorous Adam had been. Glancing down at myself.I saw the evidence scattered across my skin-little marks of possession that Adam seemed to delight in leaving. My neck,my collarbone, even the inside of my thighs bore his signature.

Across the room, Adam sat on the sofa, already dressed in a crisp button-down shirt and tailored pants, laptop balanced on his knees as he scrolled through emails. He looked annoyingly fresh and alert, as if he hadn't spent half the night keeping me awake.

"Good morning," he said without looking up, his voice carrying that subtle smugness that made me want to throw something at him. So I did.I grabbed my pillow and hurled it at his head with all the "Who could that be at this hour?" I whispered, panic rising in my chest. The last thing I needed was someone from the production team seeing Adam in my room.

The knocking continued, more insistent now.

"You-you need to hide!" I hissed, grabbing his arm and trying to pull him up. He remained immovable, looking at me with mild amusement. "Come on, Adam! Go to the bathroom!"

"Stella," he said calmly, "we are legally married."

"That's not the point!" I tugged harder at his arm. "Please,just hide!"


When he still didn't move, I added desperately, "If you don't cooperate,you can forget about staying here!"

Adam's expression shifted, a cold smile playing at his lips. "Is that so?"


I knew I had no real leverage, but I was desperate. "Mr.Lancaster," I said, softening my voice, "for God's sake! Please! I don't want to walk into the production office and be surrounded by people asking for gossip." face.

Taking a deep breath to compose myself, I smoothed my hair and opened the door with what I hoped was a casual expression.

"Tay-" I stopped mid-word, relief washing over me. "Taylor.It's you."

Adam's assistant stood in the hallway, holding a large paper bag that smelled deliciously of fresh pastries. "Good morning,Mrs. Lancaster! I've brought breakfast for you and Mr.Lancaster. Also, I need to collect the documents he reviewed last night."

I stepped aside to let him in, suddenly feeling foolish for my panic. "Of course, come in."

Taylor glanced around the room, then back at me with a questioning look. "You seem... relieved? Were you expecting someone else?"


"No! I mean... no. I just..." I trailed off, not sure how to explain. "Is Mr. Lancaster available? I need those files before his nine o'clock call."I gestured awkwardly toward the bathroom. "He's.,. in there." Taylor nodded as if this was perfectly normal information."I see. The documents should be on the desk-he mentioned they were ready."

I hurried to gather the stack of papers Adam had been reviewing last night and handed them to Taylor, who accepted them with a polite nod. As he arranged the breakfast on the small dining table, I marveled at the spread-flaky croissants,a fresh fruit and yogurt parfait, eggs Benedict, smoked salmon with avocado toast, and a carafe of what smelled like premium coffee.


After Taylor left, I approached the bathroom door and leaned against it. "You can come out now, *sir*. Or do you plan to stay in there all day?"

"Isn't that what Mrs. Lancaster wanted?" Adam's voice came through the door, cool and slightly mocking. "For me to remain hidden?"


I rolled my eyes, even though he couldn't see me. "I didn't know it was Taylor, okay? Breakfast is getting cold."

When he still didn't emerge, I sighed and reached for the doorknob. "Fine, be childish."Opening the door, I found Adam leaning against the marble counter, arms crossed, looking irritatingly handsome despite his obvious displeasure. I reached out and grabbed his hand, tugging him toward the dining area.

"Come on," I said, softening my tone. "The food looks amazing.and I'm starving."

His eyes flickered to our joined hands, and I realized with a start that I had reached for him instinctively. My first impulse had been to touch him, to connect physically. When had that happened? When had touching Adam become so natural?

The tension in his shoulders eased slightly as he allowed me to lead him to the table. "You need to eat," he said, his expression warming. "You barely touched your dinner last night."


\---

I was halfway through a buttery croissant when another knock sounded at the door. Adam and I exchanged glances.

"Expecting someone?" he asked, his voice neutraI but his eyes watchful.

"No," I set down my pastry and approached the door cautiously. Opening it just enough to see who was outside, I found Lisa bouncing on her heels, her usual energetic self. Before I could stop her, she pushed the door wider and practically skipped into the room. "Stella! I was thinking we could go over the-" She stopped abruptly, her eyes widening as she spotted Adam at the dining table,casually sipping his coffee. "Oh! I... he... you... the... I..."
###Chapter 78

Stella's POV

"Lisa," I began, desperately trying to think of an explanation,"it's not what you're thinking. Let me explain. Adam andI-"

"No need to explain!" she interrupted, her eyes darting between us, a knowing grin spreading across her face. "I totally get it!Gorgeous man, beautiful woman-it makes perfect sense! Your secret is safe with me!" She mimed zipping her lips. "Not a word to anyone, I promise!"

I sighed, recognizing the futility of correcting her assumptions."
Thanks, Lisa. Did you need something?"

Her expression sobered slightly. "Actually, I came to say goodbye."

"Goodbye?" I echoed, confused.

Lisa nodded, suddenly less animated. "My family found out about that crazy fan incident yesterday. They don't think it's safe for me to keep working here. My parents are waiting downstairs-I'm leaving right away.""That's so sudden," I said, genuinely disappointed. Despite her sometimes overwhelming energy, I'd grown fond of Lisa. "Let me walk you down at least." She waved me off, her eyes darting to Adam again. "No need!You should stay with Mr. Lancaster. We'll catch up another time!"


After Lisa left, I closed the door and leaned against it, frowning slightly.

"That's strange," I murmured, more to myself than to Adam. "The production is already short-staffed. Would the director really let her go so easily?"

Adam set down his coffee cup. "She's Robert Davis's fiancée.The production wouldn't dare refuse."

"Robert Davis?" I looked up in surprise. "From the Boston Davis family?"

Adam nodded once, returning to his breakfast. I joined him at the table, my mind racing. The Davis family was old money-not quite as powerful as the Lancasters, but close. Their influence stretched across East Coast shipping, banking,and real estate.


"How did you know that?" I asked, watching Adam carefully. "I worked with her for weeks and had no idea.""I make it my business to know these things," he replied simply,as if that explained everything.

 I studied his face, wondering what else he knew that I didn't. With Adam, there were always layers of information, carefully controlled and selectively shared.




By mid-morning, I had arrived at the production set, my mind still processing the breakfast interaction with Adam. I'd barely stepped through the doors when an new assistant rushed toward me, practically dragging me toward the makeup area.

"Thank goodness you're here!" she exclaimed. "The new male lead for the supporting role needs a styling evaluation for his costume fitting. We need photos for the press release by noon!"

I blinked in confusion. "New male lead? What happenedto-"

"Oh, you haven't heard?" The new assistant lowered her voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "He's been replaced! Effective immediately!"

"But why?" I asked, following her through the bustling corridor. "Yesterday he was fine-demanding and unpleasant,but fine." She glanced around before leaning closer. "Apparently, some serious dirt got leaked to the media this morning. It's bad-really bad. He was cheating on his girlfriend with multiple women, plagiarizing other people's work, had a secret social media account with all these misogynistic comments,and-"she paused for dramatie effect, "-his father's company is being investigated for tax fraud!"

I felt a chill run down my spine, remembering Adam's phone call last night. *"Take care of the trash,"* he had said. Could it be coincidence that less than twelve hours later, the man who had insulted me was facing total career destruction?

Pulling out my phone, I quickly typed a message to Adam:

\[Did you have something to do with what happened to the male lead?\]

I stared at the screen, waiting for a response that didn't come.

Throughout the morning, I noticed a distinct change in how the production staff interacted with me. Gone were the casual attitudes and occasional dismissiveness. In their place was a careful politeness, bordering on deference. People who had barely acknowledged me yesterday were now going out of their way to be helpful.

*Word travels fast in this industry,* I thought. *Everyone knows I'm Adam Lancaster's wife now.* In the early afternoon, I headed to the costume storage room to select accessories for the new supporting male lead. His measurements and coloring were different from his predecessor,requiring adjustments to several costume pieces. The storage room was located in the basement level of the building-a large space filled with racks of clothing,shelves of accessories, and carefully organized props. The lighting wasn't ideal, but I knew exactly what I was looking for.

I was reaching for a vintage pocket watch when suddenly the lights went out, plunging the room into complete darkness.I froze, my hand still outstretched, heart pounding in my chest.

"Hello?" I called out, my voice sounding unnaturally loud in the silent darkness. "Is anyone there?"


No response.

I fumbled for my phone, about to turn on the flashlight, when I heard the door open. Light from the hallway briefly illuminated the room before being blocked by a tall figure entering.

"Who's there?" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.

As I turned toward the door, strong hands gripped my shoulders, pushing me back against the wall. My breath caught in my throat, a scream building-
The hairpin clattered to the floor as I instinctively grabbed his shoulders-first to push him away, then, embarrassingly quickly, to pull him closer. The kiss deepened,and I momentarily forgot we were standing in my workplace with only a flimsy door separating us from the entire production crew. When he finally released me, I was struggling to catch my
###Chapter 79

Stella's POV

I froze as a familiar scent wafted toward me. I would recognize that cologne anywhere.


"Adam?" I could barely make out his tall silhouette in the darkness,but I was certain it was him. My heart was still racing from the adrenaline.

He let out a low chuckle that sent an involuntary shiver down my spine.

"You scared me to death!" I smacked his shoulder, genuinely annoyed. "How did you even get in here? Aren't you worried someone might see you?"

Instead of answering, he wrapped his arms around my waist and pulled me against him. Before I could protest, his lips were on mine, effectively silencing any further questions I had. breath, my mind foggy with a mix of desire and confusion.

"That guy who got beaten up-was that your doing?" I managed to ask once my brain started functioning again.

"Who?" Adam leaned down to press another quick kiss on my lower lip.

Typical. He couldn't even be bothered to remember the man's name. "The supporting actor in our production. The one who got his ass handed to him last night."

"Yes," he admitted without a hint of remorse. "Any objections?"

"None whatsoever." I couldn't help the satisfaction I felt knowing Adam had dealt with someone who'd been so awful to me. It was wrong, probably, to feel this way-but I did.

The pitch-black makeup room suddenly felt incredibly intimate,like we were cocooned away from the rest of the world. His hands stayed firm on may waist, his presence filling the small space entirely.

"I'm heading to Toronto soon," he said abruptly. My stomach dropped slightly. "So urgently? Is there a problem at GT Group?" I frowned, thinking about logistics. "I don't think there are direct flights from here." "Private jet," he replied simply. "Oh." Of course. I hesitated before asking, "Will you make it back for Mrs. Morgan's birthday on Saturday?"

Saturday was Luke and James's mother's fiftieth birthday. We'd received the invitations weeks ago, and I was actually looking forward to it.

Adam nodded. "I'll be back."

"Good." I tried to push away the disappointment I felt.Why was I disappointed anyway? It was just a business trip. "Will you bring me a gift? As Mrs. Lancaster, am I entitled to request a souvenir from Mr. Lancaster's business trip?"

I saw the corner of his mouth quirk up slightly. "What would you like? A handbag? Diamonds?"

"There's a private shop in Toronto that makes custom Indian masks. Maybe you could make one for me?" I noticed his almost imperceptible frown and quickly backtracked. "If you're too busy, just bring me a box of maple tea from Toronto. That would be fine too."He seemed satisfied with my more reasonable request, his thumb gently stroking my wrist. The tenderness of the gesture was so unlike his usual cool demeanor that it made my heart skip. Protected by the darkness, I suddenly felt brave-or stupid,possibly both. 
"Adam," I tilted my head, looking up at what I could see of his face, "have you... fallen in love with me?"

*Oh my god, did I actually just say that out loud?*

*Knock! Knock! Knock!*

The sudden pounding at the door shattered whatever madness had possessed me to ask such a direct question.

"What did you just say?" Adam leaned closer, clearly having missed my words thanks to the interruption.

"Nothing," I said quickly, simultaneously mortified and relieved.*Thank god for whoever's at the door.*

"Sir, it's time to go," Taylor's voice came from the hallway.

Adam cupped my face one last time, placing a gentle kiss on my lips. "I have to leave."

And then he was gone, slipping out of the room as silently as he'd arrived. The moment the door closed behind him, the lights flickered back on, flooding the room with harsh fluorescent brightness that seemed to mock my momentary courage. *What was I thinking?* I touched my lips, still feeling the pressure of his kiss, *Thank goodness he didn't hear me clearly . That would have been beyond embarrassing,* Miss Winston, are you alright?" A crew member called through the door. "We just had a power outage on this floor,but the wiring's fixed now."

"I'm fine," I called back, quickly smoothing down my clothes and hair.


As the footsteps faded away, something clicked in my brain.The timing of the power outage was way too convenient. Had Adam actually cut the power to avoid security cameras? The thought of him going to such lengths just to see me privately made something warm flutter in my chest.




"Surprise!" Sam's voice cut through the busy set on Friday afternoon. I looked up from the costume rack to see her waving enthusiastically.

"Sam!" I couldn't help smiling at the sight of my best friend."What are you doing here?"

"Can't a girl visit her bestie on set?" She linked her arm with mine,pulling me away from the busy filming area. Once we found a quiet corner, her expression turned more serious."Plus,I have news about that silver lock you asked me to look into." My smile faltered. "What did you find out?" "The lock was custom-made for a baby girl over twenty years ago." Sam explained. lowering her voice. "It symbolizes safety,happiness. and longevity. Unfortunately, the family emigrated shortly afterward, and the trail goes cold there."

"They emigrated..." I sighed. feeling the familiar weight of disappointment. "So that's the end of that lead."

Sam squeezed my arm supportively. "At least you know your birth parents cared for you. They had this specially made with love and good intentions."

"I've been searching for years with no results. Even with this clue. the trail has gone cold." I forced a small smile.′′Ithink fate has decided I'm not meant to know my blood relations.Let's just... stop looking."

Sam was about to respond when a familiar voice interrupted us


###Chapter 80

Stella's POV

"Well, look who's here!" Lucy approached, dressed like she was heading to a photoshoot rather than a film set. "Samantha.visiting your dear friend? How touching."

Sam's expression instantly cooled. "Lucy. Still hanging around sets pretending to be important, I see."

"Actually, I have a legitimate role in this production," Lucy replied with her sickly-sweet smile. "Unlike some people who can only visit because they have nothing better to do."

Before Sam could deliver what would undoubtedly be a scathing comeback, I intervened. "Sam, don't waste your energy.
Lucy, I think the director is looking for you-something about reshooting your scene."

Lucy narrowed her eyes suspiciously but took the hint and walked away, flipping her hair dramatically as she left.

"She's insufferable," Sam muttered. "Forget about her," I checked my watch. "I need to get changed. The lead actress's dance double called in sick,and I volunteered to fill in."Sam's eyes widened. "You're going to dance? On camera?" I shrugged. "It's just a simple dance. The scene's more about the costume than the dancer's face."


"Then I'm definitely staying to watch this!" Sam declared with a grin that sent a flicker of nerves through me.




Two hours later, I stepped out of the dressing room in a flowing red ball gown. The satin bodice hugged my torso,cool and smooth against my skin, while the layered skirt flared out,heavy with delicate lace trim that rustled with every step. My hair was swept into an elegant chignon, adorned wwith a single pearl comb that glinted under the lights.

The director glanced up from his monitor and nodded approvingly. "Perfect! Let's see if we can nail this in one take."

As the orchestral music swelled-violins weaving into a lilting three-beat rhythm-I took my place center stage. The set hushed, and I felt every gaze settle on me. A jolt of anxiety hit hard;it'd been ages since I'd danced like this in front of anyone. But when the first notes rolled through, my body remembered what my mind had half-forgotten. I extended one arm gracefully, imagining an invisible partner as the waltz began. The music carried me forward, my feet gliding across the floorin smooth,sweeping steps. I turned, the red skirt billowing out like a flame, each spin blending strength and elegance in that effortless way a waltz demands. The fabric caught the air, tracing arcs that spoke of romance and longing without a single word.

When the final chord faded, silence hung thick for a heartbeat-then the set burst into enthusiastic applause erupted.

"Bravo! That was magnificent!"

"My God, that was beautiful!"

"Stella's dancing is incredible! Combined with her looks, she's absolutely stunning!"

The director approached, looking thoroughly pleased."That was perfect, Stella. Could we get one mnore take from a different angle?"

I nodded, taking a moment to catch my breath before resuming my starting position. From the corner of my eye, I caught Lucy watching from the sidelines, her expression a mixture of disbelief and dismay.

After several takes from different angles, I sat in the break area,drinking water to rehydrate. "Miss Winston, with your abilities, why didn't you go into entertainment?" The lead actress approached, curiosity evident in her voice. I paused mid-sip. "Different people have different ambitions.The entertainment industry isn't where my interests lie." I set my water bottledown. "Even though I stepped in as your dance double today, I have no intention of moving into the spotlight."

The relief on her face was almost comical. "You're truly talented and beautiful, Miss Winston. No wonder Mr.Lancaster holds you in such high regard." Her smile widened. "I should apologize for my forwardness at that dinner, offering Mr. Lancaster a drink. That was inappropriate of me."

"No harm done," I replied politely, though I remembered the incident perfectly well.

As she walked away, Sam slid into the seat beside me, her expression mischievous.

"That was incredible!" she exclaimed. "I recorded some of it-hope you don't mind."

"Did you send it to Adam?" I asked knowingly.

"Not directly," Sam admitted with a grin. "I sent it to Taylor.I figured he'd know what to do with it."

"You're impossible," I said, shaking my head. That evening. I had just stepped out of the shower when my phone chimed with a message notification. Wrapped in the hotel's plush robe, I checked the screen and froze.


It was a photo of me dancing, captured at a moment when my body was perfectly poised. the red silk sleeves creating an artistic frame around me. The image was beautiful, almost professional in quality-and it had been sent by Adam.

Without hesitation,I called him.

"How did you get a photo of me dancing?" I asked as soon as he answered. "Did the director send it to you?"

Adam didn't address my question directly. "Stella, you've never danced like this for me."


I sensed... accusation in his tone? "But I danced modern style for you before," I countered, recalling our night at the hotel months ago.

"That was under duress," he replied, clearly displeased.′′Ycou were dressed casually, your appearance was casual."

During the brief silence that followed, I processed his words.Was he.,. jealous? The idea seemed ridiculous, yet his tone definitely suggested it. I barely made it to Paris in time for the YEAR Awards ceremony. After wrapping up the Splendor production work,I flew straight here, only having enough time to check into my hotel and change before rushing to the venue.

The YEAR Awards were a big deal in the fashion industry-especially for visual styling. I'd submitted my portfolio three months ago and found out last week that I'd won the gold award. At twenty, I was now officially the youngest recipient in the competition's history.

Standing in the venue surrounded by fashion's elite, I felt an unexpected bubble of excitement. It wasn't like I hadn't won awards before-some even more prestigious than this one-but something about this victory felt different. Maybe because it was the first major recognition since marrying Adam.

*I should call him*, I thought, pulling out my phone. The idea of sharing my achievement with Adam brought a small smile to my face. Would he congratulate me in that cool way of his?Or maybe tease me with something like, "Does Mrs. Lancaster want a reward?" Either option made my heart beat a little faster.

Finding a quiet corner, I dialed his number. The phone rang several times, and I was about to hang up when someone finally answered.

"Hello, Adam, I-"I began, unable to hide my excitement. "Hello? I'm sorry. Adam's phone isn't with him right now. May I ask who's calling? I can pass along a message for you."A woman's voice-smooth. cultured. came through the speaker.

I felt like someone had dumped a bucket of ice water over my head. My excitement evaporated instantly.

"...Who is this? His assistant?" In all the time I'dknown Adam.he had never let anyone else answer his personal phone. He was practically obsessive about his privacy.
###Chapter 81

Stella's POV

"I'm sorry, I'm not at liberty to disclose my identity, but no,I'm not his assistant." The woman's tone was polite but reserved.speaking with a familiarity that made my stomach twist.

A ridiculous thought hit me: what if Adlam hadn't even saved my number in his contacts? What if my calls just appeared as unknown numbers on his screen? The thought that I might be just another nameless entry in his phone made my chest hurt.

"I'm sorry, I must have dialed the wrong number," I said quickly, hanging up before she could respond.

I stared at my phone, my mind racing. Who was this woman with Adam? Why was she answering his phone? My eyes stung.and I felt a sharp pain in my chest.




"And now, please welcome to the stage the youngest ever recipient of the YEAR Visual Gold Award-Miss Stella Winston! The announcement snapped me back to reality. I quickly composed myself,forcing a smile as I made my way to the stage. The bright lights momentarily blinded me as applause filled the hall. I delivered my prepared speech in what I hoped was fluent.elegant English, thanking my mentors and expressing gratitude to the committee. Just as I finished and was about to leave, the host placed a hand on my arm, stopping me.

"Miss Winston is the youngest winner of several prestigious awards in visual styling," the host announced. "Everyone is curious about your personal life, Miss Winston. On behalf of all our viewers and attendees, I'd like to ask: what type of gentleman catches your eye? I know many eligible young men would love to make your acquaintance."

I froze for a moment, microphone still in hand. My mind flashed to Adam-to the woman who had answered his phone-and I felt a surge of defiance.

"Thank you for your interest and everyone's concern," I replied smoothly, "but I should mention that I'm already married."

A ripple of surprised murmurs passed through the audience.




As I came down the stairs from the stage, award in hand,I overheard snippets of conversation from nearby attendees. "Stella's only twenty five and already married? That's unexpected." "Fashion gossip has been wild these past few days. Did you hear that Grace's exhibition in Toronto had a surprise visitor?Adam from GT Group was there."

"Really? Adam never attends public events unless they're business-related. Why would he go to Grace's exhibition? I didn't know they were close-that's shocking!"

"If you ask me, they make a handsome couple."

The mention of "Grace" and "Grace Davis" made my heart skip a beat. My focus completely shattered, I missed the last step on the stairs and stumbled, nearly falling before a strong hand caught my arm.

"Do you always walk without looking where you're going?"A familiar male voice, tinged with annoyance, came from beside me.

I looked up in surprise. "James? Thanks... What are you doing here?"


"Iconducted the background music for today's ceremony, so naturally, they invited me." James released my arm and shoved his hands into his pockets. "I know you can't stand me, but I didn't come here deliberately to share a roof with you." I blinked in confusion. "I don't dislike you. Aren't you the one who's always had a problem with me?" "When have I ever had a problem with you?!" James lookedgenuinely offended.

I counted off on my fingers: "Kindergarten, you pulled my hair.Elementary school, you took my erasers. Middle school,you
called me a bookworm because I got the highest grade. High school,you'd walk away whenever you saw me."

James looked uncomfortable, his eyes darting around. After a long pause, he finally managed to say,′′Ifyou don't have a problem with me, then... then why aren't you wearing the hairpins I gave you? Don't you like them? If you don't, just throw them away!"

"I left those hairpins at home. It was coincidental timing,not dislike," I explained, trying to be patient.

"Oh." James responded simply.

\---

The names I'd overheard continued to echo in my mind,making it impossible to focus on anything else.

"James, can I ask you something?" I didn't wait for his permission before continuing,′′DOo you know Grace Davis?" "Grace Davis? How do you know about her?" James pulled me to one side to avoid blocking other guests. "She's a jewelry designer who lives abroad. There shouldn't be much news about her in America." "Does she... know Adam?" I could feel my heart rate accelerating.

"How do you know about that too? The Davis family and Adam's mother's family have been close for generations. Grace and Adam have known each other since childhood." James explained, then added with feigned casualness, "Are you heading back to America together?"

I shook my head. "I've already booked my flight." The truth was that I couldn't bear the thought of making small talk with James on the journey home-I needed to be alone with my thoughts.

"Stella, are you still with Adam?" James finally asked the question that seemed to be hovering in his eyes since he first saw me.

I didn't answer directly. Instead, I forced a smile. "Thanks for telling me all this. I'll be at your mother's birthday party the day after tomorrow. See you back in New York." On the flight from Paris to New York, I couldn't help but feel the irony of my situation. One minute I was announcing to the world that I was married, and the next, I was hearing gossip about my husband with another woman. I tried desperately not to think about Adam and Grace, but my mind wouldn't cooperate. I'd always known that Adam,with his status and looks, would attract women-I'd prepared myself for that reality from the beginning. But somehow, the concrete knowledge that he had attended Grace's exhibition,sparking rumors, felt like a physical blow.

*It's just gossip*. I told myself.*It doesn't mean anything*.

But the memory of a woman answering Adam's phone lingered.feeding my doubts.


\---

When I returned to Lancaster Manor, my mind was still dominated by thoughts of Adam and Grace. Without any evidence, I even suspected that Grace might have been the one who answered Adam's phone before the award ceremony.

Sitting on the sofa, my thoughts were interrupted by the ringing of my phone. Adam's name flashed on the screen.

"Hello," I answered, my voice sounding flat even to mny own ears.


There was a brief pause on the other end. "What's wrong?"Adam asked, immediately picking up on my mood. mind wouldn't cooperate.

Those four simple words, though nothing special in themselves,somehow broke through the dam holding back my emotions.All the hurt and confusion I'd been suppressing rushed forward, making my throat tighten.

"No," I managed, trying to sound normal. "Did you need something?"

"I'll be arriving at Kennedy Airport at three this afternoon.Come pick me up, and we'll go to Mrs. Morgan's birthday party together."

"Okay," I agreed quickly, anxious to end the call before he detected more of my emotional state. "If that's all, I should go-I have work to do."
###Chapter 82

Stella's POV

I couldn't help myself. After hanging up, I went online and searched for info on Grace Davis, my fingers practically shaking as I typed.

American sites came up empty.

Switching to international ones, I hit paydirt: Grace Davis, the Davis family's golden girl, a perfect mix of talent and beauty,hailed as one of her generation's most promising jewelry designers. *Talent and beauty?* I bit my lip, a sharp sting prickling my chest. No photos, but her published works screamed genius-technical skill paired with artistic flair. *This kind of woman's totally Adam's type, isn't she?*

The latest headline stopped my heart for a second: "GT Group President attends jewelry designer Grace Davis's exhibition,sparking romance rumors." I snapped the laptop shut, telling myself I was being ridiculous.*Romance? No way, he's got me, right?* But the doubt took root like a weed I couldn't yank out. *What's he got with her?Friends? Or... more?* My head spun with stupid images-Adam laughing low with some elegant blonde, his fingers brushing her ring designs, his eyes softin a way that made me want to scream with jealousy. At exactly 3:00 p.m., I spotted Adam's wheelchair cutting through the crowd at Kennedy Airport. Our combo of good looks instantly drew stares, like we were some spotlight magnet.



He handed me a sleek paper bag. "Gift."

I stared at it, thrown-I'd been so caught up obsessing over Grace, I'd nearly forgotten my usual souvenir nag.*Iwas secretly hoping for another handmade mask.* Inside were two boxes of maple tea, different flavors, the rich scent hitting me as I opened them. Not the mask I'd daydreamed about,but knowing he'd picked this out warmed me up a little. *He's swamped, and he still remembered I love maple tea-pretty sweet,actually.*

"Thanks,"I said, swallowing my disappointment with a smile. *Ask him about Grace, right now!* But the words stuck in my throat-James had already said they were childhood friends,basically raised together. *If I bring it up and he thinks I'm petty, I'll look like an idiot.* On the way to Mrs. Morgan's birthday bash, we stopped at the stylist's. In the car, Adam reached over and mussed my hair."Problem's fixed. Why're you still moping?"I blinked at him, confused."What's fixed?"

Taylor piped up from the front passenger seat: "The Lucy stealing-your-dance-double-credit thing!"

I yanked out my phone and saw the top trend: "Lucy Caught Faking Dance Double Role."It started innocently enough: "Big thanks to Miss Winston from the 'Splendor' crew for stepping in as a dance double. So beautiful!"The video showed a dancer in a flowing red gown, moving with grace and skill-me,though my face wasn't clear.

Within hours, Lucy's PRteam jumped on it, liking and reposting like it was her. Her fans ate it up:

@LucyWinstonFan: "Our queen's unstoppable! Beauty,talent,and now killer dance moves! #LucyWinston #Splendor"

@CelebrityUpdate: "Lucy Winston stepping in as a dance double proves her work ethic and versatility!#RespectTheHustle"

I'd have ignored it, but then an entertainment blogger dropped a crystal-clear video-my face front and center-captioned:"Proof! The mystery dancer isn't Lucy Winston, it's a crew stylist. Nice try, Lucy! #DanceDoubleDrama" The lead actress fanned the flames: "The 'Splendor' crew's full of hidden gems! Thanks to our gorgeous stylist for doubling as my dancer.Love you! bIn hours, the truth blew up online-#LucyLied and #FakeClaims flooded my feed. Some even tied it to that birthday fireworks stunt: "Wait, isn't this the same Stella from the insane birthday fireworks a few weeks back? #RichBoyfriend #MysteryCouple"

I sighed, flipping my phone face-down on the vanity. So that's what Adam meant by "fixed."I was touched he'd stood up for me, but Lucy's public flop left me a little uneasy.

*That's not what's really eating you, though, is it?* a voice in my head whispered. Nah, what really gnawed at me was Grace Davis-and that woman who'd answered his phone. *Was she with him in Europe, all cozy? Did he ruffle her hair too? Buy her gifts?* My chest tightened, sour and heavy with jealousy.




At 3:30 p.m., I was at Cyril's studio, getting ready for the night.
"Mrs. Lancaster, youngest Vogue Fashion Stylist Gold Award winner ever! Unreal!"Cyril gushed, fussing with my hair."Iwas twenty-three when I won, and you outshine me!" I smiled politely, but my mind was miles away. *Outshine?Does Adam think I shine, or is Grace the one dazzling him?* I'd picked Cyril's place to keep busy, anything to stop obsessing over those messed-up thoughts. "Done!"Cyril stepped back, beaming at his work. "This summer haute couture mermaid gown's perfect on you. Mr. Lancaster won't be able to peel his eyes off."

I checked myself in the mirror. The dress was stunning-a masterpiece, hugging my curves, shimmering faintly as I shifted.My makeup was flawless, smoky eyes giving me a mysterious.elegant edge. James's pearl hairpin added a classic touch to the modern vibe.*Ilook good enough to knock him dead,right?Better than Grace?* I bit my lip, jealousy bubbling up again.

"Thanks, Cyril. It's perfect."I grabbed my clutch and headed out.

Stepping from the dressing room, I caught Adam waiting in the reception area. His eyes flicked to me, widening just a fraction-his usual cool mask slipping, showing real surprise.

For a split second, I felt smug as hell, like I'd won something.*Take that, Grace-I can still make him stare!* Despite the doubts, the fears, knowing I could shake him up like this flooded me with a goofy,giddy thrill.

Cyril clocked Adam's reaction and waved dramatically at me."Mr. Lancaster, isn't she stunning?"he asked, proud as a peacock. Adam's gaze snapped to Cyril, cold and possessive,then slid back to me. He didn't say a word, but that look made Cyril shuffle back a step. *Classic Lancaster intimidation,* I thought,half-amused,half-annoyed, but secretly buzzing. *Is he jealous too,worried someone else might snatch me up?*
###Chapter 83

Stella's POV

When we rolled up, the Morgan family's private estate was lit up like a damn Christmas tree, the circular driveway packed with luxury cars-a full-on flex fest.

I pushed Adam's wheelchair toward the entrance, and eyes hit us from every angle like spotlights. This was his first public outing since the GT Group CEO reveal, and the curiosity was thick enough to choke on.

I snuck a glance down at him. *With that face and this title,who wouldn't stare? But how many of these looks are for me?*A smug little buzz hummed in my chest, mixed with a twitch of nerves.

"I need to go wish Mrs. Morgan a happy birthday and drop off our gift," I whispered close to Adam's ear, clutchingthe fancy wrapped box in my hand.

"Go for it," he said casually, already deep in chat with some tech company CEO. I started to slip away, but his hand snapped around my wrist,firm enough to make my pulse jump. "Where you headed?" "To give Mrs. Morgan the gift," I said again, lifting the box a bit. "T'll be right back." His fingers lingered, brushing my wrist longer than they needed to before letting go. I caught a bunch of stares zeroing in on that tiny move-suit-and-tie bigshots swapping looks,like they were recalculating what I meant to Adam.


*Bet they figured I'm just arm candy, not someone he'd grab like that, huh?* I smirked inside. *Let them guess* I strutted through the crowd, chin up, spine straighter.




Upon the second floor, I found Mrs. Morgan in a reception room, chatting with a tight-knit crew of friends. Her face lit up when she spotted me. "Stella!" she exclaimed, throwing her arms wide like I was family.


"Mrs. Morgan, happy birthday!" I flashed a warm smile as I walked over. "I've been swamped lately, sorry I haven't visited.This is fromn Adam and me," I said, handing her the box.′′Wheard you're into tea, so it's an English tea set. Hope you like it.11


She took it with a grin that could've lit the room. "You're so thoughtful! This is perfect-definitely your pick. That work-obsessed Adam couldn't dream up something this classy!" J smiled politely, but her words jabbed me right in the gut. *Yeah,he doesn't give a damn about stuff like this-I'm the one sweating the details.* Imagining him brushing off personal touches like this stung, and a sour thought crept in. *Does he do the same with Grace? Just toss her some random crap and call it a day?*

Mrs. Morgan's gaze softened as she studied me. "You know,Stella. I've always adored your grace. No wonder all the big names rave about you."

"You're too kind, Mrs. Morgan," I said, dodging the compliment. It made me squirm. *Grace? Right now, I'm a jealous mess-where's the grace in that?*

After a few more minutes of small talk, I excused myself and headed back to the main reception area. Passing through the hallway, I caught snatches of chatter from a clique of trendy young women, and my feet slowed on their own.

"Isn't that the dress you wanted but couldn't snag?" one asked another.

"Don't remind me," came a bitter snap.′′I′Ss maddening-someone like Stella, no pedigree, gets to wear it, andI don't."

"Heard Adam bought it for her... surprised he hasn't dumped her yet,though." "Too bad Lucy and Brian didn't make the guest list-talk about a fireworks show!" I fiddled with my bracelet, pretending to adjuast it while soaking in every word. *No pedigree? I've got Adam in my corner-who needs a fancy family name?* But "dumped her"hit like a punch. *They think I can't hold onto him? Because of Grace,maybe?*

"Susan,your folks are tight with Adam, right? What's the deal with him and Stella?" another piped up.

"Stella..." Susan paused, then puffed up. "Just wait. She won't be basking in the spotlight much longer."

I sped up, not wanting to hear more. Susan's thinly veiled jab didn't rattle me as much as it might've months back.




In the hallway, I nearly ran smack into James, who looked like he'd been lurking for me. "You're wearing the hairpin I gave you," he said, his voice shaky, unsure. "It looks good."

"Mr. Morgan's got great taste," I tossed back vaguely, my head still spinning.

James shifted, awkward as hell. "You here alone? I didn't bring a date tonight-maybe we could-""She's not alone." Adam's voice cut through, calm but loaded with authority,echoing from the end of the hall. He rolled his wheelchair up. face unreadable as stone.

James went rigid. "Adam."

"Come here," Adam said, stretching a hand toward me,eyes locked on James like a hawk.


I didn't even think-just walked over and slid my hand into his. His fingers clamped around mine, warm and steady,thumb grazing the inside of my wrist. *He's staking his claim,isn't he?* I stole a peek at him, my heart doing a goofy little flip-half smug, half giddy. *Sorry, James, no shot-he's jealous as hell right now.*

"Gift delivered?" Adam asked, his thumb still rubbing my skin,teasing me in that subtle way of his.

I nodded, feeling James's stare prickling my back like needles.

"The hairpin," he said, voice light but pointed. "James gave it to you?"

"Yeah," I admitted."The one from that night we got back from Rouge-it was on my nightstand. You asked about it." His face stayed blank, but his grip tightened just a hair. *He's bothered by this? Over James, or because I kept something from another guy?*′′Wait forme over there," he said, nodding toward a quiet seating area down the hall. I hesitated, flicking my eyes between him and James. Neither was backing off-tension crackled like static. *What's this vibe?They gonna throw punches or what?*

"It's fine," I murmured to Adam, easing my hand free. "I need to fix my makeup anyway."

As I walked off, their voices kicked up. "She's my date, James.You leave your brain at home today?" Adam's tone had that dangerous edge I knew too well.

"No, Adam, I didn't realize-my bad," James stumbled over his words.

I rounded the corner, their voices fading,but a nagging hunch stuck with me-this showdown had been simmering for a while. *James into me? And Adam this possessive-he scared I'Il get snatched up?* My cheeks burned, a weird mix of sour and sweet swirling inside.




From near the powder room, I watched James hustle back to the reception room, looking rattled, like he'd seen a ghost. He found his mom there. "What's up with you? You look spooked," Mrs. Morgan said,eyeing him with worry. "Mom,is the 、re really that big a gap between me and Adam?" James muttered, voice low but clear enough for me to catch.

Mrs. Morgan's laugh was soft but blunt. "Between you and Adam? I'd say it's about ten Lukes wide."

James flinched, stung by the comparison to his overachiever brother.

"What's this about? Don't tell me you've got a thing for that girl?" Mrs. Morgan asked, her eyes sharpening like she'd figured him out.

"What girl? What're you on about?" James shot back too fast,too flimsy.

"Stella, obviously!" Mrs. Morgan said.

"That's nuts! I barely know her-if I liked her, I'd have liked her ages ago!" James protested, but his face gave him away.

Mrs. Morgan shook her head, pity in her eyes. "Like her or not,drop it. Stella's Adam's."

"Adam's?" James scoffed. "They're not even married!"

"They are, actually," Mrs. Morgan corrected, cool as ice James's head jerked up, defiance melting into shock. "What? No way!" I turned from the doorway, done listening. My stomach knotted up tight. *Mrs. Morgan knows we're married? Did Adam tell her? Or... does Grace know too?* My head was a mess,jealousy and panic crashing over me like waves. *If he's spilling that to people, where the hell does Grace fit in his heart?*
###Chapter 84

Stella's POV

I found a quiet corner, desperate for a moment of solitude.The constant smiles and small talk had become exhausting and I needed to escape the curious stares that followed me and Adam throughout the evening.

Leaning against the wall, I pulled out my phone and mindlessly scrolled through Instagram. My finger paused mid-swipe when a familiar username caught my eye: "GRACE." I tapped on the profile and immediately recognized it as Grace Davis's account.

Her latest post made my blood run cold.

It was a photo of an exquisite Indian mask, intricately handcrafted with vibrant colors and delicate featherwork. But it wasn't the mask itself that made my stomach drop-it was the caption:

【Made by ADAM! Happy!】 I stared at the post, reading those four simple words over and over until they blurred before my eyes. The memory of my own request rose unbidden in my mind. "There's a private shop in Toronto that makes custom Indian masks. Maybe you could make one for me?" 
Adam had barely acknowledged my request, and I'd quickly backpedaled, asking for maple tea instead-which he had dutifully delivered. I'd been disappointed but uinderstanding.After all, why would a busy CEO like Adam Lancaster have time for handcrafting anything?

Except, apparently, he did have time. Just not for me.

A bubble of hysterical laughter rose in my throat. How pathetic I was, standing here feeling betrayed over a handmade mask.What did I expect? That Adam wouldn't have relationships with other women? That I was somehow special to him?

He only had no spare time for you. And yet you still had expectations!

I felt like I couldn't breathe, like a wad of cotton was being stuffed down my throat, blocking mny airway and pressing against my heart. The elegant party around me suddenly felt stifling, the soft music grating against my nerves.

Without thinking. I grabbed a flute of champagne from a passing server, raising it to my lips. The rational part of my brain reminded me I shouldn't mix alcohol with my medication,but the emotional part didn't care. I just wanted to numb this unexpected pain. "Planning to make a scene at someone else's party?"Adam's cool voice cut through my emotional spiral. His hand captured my wrist before the champagne could touch my lips.his grip firm but not painful.


Sanity rushed back, and I lowered the glass, embarrassed by my impulsive behavior. "I wasn't thinking."

Adam took the champagne flute from my hand and placed it on a nearby table. His fingers remained wrapped around my wrist, his thumb absently stroking the sensitive skin on the inside of my arm.

"Who upset Mrs. Lancaster?" he asked, his tone lighter but his eyes sharp and observant.

"No one," I replied, turning my head away to avoid his penetrating gaze. I couldn't let him see the truth-that he was the one who had upset me, with a mask he'd never bothered to make for me.


His grip tightened, pressing against the delicate bones of my wrist until I winced.


"You're hurting me!" I hissed, trying to pull away.′′Letgo."

Adam didn't release me, his eyes conveying a clear message:tell me what's wrong, or I won't let go. "Enough, you two!" Luke's amused voice interrupted our silent standoff.′′Mymother will be making her entrance soon. Please don't show off your marital affection  in front of her, or she'll start pressuring me to settle down next!"

I immediately plastered on a bright smile, grateful for the interruption. "Dr. Morgan, it's been a while."

Luke glanced between us, clearly sensing the tension. "Why don't we head to the main hall? Hiding in corners isn't very social of you."

"That sounds like a good idea," I agreed eagerly, using the distraction to free my wrist from Adam's grasp.

Adam's expression darkened further as he watched me step closer to Luke, but he said nothing as we made our way toward the main hall.

One hours later, I stood beside Adam in the grand ballroom,physically present but mentally elsewhere. My thoughts kept returning to that Instagram post, to Grace's obvious delight at receiving a handmade gift from Adam.

I was vaguely aware of James entering the room, taking his place beside his mother. Even from across the hall, I could feel his gaze occasionally drifting toward me. Adam noticed too,his posture becoming increasingly rigid each time Jameslooked our way. He's being ridiculous, I thought. It's just James. He and I have known each other since we were children. Adam's hand suddenly reached up. plucking the Chanel pearl hairpin from my updo. Several strands of hair tumbled free.brushing against my cheek.

"What are you doing?" I demanded, taken aback by his unexpected action.

"I'll buy you a new one tomorrow," he replied coolly, tucking the hairpin-James's gift-into his pocket.

"Adam, that was a gift!" I protested, feeling my composure start to crack.


"Mrs. Lancaster," he responded, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper, "it was a gift from another man."

Something inside me snapped. All the frustration, jealousy, and hurt I'd been suppressing bubbled to the surface.

"So what if it was from a man?" I demanded, no longer caring who might overhear. "Am I not allowed to have male friends? I've received hundreds of gifts from men throughout my life-are you planning to throw them all away? It was just a gift,completely innocent. You have no right to control me in this!" Adam's eyes narrowed. "You seem very attached to James's gift.11 "And what if I am?" I shot back, my voice trembling with emotion. I noticed several nearby guests turning to stare at our increasingly heated exchange. Taking a deep breath, I forced myself to regain control.

"I need to use the restroom," I announced, turning away before he could respond.

Seated in the locked stall of the ladies' room, I buried my face in my hands, fighting back tears. I'd been sitting here for nearly ten minutes, my mind a jumble of conflicting emotions.


Everything I knew about Grace Davis swirled through my head.The childhood connection. The jewelry designs. The exhibition Adam had attended. The handmade mask.


How hypocritical can he be? I thought bitterly. He's clearly involved with another woman, yet he has the audacity to be possessive over a simple hairpin?

There was a world of difference between my innocent social interactions with James and whatever was going on between Adam and Grace. James and I exchanged casual pleasantries and the occasional gift-nothing more. But Adam had gone to Grace's exhibition, crafted her a mask by hand, and who knows what else.
I regretted crossing that line with Adam. What had started as a contractual arrangement had evolved into something far more complicated, leaving me vulnerable in ways I hadn't anticipated.

A knock on the stall door interrupted my thoughts.

"Someone's in here!" I called out,quickly wiping away a stray tear.


The knocking continued, more insistent this time, the rhythm firm and deliberate.


Annoyed, I glanced down and froze when I saw men's dress shoes visible beneath the stall door. My heartbeat quickened,and I instinctively reached for my phone, preparing to call for help if necessary.
###Chapter 85

Stella's POV

Cautiously. I cracked open the door, ready to slam it shut at the first sign of danger. Before I could react, a powerful force pushed from the outside, shoving the door inward.

Adam stepped into the stall, his green eyes blazing with an intensity that made my breath catch. In one fluid motion, he backed me against the wall, his lips crashing down on mine in a fierce,possessive kiss.

"Adam,you-mmph!" I struggled against him, pushing at his chest. "Let me go! Let go!"

He ignored my protests, one hand pinning my wrists above my head while the other roamed freely over my body. His kiss was demanding, almost punishing, leaving me gasping for air when he finally pulled back.

"Adam, have you lost your mind?" I whispered furiously.′′This is a bathroom! The Morgans' bathroom!"

"You could speak louder," he suggested coldly. "Maybe James will come to your rescue." His words stung, but I was more concerned about someone discovering us. If anyone walked in and found Adam Lancaster-supposedly wheelchair-bound for years-standing perfectly fine in the women's restroom, it would be a scandal of epic proportions.

Even in my anger and humiliation, I found myself worrying about protecting Adam's secret. How pathetic was I, still putting his interests above my own dignity?

I felt his fingers at the back of my dress, slowly pulling down the zipper. My body trembled, a confusing mix of desire and outrage coursing through me.

"Adam," I whispered, my voice catching as tears welled in my eyes, "if you force me now, I won't forgive you this time."Despite my efforts to sound firm, my voice wavered,betraying my emotion.

He paused, his fingers still on the zipper.'"Why are you crying?"

I didn't answer, refusing to meet his gaze as tears spilled down my cheeks, landing on his immaculate suit jacket.

"Are you that unwilling?" he asked, his voice softer now,almost uncertain.


Still, I remained silent, keeping my eyes averted. After what felt like an eternity, Adam slowly pulled the zipper back up, securing my dress. "Better now?" he asked, his tone unreadable.Before I could respond, the muffled sound of Mrs. Morgan's birthday speech echoed from the main hall.

I seized the opportunity, ducking under his arm and rushing out of the stall. In the outer area of the restroom. I was surprised to find only Adam's empty wheelchair and, a short distance away, James looking concerned.

"Stella, where have you been?" James asked, taking a step toward me. "Adam's been looking for you..." He paused, his eyes widening as he might notice my reddened eyes and smudged lipstick. "What happened? Are you okay?"

I quickly pulled a face mask from my purse and slipped it on,hiding the evidence of what had just occurred.


"James, why are you here?" I asked, desperate to change the subject. "Your mother's birthday ceremony has already started.Shouldn't you be by her side?"

"Adam said you wandered off, so I came with him to look for you," James explained, still studying me with concern. "Are you sure you're alright? And where is Adam?"

′′I′m right here," Adam's voice came from behind me, making me jump. James glanced between us, his expression shifting as understanding dawned. An awkward silence fell, broken only by the distant sounds of the party. "I, uh." James stammered, clearly uncomfortable, "should we head back now. Adam?"


"I'm sorry, James," I interjected before Adam could respond.′′I′m not feeling well. I think I need to go home."

"What about Adam?" James asked. looking uncertain.

"We're leaving," Adam stated firmly. "Please convey our apologies to your mother."

"Oh, alright," James replied, shifting his weight from one foot to the other. "Let me walk you out."

As James led us toward the side exit, I felt Adam's presence behind me like a physical weight. The tension between us was palpable, a silent battle raging beneath our polite facades.

James opened the door for us, the cool night air a welcome relief against my flushed skin. As I stepped outside, I caught James noticing the absence of the pearl hairpin from my hair.his expression briefly registering surprise before smoothing into a neutral smile.


"Thank you for understanding," I said softly, unable to meet his eyes. James nodded, his gaze flicking between Adam and me."Take care,Stella. Adam." As the door closed behind us, leaving us alone in the darkness.I wrapped my arms around myself, suddenly feeling very cold despite the mild evening temperature.

I felt Adam's hand at the small of my back, steering me toward the waiting car. Neither of us spoke. There was nothing left to say.

The silence in the car was suffocating. I gazed out the window at the night scenery. Adam sat beside me, seemingly engrossed in his phone, but his rigid posture betrayed his awareness of the tension between us.

Taylor glanced at us through the rearview mirror. "Mrs.Lancaster, you seem upset. Is everything alright?"

I forced a smile, avoiding his concerned gaze. "Just tired. It's been a long night."

Taylor's eyes flickered between Adam and me,clearly noticing the distance-both physical and emotional-between us.Normally, Adam would casually rest his hand on mine,or I would lean on his shoulder. Tonight, we sat at opposite ends of the back seat, as if the cushion between us was the Atlantic Ocean itself.When we finally pulled into the circular driveway of the Lancaster estate, I didn't wait for Joseph to open the door. As soon as the car stopped, I pushed the door open myself and headed straight for the mnain entrance.

"Madam, shall I prepare some tea for you?" Joseph called after me, clearly surprised by my sudden move.

"No, thank you. I'm going to bed," I replied without looking back,continuing towards the grand staircase.

I could feel Adam's gaze burning into my back, filled with unspoken questions, but I couldn't face him. Not tonight. Not after hearing the gossip about Grace Davis and her exhibition in Toronto.


Behind me, I heard Joseph's hushed voice. "Sir, is something wrong between you and Mrs. Lancaster? You both seem-"

The sound of Adam's wheelchair rolling across the marble floor cut off whatever Joseph was about to say. I quickened my pace,reaching our bedroom before Adam could intercept me.
###Chapter 86

Stella's POV

Hours later, I lay in our king-sized bed, staring wide-eyed at the ceiling. Sleep refused to come, my mind replaying the events of the night.

The digital clock on the nightstand read 1:23. Adam still hadn't come to bed. The sliver of light under the door suggested he was in his study, likely working-his typical response to emotional turmoil.

I threw off the covers. The bedroom suddenly felt stifling, the air too heavy to breathe. I needed to clear my head, perhaps a walk in the garden. The night air might help calm the storm of thoughts swirling in my mind.

I quietly donned my robe and soft slippers, gently opening the bedroom door-only to find Adam sitting in the hallway in his wheelchair, a laptop balanced on his lap, the screen illuminating his tired face.

He looked up as I stepped out. "Where are you going?"

The question sounded casual, but there was an edge to his tone. "Just needed some fresh air," I replied, trying to move past him towards the stairs. Adam maneuvered his wheelchair to block my path. "It's past one in the morning, Stella."

"I know what time it is." I tried to sidestep him, but he moved again, blocking me.

"Stella," his voice hardened, "what's going on with you tonight?"

"Nothing." I crossed my arms defensively.

"Nothing?" He narrowed his eyes. "You've been acting strange since we got back from the party. If this is about the hairpin James gave you,then-"

"This isn't about James," I interrupted, my frustration mounting.

Adam's jaw tightened. "Then what is it? Stella,you're the only person who makes me ask the same question twice."

I bit my lip, torn between confronting him directly or keeping my suspicions to myself. What if I was overreacting? What if Grace really was just a childhood friend? But why had a woman answered his private call?

"What were you doing in Toronto?" I finally asked, watching his face closely for any reaction. For a moment, surprise flickered across his features. "Why do you ask?" "Just curious." I tried to sound nonchalant, but my voice betrayed me, higher than usual.

Adam studied me, his green eyes inscrutable. "Business. I told you before I left."

His dismissive attitude only fueled my frustration. "Fine.Whatever. It doesn't matter." I turned to head back to the bedroom. But before I reached the door, I remembered something.


"Wait," I told him, disappearing into the room. Moments later,I returned with a package wrapped in simple blue paper. "I was going to give you this when you got back from Toronto,but then...well,things happened."

Adam took the package, looking puzzled. Carefully unwrapping it, he revealed a hand-knitted, dark green scarf-the color chosen to match his eyes. It was wider than a traditional scarf,with intricate patterns.

"I promised you a gift," I explained, suddenly feeling self-conscious under his intense gaze. "It's a bit large, so you can use it as a lap blanket too-though I don't know why you insist on pretending to be disabled." The lines of Adam's mouth softened, not quite a smile,but no longer the hard lines of anger. His fingers traced the patterns on the scarf, lingering on the initials I had pains takingly woven into the fabric. "You made this?" he asked, his voice unusually gentle.

I nodded, then took a deep breath. "I'm sorry, Adam. T overreacted today. It was inappropriate to question you like that. I think I need some space to sort out my thoughts.Maybe I should sleep in my own room tonight."

The softness in Adam's face vanished instantly. "What did you say?"

′′Isaid I should sleep in my own room," I repeated, confused by his sudden change in demeanor.

Adam narrowed his eyes, gripping the scarf tightly. ′′Isthat what you mean? A parting gift?"

"What? No!" I protested, bewildered by his conclusion.′′It7Sjust a gift, Adam. The one I promised you."

"Then why are you talking about sleeping separately?" His voice took on that dangerous edge I knew so well."Stella,you're my wife. You givre me a scarf and then talk about sleeping elsewhere-what am I supposed to think?"

"It's not like that," I insisted, realizing how my words must have sounded to him. "I just need some time to process everything." "Process what?" Adam demanded, wheeling closer."The fact that I attended a friend's exhibition? Or that she borrowed my phone for a few minutes?"

"I just-can't be in the same room with you right now!" The words burst out before I could stop them, driven by frustration and exhaustion.


Adam went still, his expression hardening into the cold mask he wore when dealing with business adversaries. "Fine," his voice was icy. "If that's what you want."

Without warning, he tossed the scarf into the nearby trash bin,the handmade gift landing among crumpled papers and tissues with a soft thud.


"You think I care?" he said, his voice low and dangerous. "Stay in your room, Stella. See if I care."

With that, he wheeled away towards the elevator at the end of the hallway, leaving mne standing alone at the bedroom door.

I stared at the trash bin, the green scarf stark against the white tissues. My heart felt like it had been struck by an invisible force, a dull ache spreading through my chest. Three weeks of work,countless hours learning to knit, all discarded in a moment of anger.I slowly returned to the bedroom, gently closing the door behind me. Only then did I allow the tears to fall.
###Chapter 87

Adam's POV

I slammed the empty glass onto the bar with a force that cut through the nightclub's background music. "Another one," I ordered, my voice cold and unyielding.

"Maybe you should slow down?" Mark raised an eyebrow but still signaled the bartender. "That's your fourth drink already."

"Shut up." My expression was dark, warning him not to utter another word.


Mark exaggeratedly raised his hands in surrender. "Alright,alright. So, you're not going to tell me what's going on, but you expect me to sit here and watch you drink yourself into oblivion?"


I chose to ignore him, taking the next glass of whiskey from the bartender. The nightclub was relatively quiet tonight, with only a few VIP patrons occupying the surrounding luxurious booths. The dim lighting and pulsating music created a private space for us at the bar. "You know," Mark continued, unfazed by my silence,′′a11of Wall Street is talking about how Stella must have really pissed you off this time." I snapped my head up. "What did you say?" Just repeating what I heard." Mark shrugged, a míschievous glint in his eye. "The great Adam Lancaster,looking murderous at the gala. People are talking."

I took another swig of whiskey, saying nothing.

"So, did she really make you mad?" Mark pressed on.

"We didn't have a fight," I finallyresponded, my tone clipped.

Mark scoffed. "Sure. That's why you're here, drinking alone,looking like you want to punch a hole through the wall."

I shot him a warning look but didIn't refute his words.

I nodded absently, my thoughts clearly elsewhere. After a moment, I pulled out my phone and dialed a number.

"Joseph," I said when the call connected, my voice low, "the trash bin in my bedroom. There's a green scarf in it. Retrieve it and keep it safe. Do not tell my wife." I paused, listening to his response. "No, do not clean it. Just store it in a secure place."
Another pause. "Good."

I ended the call, noticing Mark's curious expression.

"Not a word," I warned. Mark mimed zipping his lips, but his eyes sparkled with amusement. Stella's POV

The next morning, I was awakened by the warm sunlight,raising my hand to shield my eyes. As I turned over, I noticed Adam's side of the bed was neatly made, clearly untouched throughout the night.

I instinctively glanced at the trash bin where the scarf had been,only to find it emptied and replaced with a new liner.

Joseph must have cleaned the room while I was asleep,I thought, feeling a pang of disappointment. That scarf had taken me nearly a month to learn how to knit, choosing the perfect materials, and even hiding Adam's initials in the pattern.
Now, it had been discarded along with the other trash.

My phone buzzed with a message from Samantha:

Sam:Did you and Adam have a fight?

Me: How did you know?

Sam: The whole Manhattan elite knows. Someone saw Adam drinking alone at an upscale bar last night, looking like he wanted to kill someone. News travels fast. I groaned, sinking back into the pillow. Of course, the news would spread quickly. Adam rarely showed emotion in public, so his appearance at a bar, visibly upset, would naturally spark gossip.

Me: What else are they saying?

Sam: That you're about to be dumped.

I stared at the screen, a surge of anger rising within me. I wasn't some disposable item! But then I realized, for Manhattan's high society, that was exactly how they played their games.

Me: He went to the bar alone? Where?

Sam: Mark's place. High-end, members only.

I put down my phone, digesting the information. Adam had gone to Mark's club-not surprising, given their friendship.

Something was happening, I thought, my intuition tingling. It wasn't just our argument.

The next few days passed in a state of cold war. I threw myself into work, flying to the Splendor set to handle some final costume details for the production. The distance gave me space to think, to process my feelings about Adam, Grace,and the escalating tension between us. Every night, I returned to the Lancaster estate late, usually finding Adam already in bed, pretending to be asleep. We coexisted in parallel, sharing the same space but barely engaging beyond the most basic courtesies.

Of course, the staff noticed. I caught Joseph and the other household employees exchanging worried glances when they thought I wasn't looking. The vibrant energy that had once filled the mansion had dimmed, replaced by a heavy silence that seemed to seep into every corner.

\---

Adam's POV

"Sir, a reminder about tonight's economic forum," Taylor placed a folder on my desk. "As a formal dinner, you will need a female companion."

I continued reviewing the quarterly reports, not even looking up."And?"

"Mrs. Lancaster is working at a nearby studio today," Taylor continued cautiously, "I thought perhaps-"

"Who said I planned to invite her? I cut him off, my tone icy.

Taylor hesitated, clearly uncomfortable. "I was merely suggesting Mrs. Lancaster, as she is your wife, and it would be the most ap propriate choice." I finally looked up, my expression inscrutable. "′′Calher.Inform her about tonight's event." Taylor nodded. pulling out his phone and stepping a few paces away to make the call. Moments later, I heard his professional voice, "Mrs. Lancaster? This is Taylor. Mr. Lancaster asked me to inform you about tonight's economic forum..."

I couldn't hear Stella's response, but judging by Taylor's increasingly uneasy expression, it wasn't positive.

"I understand, Mrs. Lancaster. Thank you for your time,"Taylor ended the call and turned to me. "Sir, Mrs. Lancaster is unavailable tonight. She suggested we find another suitable companion."

My jaw tightened. "Call her again. Put it on speaker."

Taylor looked alarmed but complied, dialing Stella's number once more and placing the phone on my desk.

"Hello?" Stella's voice filled the office on the third ring. >aylor,is there something else?"

"Mrs. Lancaster," Taylor began, his discomfort evident,′′MLancaster wanted to clarify the situation regarding tonight's event. It is quite a formal occasion, and it would be courteous to have a female companion. Considering you are nearby-" Stella interrupted, her tone polite but firm,"Iunderstand if Adam needs a companion, but I'm afraid I am unavailable tonight. Perhaps you can arrange for someone else suitable?" The ensuing silence was deafening. My expression darkened.my knuckles turning white as I gripped the armrest of my chair.

"Mrs. Lancaster," Taylor tried again, "perhaps if we sent a car-



"There's no need," Stella cut him off. "I have plans after work.Please convey my apologies to Adam. I must go now;they're calling me back to the set."

The call ended, leaving Taylor standing awkwardly by my desk,unsure how to proceed.

"Sir?" he asked cautiously after a moment.

My expression was completely closed off, my gaze as cold as winter frost. "Find someone else," I finally said,turning my attention back to the reports on my desk. "Anyone. I don't care who."
###Chapter 88

Stella's POV

"Stella, thank heavens you're here!" As I burst into the VIP lounge of Rouge nightclub, Samantha's frantic voice hit me like a slap,jolting me awake.

"What happened? Your text saidit was an emergency-"I stopped abruptly, the scene before me rendering my mind blank.


A man lay sprawled on the luxurious sofa,his shirt torn to shreds,bloodstained and barely breathing. Sam was hunched over him, pressing a cloth desperately against a prominent wound on his shoulder, blood seeping through her fingers in a horrifying display.

"What the hell happened here?" I gasped, quickly locking the door. "Sam, did you hurt him?"

"No!" Sam shouted back, her face a mix of indignation and panic. "I found him like this outside our lounge. I couldn't just leave him there!" I cautiously approached, scrutinizing the injured man. Despite the blood and grime obscuring half his face, his features seemed familiar. My heart raced as I took a closer look."Wait,isn't this Victor?" The Moore family member. Sam nodded heavily. "Yes, it's Victor."

"How did he end up like this?" I demanded, grabbing a clean cloth from the bar to help stem the bleeding. *This can't be a coincidence, Sam. What kind of trouble have you gotten into?* "This is too suspicious!"

Sam hesitated, her usual confidence replaced by uncertainty."It's... complicated. Years ago, when I was backpacking in Asia,Victor saved my life. I owe him. He must have known this place was mine and came here for help."

I examined the wound more closely, my stomach churning-too deep, too severe. "This looks like a gunshot wound,Sam!We need to get him to a hospital!" *Damn, with this much blood loss, my heart's about to leap out of my chest.*

"We can't go to a hospital!" Sam's voice rose in desperation."Trust me, Stella. Reporting a gunshot wound would put him in even greater danger."

I bit my lip, my mind racing. *No hospital? With this much blood loss, how long can he last? But if she's this desperate,there must be more to it.* "Do we have any medical supplies here?" "Just a basic first aid kit," Sam pointed to the small box she had already opened. "It's not enough for this kind of injury." "We need professional help," I decided, pulling out my phone. " I'm calling James."

"That conductor?" Sam looked bewildered."What can he do?"

"James went to medical school before becoming a conductor,"I explained as I dialed. "He got his license, then chose music, but he still has his credentials. If anyone can help without involving a hospital, it's him." *Damn, my hands are shaking.but I can't let Victor die here.*

The phone rang four times before James answered. "Stella? It's almost midnight, are you okay?"

"James, I need your help," I tried to keep my voice steady,though my heart was pounding like a drum. "It's a medical emergency. Can you come to Rouge nightclub? Bring equipment for... a severe injury."

He paused. "What kind of severe injury?"

I glanced at the unconscious Victor. "A lot of blood loss,possibly a gunshot wound."

"Jesus, Stella," James swore softly. "What the hell have you gotten into?""Are you coming or not?" I snapped, too anxious to mince words."I'll be there in half an hour," he finally relented. "Don't move the patient, keep pressure on the wound, and don't let him drink anything if he wakes up."

"Thanks, James," I sighed in relief, feeling a weight lift off my shoulders. "We'll be in the VIP area. Tell security you're here for me."




An hour later, James stormed into the VIP room, carrying a black medical bag, his face a mix of concern and irritation."Stella, I haven't performed surgery in years," he grumbled as he examined Victor's wound. "I'm a conductor now, not a surgeon."


"You're our best option right now," I reminded him, helping lay out his tools. *Stop talking and save him already, my heart's about to explode!*

"Who is this guy?" James asked as he cleaned the wound with antiseptic.

"Just someone we found," I evaded, unable to meet his eyes.

James shot me a skeptical look. "Really? You just found a guy with a gunshot wound outside a nightclub lounge. Stella, if that's true, I should call the police." "He's my boyfriend," Sam interjected, her hand possessively resting on Victor's uninjured arm, her tone smooth as if rehearsed. "We need your discretion, Mr. Morgan."

James raised an eyebrow, clearly unconvinced but didn't press further. "Discretion comes at a price," he said, preparing a suture needle.


"Name it," I spoke before Sam could, *Hurry up, don't let him die here!*


James looked up, a mischievous glint in his eye."Dinner on you,anywhere I choose."

"Deal," I agreed immediately. "Even if you want the biggest seafood platter in Manhattan, I'll get it for you."

With the terms settled, James focused entirely on treating the wound, his hands moving with the precision of someone who hadn't lost his touch. "The bullet went through," he assessed. "He's lucky, no major arteries hit. But he's lost a lot of blood,needs fluids and antibiotics."


Sam and I watched tensely as he cleaned, stitched,and bandaged the wound, finally setting up an IV. My heart was in my throat, *If he doesn't make it, what will I do?*

"He should be stable now," James said, packing up his tools. "But he needs rest and monitoring. This kind of wound has a high risk of infection."

"Thank you, James," I said sincerely. "You saved a life tonight." He shrugged, trying to appear nonchalant, but the pride in his eyes was unmistakable. *This guy might actually miss the thrill of emergency medicine.*

"About that seafood platter..."




An hour later, James and I were seated in a high-end seafood restaurant, tucked in a corner. Despite the late hour, the place was half full, mostly theater-goers and nightclub patrons.

"Are you going to tell me the truth?" James asked between bites of his seafood platter. "That guy is definitely not Sam's boyfriend."

I sipped my water, avoiding his gaze. "It's complicated."

"Complicated as in 'can't say,' or complicated as in 'I don't know?" James pressed, his eyes boring into mine.

"A bit of both," I admitted. "Sam said he saved herlife years ago, and she owes him. That's all I know." *Damn, I'm as confused as you are. What else is she hiding?* James looked skeptical but didn't push further. "He'll recover.Keep the wound clean, change the dressings daily, and make sure he takes the antibiotics I left." "Thanks again," I said, genuinely grateful. "You didn't have to come out so late."

"Consider it payback for old times," James half-smiled.

My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen, my body tensing. An unknown number had sent a text, containing only a photo-Adam at tonight's economic forum, smiling politely,standing next to a woman in a revealing dress. The message was brief: "Stella, men are naturally playful. Your precious Adam is no exception-he likes female company. At least I'm whole.unlike him."


A chill ran through me. Only one person would send such a message, deliberately jabbing at Adam's "disability"-Brian. *Damn!* I stared at the photo, recognizing the woman as one of the leads from *Splendor*, who had been flirting with Adam at a dinner a few weeks ago. *She's back at it?*


"Stella? What's wrong?" James's voice broke through my thoughts. "You look like you've seen a ghost."

I quickly locked my screen, forcing a neutral expression. "Nothing, just a work message." James clearly didn't believe me, but before he could say more,his phone rang. "Excuse me," he said, stepping away to take the call. I looked at the photo again, my chest tightening. *Adam, you really know how to play, don't you? I'm here saving a life, and you're out there smiling with another woman?*
###Chapter 89

Adam's POV

I formally bid farewell to the actress. "Thank you for your company this evening," I said, my tone professional and detached, devoid of any warmth. This was merely part of the job; there was no need to display any emotion.

"It was my pleasure, Mr. Lancaster," she responded, her smile overly bright and her eyes excessively eager.′′Iwould never have had the chance to attend such an event if it weren't for you. I'm truly grateful."


I gave a curt nod, already scanning the parking area for my car.These situations were all too familiar, and I just wanted to end the day as quickly as possible.

"Mr. Lancaster," the actress persisted, stepping closer,′′Ijust wanted to say how much I appreciate this opportunity. Is it because I helped clarify the misunderstanding about Miss Winston's dance double?"


I glanced at her briefly before returning my gaze to the street "You may leave now." I felt no need to explain anything further or continue this conversation. Her smile faltered slightly but quickly regained its composure,"Of course. Thank you again for the invitation." As she finally walked away, Taylor approached me,his expression grave. I had a premonition that it wasn't good news.

"Sir, we have confirmed that Brian took photos of you and the actress tonight. Our security team checked his phone, and he has already sent the images to your wife."

I felt my jaw tighten, a surge of anger rising in my chest, but I suppressed my emotions. "And then?" I asked calmly.

"Mrs. Lancaster has not responded to the messages," Taylor reported. "She seems to be ignoring them."

"What is she doing now?" I demanded, my voice low, a sense of unease creeping in.

Taylor hesitated, clearly uncomfortable with the information he was about to reveal. "Mrs. Lancaster is having dinner with Mr.James Morgan."

A cold fury swept through me. James-the man who had always coveted my wife. The photos, the misunderstandings, and now this-all the pieces began to connect in my mind. Without another word,I strode towards the waiting car, hearing Taylor's hurried footsteps behind me. Stella's POV It was nearly three in the morning when I returned to the Lancaster manor. The house was dark and quiet, with only the security lights illuminating the hallways.

I quietly ascended the stairs, not wanting to wake anyone. As I entered our bedroom. I was surprised to find Adam already in bed, his back to the door,seemingly asleep.

He must have left the forum early, I thought, tiptoeing towards the bathroom to freshen up.

Twenty minutes later, I emerged in my nightgown, and Adam hadn't moved. I slipped into bed, staying on my side, careful not to disturb him.

Just as I was about to drift off. I felt the mattress shift.
Without warning,Adam turned over, his arm encircling my
waist,pulling me against his chest.

"You're not asleep," I gasped, startled by the sudden movement.

"No," he confirmed, his breath warm against my ear.

A tense silence stretched between us.

"Stella," Adam finally spoke, his voice low. "About tonight. My companion. There is nothing between us."

I blinked in surprise. Was he explaining himself? Adam Lancaster never explained his actions to anyone. "I know." I said simply.

"You know?" He sounded almost disappointed by my lack of reaction.


"She's been trying to get close to you since the first dinner on set," I explained, keeping my voice neutral. "I'm not surprised she would seize the opportunity to accompany you to an event.11


Adam was silent for a moment. "You have nothing else to say?"

"What should I say?" I asked, genuinely puzzled. "Who you choose as your companion for events is your decision. I had matters to attend to tonight."

Adam let out a half-laugh, half-scoff. "Okay, I won't ask more."

Thanks God, he didn't press further, I didn't want him to know the detail.

The next morning, I woke early, slipping out of bed without disturbing Adam. After dressing quickly, I grabbed a small bag of groceries I had prepared the night before and left a note for Joseph, explaining that I would be back before noon. Twenty minutes later, I knocked on Sam's apartment door. She opened it, looking exhausted, with dark circles under her eyes and her usually perfect hair in disarray. "How is he?" I asked as I walked in, placing the bag on her kitchen counter.


"Not good," Sam admitted, running a hand through her hair."He had a fever last night-probably an infection from the wound. I gave him the antibiotics James left, and the fever has come down a bit."


I unpacked the groceries, which included fresh fruit, protein-rich foods, and medical supplies.′′Ibrought more bandages and antiseptics. And some proper food-you look like you haven't eaten since yesterday."

"Thank you," Sam said gratefully, accepting the coffee I handed her. "I've been up all night watching over him."

"Any idea what happened?" I asked, keeping my voice low. "How did he end up outside our club with a gunshot wound?"

Sam shook her head. "He hasn't been coherent enough to explain. He just mumbled 'they found me' before passing out again."

I frowned, my concern growing. "Sam, this is serious. If someone is after him and they tracked him to Rouge, you could be in danger too." "I know," she sighed, leaning against the counter. "But like I said, I owe him a huge debt. I can't just turn him away." "Are you planning to keep him here? In your apartment?" I asked incredulously.


"Of course not," Sam said quickly. "Once he's stable enough to move, I'll help him find a safer place. I can't harbor a gunshot victim indefinitely. It's too risky."
###Chapter 90

Adam's POV

I stared at James across the table. The guy was fidgeting like he had a thorn under his seat. The whiskey in his crystal glass swirled, mirroring his unsettled heart.

James was visibly uncomfortable, his fingers tapping nervously on the barely touched glass, the sound echoing like a drumbeat in my head. "Adam, thanks for theinvite," he began, breaking the silence. "But honestly, when I got your call, I was pretty damn surprised."


I remained silent, taking a leisurely sip of my whiskey. *Let him sweat, let this idiot guess my intentions.* I deliberately dragged out the moment, savoring his discomfort.

"Is there something you need?" James spoke again,his Adam's apple bobbing as if he had swallowed a stone. "You seem... off tonight."

I leaned back into the leather sofa, adopting a relaxed posture,but my gaze remained fixed on him, sharp enough to pierce through his feeble courage.*Let's see how long you can keep up the act.* James grew more anxious, shifting in his seat like a caught thief. "Adam, do you,,. have a problem with me?" 
"Oh?" I raised an eyebrow, my expression inscrutable, a cold smile playing on my lips.


*Why is this guy so jumpy? I just invited him for a drink.*Unless... he had something to hide. *Damn, did he actually do something to betray me?*

James finally picked up his glass, downing a gulp of whiskey before setting it down hastily, his fingers trembling like a leaf. *Look at him,scared shitless.*


"I just had a feeling. That day, on my mom's birthday, you insisted I accompany you to find Winstead. It was weird," he stammered.


I chuckled softly, taking another sip of my drink, still not saying a word. *Silence is the best weapon, let him scare himself more than my words ever couldl.* Let's see what he spills.

My silence only added fuel to the fire, and James's unease exploded. "And when you left that day, I noticed the pearl hairpin I gave Stella was no longer in her hair."

The pearl hairpin. *So he did notice that.* At the mention of the hairpin, I looked up, my gaze boring into him, the alcohol loosening my restraint. Whatever he saw in my eyes made himn shrink back, like a dog with its tail between its legs. "Are you upset with me because of Stella?" he ventured,his voice trembling.


I set my glass down, my movements slow and deliberate,my hand steady as a rock. "You missed one thing. You had a late-night snack with Stella last night."


*Just thinking about her being alone with him makes me want to smash something.* The image of her smiling and chatting with him, her face glowing under the lights,made my blood boil.

James looked bewildered, his eyes wide as saucers. "Adam, last night... it was just a casual get-together, purely as friends!I have no inappropriate thoughts about her, especially since you two are married! My mom even told me."

I caught the flicker of disapopointment on his face when he mentioned our marriage. *This bastard has feelings for her.*

"We're married, and that bothers you?" I pressed.

"No!" he denied too quickly, downing his drink as if to drown his thoughts in alcohol. *Liar, it's so obvious.* I watched him coldly, my fingers drumming on the armrest. I signaled the waiter at the door. "Bring that bottle over." James looked shocked as the waiter brought an outrageously expensive bottle of whiskey and poured it into his glass. "This...this is top-shelf stuff."

"Drink up." I said coolly. "You look like you need it."

*Alcohol is the best truth serum. Let's see what he spills after a few more glasses.*


Three high-proof bourbons later, James's defenses began to crumble. His speech slurred, and his expression relaxed,the pretense fading.

"Adam," he leaned forward suddenly, his drunken eyes wide with a secret. "You might not know this, but half the guys in our grade had a crush on Stella, and I!" He pointed exaggeratedly at himself, "was in the other half. But even in that half, many secretly admired Winstead!"

I narrowed my eyes at him, noting how his gaze softened every time he mentioned "Stella." *That's the answer I needed.*

*So,you were one of those cowards who never spoke up.*

"There were upperclassmen, underclassmen, so many who pursued Winstead," James continued, his drunken rambling unfiltered.I cut to the chase: "What about you? Do you still have a crush on her?" James's face froze, as if I had struck a nerve. He dodged the question,changing the subject. "Adam, with so many people liking Stella, why do you argue with her?"

"She wants to argue with me." I corrected him, my tone icy.

*Stella never picks a fight unless she's really hurt.* Just thinking about her angry, glaring at me, made my heart clench.*Damn, did I really piss her off?*


James blinked. "She argued with you? Why would she argue with you?" He squinted, as if a light bulb had gone off. "Is it because of the rumors about you and Grace?"

He muttered into his glass, "Of course! Not just argue, she should divorce you!"

"What rumors?" I frowned, a sense of foreboding creeping in.

James stared at me wide-eyed. "You don't know?"

He clumsily pulled out his phone, fumbling with the screen.′′It7s everywhere... whereis it?" He grew increasingly frustrated,finally slamming the phone down in a drunken rage.′′Damn it,I can't find it!""Rubbish," I said, but my mind was already racing.*What the hell is this about now?* "Taylor will handle it." I glanced at my watch and stood up. "I'm leaving. CaIl your 
friends to keep you company. I'll cover the bill."

James looked up blearily. "Adam, you called me out just to leave like this?"


I ignored him, pushing my wheelchair towards the door.∗I∗ve learned all I needed to know.*

Taylor was waiting outside the private room, stepping forward as I emerged. "Sir, the car is ready."

"What did Grace post on Instagram?" I asked bluntly.

Taylor was visibly taken aback, just as surprised as James that I was in the dark. "I'm not sure, sir. I'll find out immediately."

As we waited for the elevator, I replayed my conversation with James. His reactions confirmed my suspicions: no matter how much he denied it, this bastard had feelings for my wife.*Every denial was like handing me a weapon.*

*How laughable, he thinks I can't see through his little charade?* *So many men desire her, but I married her.* No matter how it started, that fact gave me immense satisfaction. *She's mine,and no one can take her away.* The elevator descended smoothly to the ground floor. Taylor was still engrossed in his phone, searching for Grace's potentially scandalous post. "Sir," Taylor finally spoke as we exited the building.′′Ifound it.Miss Davis posted this five days ago, and many people assumed it was from you."

He handed me his phone, displaying Grace's Instagram page

"Made by ADAM. Happy!"

My blood ran cold as I recalled Stella asking me to get her a custom mask from a private shop in Toronto-I had refused.bringing back only maple tea. Now I understood her coldness,her anger. *In her eyes, I refused her request but got the same thing for another woman.*
###Chapter 91

Stella's POV

The jarring ring of the phone interrupted my afternoon nap.I groggily reached for the phone on the bedside table, my eyes not fully open yet.

Who would be calling at this hour?

The screen displayed an unmarked number. After a moment of hesitation,I answered.

"Hello."

"Stella, are you stilI sleeping? Have you forgotten about the show?" A man's broken English, mixed with fluent French.came through the phone.

Damn it! Frank's show!

I sprang up from the bed, devoid of drowsiness: "No, no! I will definitely be there on time!"

The other party grunted and hung up directly. *This is so embarrassing.* Glancing at the time, I cursed my carelessness inwardly. Frank Leclerc, the most promising haute couture designer today, with a quirky temperament but overflowing talent. Tickets to his private show were hard to come by, and I almost missed it because I overslept.Rushing to the dressing room. I pondered on what to wear. It had to reflect taste but not be too ostentatious, after all. this was Frank's show,not mine.


In the end. I chose a deep purple velvet evening gown, with a slight crinoline underskirt, the length just grazing the ankles. It exuded a formal elegance without being overly grand, perfect for a private show.

As I applied makeup, I tried to keep my hand steady. Today,I would meet many high society figures from Manhattan,and I couldn't afford to make a fool of myself.

Heading downstairs, Joseph happened to be walking from the other end of the corridor.

"Madam is going out? Will you be back for dinner?"he inquired.

Putting on my shoes, I replied, "I'm going to the show at Hopper Winery, it should end around five, so I should be back for dinner."

"Do you need me to prepare a car for you?" "No, thank you, Joseph. I've already called for a car." Glancing at my watch, I calculated the time in my mnind. Though rushed.I should make it in time."Does Mr. know you're going out?" This question made me tense. Since the night of Mrs. Morgan's birthday party. the relationship between Adam and me had been in a subtle cold war state. Estranged, each busy with our own affairs, hardly any interaction.

What if he knows? It's not like I have to inform him of my whereabouts.


"He probably doesn't care about my schedule." I replied softly.trying not to sound too bitter.

Joseph's expression shifted slightly, but quickly reverted to his professional butler demeanor. "Well, have a pleasant time.madam."


*A pleasant time? It's probably not that simple.* I thought of Frank's eccentric temperament and the troublesome characters that could appear at any moment, I knew today wouldn't be easy.

Upon arrival, I could feel the probing gazes. For months, I had been the focus of Manhattan's high society gossip. "Adam Lancaster's mysterious wife,"′′The Ward daughter who rose from obscurity to socialite"-various labels and speculations surrounded me.

Let them look, I'm not here to please them. "Stella! What a coincidence, you're here for the show too?" Turning around, I immediately recognized the speaker-Chloe Lancaster, Adam's sister-in-law, Thomas's wife. She was dressed in a luxurious designer coat, with exquisite makeup.Hermes bag slung over her arm, standing arrogantly among a group of wealthy ladies.

Here she is again. How annoying.

"Lady Lancaster, what a coincidence." I politely responded,but remained wary. Chloe had never been easy to deal with, her animosity towards me never concealed.

"I heard Adam hasn't been very fond of you lately, just the other day he took a female star to an event, and you still have the mind to attend a show?" Chloe's face bore a fake smile,"Well,you must be making the most of his resources and money,since the Winstons are not invited to this show, you got the invitation through Adam,right?"

*Hah,she knows how to hit where it hurts.* I resisted the urge to roll my eyes. Chloe was as unpleasant as ever, always keen on exposing the rift in my relationship with Adam. As for that female star, she was just an actress working for him,hardly significant. But such an explanation would only show that I cared,so I chose to remain silent. A wealthy woman with short hair suddenly interjected, "Miss Winston, how long can a woman rely on looks to get by? Let me introduce you to someone suitable. My nephew is single. and I think you'd suit him."

Seriously? Introducing a man to Adam Lancaster's wife in front of so many people? Were they out of their minds or what?


"Thank you, but that's not quite appropriate." I suppressed my anger,politely declining.

Chloe, like a shark smelling blood, chimed in, "I think it's quite suitable. Stella, weren't you fickle in the past? Engaged to my son and then quickly with Adam? Madam. why don't you speak. Miss Winston might be considering it."

The woman's daughter added, "Stella, let me tell you the truth.a woman like you, whose parents are unknown, if it weren't for my liking Adamn, my mom wouldn't have introduced my cousin to you!"

*Are they acting out a play?* I couldn't help but laugh. They were openly introducing men to Adam Lancaster's wife in front of so many people? It was simply ridiculous and laughable."I believe I know that actor you mentioned, the one who was recently exposed for cheating, playing around, and plagiarism,right?" I said calmly, "I heard his father is facing legal issues due to business malpractice. You may not know, but he was exposed probably because he offended me."Well,actually, he offended Adam, but these minor details didn't matter. The woman's daughter instantly flushed red. "You... Stella. did you ruin my cousin's family? How can you be so malicious!"

"Lady,be cautious with your words, there's a saying. Those who sow the wind shall reap the whirlwind.'" My tone was cold. If anyone should be blamed, it's your cousin for his own actions, Adam merely gave him a push.

Turning to Chloe, I added with a hint of threat. "Lady Lancaster, you're encouraging others to introduce men to me.I wonder if Mr.William would be upset if he found out?"

Chloe's face slightly changed, realizing the threat in my words.

To change the subject, she hastily said, "Alright! The show is about to start, everyone take your seats!"

A lady took the opportunity to compliment Chloe, "Ms.Lancaser, you have the best seat today, I envy you!"

Chloe responded smugly, "It's not the best seat, Frank's show always leaves the centerseat vacant, I'm sitting next to it."

Yes, there was a strange phenomenon at Frank's show-the most prestigious center seat was always left empty. It was said to be reserved for a mysterious figure... but in all these years.no one had ever sat there. The woman with short hair taunted again, "Stella, where are you sitting? I don't see your seat in the first row, did you hide 
in some corner?"

Chloe immediately chimed in, "Adam is the CEO of GT Group.why didn't he get you a good seat?"


*They have a death wish.* I didn't respond, just smiled faintly and followed the staff's guidance to the designated area inside.

As I walked straight to the center seat, I could feel Chloe's shocked gaze. She had just taken her seat and saw me walking to the seat next to hers-the supposedly forever vacant center seat.
###Chapter 92

Stella's POV

"Why are you sitting here?" Chloe's voice was sharp, "This seat at Frank's show is always empty, don't you know?"

The murmurs around grew louder: "Hah! Doesn't Stella attend many shows? Doesn't she understand this rule!" "This is going to be interesting!"

These people, just waiting to see me make a fool of myself.

Chloe quickly waved over the show's manager,a tall blond man with blue eyes. When he saw me, his expression instantly lit up.

"My God! Miss Winston, you're finally here!" heexclaimed in a mix of French and English, "If you hadn't shown up, this seat would have been empty again this year! Frank knew you were averse to the cold, so he specially designed this year's show indoors, do you like it?"

*Hmm,seeing their shocked expressions is so satisfying.* The venue fell silent. Everyone's expressions froze, especially the group that had mocked me earlier, their smiles awkwardly frozen."I like it. I'm sorry for the rushed outing today, I didn't bring flowers as a gift." I responded calmly, as if everything was perfectly normal.

The manager's smile grew even brighter. "Miss Winston. Frank will surely say, your presence is the best gift!"

Chloe's expression changed from shock to embarrassment. "You.how..."


"I forgot to tell you, my invitation wasn't from Adam, it was from Frank." I said calmly, adjusting my skirt. In fact, Frank had been sending me invitations every year, I just hadn't had the time before.

People around were whispering: "Did I mishear?" "What's going on?" "Is that seat really reserved for her?"

*Seeing their expressions, it's worth the price of admission.* As the lights dimmed, the show began, and I could almost feel Chloe's eyes watching me from the corner, filled with incredulity and envy.

Two hours later, Frank took the stage to give a speech. In his thirties, with deep features, he wore a well-tailored black suit,his green eyes sparkling under the lights. Today, he had an unusually pronounced smile on his face. The last time I saw him was in Paris, about two years ago? He seemed to be in good spirits.I noticed that from the moment he stepped on stage, his gaze hardly left the area where I was seated. Many people noticed this detail, sparking more speculation and whispers.

After a brief thank you, Frank began to answer questions from the press.

"Mr. Frank, we have a question. In the past four years and six private shows, you always left the best seat empty, why is there a lady seated there today?" a bespectacled female journalist asked.


Frank smiled as he replied, "Isn't this quite obvious? This seat is reserved for her. In the past, it was left empty because this lady declined to attend the show, always busy or unable to travel abroad, so I arranged this show in her hometown, and she no longer had a reason to stand me up."

With his last sentence, he clearly directed it towards me,with a tone of intimacy and complaint. I felt a flush on my face. He really held a grudge, and I had only missed a few times.

The journalists seemed to have found a big story, camera flashes incessantly capturing me in the center seat. The whispers from the audience grew louder: "Who is that woman? Refusing Frank six times, is she crazy?""Isn't that Stella? I thought she relied on Adam, but it turns out she got the invitation from Frank?""When did Stella meet Frank?" *Although I don't quite like being the center of attention, seeing Chloe's twisted face. I find it quite satisfying.* I maintained a nonchalant attitude, as if all of this was just another day.When asked why I had declined the invitations multiple times.I simply responded, "I was genuinely busy."

It wasn't an excuse, I was just truly overwhelmed.

"Mr. Frank, your center seat has been vacant for Miss Winston for four years, what makes her stand out? I've been following you since your first show eight years ago, but as far as I know.Miss Winston and you have no connection." Another journalist pressed.

Frank's expression turned serious and earnest, "Four years ago,I was embroiled in a plagiarism scandal, and no one believed me. It was her who got a lawyer to prove my innocence,and it was Miss Winston who orchestrated the 'Polar Night' show for me. She is my benefactor, my muse, dleserving of the throne at the cost of my honor."

This answer caused a stir throughout the venue. He didn't need to exaggerate like that. I just felt he was wronged, did a little favor, that's all. As for the 'Polar Night'show, I only made a few suggestions, he executed the rest himself. I could feel everyone's gaze changing-from, doubt, mockery to shock,curiosity, and even admiration. And Chloe looked like she had swallowed a fly,her face contorted to the extreme.

The last journalist posed a tricky question, "Is Miss Winston someone you like? Are you pursuing her?"

The entire venue fell silent, everyone perked up to hear the answer. These journalists dared to ask anything.

Looking at me, Frank's green eyes shimmered with complex emotions, but in the end, he just smiled gently, "No. I'm too old.not worthy of her."

Frank's declaration left the venue in complete silence. Even the most aggressive reporters kept their distance, though I could see them whispering among themselves, occasionally glancing in my direction.

I adjusted my evening bag, preparing to make a graceful exit before the crowd recovered and the questions began anew.Frank,however,had other plans.

"Stella, are you leaving already?" he asked,his French accent more pronounced than usual. "Surely you're not going to refuse dinner with me as well?After declining my invitations for four years?" I sighed inwardly. Dozens of eyes were watching our every interaction, and refusing him now would seem callous, especially after his public declaration of our"special relationship."

Why does it always end up like this? I just came to see a fashion show.


"Fine," I conceded. "I'll treat you."

Frank's face lit up with boyish delight. "Excellent! I know just the place."

As we headed toward the exit, I could feel Chloe's burning gaze following us. Her earlier smugness had evaporated,replaced by barely concealed jealousy.

Frank skillfully guided me through a side door, away from the clamoring crowd.

Once outside, he burst into laughter. "Did you see their faces?Like fish gasping for air!"

"Frank," I chided, though I couldn't completely suppress my smile. "That was completely unnecessary. Did you have to be so dramatic about it?""I heard some people weren't being very nice to you," he replied,his green eyes twinkling with mischief. "How was my performance? Did I heIp you save reputation?" He's so over-the-top, but he did give me a beautiful comeback. "You're impossible." I sighed, pulling out my phone. "I need to call Joseph to let him know I won't be home for dinner."

"So, did I do well?" Frank persisted, looking for praise like an eager puppy.


I shook my head, unable to maintain my stern expression. "Frank, you really don't act like a thirty-five-year-old man sometimes."


"As long as it helped you look good," he shrugged,completely unrepentant. "Were you happy with the result?"

Despite myself. I smiled. "Yes, I was happy. Thank you."

When we pulled up to the hotel entrance, I froze. There,waiting in the circular driveway, was Adam in his wheelchair.His expression was unreadable as always, but the rigidI set of his shoulders betrayed his tension. Taylor stood nearby as well.

How did he know I would be here? I hesitated, unsure whether to approach him or pretend I hadn't seen him.
###Chapter 93

Stella's POV

God. I'm acting like a teenager. He's my husband, after all.

Taking a deep breath, I walked over to him, leaving Frank momentarily confused by my sudden detour.

"What are you doing here?" I tried to keep my voice steady.

Adam's green eyes assessed me coolly.′′Passing by. Thought I'd pick you up for dinner."

"I already called Joseph," I said, shifting my weight uncomfortably. "I told him I won't be back for dinner tonight.I have plans."

"Last-minute plans?" Adam's voice was casual, but I detected an edge to it.

"Yes," I replied simply.

Why is helying? He could just say he came to pick me up.Always so roundabout. Taylor cleared his throat discreetly. "Sir, I believe we've been waiting for nearly thirty minutes." Thirty minutes? Adam had been waiting for me for half an hour? That didn't sound like "passing by" at all. Before I could dwell on this revelation. Frank appeared at my side,curiosity evident in his expression.

"Wait, isn't this the CEO of GT Group?" Frank said, recognition dawning in his eyes. "Stella, you two know each other?"

Adam's gaze shifted to Frank, instantly cooling several degrees."Who are you?"

I could feel the tension mounting between them, like storm clouds gathering before a downpour. "He's my friend, Frank." I said quickly."Frank, this is my-"

"Husband," Adam cut in before I could finish, his tone leaving no room for argument.

Frank's eyes widened in shock. "Husband? No, you must be joking!" His gaze darted between us. "Sir, I just saw tabloid reports about you and jewelry designer Grace Davis. AndStella," he reached for my left hand, examining my bare fingers,"doesn't wear a wedding ring."

I felt my stomach drop. Of all the topics to bring up, Frank had inadvertently chosen the most explosive one. Adam's eyes narrowed dangerously as Frank held my hand, examining it with exaggerated scrutiny. This is trouble. Frank mentioned Grace and noticed I'm not wearing a ring. Adam's definitely going to be furious. "See? No ring." Frank announced triumphantly. "Stella isn't married!"


Adam moved with lightning speed, snatching my hand away from Frank's grasp. "Let go of her!" he growled, his voice low and threatening.

Frank seemed oblivious to the danger. "Sir, are you one of Stella's suitors? I'm also pursuing Stella,and with your disrespectful behavior, you should withdraw from the competition! You-"

"Frank!" I interrupted frantically. "He really is my husband!"

Frank froze mid-sentence, his expression comical in its shock. "What? You're not joking?" His gaze darted between us. "But the rumors about him and Grace are really-"

"Frank," I cut in sharply, "I'm aware of those rumors. But he is indeed my husband."

Adam's grip on my hand tightened possessively. I tried to pull away, uncomfortable with the public display,but he only held on more firmly. His thumb brushed across my bare ring finger,and something like regret flashed briefly in his eyes. He never gave me a ring, so why is he concerned now? This man is so hard to understand.Frank studied our joined hands, then Adam's face,then mine. His expression shifted,becoming unexpectedly serious

"Suitor?" Adam repeated, his voice dangerously soft.

"Mr. Lancaster." Frank suddenly switched to a business-like tone,"I sincerely apologize! The truth is, Stella is actually my boss. I only claimed to be her suitor because I couldn't bear to see my beautiful employer deceived by some scoundrel... I'm not calling you a scoundrel, sir! Well, I did have my suspicions.11


I stared at Frank in disbelief. Frank's improvisation is amazing.I just hope Adam doesn't take it too seriously.

"Frank," I interjected, desperately trying to salvage the situation,"maybe we should reschedule our dinner for another day?"


Adam's expression remained stony. "Since you're my wife's subordinate, I'll treat you to dinner."

Oh no. Adam and Frank at the same dinner table was the last thing I needed right now.

Frank, sensing my discomfort, shook his head.′′I7m terribly sorry, Mr. Lancaster, but I must defer to Stella in this matter.She seems reluctant to continue with our dinner plans tonight."For a moment, no one spoke. The tension in the air was thick enough to cut with a knife. I just want to end this awkward encounter as quickly as possible.

Adam finally broke the silence. "Taylor, bring the car around."

As we drove through Manhattan's evening streets, the silence in the backseat was suffocating. Taylor kept his eyes firmly on the road, clearly uncomfortable with the tension radiating from us.

Adam finally spoke, his voice deceptively casual."Stella,that Frank is thirty-five years old."

I turned to face him, anger bubbling up inside me. "Adam, he's my friend! You can have rumors with Grace Davis, but I can't even have a male friend? I haven't questioned your actions,what gives you the right to monitor who I'm friends with?"

Finally, I can say what's been on my mind. Why can he freely associate with Grace while I can't even have a male friend?

Something flickered in Adam's eyes-surprise, perhaps."When did you learn about those rumors?"

"When you were in Toronto," I replied, turning to look out the window."Why didn't you ask me about them?" I let out a bitter laugh. "If I had asked, would you have told me the truth?"

Before he could respond. Adam leaned forward. "Taylor.pull over."


Taylor glanced uncertainly in the rearview mirror. "Sir?"

"Pull over." Adam repeated, his voice allowing no argument."Find something to do for an hour. Come back then."

Taylor's brow furrowed in concern, but he obediently guided the car to the curb. "Yes, sir."

An hour? What is he planning? I felt a wave of tension, but also a hint of anticipation.

Once we were alone. Adam turned to face me fully. "The media got it wrong. I attended her exhibition as a friend.nothing more."

"You went to Toronto to see her exhibition." I said.unable to keep the hurt from my voice. "Did you know your wife won an award that same day? Cyril congratulated me, but you didn't even know I'd won anything."

exhausted by the conversation.

"Then I'll accompany you to all your future award ceremonies."Adam said slowly. How I wished you were there that day, but you were applauding another woman instead."Grace," he said, his voice businesslike, "someone told me they saw a post on your Instagram showing a mask that was supposedly from me. Is that true?""I don't want to say. It doesn't matter now," I said,suddenly The sincerity in his voice made my eyes burn with unshed tears. I looked away, unwilling to let him see how much his words affected me.


Why does such a simple promise soften my heart? But what excuse will he have next time?


"And what about the mask?" I asked, my voice barely steady."You didn't have time to make a mask for me, but you had time to handcraft one for Grace Davis? I saw her Instagram post."

Adam's expression hardened. "I didn't give her that mask."

"'Made by ADAM," I quoted, the words bitter on my tongue."Do you think I can't read?"

Without hesitation, Adam pulled out his phone and dialed a number. After a few rings, a soft female voice answered.

"Adam? This is unexpected."
There was a brief pause. "Oh, that," Grace laughed lightly."I'm sorry. Adam. A friend with the same name as you gave me that mask. I didn't realize it would cause any confusion. If it's causing problems for you, I'd be happy to delete the post."

"Delete it," Adam said tersely.

"...Alright," Grace replied, her voice tinged with disappointment before the call ended.


The silence that followed was heavy with unspoken wvords.I stared at my hands, my thoughts in turmoil. The woman's voice was undeniably the same one who had answered Adam's phone when I called to share news of my award.

He confronted her so directly? And why did she sound so disappointed about deleting the post?
###Chapter 94

Stella's POV

I gazed out the window at the swiftly passing city lights, when suddenly a flash of green caught my eye.

I blinked in surprise. There, next to Adam, was a deep green hand-knitted scarf-the one I had gifted him, the one he had thrown into the trash during an argument.

Impossible. Did he really retrieve it from the trash? This didn't seem like something Adam would do.

Without hesitation, I reached for the scarf, the familiar texture confirming it was indeed the one I had given him. "You kept it?" I asked in astonishment, "I thought you had thrown it away."

Adam glanced at the scarf in my hand, his expression carefully composed. "Joseph rescued it."

"Joseph?" I examined the pattern on the scarf closely.

Stop pretending, Adam. Is it so difficult to admit that you retrieved it yourself? Why can't you acknowledge that you care about certain things?A hint of challenge flashed in Adam's eyes,"Perhaps Joseph bought it?" I turned the scarf over, "I knitted this myself. See this pattern?"I pointed to a intricate design at the edge of the scarf. "I hid your initials A.L. in it."


Adam's expression changed instantly, his eyes widening slightly.suddenly showing a new interest in the scarf. "You knitted this yourself?"

"Yes," under his gaze, I suaddenly felt a bit uncomfortable,"
What did you think? I bought it?"

I had spent weeks learning to knit, my fingers even blistered.

Adam remained silent, but I could see a subtle change in his expression-the softening of his eyes,the relaxation of his jawline. He reached out to take back the scarf, his fingers lightly brushing against mine.

"Give it back to me," his voice softer than before.

A mischievous thought suddenly crossed my mind. I pulled the scarf out of his reach, a playful smile playing on my lips. "Why? You already threw it away once, obviously you didn't like it."

Idiot,throwing it away once and now wanting it back.

"Stella..." his tone carried a warning, but not anger. Adam suddenly leaned in, pinning me against the car door, his face inches away from mine. The scarf was forgotten,his weight pressing down on me, the leather seat emitting a slight creak.


"Adam!" I gasped, the cramped space of the car suddenly feeling more suffocating. "What are you-"

A rare, genuine smile appeared on his lips, momentarily rendering me speechless.

Oh, he looks so handsome when he smiles. Like a completely different person. HIe can easily catch me off guard, it's so unfair.

This thought flashed through my mind, leaving me momentarily disoriented. Before I could regain my senses,Adam took advantage of my distraction and snatched the scarf back.


"Tell me," his voice lowered to that dangerous tone that always made my heart race, "why did you refuse to accompany me to the economic forum, but had time to have supper with James?"

The sudden change in topic caught me off guard. "I didn't refuse because of James-"

"Then why?" Adam narrowed his eyes slightly.

I sighed,suddenly tired of these constant misunderstandings." That night, James did a favor for Sam. The dinner was just a way to thank him."
Why are things always so complicated with him? I couldn't tell him about Victor, that would betray Sam's trust, but if I didn't explain, he would continue to think the worst.

Adam stared at my face for a long moment. "And what about the pearl hairpin James gave you? The one you wore at his mother's birthday party?"

"What about it?" I asked defensively, "You took it, remember?"

Oh, here we go again. This man's ability to hold a grudge is unmatched.


"You didn't ask for it back," he pointed out.

I rolled my eyes, "I thought you threw it away, just like the scarf."


"You seem to cherish James's gift," Adam said in a feigned casual tone.


"That's ironic coming from you," I retorted, "When Susan gave you that box of imported chocolates, I immediately saw through her intentions, so I took it. But James had no ulterior motives. We had just started to get along, hadn't even spoken before. These two situations are completely different." How can such a smart person be so dense? Susan practically threw herself at him with the chocolates, while my relationship with James is purely platonic. Adam's expression unexpectedly softened. He reached out and gently ruffled my hair, a gesture so unexpected and full of warmth that it momentarily made me forget my annoyance.

"Move," I weakly pushed at his chest, "You're crushing me."

Instead of moving away, Adam leaned in and kissed me, a decisive and swift kiss that stole my breath away. Before I could react, he had pulled back, leaving me blinking in surprise.

"What was that for?" I asked, my voice awkward and breathless.


"Do I need a reason?" he countered, his eyes gleaming with satisfaction at my reaction.

Steam filled the bathroom as I stood under the shower, letting the hot water wash away the day's stress. Just finished washing my hair, I heard the bathroom door open.

"Adam?" I called out, reaching for the towel next to me,"What's wrong?"

Instead of a response, I heard firm footsteps approaching the shower. When the glass door slid open, my heart skipped a beat as I saw Adam standing there in a perfectly tailored suit. "Adam!" I exclaimed, instinctively shielding myself with my arms, "I'm showering! What are you doing coming in?" Seriously? He had to choose this moment to come in?

His gaze roamed appreciatively over me. unashamedly admiring."I know you're showering," he replied calmly, "Why else would I come in?"


I tried to reach for the towel hanging outside the shower,but Adam intercepted my hand, pulling me into his embrace. The sudden movement caused my wet feet to slip on the marble floor, but Adam's arm securely wrapped around my waist kept me steady.

"I haven't finished," I protested weakly as his lips neared mine.This is ridiculous. His suit is getting soaked, and I'm covered in shampoo.

"It's okay," he whispered against my lips, the expensive suit quickly getting drenched in the mist, "We'll finish together."

His lips claimed mine in a kiss that made my bones melt, more effective than the steam in making me dizzy. I felt his hand glide over my wet back, the water still cascading down,leaving a trail of hot marks.

"You're suit," when he finally released my lips, I managed to say.
He casually removed his jacket and tossed it on the floor,unbuttoning his shirt one by one, revealing his sturdy chest. then his pants slid down, his hard, erect member exposed to the steam, thick and full of power
###Chapter 95

Stella's POV

He stepped into the shower, the water running over his head.cascading down his shoulders. He approached me, warm palms caressing my face, trailing down my neck to my shoulders.finally resting at my wwaist, pulling me tightly against him.

His lips pressed against mine, the kiss urgent and deep, his tongue delving into my mouth, entwining with mine, wet and teasing. My hands involuntarily roamed over his chest,feeling his pounding heart, then down to grasp his member, fingertips gliding over the scorching hardness, gently stroking, imagining the impact when it enters me.

He groaned softly, his hand moving to my buttocks, kneading the soft flesh, sending shivers of pleasure through me. I lifteda leg to wrap around his waist, and he pressed me against the cold tile wall, his slick member poised at my entrance, slowly entering. The fullness instantly hit me, and I moaned softly,the walls of mny vagina tightly wrapping around him. He began to thrust, his movements strong and rhythmic,each thrust deep and hitting my sensitive spots. The secretions flowed out along with his entry, mixing with the water.dripping on the tiles. My nipples rubbed against his chest, the pleasure building up layer by layer. I clung to him,nails digging into his back muscles, moans echoing in the steam, growing more and more out of control.

The steam blurred everything, leaving only our intertwined breaths and the intimate collisions.

After who knows how long, as Adam wrapped a towel around me, I felt a cool metal object slip into my fingers. Through the mist in the bathroom, I couldn't see what it was, but I heard Adam's low voice:

"Wedding ring, Mrs. Lancaster. Wear it well."

The next morning, sunlight streaming through the window woke me up. I lay there for a moment, fragments of last night's memories flashing through my mind. Adam's hands in the shower,the cold water not stopping us, and then... a ring?

Did he really give me a ring, or was I dreaming? We were both half asleep last night.

I slowly raised my right hand, taking a sharp breath. A delicate pink diamond sparkled on my ring finger,set in platinum or white gold, surrounded by smaller diamonds. The morning light shone on the diamond, casting rainbow reflections on the ceiling.

Oh my. This is... unbelievable. "You're awake." I looked up to see Adam coming out of the closet.already dressed. His gaze immediately fell on my hand, noticing that I had discovered the ring.


"Do you like it?" he asked casually, but I could hear the underlying uncertainty beneath.

"When did you... how did you get this..." I struggled to find the words. still mesmerized by the ring. "When did you buy this?"


He must have planned it. There's no way he just happened to have a perfectly sized ring for me.

Adam didn't answer, but instead walked to the side of the bed.kneeling down with his face level with mine. "Do you like it?"he repeated, his gaze focused on my face, leaning in to kiss me.

"I haven't brushed my teeth," I weakly protested, suddenly embarrassed about my morning breath.

Good answer, Stella. Really on top of things. He gives you a million-dollar ring, and you're worried about your breath.

A smile tugged at Adam's lips. "That's not my concern, Stella." I looked back at the ring, turning my finger to catch the light. "Yes," I admitted softly,′′]really like it." The look of satisfaction on Adam's face made it worth being honest. He leaned in for a quick kiss on my lips and then stood up.

"It's still early," he checked his watch, "Take a nap. I have meetings all morning."

As he turned to leave, I noticed the simple, classic ring on his left hand,perfectly complementing my more intricate ring. A strange warmth blossomed in my chest at the sight.

He's wearing a wedding ring too. When did that happen?

Adam paused at the door, looking back at me, his expression unreadable. He seemed to be pondering something, then took two steps back to the bed. Before I could react, he bent down to place a gentle kiss on my forehead.

"Good morning, Mrs. Lancaster," he said softly, then left,leaving me staring blankly at his retreating figure.

What's gotten into him? First the ring, now these displays of tenderness. It's like he's a different person. Did he plan to give me the ring all along?

The thought was both exciting and unsettling. I closed my eyes,feeling the weight of the ring on my finger, strange but not unwelcome. A firm knock on the door jolted me awake from my nap. The bright sunlight outside indicated it was late morning. "Come in," I called out, sitting up and quickly running my hands through my disheveled hair.

Joseph entered, his expression as solemn as ever,but I could sense a hint of concern in his eyes.


"Madam, the security report says there's a young man sitting outside the front gate for over an hour. They've asked him to leave multiple times, but he refuses. He also won't say who he's here to see."


I furrowed my brow, reaching for my robe. "How young?"

"A teenager, around sixteen or seventeen," Joseph replied, "The guards aren't sure whether to forcibly remove him or call the police."

"No, don't do that," I quickly said, slipping my feet into slippers,"Let me see who it is first."

Hastily changing into casual attire, I followed Joseph to the front gate of the estate. As we approached, I saw a small figure huddled on the ground outside.

The poor child looked frozen. Who would leave a teenager out in this weather? The security guard, a burly man in a neat uniform,visibly relaxed wwhen he saw us. "Mrs. Lancaster, he doesn't speak.doesn't move. We're not sure if he's deaf or mute." "I'm neither deaf nor mute, you idiot!" the boy retorted sharply.lifting his head at the accusation.


I blinked in surprise, recognizing him. Despite wearing jeans and a thin denim jacket, looking like any ordinary teenager.I recognized that face.

"One?" I asked incredulously.

Why would an internationally renowned gaming prodigy be sitting at our gate?

The boy's eyes widened slightly, then narrowed with suspicion."One is just my gaming ID," he muttered, "My real name is Eric Lancaster."

Did I hear that right? Is he related to Adam?

"Eric," I asked cautiously, "Are you Adam's cousin?"

Eric met my gaze, his eyes-a striking green similar to Adam's-a mix of defiance and vulnerability. "You."

Me? Not Adam? This was getting stranger by the minute.

Ten minutes later, I led Eric into the main house, settling him in the living room and offering him a cup of hot coffee.

"Wait here for a moment," I told him, "I need to make a phone call." I immediately dialed Adam's number.

"Hey. Adam," I said when he answered,"Is Eric your cousin?"

A brief pause. "Yes. Why the sudden interest in him?"

"He's here now, in the house," I explained, "He's been waiting outside the gate for over an hour. Why didn't he just call you?It's cold outside-he could catch a cold sitting out there for so long."

"It's fine," Adam replied coldly, "He won't die. Don't worry about him, I'll deal with it when I get back."

Wow. Even for Adam, that's too callous. What happened between these two?


His indifference in his tone surprised me.

"I'll stay with him until you get back," I said firmly, hanging up before Adam could object.
###Chapter 96

Stella's POV

When I returned to the living room. Eric was bent over his phone, fingers moving rapidly. He briefly looked up when I entered, then continued to focus on the device.

"So," I began, sitting on the sofa opposite him, "You're Adam's cousin?"


Eric nodded, not looking up.

"Do you live nearby?" I tried again.

"No," was his short reply.

I suppressed a sigh. Clearly, getting information from Eric would be as difficult as pulling teeth.

"Are you hungry?" I changed tactics,"It's almost lunchtime."

As soon as I mentioned food, Eric's head shot up, interest flashing in his eyes before quickly returning to an indifferent expression. "I could eat."

Ah,the universal language of teenagers: food. I smiled, recognizing the teenager beneath the aloof exterior."Let's go to the dining room, Joseph can prepare something for us." The dining room at the Lancaster estate was intimidatingly formal, the smooth mahogany table large enough to comfortably seat twenty.

"It's just us today," I said, gesturing for him to sit down, "No need to be too formal."


Joseph appeared, carrying two steaming plates of pasta,the rich aroma of garlic and herbs filling the air. Eric stared at the elegant presentation for a moment, then dove in with the enthusiasm of a hungry teenager. After finishing the first bowl,he visibly relaxed.

"Your table manners are impressive," I observed, "Better than most professional gamers I've seen."

Let him know I did my homework. Maybe it will help him open up.

"Do you follow esports?" he asked skeptically.

"Not really," I admitted, "But I looked up your profile while you were having coffee." Eric seemed to consider this, then nodded as if agreeing with my honesty. "Most adults either don't know what I do or think it's a waste of time." "Well, considering you're earning more in your teens than most people do in a decade. I'd say it's a legitimate profession."I replied with a smile.

A hint of a smile crossed Eric's face, then he returned his focus to the food.


After lunch, we returned to the living room. I had work to do-preparing a speech for my alma mater's anniversary celebration-while Eric continued to play on his phone. About twenty minutes later, I noticed him setting down his phone.curiously watching me.

"Adam won't be back until five or six," I looked up to him."You can watch TV or go to the game room, if you'd like."

"Game room?" Eric asked, suddenly perking up involuntarily.

I laughed. "At the end of the hallway, third door on the right.It probably has every gaming console model, I think. Adam doesn't use it much."


Eric hesitated for a moment, then shook his head. "I'll stay here. If that's okay."

"Of course," I replied, returning to my work.

"Is 'nurturing environment' too cliché?" I muttered to myself.deleting the phrase for the third time.

"Anything education-related is cliché," a bored voice replied from across the room. I looked up to see Eric Lancaster sprawled across the sofa,one leg dangling over the armrest while he scrolled through his phone.

"Then what would you suggest?" I asked, grateful for the distraction.


Eric shrugged without looking up from his phone. "I dunno.Just say something like, 'thanks for the student loans, now here's how I'm killing it in the real world."

I laughed despite myself. "I can't say that to a room full of professors and alumni donors."

"Why not? It's honest." He sat up suddenly, his eyes widening as he stared at his phone. "Whoa, sis-in-law,you're trending."

Trending? What now? "What do you mean?"

Eric swiped and tapped on his screen. "You know Frank? The designer?"

"Yes," I replied cautiously."Why?"

"My mom loves his designs." He glanced up at me with newfound interest. "If you know him, could you get her something? Like an autograph or whatever?"

"Sure, I could reach out to him if your mother would like something,"Isaid,surprised by the request."But how did you
know I know him?"

Eric snorted. "Pretty sure the entire internet knows by now."He turned his phone toward me, showing a social media page filled with video clips and photos.

I leaned forward to see the screen better. There I was, sitting in the central seat at Frank's show, and another clip of Frank answering the journalist's question

about why he had reserved the seat for me all these years.

"She is my benefactor, my muse, deserving of the throne at the cost of my honor," Frank's voice declared from the video.

Oh God, I didn't realize this had gone viral.

"You're quite the celebrity," Eric smirked, pulling his phone back and continuing to scroll. "Listen to this comment:Winston is not just beautiful,she's evidently

brilliant too. The way Frank speaks about her contributions to his career... she must be extraordinary."

I felt my cheeks warming. "They're exaggerating."

Eric laughed, a sound surprisingly similar to Adam's rare chuckles. "You know what people are calling you online?The annual ridiculous person representative."

"What?" I blinked, confused by the strange title. "Yeah," Eric nodded enthusiastically.′′One comment says: 'A stylist who can't dance is not a good stage designer.' But then others are defending you like: 'Winston excels at everything she does- styling, dancing, design... is there anything she can't do?It's hilarious!"


Eric continued gossiping. "By the way, are you blind or something? Why did you marry Adam?"

The question was so unexpected and direct that I nearly choked on my breath. "What?"

Eric looked at me with genuine curiosity. "Your husband...you know, my cousin? I'm just wondering what you saw in him."


"Your cousin isn't that bad..." I trailed off, not entirely convinced by my own words.

"Really?" Eric's expression was incredulous. "Before you married him, you probably didn't know his legs were fine,right? So from your perspective, he was a physically disabled man with a terrible temper. Sure, he's good-looking, but he has the emotional range of a brick wall! How does someone like you end up with someone like him?"

I stared at Eric, completely caught off guard by his blunt assessment. The worst part was that I couldn't entirely refute his logic. When we first married, I did think Adam was disabled.

"It's... complicated," I finally managed to say.

Eric snorted. "That's what people say when they don't have a good answer."
###Chapter 97

Stella's POV

Before I could respond, we heard the front door open and close. Eric immediately tensed, his posture straightening as footsteps approached the living room.

Adam appeared in the doorway, his expression unreadable as always.

"Why are you home so early?" Eric asked, his voice taking on a defensive edge.

Adam ignored the question, his green eyes sweeping over the room before settling on his cousin. "The family tutor will arrive tomorrow.You'll be studying in the guest house from now on."

Eric jumped to his feet. "What? No way! I have to train for the world championship!"

"And the SAT is in May," Adam replied coolly. "Will the world end by then? Or will the championship disappear?" His voice took on a sharper edge. "Do you want to be the only Lancaster with just a high school diploma, Eric?"

"I'm competing for our country, you old fossil!" Eric shot back,his face flushing with anger. "You don't understand anything about esports! Stella was supportive of my professional career,unlike you!" I winced as Eric dragged me into their argument. Adam's gaze flickered to me briefly before returning to his cousin.

"Your parents entrusted you to my care," Adam stated firmly. "If you don't study, you don't eat."

With that ultimatum delivered, Adam turned and headed upstairs. leaving a seething Eric behind. After a moment's hesitation, I decided to follow Adam, hoping to mediate the situation.


"Adam, wait," I called out, hurrying up the stairs after him.

He paused in the second-floor hallway, turning to face me."What is it?"


"That's your cousin," I said quietly, glancing back to make sure Eric couldn't hear us. "Not giving him food isn't right. He's seventeen- that's a crucial age for physical development."

"He won't starve to death after three days without food,"Adam replied dismissively.

"Adam," I persisted,"he's just a teenager. What good is it if he grows physically but not mentally?"

Adam's expression remained impassive. "Exactly my point,What's the use of just growing taller without developing his intellect?" I sighed, trying a different approach. "Let me talk to him.Maybe I can convince him to take his studies more seriously."

"No need," Adam said firmly. "Leave him be."

Before I could argue further, Adam took my hand and pulled me toward his study. He closed the door behind us,the sound of the lock clicking into place echoing in the quiet room.

"Adam,what are you-"

My question was cut short as he pressed his lips against mine,one hand sliding to the small of my back while the other cradled my face. The kiss was surprisingly gentle, his touch almost reverent.

When he finally pulled away, a rare smile played at the corners of his mouth. "Congratulations, Mrs. Lancaster. The youngest ever recipient of the YEAR Visual Gold Award."

I blinked up at him in surprise. "You... know about that?"

A flicker of something -possibly guilt - crossed his features."I asked Cyril."

"Let me go," I said, pushing lightly against his chest. "Your cousin is still downstairs!"

"He's not a child," Adam replied, his arms remaining firmly around my waist, "He understands." I rolled my eyes, though I couldn't suppress the warmth spreading through me at his proximity. "I should get back to work. I still need to finish the anniversary speech for my alma mater."


He leaned in for another kiss, and this time I didn't resist. For all his flaws - and Eric had enumerated quite a few - there was an undeniable magnetism to Adam Lancaster that I couldn't seem to escape. Or perhaps, if I was being honest with myself,didn't want to escape.

Half an hour later, I finally made my way back downstairs and found Eric still sprawled on the sofa, though his expression was considerably darker than before.

"That didn't take long," he remarked sarcastically as I entered the living room.

I felt heat rush to my cheeks. "I was trying to convince your cousin."

"Sure you were," Eric replied, his tone making it clear he didn't believe me. "And was he... persuaded?"

"I'm working on it," I said vaguely, taking a seat across from him, "Eric, why did you take a year off? You just won the national championship- it seems like an odd time to step away."

His expression clouded over. "It wasn't because of the SAT. It
was because Adam threatened to buy our team and run it into the ground if I didn't take a break!"

I blinked in surprise. That sounds like something Adam would do.


"The SAT is in May, still six months away," I reasoned. "You're only seventeen, so taking half a year off won't significantly impact your career. I checked - your team's current mid-laner has a wrist injury, but it's not serious. He's planning to retire next year for family reasons, so whether you join now or later doesn't make much difference."

Eric looked at me with newfound respect. "You know about esports?"

"I did some research," I admitted. "Since we're going to be living together for a while, I thought I should understand what you're passionate about."

"You're much nicer than Adam," Eric sighed,slumping further into the couch.

"If you agree with my assessment, why not spend six months preparing for the SAT?" I suggested. "Once the test is over,you can apply to colleges and then request a gap year. That way,you won't have to sacrifice either."

Eric snorted. "That would work if I could actually get into college. My SAT score is under 500."
I stared at him in disbelief. "Out of... 1400?"

"Yeah," he confirmed glumly. "I bombed it last time."

No wonder Adam is so insistent on the tutoring.

"Damn it! I'm just stupid, okay?" Eric suddenly exploded,throwing his hands up in frustration. "I want to pass too! If teachers won't give me the grades, what am I supposed to do?!”

His outburst caught me off guard. I'd been quietly watching him sulk for the past fifteen minutes, wondering what was going through his mind.

"Eric," I said gently, moving to sit across from him, "the world's top esports champion can't possibly have a bad brain. That's just not how it works."

Eric's green eyes-so similar to Adam's yet so much more expressive-flashed with a mix of anger and something deeper.Hurt,maybe.

"You don't know anything," he muttered, slumping further into the couch. "That bastard Adam was reciting Shakespeare when he was three. You know what I was doing at three? I couldn't even properly pronounce 'grandmother'!"

He ran his hands through his hair in frustration. "My entire childhood was spent feeling like an idiot next to him. That's my childhood trauma right there!"Wow. I knew Adam was brilliant, but reciting Shakespeare at three? That's a bit terrifying.

"Who are you calling a bastard?"

Adam's cool voice cut through the room. I turned to see him standing at the bottom of the stairs, his expression unreadable as always.

Eric completely ignored him, instead turning to me with renewed interest. "By the way, Ms.Stella, how did you do on your SAT?"

"I didn't take the SAT," I replied honestly.

Eric's face lit up with hope. "Really? See, Adam? Even Stella didn't-"


"I was accepted early to an Ivy League university during my sophomore year of high school," I added quickly, watching the hope drain from Eric's face.

Maybe I should have kept that to myself.

Eric's shoulders slumped in utter defeat. Goodbye! I don't deserve to be in this mansion! I could practically read the thought on his expressive face.

Later that evening,I watched from the window as Adam arranged for Eric to be moved to the guest house. A tutor hadalready been hired-supposedly the best in the country-and would arrive tomorrow morning. Two security guards stood nearby, clearly there to ensure Eric didn't try to escape during the night.

Adam's treating his own cousin like a prisoner. Poor kid just wants to play his games.
###Chapter 98

Stella's POV

"Don't you think you're being a bit harsh?" I asked Adam as we settled into his study. "Forcing him to study like this...what if he just gives up entirely?"

Adam didn't look up from his laptop. "If he doesn't get into college, he'll repeat the year. Professional gamers' careers are short-he can't afford to waste time."

"That's brutal!" I exclaimed, genuinely shocked by his cold approach.

"The alternative is worse," Adam replied simply.

I paced the room, unable to sit still. "But is this even realistic?He only has half a year, and his SAT score is only 1050... that s pretty far from Ivy League standards."

"He didn't study before, now he pays the price. That's life."Adam's tone was final, brooking no argument.

How can he be so unsympathetic? They're family!

I decided to change the subject. "By the way, I'm having dinner with Frank the day after tomorrow. I won't be home for dinner that night."

Adam finally looked up, his expression shifting subtly. He beckoned me over with a slight gesture of his hand.

What now? I thought, but found myself moving toward him anyway.

When I reached his chair, he unexpectedly pulled me onto his lap, his arm settling around my waist with casual possessiveness.

"Since when does the boss treat an employee to dinner?" he asked, his voice deceptively light.

I rolled my eyes. "Frank was just joking about me being his boss."

"So he's a suitor then?" Adam's fingers tightened slightly on my waist.

I bit my lip, struggling with how to explain my relationship with Frank. The truth was complicated-I'd been the primary investor in his studio years ago,

providing the capital he needed when no one else would take a chance on him.

"Actually," I admitted reluctantly, "Iam sort of his boss. I'm the majority shareholder in his studio."

Adam's eyebrow rose fractionally.11Goon.n

"I'm not really involved in day-to-day operations," I hastened to explain. "I just collect dividends. I've been gradually distributing shares over the years. Now I only hold about 45%.while Frank has 40%."

A hint of amusement flickered in Adam's eyes. "Owner of Rouge, majority shareholder in an international design studio...what other assets are you hiding from me, Miss Winston?"

I felt my cheeks warm. "That's it. It's nothing compared to what you have, Mr. Lancaster."

Adam reached up to pinch my cheek gently. "Flattery won't work on me."

"What do you want then?" I asked, genuinely confused by his reaction.

"Just curious," he said, his voice softening slightly. "I won't touch your little piggy bank."

Little piggy bank? My net worth is in the millions!

Two days later, I found myself at Frank's studio,ostensibly for a routine visit to "check on operations." The real reason, of course, was our dinner plans, but a CEO dropping by to inspect her investment was a much better cover story than two friends catching up.

"So," Frank said, leaning against his desk as I examined some fabric samples, "how's married life treating you? Is the mysterious Mr. Lancaster as terrifying at home as he is in public?"

I gave him a stern look. "It's basic professional ethics not to gossip about your boss's personal life, Frank."

Frank laughed,clearly not intimidated. "Fine, fine. But Stella, I really did hear those rumors about Grace and your husband.Don't take it to heart-most men aren't worth the trouble!"


"Frank, you're a man too," I reminded him with a raised eyebrow.

"Exactly why I've never married!" he replied with a theatrical flourish. "Speaking of which, is your husband upset about our dinner plans tonight?"

On the surface, I maintained a puizzled expression. "Why would he be upset?"

But inside, I couldn't help remembering Adam's stiff posture and the subtle tightening around his eyes when I mentioned tonight's plans.

"The way he looked at me that day," Frank continued, "was like I was some invader he wanted to deport from America! I'm glad he won't be joining us for dinner-I'd certainly suffer from indigestion!"

I couldn't help but laugh. "Are you being dramatic again?" This isn't dramatics." Frank insisted, his expression suddenly serious. "Tve never seen a man more jealous in my life!"

Jealous? Adam? That's... actually an interesting thought.

Before I could dwell on this new perspective. Frank's assistant knocked and entered the room.


"Sir, there's a woman outside claiming to be Miss Winston's mother,and she's asking to see you."

I felt my expression harden involuntarily,all warmth draining from my face.

Frank noticed immediately. "Stella, what's wrong? Is she an imposter?"

"No," I said quietly. " I don't know if you've heard the rumors.but while my last name is Winston, I'm not actually a Winston by blood. She is my adoptive mother."

Frank's face darkened with anger. "So she's the bloodsucker who raised you? You stay right here-I'll handle this."

From my position near the doorway of Frank's private office,I could see into the reception area where Anna and Lucy sat on a plush sofa, flipping through portfolios and discussing designs as if they owned the place.

Frank approached them with perfect professional courtesy,though I could see the tension in his shoulders.

"Madam, I understand you've been asking for me?"

Anna looked up. her face instantly transforming into a mask of maternal warmth. "Mr. Frank, hello! I'm Stella's mother, Anna.And this is my daughter, Lucy Winston! She's a very talented actress!"


Lucy barely managed a stiff"Hello, Mr. Frank."

I watched as Frank's eyes flicked between them,no doubt comparing Lucy's beauty to mine. I didn't need to hear his thoughts to know what he was thinking-Frank had always been brutally honest about his aesthetic judgments.

"What brings you here today, madam?" Frank asked, his tone perfectly professional.

Anna didn't hesitate. "We'd like to order several of your newest gowns, and my daughter Lucy has a red carpet event coming up. Would it be possible to provide something ready-made? We heard Stella is your benefactor, which is why we're bothering you with this request."

I noticed several clients in the waiting area exchanging glances at Anna's audacious demands, Frank's collections were notoriously exclusive, with waiting lists extending months for custom pieces, "Stella is indeed my benefactor," Frank confirmed, his voice carrying throughout the space. "She enjoys every privilege here."

Anna and Lucy exchanged smug smiles. basking in the envious glances from the other clients.

Frank's smile turned sharp. "However, she is her, and you are you. You stand on equal footing with all my other clients."

My heart swelled with appreciation for Frank's loyalty.

"In fact," his assistant chimed in with barely concealed satisfaction, "Ms. Lucy's team already contacted us about borrowing a dress for the red carpet. We declined."

Anna's face flushed an ugly red. "Mr. Frank, I am Stella 's mother!"


"Were," Frank corrected coldly, signaling for his assistant to take back the portfolio. "Mrs. Winston, from what I understand.since your biological daughter returned, you've made Stella's life quite difficult. Even before that, you weren't particularly kind to her."

He leaned in slightly, his voice dropping but still audible to those nearby. "The person who helped me was Stella, not the Winston family, and certainly not your daughter here. There is a term for people like you-'parasites,' isn't that right? It describes you perfectly." The other clients in the studio didn't bother hiding their amusement at Anna's public dressing down, several nodding in agreement with Frank's assessment.

"It's true," one elegant woman remarked loudly. "I've heard how they treated Stella. Absolutely shameful!"

Frank turned to the woman with a brilliant smile. "Madame,your appreciation for justice moves me. Please, allow my team to prioritize your order as thanks for your support."

Frank personally "escorted" Anna and Lucy to the door,his professional smile never wavering despite the daggers they were glaring at him-and by extension, at me.

As they reached the entrance, Anna suddenly froze, her expression transforming from humiliation to desperate hope.Following her gaze, I saw Adam sitting in his wheelchair just outside the studio door, Taylor standing attentively behind him.

What is he doing here? I wondered, feeling a mixture of surprise and-though I'd never admit it-pleasure.
###Chapter 99

Stella'POV

"Mr. Lancaster!" Anna exclaimed, her voice suddenly honey-sweet. "How fortunate to see you! You, of all people.understand the relationship between our family and Stella. I'm her mother, after all! Please, explain to Mr. Frank that we've never mistreated Stella!"

Adam regarded her with cool detachment. "The only person your family never mistreated is the one standing beside you.Mrs. Winston, you might find more sympathy from Brian.That would be more... realistic."

Anna's face turned ashen at the mention of Brian, and Lucy looked like she might burst into tears of frustration.Without another word, they hurried past Adam and into their waiting car.

Frank approached Adam cautiously. "Mr. Lancaster, what brings you here?"

"I'm here for Stella," Adam replied simply.

"But Stella and I have dinner plans tonight," Frank reminded him, looking increasingly uncomfortable.

Adam nodded once. "She's treating you. I'm paying. What would you like to eat, Mr.Frank?
Frank's expression was almost comical in its dismay. Oh God, I'm definitely going to have indigestion tonight!

Later that evening, Joseph brought us a late-night snack in the living room-a plate of artisanal cheeses, fresh fruit, and warm bread. As I reached for a grape, a mischievous thought crossed my mind.

"Adam," I began innocently, "Frank said you were jealous. Are you?"

Adam's hand paused mid-reach for a piece of cheese. "You're overthinking things."

"If you're not jealous," I pressed, watching his reaction carefully,
"then why do you keep criticizing my employee?"

"I'm merely encouraging you to manage your subordinates properly," he replied smoothly, though I noticed his jaw tighten slightly.

"But why focus on Frank specifically?" I tilted my head,enjoying this rare opportunity to see Adam on the defensive.

Out of the corner of my eye, I caught Joseph pressing his lips together, clearly struggling to maintain his professional composure.

"Stella," Adam's voice carried a warning note, "don't talk while eating." I set down my fork with exaggerated care. "I'm full now."

Adam's eyes met mine, and for a moment. I thought I detected a flicker of uncertainty-a rare sight in the always-composed Mr. Lancaster. Before he could respond. Joseph cleared his throat discreetly.

"Sir, I've received a message from the guest house. It seems young Master Eric has... driven away another tutor today."

Adam barely reacted to this news, simply nodding as if it was expected. "Find another one."

"Yes, sir. I've already begun the search for a suitable replacement," Joseph replied, his expression perfectly calm despite the unusual situation.

I raised an eyebrow at Adam. "That's it? Your cousin terrorizes yet another educator, and all you say is 'find another one'?"

Adam turned to me, his expression unreadable. "Eric has gone through five tutors in the past year. It's nothing new."

"Perhaps if you took a different approach-" I began,but my words were cut short as Adam suddenly rose from his seat and,before I could react, scooped me up into his arms.

"What are you doing?"I gasped, instinctively wrapping my arms around his neck to stabilize myself. "Put me down!" Adam ignored my protests, carrying me toward the grand staircase as if I weighed nothing. The household staff we passed along the way studiously averted their eyes,pretending not to notice their employer carrying his sputtering wife through the mansion.

"Put me down! Everyone is watching!" I hissed, mortified by the spectacle we were creating.

"I thought Mrs. Lancaster didn't mind being seen," Adam remarked dryly, climbing the stairs with ease despite his burden.


"That was all Frank's doing! Not me!" I protested,burying my face against his shoulder to hide my burning cheeks.

Joseph, the traitor, merely smiled faintly before turning away.

Once we reached our bedroom, Adam unceremoniously tossed me onto the plush bed. I bounced slightly on the mattress, my hair fanning out around me. Before I could recover my composure, Adam was already loosening his tie, his movements deliberate and unhurried as he began unfastening his cuff links.

"I was wrong! I shouldn't have said anything! Don't-don't do anything rash," I stammered, suddenly recognizing the dangerous glint in his eyes.

"I'm not being rash," he replied calmly, setting his cuff links on the dresser with meticulous precision. I scrambled to sit up, trying to regain some semblance of dignity. "Adam, Frank only said he doesn't want you at our next dinner because he's afraid you'll intimidate him into quitting! I was just teasing you! I didn't mean to imply anything!"

"If he quits, I'll find you a more talented designer," Adam said simply, approaching the bed with predatory grace.

I backed away until I hit the headboard. "Adam, I have the university anniversary ceremony tomorrow! You can't-you shouldn't-"


"That's not a problem," he interrupted, his voice dropping to that low timbre that always sent shivers down my spine. "The ceremony doesn't require evening wear."

His implication was clear, and I felt heat rush to my face-and other parts of my body I didn't want to acknowledge. Adam's eyes darkened as he watched my reaction, a satisfied smile playing at the corners of his mouth.

"You're impossible," I whispered, but there was no real conviction in my voice.

His only response was to reach for me, and despite my protests,I found myself leaning into his touch.

The harsh sunlight streaming through the curtains woke me far too early the next morning. I groaned, feeling the familiar ache of too little sleep in my limbs. It was only when I attempted to roll over that I realized Adam's arm was still draped possessively around my waist.

"Adam, you're such a pain," I muttered, reluctantly opening my eyes.

"Such a terrible morning mood," he remarked, already awake and looking frustratingly refreshed. How did he always manage to look so put-together, even first thing in the morning?

"Try sleeping at three and waking at seven," I grumbled,dragging myself out of bed and toward the bathroom.

As I caught sight of my reflection in the mirror, I froze. My neck was adorned with several unmistakable red marks, far too high to be concealed by any of the outfits I had planned for today's ceremony.

"You freak who doesn't need sleep!" I called out, rushing to the closet to find something-anything-with a high enough neckline.

"Sleep?" came Adam's amused voice from the bedroom. "The noun or the verb?"

I poked my head out of the closet to glare at himn. "The world should see what the CEO of GT Group is really like!"

Adam merely smiled, a rare full smile that momentarily distracted me from my irritation. "They'd be envious," he said simply, and despite myself, I felt a traitorous warmth bloom in my chest.

When I arrived at the university campus for the anniversary celebration, the entire place was packed with people. Alumni in expensive suits and dresses wandered around, showing off their promotions and catching up with old professors.

As I headed toward the auditorium, I spotted a familiar face that made my stomach drop. Brian was talking with some alumni near the entrance.

What the hell is he doing here? He didn't even go to this school.


Before I could figure out his angle, I noticed another unwelcome sight-Lucy,wearing university colors with a host badge pinned to her lapel, chatting with an event organizer.

Lucy as a host? You've got to be kidding me. She just started here.

The alarm bells in my head were deafening. Brian and Lucy both showing up couldn't be a coincidence. They were planning something.

Damn it. I should have known today wouldn't be simple.

I took my assigned seat near the stage, watching as the auditorium filled with distinguished graduates and faculty members. Everyone looked so proud and accomplished-I'd normally feel the same, if it weren't for the knot in my stomach warning me something was about to go wrong.

The university president welcomed everyone, then handed the microphone to the hosts-including Lucy, with her fake sweet voice that made me want to roll my eyes.

"Welcome,esteemed alumni, honored faculty, and distinguished guests," she chirped, her gaze landing on me with a barely concealed smirk.


Whatever you're planning, Lucy. I won't go down easily.

The ceremony proceeded smoothly enough. When they called my name, I walked to the podium with my head high.delivering my speech the way I'd practiced.

I'd just finished when a voice cut through the polite applause.

"I have a question for this particular alumna!" Brian stood up.his voice carrying through the auditorium. Everyone turned to look at him.

Shit. Here we go.
###Chapter 100

Stella'POV

"Today we've heard from seven alumni, each one an industry elite," Brian continued, practically oozing false concern, "except for Ms. Winston, who graduated just last year. Tell me,do you truly believe you deserve to be on this stage as an exemplary alumni speaker?"

The room went quiet. I could feel hundreds of eyes on me,waiting. Lucy stood at the side of the stage with a barely suppressed grin, clearly enjoying my predicament.

Deep breath, Stella. Don't let them see you sweat.

"First, I'd like to correct a point of misinformation," I said,keeping my voice steady despite wanting to tell Brian exactly where he could shove his question. "I completed my combined bachelor's and master's degrees through an accelerated program.
Before questioning someone's qualifications, it's important to have your facts straight."

A few people laughed, and I saw Brian's face twitch with surprise before he covered it with indignation.

That's right, asshole. I'm not the pushover you think I am.

"If you have specific concerns about my presence here today,I'd be happy to address them after the ceremony," I continued. maintaining my composure. "However. I don't believe it's appropriate to take up everyone's valuable time with personal inquiries."


Brian stepped into the aisle, not backing down. "A master's degree is still just a piece of paper! It proves nothing about real-world accomplishments! And waiting until after the ceremony?By then, who will still care whether you're worthy of this platform or not?"

Who does he think he is?

Before I could respond, there was a commotion at the back of the auditorium. People started murmuring and turning in their seats. A pathway cleared as a familiar figure in a wheelchair made his way toward the front-Adam, looking like he'd stepped out of a GQ magazine cover.

Adam? What the-I thought he had meetings all day!

The university president practically tripped over himself rushing to greet Adam. Whispers rippled through the crowd as people recognized the CEO of GT Group. The president guided Adam to a reserved seat in the front row, directly facing the stage.

"The alumni speaker still hasn't answered my question." Brian pressed,somehow emboldened by Adam's arrival. "Outstanding alumni representatives must have sufficient qualifications and
achievements. I'd like to hear your justification. Education is sacred and shouldn't be used as a stepping stone for capital or connections!"


Rich coming from someone who's never earned anything on his own merit.


The event coordinator approached the podium, visibly uncomfortable. "Perhaps we should move on with our program-"

"I believe we should address this matter now," Adam's voice cut through the room like a knife. "This concerns the reputation of both the alumni and the institution. Don't you agree,President?"

The university president looked like he'd rather be anywhere else. "Well, I... perhaps a brief clarification would be appropriate."

Great. Now everyone's going to think I'm only here because of Adam.


As the tension in the room thickened, a young man in a casual blazer suddenly stood up from the alumni section. He was tall with an athletie build, his dark hair neatly styled.

"President," he called out, "if I may, I'd like to take a moment to share some context about Ms. Winston's achievements with 
The president looked relieved. "Of course, Mr. Jones. Please proceed."

This Jones guy made his way to the stage. As he passed me,he gave me a reassuring smile. "Don't worry, I'll handle this," he murmured.


Who is this guy? Do I know him? I frantically searched my memory, but came up blank. I was sure I'd remember someone so confident.


"For those who don't know me, I'm Henry Jones, head of the Alumni Association's Recognition Committee," he addressed the audience. "We have a responsibility to identify and celebrate extraordinary graduates who bring honor to our institution."

He signaled to the tech booth. "If I could have the presentation,please?"

The screen behind the stage lit up with my university ID photo.

God, not that photo. I look like I haven't slept in a week.

"Stella Winston not only earned a combined bachelor's and master's degree but did so with the highest honors in her class,"Henry began, clicking through to a slide showing my academic transcripts. "She maintained a perfect GPA for six consecutive semesters and was unanimously selected for the Outstanding Graduate award." My jaw nearly dropped as he continued through a slideshow documenting achievements I'd never imagined anyone had tracked. Photos of me receiving various awards, copies of academic journal publications with my name, headlines from design competitions where I'd placed first.

How the hell did he get all this? Some of these photos I don't even have copies of!

"In addition to her academic excellence," Henry continued enthusiastically, "Ms. Winston has distinguished herself professionally by winning six international fashion design gold medals, the National Master Stylist championship, and-perhaps most impressively-becoming the youngest recipient of the Paris YEAR Visual Styling Gold Award in the competition's history."

The audience was buzzing now. I glanced at Lucy, whose smug smile had been replaced by a look of shock.

Not so cocky now,are we?

"For those in the fashion and design world," Henry added, "Ms.Winston is also known as the talent scout who discovered designer Frank Leclerc when his career was at risk of ending before it began. She was the creative force behind his groundbreaking 'Polar Night' collection, which fashion critics hailed as revolutionary." Seriously, who is this guy? Even I don't talk about my involvement with Frank's work that openly.

When Henry finished, the auditorium was silent. Brian was slinking toward the exit, his face red with humiliation. The faculty members were exchanging impressed glances. while students looked at me with newfound awe.

Well, this is awkward. Flattering, but awkward.

"I believe," Henry concluded with satisfaction, "this answers the question of why Ms. Winston was invited to speak today.Indeed, one might wonder why she wasn't featured more prominently in our program."

The audience erupted in applause. Several people stood up.and soon the entire auditorium was giving a standing ovation.

I stood frozen at the side of the stage, completely unprepared for this turn of events. When I glanced toward Adam, he wasn't looking at me-his gaze was fixed on Henry, his expression unreadable but his jaw tight.

That's Adam's "I'm not happy" face. Great.

Lucy stumbled forward to reclaim her hosting duties, but she was clearly rattled. "Th-thank you, Mr. Jones, for that...illuminating presentation," she stammered, fumbling with her notes. "We will now continue with our next alumni speaker...Dr. Jonathan Reynolds from the Class of 1998..." She tripped over several words, at one point announcing"nineteen-ninety-eighty" before hastily correcting herself. The event coordinator winced with each mistake.

Karma's a bitch, isn't it,Lucy?
