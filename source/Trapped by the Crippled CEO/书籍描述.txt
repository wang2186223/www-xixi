"No..." Gripping my hips, Adam pushed himself between my legs, I could feel his erection pushing into me. "I'm not ready." I tried to shove him back, but his lips just moved to my jaw, my body even reacting. Our breaths intertwine, his kisses along my neck, igniting an involuntary arch in my body. "Don't resist me." With that ,he pulled down my underwear, exposing my trembling breasts. When I felt him bite them, I squirmed it stung, but I felt his tongue glide over his bite mark soothing the pain. But he just pressed his hardness against my thighs, rubbing slowly, but not entering. I squirmed, look at him with a mix of shyness and frustration. "Why are you looking at me like that?" My cheeks flush instantly. "What do you want? Just say it." he commanded, looking into my eyes as I moaned. "I want you."I moaned breathlessly, feeling him go deeper and increase his rhythm. Oh, my God... so good. I, Stella Winston, seemed to have it all—beauty, a loving family, and a wealthy fiancé. But my perfect world shattered when my fiancé, Brian, and my sister, Lucy, betrayed me. I was compelled to become the substitute bride, marrying Adam Lancaster, a disabled man in exchange for care for my grandmother. Just when I thought all hope was lost, I discovered Adam was not at all like the rumors suggested.
