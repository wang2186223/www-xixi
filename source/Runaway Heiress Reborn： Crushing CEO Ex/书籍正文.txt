###Chapter 1

The clock had just struck nine when Isabella Sinclair's plane touched down in Salzburg.

It was her birthday.

As she switched on her phone, notifications flooded in—messages from colleagues, friends, even distant relatives.

But not a single one from her husband, Alexander Whitmore.

Her smile vanished.

By the time she reached the villa, it was past ten.

Margaret Dawson, the housekeeper, startled at the sight of her. "Mrs. Whitmore! You're here?"

"Where are Alexander and Sophia?" Isabella asked.

"Mr. Whitmore hasn't returned yet," Margaret replied. "And Miss Whitmore is in her room, playing."

Isabella handed off her luggage and climbed the stairs.

Sophia sat at her desk, absorbed in something, her small fingers working meticulously. She didn’t even glance up when the door opened.

"Sophia?"

The little girl turned, brightening. "Mom!"

Then she immediately went back to her task.

Isabella pulled her into a hug, pressing a kiss to her cheek. Sophia squirmed away.

"Mom, I'm busy."

It had been two months since Isabella last saw her daughter. The ache of missing her was unbearable. She wanted to talk, to hold her, to soak in every second.

But Sophia’s focus was unshakable.

"What are you making, sweetheart?"

"A shell necklace!" Sophia beamed, suddenly animated. "Victoria’s birthday is next week. Dad and I are making this for her. We polished every shell—aren’t they pretty?"

Isabella’s throat tightened.

Before she could speak, Sophia added, "Dad even got her a special custom gift. Tomorrow—"

A sharp pain lanced through Isabella’s chest.

"Sophia," she interrupted softly. "Do you know what today is?"

Sophia barely glanced up. "Huh? Mom, stop talking. You’re messing up my order—"

Isabella let go.

She stood there, waiting, but Sophia never looked back.

Finally, Isabella left without another word.

Downstairs, Margaret approached. "I called Mr. Whitmore. He said he’s busy tonight and asked you to rest."

Isabella nodded numbly.

Her fingers hovered over her phone. She dialed Alexander.

It rang endlessly before he answered, his voice indifferent. "I’m busy. We’ll talk tomorrow."

"Alexander, who is it?" Victoria Kensington’s voice cut in.

Isabella’s grip on the phone turned white-knuckled.

"Nothing important," Alexander replied.

The line went dead.

They hadn’t seen each other in months. She’d flown across the world, and he couldn’t spare five minutes.

This was their marriage—cold, distant, an afterthought.

She used to call again. Used to beg him to come home.

Not tonight.

The next morning, she tried once more.

Today was her actual birthday here.

She didn’t come just to see them. She’d hoped for one meal together. One moment where they felt like a family.

Alexander didn’t pick up.

A text arrived later: What is it?

Lunch today? All three of us? she typed.

Fine. Send the address.

No Happy Birthday. No acknowledgment.

She dressed mechanically, pausing at Sophia’s laughter drifting up the stairs.

"Aren’t you happy Mrs. Whitmore is here?" Margaret asked.

Sophia’s voice was light. "Dad and I promised Victoria we’d take her to the beach tomorrow. If Mom comes, it’ll be awkward. And she’s always so mean to Victoria—"

"Miss Whitmore, that’s your mother."

"I know. But Dad and I like Victoria more. Why can’t she be my mom instead?"

Isabella’s legs gave out.

She’d raised Sophia alone for years. Then Alexander took her abroad, and now—

Her daughter wished for another mother.

She repacked the gifts she’d brought.

When Margaret took Sophia out, Isabella wandered the city, hollow.

At noon, Alexander canceled. Something came up.

Of course.

She ended up outside The Grandeur, their old favorite restaurant.

And there they were—Alexander, Victoria, Sophia.

Victoria fed Sophia bites of her dessert. Alexander smiled at them like they were his entire world.

This was his something came up.

Her daughter. Her husband. Another woman.

Isabella turned away.

Back at the villa, she drafted divorce papers.

Alexander had been her dream since she was sixteen.

But dreams weren’t real.

She left the envelope with Margaret.

"To the airport," she told the driver.

The car pulled away.

She didn’t look back.
###Chapter 2

The clock struck nine when Alexander and Sophia finally arrived home.

Sophia dragged her feet, clutching the edge of Alexander's coat as she stepped out of the car. The thought of Isabella being inside made her reluctant to enter.

But Victoria had insisted—Isabella had come specifically to see them. If they didn’t return, she’d be heartbroken. Alexander had also pointed out that if they skipped tonight, Isabella might insist on joining their beach trip tomorrow.

With a sigh, Sophia gave in.

Still uneasy, she muttered under her breath, "Dad, what if Mom forces her way into our plans tomorrow?"

"She won’t," Alexander replied without hesitation.

In all their years of marriage, Isabella had always bent over backward to please him. She knew better than to push his boundaries. One firm word from him, and she’d back down.

Sophia relaxed. If Alexander said it wouldn’t happen, then it wouldn’t. Her mood lifted instantly. She skipped inside, announcing to Margaret, "I want to take a bath!"

"Of course, Miss Whitmore," Margaret replied. Then, remembering Isabella’s instructions, she handed Alexander an envelope. "Mr. Whitmore, Mrs. Whitmore left this for you."

Alexander took it absently. "Where is she?"

"She packed her things and returned to Salzburg this afternoon. Didn’t you know?" Margaret answered.

Alexander paused mid-step on the staircase. He turned, brows lifting slightly. "She left?"

"Yes."

Why would Isabella suddenly go back to Salzburg? He hadn’t given her a chance to explain, nor had he cared to ask. The news barely registered before he dismissed it.

Sophia blinked in surprise. A flicker of disappointment passed through her. She’d secretly hoped Isabella would at least be home when they returned—maybe help her finish polishing the seashells she’d collected.

Margaret hesitated, recalling Isabella’s tense expression. "Mr. Whitmore… Mrs. Whitmore seemed upset when she left. Almost angry."

"Angry?" The word echoed in Alexander’s mind.

Isabella had never shown anger toward him before. The idea was almost amusing. He smirked and brushed off Margaret’s concern before continuing upstairs.

In his room, he barely glanced at the envelope before tossing it aside when Victoria called. He left without another thought.

Hours later, the envelope slipped off the bed, forgotten on the floor.

Alexander didn’t return that night.

The next morning, Margaret found the envelope while cleaning. Assuming Alexander had already read it, she tucked it into a drawer.

Meanwhile, Isabella had arrived home and begun packing. After six years in this house, she had accumulated plenty—but she took only essentials: clothes, toiletries, and a few cherished books from her college days.

Alexander had always deposited money into separate accounts for her and Sophia. She’d never touched Sophia’s funds, but her own account had been drained over the years—not on herself, but on Alexander and Sophia. Clothes, gifts, anything to make them happy.

But lately, with them away, her spending had dwindled. Now, her account held over three million dollars.

A fortune to her, pocket change to Alexander.

She transferred every cent without hesitation, left both cards behind, and walked out without looking back.

Her apartment—bought years ago to help a struggling friend—was small but pristine. After a quick cleanup, it was ready.

Exhausted, she collapsed into bed by five.

Then, at 1:00 AM, an alarm blared.

Her heart lurched. For a disoriented moment, she didn’t understand why.

Then it hit her.

Seven AM in Salzburg. Breakfast time.

For months, she’d set this alarm to call Sophia. At first, Sophia had clung to her, homesick. But lately, the calls had grown shorter, colder.

The alarm wasn’t needed anymore.

With a bitter smile, Isabella deleted it and shut off her phone.

Meanwhile, Alexander and Sophia were finishing breakfast. He barely registered the absence of Isabella’s usual call.

Sophia, however, was thrilled. No call meant no forced conversation. She bolted for the door before Margaret could stop her.

"Ms. Whitmore, it’s early—"

But Sophia was already in the car, grinning.

The next morning, Isabella arrived at work and handed her resignation to Benjamin Hayes.

"I’m done."

###Chapter 3

Benjamin Hayes was one of Alexander Whitmore's personal secretaries. The moment he saw Isabella Sinclair's resignation letter, his eyebrows shot up in shock.

He belonged to the small circle at Whitmore Enterprises who knew about the complicated relationship between Isabella and Alexander.

Anyone who knew Alexander understood he didn't love Isabella. Their marriage had been cold from the start—he rarely came home, and when he did, it was with indifference.

Desperate to win his affection, Isabella had joined Whitmore Enterprises years ago.

Her initial goal had been to become his personal secretary, but Alexander had outright refused. Even when Arnold intervened, Alexander wouldn’t budge. In the end, she settled for a position in the secretarial department, becoming just another face among his many assistants.

At first, Benjamin had worried Isabella’s presence would cause chaos. But to his surprise, she never caused any trouble. Though she used her position to get closer to Alexander, she was always careful—never crossing boundaries, never overstepping.

Instead, she worked harder than anyone. She excelled in her role, hoping to earn Alexander’s respect. Through her pregnancy, childbirth, and every challenge, she followed company policies strictly, never asking for special treatment.

Over the years, she rose to lead the secretarial team. Benjamin had watched her devotion from the sidelines. He never imagined she’d resign one day. The idea of her willingly walking away seemed impossible.

Something must have happened between her and Alexander—something serious enough for her to leave now. Benjamin suspected Alexander had ordered her resignation.

Though he pitied her, his tone remained professional. "I’ve received your resignation. I’ll arrange for a replacement immediately."

"Alright." Isabella nodded and returned to her desk.

Later, during an online meeting with Alexander, Benjamin reported on company updates. As the call neared its end, he hesitated before mentioning the resignation.

"Mr. Whitmore, there’s one more thing—"

He had promised Isabella a quick transition, but he wanted to gauge Alexander’s reaction first. If Alexander wanted her gone immediately, he’d make it happen.

Then he remembered Alexander’s rule from the beginning—Isabella’s employment was to be handled like any other employee’s. No exceptions, no reports to him.

And true to his word, Alexander had never once asked about her.

Even when they crossed paths at work, he treated her like a stranger.

Years ago, when the team hesitated over promoting her, they had cautiously brought it up to Alexander.

He had scowled and snapped, "Handle it by the book. Don’t mention her to me again."

Now, seeing Benjamin hesitate, Alexander frowned. "What is it?"

Benjamin snapped back to the present. "Nothing, sir."

If Alexander already knew about the resignation and hadn’t mentioned it, then it clearly didn’t matter to him. Benjamin would proceed as usual.

The call ended.

"What’s on your mind?" A colleague nudged Isabella at lunch.

She blinked, then smiled faintly. "Nothing."

"Aren’t you calling Sophia today?"

"Not today."

Normally, she called Sophia twice daily—once in the morning, once at noon.

Her coworkers knew about the habit. What they didn’t know was that Sophia was Alexander’s daughter.

After work, Isabella stopped by the supermarket. She picked up groceries and a few potted plants before heading home.

That evening, she researched the upcoming tech exhibition online.

Then she made a call. "Reserve me a ticket for next month’s exhibition."

"Seriously?" The voice on the other end was icy. "The last two times I got you tickets, you didn’t show. Do you know how many people would kill for these?"

The annual tech exhibition was the industry’s biggest event. Tickets were near impossible to get.

Their company had limited slots, and every IT professional there fought for the chance to attend.

"If I don’t go this time," Isabella promised, "I’ll never ask again."

Silence. Then the line went dead.

She smiled. He’d agreed. What she hadn’t said was that she was planning her return.

Though she was a partner at her tech firm, she’d stepped back years ago for her marriage. Her absence had cost them opportunities, and her colleagues had been furious. They’d barely spoken since.

Now, she wanted back in—but she knew she’d been gone too long. She needed to catch up before making her move.

For the next few days, she focused on work by day and her own projects by night. She didn’t reach out to Sophia or Alexander. They didn’t contact her either.

She wasn’t surprised. For months, their communication had been one-sided. They only responded—never initiated.

Meanwhile, in Salzburg, Sophia had developed a new habit—calling Victoria Kensington first thing every morning.

That day, she called as usual. But within minutes, she burst into tears.

Victoria had delivered bad news. "I’m returning to the country soon."

Devastated, Sophia immediately called Alexander. "Dad, did you know about this?"

In his office, Alexander flipped through documents. "Yes."

"Since when?"

"A while."

"You’re horrible!" Sophia sobbed into her stuffed unicorn. "I don’t want her to leave! If she goes, I don’t want to stay here either! I want to go back too!"

Alexander’s voice was calm. "It’s already arranged."

Sophia sniffled. "What do you mean?"

"We’re leaving next week."
###Chapter 4
Sophia leapt from her bed, heart pounding. "Seriously?"

"Absolutely," Alexander confirmed.

"Then why didn't Victoria mention it earlier?"

"It was just finalized. She doesn't know yet."

Sophia's excitement bubbled over. "Dad, let's keep this from Victoria. Imagine her face when we surprise her back home!"

"Deal."

"You're amazing, Dad! Love you!"

After hanging up, Sophia twirled around her room, humming to herself.

Then her thoughts drifted to Isabella. For days, she'd avoided her calls—leaving early, keeping her phone off. The silence had been bliss.

But guilt crept in. What if Isabella was furious?

Yet, knowing Isabella, she'd never stay quiet if upset. She'd demand answers immediately.

Sophia's chest tightened with sudden longing. Before she could second-guess, she dialed Isabella's number.

The moment it connected, reality hit. Returning home meant seeing Victoria—but also Isabella's inevitable interference. Her joy dimmed.

Across time zones, Isabella stirred at midnight to her ringing phone. Sophia's name flashed. She reached for it—only for the call to drop.

Despite their strained relationship, worry gripped her. She redialed instantly.

Sophia saw the incoming call and turned away.

Panicked, Isabella contacted the villa's landline. Margaret answered. "Ms. Sinclair? Sophia's fine—asleep when I checked earlier. Let me verify."

Relief washed over Isabella. "Thank you."

Upstairs, Sophia brushed her teeth aggressively as Margaret entered. "Your mother was concerned. Everything alright?"

"Pocket dial," Sophia muttered, avoiding eye contact.

Margaret left, none the wiser.

Sophia exhaled sharply, resentment simmering.

Isabella, now wide awake, dragged herself to work exhausted the next morning.

Meanwhile, Alexander absentmindedly packed the forgotten divorce papers into his briefcase before their flight home.

"All set," he announced, ushering Sophia into the limo.

Isabella remained oblivious to their return.

Two weeks into solo living, Isabella relished her newfound peace. That Saturday, sunlight streamed through her curtains as she watered plants. The doorbell rang.

Abigail Winslow stood there with a basket. "Hope I'm not interrupting?"

"Not at all," Isabella smiled.

"Freshly baked goods—my small thanks for saving Charlotte from that dog last week."

"You're too kind."

After Abigail left, Isabella settled with coffee, scrolling through news of Trellis College's centennial. Alumni photos made her fingers tremble.

She could've been among them.

Impulsively, she drove to campus that evening.

As she wandered familiar halls, a voice called, "Isabella?"

At a nearby café, Nathaniel Graves poured her tea. "How have you been?"

Isabella traced the cup's rim. "Well... I'm getting divorced."

Nathaniel paused. "I'm sorry."

"What's next? Returning to the company?"

"I want to, but—"

"The team needs you," he urged. "You belong there."

Isabella bit her lip. Six years away from AI's rapid evolution—could she still lead?
###Chapter 5

Years had passed with barely any contact between Nathaniel and Isabella. Yet even in their few encounters, Nathaniel could see the change. The fiery, self-assured woman he once knew was gone.

He remembered the Isabella of old. Insecure? That word would never have described her. While he knew little about her marriage to Alexander, her current state was an open secret he'd somehow missed.

Nathaniel kept his suspicions to himself. Instead, he offered encouragement. "A setback doesn’t define you. Your talent still outshines most. If you still love this field, it’s never too late."

"Don’t forget—you were Professor Aldridge’s favorite student in his entire career."

Isabella smiled faintly. If the professor heard that, he’d scoff. "No choice but to pick the least terrible one," he’d say.

Thinking of her sharp-tongued mentor, her smile faded. "I saw the news. He’s back for the centennial. How is he?"

"Annoyed, mostly. By us—his eternally disappointing students—showing up uninvited," Nathaniel replied.

Isabella laughed, nostalgia washing over her. Those long nights drafting thesis papers under his scrutiny felt like another lifetime.

"Come back, Isabella," Nathaniel urged.

Her grip tightened around her cup. After a steadying breath, she nodded. "Alright."

AI had been her passion since childhood. But for love, she’d shelved that dream for seven years.

Catching up wouldn’t be easy. But she believed in hard work. It wasn’t too late.

"When?" Nathaniel asked.

"I need to wrap things up at my current job. It’ll take time."

"That’s fine. No rush."

As long as she returned, waiting a little longer didn’t matter.

Their conversation lingered until Nathaniel checked his watch. "I’m meeting an algorithm prodigy who just returned from abroad. Since you’re here, why not join us?"

Isabella shook her head. "I’d be out of place. Next time."

"Fair enough."

As Nathaniel left, Isabella spotted Victoria Whitmore approaching. Alexander’s sister. She’d seen her in headlines but never expected to cross paths here.

"Hello, Victoria."

No response. Just a frown. "What are you doing here?"

"Trellis’s centennial. I came to visit."

Had Isabella not mentioned it, Victoria might’ve forgotten she’d even graduated from Trellis. Today’s attendees were either current students or honored alumni.

What was a nobody like Isabella doing here?

As long as she didn’t embarrass the Whitmores, Victoria couldn’t care less.

"Benjamin misses your cooking," she said bluntly. "I’ll send him to your place tomorrow."

Benjamin, Victoria’s son, was a year older than Sophia. Between a crumbling marriage and demanding career, Victoria had little time for him. His rebellion had only worsened.

Learning he liked Isabella’s food, Victoria had been dumping him at her doorstep for years.

To the Whitmores, Isabella was invisible. Even Benjamin treated her like a servant.

Before, she’d endured it for Alexander. She’d bitten her tongue through every disrespectful remark.

Not anymore.

"Sorry, Victoria. I’m unavailable."

With her return to AI, every minute counted. After the divorce, the Whitmores would mean nothing to her.

Victoria blinked. Refusal? Isabella had always groveled for their approval.

She dismissed it—Isabella must have some "important" errand. Still, irritation prickled. "What could possibly be more important? Alexander and Sophia aren’t even with you."

Isabella’s lips twisted bitterly. Years of erasing herself for them, and this was her worth.

It stung, but she wouldn’t live like that again.

Before she could retort, a group descended. "Ms. Whitmore!"

Their eyes flicked to Isabella. "Who’s this?"

Victoria’s reply was ice. "A friend."

Their interest evaporated. One or two lingered on Isabella’s striking features, but the rest refocused on Victoria.

Once, the dismissal would’ve crushed her. Now? She couldn’t care less.

After Victoria left, Isabella grabbed her bag and walked away.

That night, Alexander’s flight landed at 10 PM. By the time they reached the estate, midnight approached.

Sophia was asleep in his arms. Passing the master bedroom, he noted the open door—and the darkness within.

After tucking Sophia in, he returned, flipping the light on. The bed was empty.

The butler, Richard, arrived with luggage.

"Where is she?" Alexander asked, loosening his tie.

"Mrs. Whitmore is on a business trip."

Richard hadn’t been home when Isabella left with her suitcase weeks ago. The staff assumed it was work-related.

Odd. Her trips rarely lasted more than a few days. This time? Over two weeks.

Alexander said nothing, his expression unreadable.
###Chapter 6

The morning sun cast long shadows across the corporate plaza when Isabella Sinclair collided with Alexander Whitmore in the lobby. Her breath hitched. She hadn't expected him back from Salzburg so soon.

Alexander's sharp gaze flickered with surprise before turning glacial. He strode past without acknowledgment, his tailored suit cutting an imposing silhouette against the marble floors.

Once, Isabella would've chased after him with sparkling eyes. Once, she'd have woven entire fantasies around such accidental meetings. Now, she merely noted the sharp angle of his jaw before looking away.

By the time the elevator doors closed behind him, she'd already calculated how soon she could file divorce papers.

Her keyboard clacked with renewed focus when Benjamin Hayes summoned her. "Two coffees for Mr. Whitmore's office. Immediately."

The request stung like salt on a fresh wound. She'd perfected her coffee craft for Alexander during those early, hopeful months of marriage. The way his shoulders relaxed after the first sip had been her private victory.

Now the silver carafe trembled in her grip as she approached his ajar office door.

Victoria Kensington's crimson nails were tangled in Alexander's hair when Isabella froze on the threshold. Their lips parted with audible wetness.

"Who permitted your entry?" Alexander's voice could've flash-frozen the Atlantic.

Isabella's knuckles whitened around the tray. "Your coffee, sir."

Daniel Prescott materialized beside her, dripping condescension. "Pathetic, Ms. Sinclair. Using coffee as an excuse to spy?"

The scalding liquid sloshed over her fingers as she turned. Alexander's final dagger followed her out: "Repeat this, and you're terminated."

Victoria's simpering voice chased her down the hall. "Don't be cross, darling. She's clearly still obsessed with you."

In the staff kitchen, Isabella watched her reflection distort in the swirling drain. The burn cream in her purse—originally packed for Sophia's scraped knees—now soothed her blistered skin.

Gossip slithered through cubicles like vipers:

"—Whitmore's heiress girlfriend touring the executive floor—"

"—dressed in head-to-toe Valentino—"

Isabella silenced them by standing. The elevator doors parted to reveal Victoria holding court with four fawning VPs.

"Your company's infrastructure is impressive," Victoria purred, examining her manicure. The managers practically genuflected. "Naturally, Ms. Kensington! Given your... special relationship with our CEO."

Their sycophantic grins curdled when Isabella stepped forward. One VP actually shielded Victoria. "Watch your step! You nearly bumped into the future Mrs. Whitmore!"

Victoria's smirk could've powered a frostbite epidemic. Isabella walked past without breaking stride, her heels clicking like a countdown to freedom.
###Chapter 7

The two coworkers beside Isabella Sinclair stole glances at Victoria Kensington before hastily retreating, pressing themselves against the elevator wall.

Victoria noticed Isabella but immediately averted her gaze. Her expression remained cold, as if Isabella didn’t exist. She stepped into the elevator, flanked by executives.

As the doors slid shut, Isabella’s colleagues exhaled in relief before resuming their hushed gossip.

"That must be Mr. Whitmore’s girlfriend, right? She’s absolutely breathtaking! Just look at her designer ensemble—must’ve cost a fortune. No surprise, coming from a wealthy family. She carries herself like royalty. Compared to us commoners, she’s in a league of her own!"

"Absolutely!"

They turned to Isabella, whispering, "What do you think, Isabella?"

Lowering her lashes, Isabella replied softly, "Yes, you’re right."

Victoria was, in truth, the illegitimate daughter of Reginald Kensington—Isabella’s biological father.

Though "illegitimate" wasn’t entirely accurate anymore.

When Isabella was eight, Reginald had refused to let Victoria and her mother suffer any longer. He’d demanded a divorce from Isabella’s mother, Evelyn Sinclair, to marry Victoria’s mother.

After the split, Isabella lived with the emotionally fragile Evelyn under the care of her grandmother, Margaret Sinclair, and her uncle, Charles Sinclair.

Over the years, Charles’ business had declined while the Kensington empire flourished.

Rumor had it that to compensate for Victoria’s difficult childhood, Reginald spared no expense in spoiling her. She wanted for nothing.

And Victoria hadn’t disappointed. She’d thrived.

The once-illegitimate Victoria had transformed into the legitimate heiress, exuding a sophistication that even surpassed Isabella’s in her prime.

Isabella had assumed this would be her only encounter with Victoria. Fate, however, had other plans.

She and Alexander Whitmore had grown up together. Yet no matter how hard she tried, he never truly saw her. From the moment he met Victoria, he was utterly smitten.

"Are you okay, Isabella?"

Her colleagues frowned at her pale complexion.

Shaking off her thoughts, Isabella murmured, "I’m fine."

She and Alexander would soon be divorced. Who he loved no longer concerned her.

That evening, Isabella worked late, wrapping up just before nine. As she finished, her phone buzzed. Her best friend, Emily Donovan, was drunk and needed a ride from The Grandeur.

Grabbing her keys, Isabella left the office.

Twenty minutes later, she arrived.

Approaching the entrance, she spotted a little girl emerging from the parking lot. The child’s profile made her freeze—Sophia!

Why was she back? She should’ve been at school in Salzburg. Had Alexander brought her home?

Though she lacked access to confidential company files, Isabella knew Alexander’s Salzburg project was ongoing. She’d assumed his return was temporary.

Seeing Sophia meant they’d been back at least a day. Yet the girl hadn’t called.

Clutching her bag, Isabella watched Sophia skip cheerfully before following silently.

As they rounded the lobby corner, Victoria appeared down the hall, flanked by Alexander’s friends. Isabella ducked behind a potted plant.

From her hiding spot, she heard Sophia squeal, "Victoria!" before launching herself into the woman’s arms.

Isabella sank onto a nearby couch, concealed by the high backrest.

"Oh! I didn’t know you were back!" Victoria exclaimed.

"Of course! Dad and I missed you!" Sophia beamed. "We came back early for your birthday! We made this for you—happy birthday!"

"You and Alexander made this? It’s incredible! Thank you!" Victoria gushed.

"I’m just glad you like it." Sophia nuzzled her affectionately. "I missed you so much! Calling every day wasn’t enough—"

"I missed you too, sweetheart."

Footsteps approached.

Isabella stiffened. She didn’t need to look—she knew that measured stride anywhere.

After nearly seven years of marriage, waiting nightly for his return, she could recognize Alexander’s footsteps blindfolded. Steady. Unhurried. Just like him.

With family, he remained composed. Unshakable. Or so she’d thought—until Victoria.

"Dad!" Sophia chirped.

Alexander’s friends greeted him. He acknowledged them briefly before murmuring to Victoria, "Happy birthday."

"Thank you," she replied.

"Dad, where’s Victoria’s other gift? Give it to her!" Sophia urged.

The group fell silent until one friend chuckled, pinching Sophia’s cheek. "That’s your dad’s private gift. He’ll give it later. Don’t interfere."

The others laughed knowingly.

Alexander said, "I already did."

"What? When?" Sophia pouted. "You saw her without me again, didn’t you?"

More laughter. Isabella recalled Victoria’s visit to Whitmore Group earlier. That must’ve been when he gave it.

Victoria blushed. "Let’s go upstairs."

As their footsteps faded, Isabella sat paralyzed, her chest burning. Forcing composure, she slipped into the elevator to retrieve Emily.

Emily’s private room happened to be on the same floor as Victoria and Alexander’s gathering.

As Isabella helped her friend into the elevator, one of Alexander’s companions—Oliver Westbrook—suddenly froze.
###Chapter 8

"Something wrong?" Oliver asked, noticing Alexander's sudden pause.

Alexander's gaze lingered near the restaurant entrance. "Thought I recognized someone."

His companions knew all about Isabella's unrequited love for Alexander. They'd grown up witnessing it firsthand.

Objectively speaking, Isabella possessed delicate beauty. But her quiet demeanor made her fade into the background. Exactly the type Alexander would never notice.

Since Alexander kept his distance, they'd adopted the same attitude. Their encounters with Isabella had been few and far between, rarely warranting more than cursory nods.

Truthfully, Oliver couldn't recall Isabella's features clearly. He wasn't even certain it had been her. Not that it mattered either way.

Shrugging, he followed Alexander back to their private room.

Isabella remained oblivious to their presence.

After leaving The Grandeur, she took Emily home and stayed overnight to care for her.

When Emily awoke to find Isabella still there, she threw her arms around her. "You're an angel! I owe you dinner!" Breakfast already waited on the table. Isabella gently nudged her. "Go freshen up before it gets cold." Emily clung tighter, nuzzling against her. "You're so warm and smell amazing. Best hug ever!"

Isabella blinked, momentarily speechless.

Returning from the bathroom, Emily gaped at the spread Isabella had prepared. Whoever married this woman would hit the jackpot, she thought.

Then she remembered Alexander. Biting her tongue, she kept the thought to herself.

As Emily ate, she scrolled through her phone. Suddenly, her fork clattered against the plate. "Is Alexander back in Salzburg?"

Isabella nodded.

Emily turned her phone around. Oliver's social media post displayed photos from last night's gathering.

"Happy birthday to the stunning Victoria!" read the caption.

Though celebrating Victoria's birthday, five of the nine photos prominently featured Alexander. One particularly intimate shot showed them jointly cutting a cake, hands overlapping on the same crystal knife handle.

Sophia was conspicuously absent from all pictures—likely to prevent Eleanor Whitmore from discovering the gathering. Eleanor, being close to Margaret, had never approved of Victoria due to past conflicts between Evelyn and Victoria's mother.

To any outsider, the photos screamed couple goals. Clearly, Alexander had orchestrated an elaborate celebration for Victoria.

Remembering how he'd ignored her own birthday weeks prior, Isabella looked away.

"Isa—" Emily began worriedly.

"It's fine." Isabella handed back the phone. "Their relationship doesn't concern me anymore. I've already filed for divorce."

"What?" Emily nearly choked. "You initiated it?"

"Yes."

Emily had once admired Alexander. His accomplishments bordered on mythical—college at thirteen, multiple successful startups before twenty, effortlessly elevating Fleming Group while expanding his empire across industries.

In their circles, Alexander commanded universal respect. His striking looks didn't hurt either. No wonder Isabella—a prodigy herself—had fallen for him. But Alexander showed zero mercy to those he disregarded.

After years watching him dismiss Isabella's devotion, Emily's admiration had curdled into disdain.

She'd often urged Isabella to leave him, only to be met with silent refusal. That Isabella would now take this step...

Pushing her plate aside, Emily searched her friend's face. "What happened?"

For Isabella to walk away after so many years, something seismic must have occurred.

After a pause, Isabella replied, "Nothing dramatic. Just... accumulated too many disappointments. Time to move on."

Emily knew that tone. Once Isabella decided, she wouldn't backtrack—even if her heart hadn't fully let go.

She pulled Isabella into a hug. "You're doing the right thing."

After breakfast, Isabella headed to work.

Previously, they'd worked in the same building while meticulously avoiding each other. Months could pass without crossing paths.

Now, having moved out, she'd encountered him twice in two days.

Today, Alexander looked as impeccably handsome as ever. His expression frosted over upon seeing her. Just like yesterday, his gaze slid right past her.

"Mr. Whitmore," she murmured, eyes downcast.

Only after he'd passed did she enter. Whether Victoria would visit today didn't concern her. She buried herself in work.

At noon, Margaret called. "Someone sent Salzburg lamb. Come for dinner—I'm having them prepare a feast."

Warmth spread through Isabella at Margaret's kindness. "I'll come after work."

She didn't see Alexander again until leaving time.

Daniel intercepted her with a file. "This needs immediate attention."

Isabella scanned it. Not truly urgent. Previously, she'd have smiled and accepted, eager to prove herself. Not anymore. Especially after Daniel's baseless accusation yesterday.

Coolly meeting his gaze, she said, "Not now. My workday's over."
###Chapter 9

Alexander's face darkened as he accused Isabella of abusing her position. "This isn't the professional attitude expected of you, Ms. Sinclair. Do you think this is acceptable behavior?"

Isabella picked up her bag, unfazed. "If you're unhappy, you're welcome to terminate my employment immediately."

"You—" Alexander began, though he knew she had already submitted her resignation.

Despite having Alexander's trust, the company wasn't his to command. He couldn't fire her on the spot.

Besides, Eleanor favored Isabella. If she complained to Whitmore Manor, Alexander knew he wouldn’t escape unscathed, even with Alexander’s backing.

Without waiting for a response, Isabella walked past him and left.

Alexander's face flushed with anger as he stormed out of the office.

Benjamin noticed his sour expression. "What happened?"

Alexander recounted the exchange.

Benjamin frowned. He had worked closely with Isabella and knew her character well. "That doesn’t sound like her. Are you sure there wasn’t a misunderstanding?"

"No misunderstanding," Alexander snapped. "She’s clearly exploiting her position. She’s not the person you think she is."

Benjamin hesitated. "Maybe she’s acting out because she’s already resigned?"

But Isabella had been as diligent as ever lately, showing no signs of change.

Just then, Alexander approached. "What’s going on?"

"Ms. Sinclair left without completing her tasks," Alexander reported.

"If you’re dissatisfied, terminate her employment according to company protocol," Alexander said coldly, uninterested.

Benjamin and Daniel exchanged glances, surprised. Alexander’s indifference wasn’t shocking—he had always been detached regarding Isabella.

What caught them off guard was his apparent unawareness that she had already resigned. Hadn’t he been the one who wanted her gone? Had they misread the situation?

Before they could speak further, Alexander’s phone rang—Victoria was calling.

Without a backward glance, he walked toward the elevator. "I’m leaving now. I’ll be there soon."

Benjamin and Daniel watched him go, puzzled.

"Maybe he forgot?" Benjamin suggested.

"Possible," Daniel agreed. After all, Alexander had never shown much concern for Isabella’s affairs.

Meanwhile, Isabella was on her way to Margaret’s house.

Sophia had always been close to Margaret. Whenever she visited, Isabella would bring her along.

But since returning, Sophia hadn’t called once. Instead, she constantly reached out to Victoria, missing her after just days apart.

Because of this, Isabella saw no reason to force Sophia to come. Besides, Margaret would be heartbroken if she knew how attached Sophia had become to Victoria.

So Isabella went alone.

Traffic was heavy, and by the time she arrived, it was past six.

Margaret’s face brightened when she saw her, but her expression darkened as she cupped Isabella’s face. "You’ve lost weight."

Isabella lowered her gaze. "Work has been busy."

Margaret sighed. "No matter how busy, you must eat properly."

"I will, Granny," Isabella promised.

She leaned against Margaret, soaking in her warmth.

When the lamb stew was nearly ready, Margaret instructed the staff to serve Isabella a bowl to warm her up. Listening to her grandmother’s kind words, Isabella felt tears prick her eyes, thinking of everything that had happened.

Afraid of worrying her, she quickly composed herself. "Are Aunt Caroline and the others still traveling?"

"Yes. They decided to extend their trip another week," Margaret replied.

"And Uncle Charles? Another business dinner tonight?"

"When he heard you were coming, he canceled his plans. He should be back soon."

As if on cue, Charles walked in, smiling. "Isabella, you’re here!" Then, frowning, he added, "You’ve lost weight. Haven’t you been eating?"

Isabella laughed softly. "Just busy. I’ll eat more tonight, I promise."

Satisfied, Charles piled meat onto her plate during dinner. Though he commented on her weight loss, Isabella noticed he looked exhausted too.

Though she didn’t work at Sinclair Corp, she knew it was struggling. Charles had been overwhelmed, unable to pull the business back from the brink.

Over the years, several projects could have been saved with Alexander’s help. Except for Eleanor’s intervention twice, he had done nothing.

Isabella bitterly thought that if not for Eleanor, Alexander might have actively sabotaged Sinclair Corp, given his misconceptions about her.

The thought made the lamb stew in her mouth turn bland.

Charles had never pressured her to ask Alexander for help, even when the family desperately needed it.

After dinner, while Margaret dozed off, Isabella handed Charles a bank card with seven million dollars.

"Charles, there’s no need—"

"It’s not much use to me." She pressed the card into his hand firmly. "This is all I can do for now."

Though brilliant in academics and research, she knew she wasn’t cut out for business.

Thankfully, her early AI work had earned her patents, and the tech company she co-founded with Nathaniel provided annual dividends. Even without lifting a finger, she received tens of millions each year.

Charles looked ashamed. "You’ve already given so much, yet the company..."

It was barely surviving.

"I’m the one who’s failed," he muttered.

"Transitioning a business takes time and resources. Don’t blame yourself," Isabella reassured. She recalled Nathaniel’s words during their recent meeting—had she not left to marry, their company might already be worth hundreds of billions, leading the industry.

There was still room to grow. He hoped she’d return soon.

If she could regain her former skills and help the company thrive, she’d be in a better position to support her family.

By the time Alexander returned home, it was past ten.

Sophia rubbed her eyes sleepily. "You’re finally back, Dad."

"Yeah. Go to bed if you’re tired."

"Okay. Goodnight."

"Goodnight."

After Sophia went upstairs, Alexander drank the water Richard handed him and headed up.

The master bedroom was dark, seemingly empty.

He paused, then turned on the light.

No one was there.
###Chapter 10

Alexander didn't dwell on it. He figured Isabella had returned to the Sinclair estate.

Stepping into the shower, it struck him that Isabella always took Sophia along when visiting Margaret. This time, she hadn't.

Had she gone somewhere else?

Maybe an emergency had come up at the Sinclair residence. Daniel's earlier comments flashed through his mind, cementing his suspicions.

Alexander hesitated briefly before shaking it off. Not his concern.

At breakfast the next morning, Alexander informed Sophia, "Your school registration is complete. Classes start tomorrow."

"Got it." Sophia wrinkled her nose. "Will you drive me tomorrow, Dad?"

"Can't promise that."

"Fine." Her eyes sparkled. "I'll ask Victoria to take me."

Before Alexander could respond, his phone rang. Eleanor Whitmore was calling.

"Back in the country, I hear?" came Eleanor's voice.

"Yes."

"Did Sophia come with you?"

"She did."

"I haven't seen my great-granddaughter in ages. Bring her and Isabella for dinner tonight."

"Will do."

Eleanor pressed, "Where's Isabella? Put her on."

"She's not here."

"At this hour? Where is she?"

"Likely at the Sinclair residence."

"'Likely'? You're her husband and you don't know?"

Silence.

"Oh, Alexander." A heavy sigh. "You're impossible."

Alexander's tone softened slightly as he deflected. "Had lunch yet?"

"Your nonsense is enough to kill my appetite!"

A quiet chuckle escaped him as he continued eating.

Eleanor knew pushing Alexander was futile. His marriage to Isabella was already a major compromise for someone of his stubborn nature. There were limits to how much even she could pressure him.

"Fine," she sighed. "I've said my piece, you obstinate mule."

"See you tonight."

"You— Ugh!" The line went dead.

Sophia, who'd been half-listening, perked up. "Who was that, Dad?"

"Your great-grandmother."

Remembering the dinner plans, he added, "She wants us over tonight."

Sophia brightened. "Perfect! I've missed Nana so much!"

Alexander glanced at his phone without comment.

Meanwhile, Isabella was finishing breakfast at the Sinclair estate when Alexander's call came through.

She froze. Unlike before, his name on her screen no longer sparked joy.

After a beat, she answered. "Hello?"

"Grandmother wants us at Whitmore Manor tonight," Alexander stated.

"Understood," Isabella agreed.

"Pick up Sophia on your way," he added.

Isabella had no desire to return to his house. Even if she did, Sophia wouldn't be thrilled to see her.

Why subject herself to that?

"Have the chauffeur bring her," she countered. "I'll drive separately after work."

During rush hour, this made practical sense.

Yet Isabella had always insisted on personally handling Sophia's transportation before. Her detached response gave Alexander pause.

Still, it was trivial. "Fine," he said, hanging up.

This time, Sophia recognized the caller. "Was that Mom?"

"Yes."

"So she's coming to Nana's tonight?"

"Yes."

Sophia's face clouded briefly before smoothing. It wasn't that she didn't miss Isabella—she hadn't seen her in weeks, and this was the longest they'd gone without contact.

The thought tugged at her heart. But Isabella's return meant less time with Victoria.

Learning Isabella was away on business after their return had delighted Sophia—more Victoria time.

Now that arrangement would end. Her mood soured.

She'd already secured Victoria's promise to take her to school tomorrow. What now?

"Dad," she ventured.

"Yes?"

While Isabella could handle school drop-off, Sophia was determined to attend Victoria's racing championship tomorrow night.

Clutching Alexander's arm, she pleaded, "You promised to take me to Victoria's race tomorrow. Mom won't allow it. Don't tell her? If she asks, make something up?"

"Fine."

Reassured, Sophia brightened slightly.

After breakfast, Alexander left for work.

Isabella arrived at Whitmore Group that morning without crossing paths with him.

At noon, Margaret invited her to lunch at The Grandeur. Since it was nearby, Isabella agreed.

Approaching the entrance, familiar voices made her freeze.

"Alexander, without your help, I'd never have landed this contract. My deepest gratitude."

Her father, Reginald.

Alexander's unusually warm reply followed: "Think nothing of it, Mr. Kensington."

Isabella's fists clenched. That tone was reserved for people he valued—and she knew his regard for Reginald had nothing to do with her.

Not after Reginald had divorced Evelyn, cutting ties with Isabella entirely. These days, he only acknowledged Victoria as his daughter.

Sure enough, Reginald continued, "Victoria's alone here. Her mother and I worry. Please look after her."
###Chapter 11

Isabella found the entire situation utterly ridiculous as she listened.

Alexander and Victoria had only met after her marriage to him. So Victoria was fully aware of their relationship. There was no way Reginald didn't know Alexander was her husband. He must have known all along.

Yet he shamelessly encouraged a relationship between Victoria and Alexander. It showed how little regard Reginald had for her, despite being his daughter too.

Alexander agreed to Reginald's request.

They exchanged a few more pleasantries. Isabella watched as Alexander waited for Reginald to get into his car and leave before driving off himself.

Given Alexander's status, he rarely showed such courtesy except to select elders of the Whitmore family. Clearly, he held Reginald in high esteem because he was Victoria's father.

Isabella remembered how Alexander had treated Charles and Margaret. His attitude had always been cold and distant. Even when she carefully mentioned Charles's past difficulties, he had refused to help.

Yet for those Victoria cared about, his attitude was completely different.

The way he treated her compared to Victoria was night and day. This was the stark difference between love and indifference.

After Alexander left, Isabella remained standing there for a long time before finally entering The Grandeur.

That evening, after work, Isabella went home to collect the gifts she'd prepared for the Whitmore elders. Then she drove to Whitmore Manor.

Located on the capital's outskirts, Whitmore Manor was surrounded by lush mountains and peaceful scenery - perfect for the elderly. The only downside was its distance from downtown.

The drive took Isabella ninety minutes.

As she parked and gathered the gifts, she heard Sophia's cheerful laughter from inside.

Eleanor sat near the entrance. She spotted Isabella immediately and beamed. "You're finally here, dear. Come sit with me."

While Eleanor greeted her warmly, Catherine Whitmore's reaction was quite different. Victoria and Nicholas didn't look pleased either. Their smiles vanished the moment they saw Isabella.

Isabella noticed but didn't care as much as she once would have.

She offered a faint smile and handed the gifts to the approaching housekeeper before greeting Eleanor. "Good evening, Grandmother."

"Good evening," Eleanor replied, her face lighting up as she guided Isabella to sit beside her. But her smile faltered as she looked closer. "You've lost weight! Has Alexander been mistreating you?"

Isabella lowered her gaze. "No, I've just been busy lately."

It was partly true. Alexander hadn't mistreated her directly, but her mood often suffered because of him.

Plus, she'd been immersing herself in AI research every night after work, sometimes until dawn.

Her recent weight loss was partly due to this.

Before Eleanor could respond, Victoria scoffed. "From how you say it, anyone would think your job is so crucial the entire Whitmore Group depends on you."

Catherine, ever elegant, sipped her drink coolly. "If working at Whitmore Group exhausts you so, perhaps you should quit. After all, no one forced you to work there."

Victoria laughed. "Exactly! Maybe someone just can't bear to leave."

Eleanor disliked their sarcastic jabs at Isabella.

She was about to intervene when Isabella spoke first. "I've already submitted my resignation. Once I complete the handover, I'll leave Whitmore Group."

Her words stunned Catherine and Victoria into momentary silence.

Eleanor frowned. "Isabella—"

"Is Mom here?" Sophia's voice cut through the tension as she descended from the second floor via elevator.

Seeing Isabella, she looked genuinely happy - they hadn't spoken in over two weeks. She ran over and hugged Isabella tightly. "Mom!"

Isabella hesitated briefly before returning the hug gently. "Hello, sweetheart."

Eleanor decided to drop the earlier topic with Sophia present.

Smiling warmly, she said to Isabella, "It's been ages since I had your tea. Would you make me a cup?"

Having grown up with Margaret, Isabella had developed exceptional tea-making skills.

"I'd be happy to," Isabella replied, "but dinner is almost ready—"

Victoria, who preferred coffee, disliked seeing Isabella showcase her tea skills. She interjected, "Exactly. Dinner will be served as soon as Alexander and Henry return."

Right on cue, Alexander entered.

He greeted Eleanor and Catherine first. When his gaze landed on Isabella, he quickly looked away and sat in a single-seat couch far from her.

Seeing Alexander, Sophia immediately left Isabella's side and ran to him. "Daddy!"

Alexander gave her a brief hug before scanning the room as if to speak. Then Henry arrived. Much younger than both Alexander and Victoria, the lively teenager bounded in energetically.

He playfully vaulted over a couch backrest, landing neatly on the cushions. Seeing everyone gathered, he grinned. "Were you all waiting for me?"

Victoria smacked his head affectionately. "Of course! We've been starving because of you."

While Alexander was reserved and Victoria fiery, Henry brought joy to the family. His arrival visibly brightened Catherine's expression, while Eleanor looked even more delighted.

Noticing the late hour, Eleanor instructed the staff to serve dinner.

The nine of them dined together. Eleanor sat at the head, with Alexander, Sophia and Isabella on one side.

Eleanor smiled at Sophia. "Sophie, switch places with your father so your parents can sit together."

Eleanor had always tried bringing Isabella and Alexander closer. The others were used to her efforts and didn't react, knowing them futile. Despite years of meddling, Alexander's attitude toward Isabella hadn't changed.

Everyone knew it was pointless. Even Victoria merely smirked sarcastically and took a random seat without comment.

Though Alexander disliked Eleanor's arrangements, he rarely contradicted her on minor matters. His silence signaled acquiescence.

Unlike before, Isabella felt no joy or hope at Eleanor's matchmaking.

She kept her expression neutral, though her smile remained gentle as she addressed Eleanor. "It's alright, Grandmother. This seating arrangement is fine."
###Chapter 12

Isabella exhaled sharply, frustration bubbling beneath her composed exterior. She'd always been too accommodating with Alexander, letting him dictate the terms of their strained relationship. That weakness had cost her every chance to bridge the distance between them.

When Eleanor didn't push further after Isabella's quiet refusal to elaborate, relief washed over her.

Dinner progressed with lively chatter filling the dining room. Isabella remained silent, methodically cutting her steak into precise pieces.

Not a single word had passed between her and Alexander since he'd entered Whitmore Manor. Fifteen minutes and counting.

Their cold dynamic raised no eyebrows anymore. The household staff barely noticed.

Sophia normally relied on Isabella for assistance during meals. Lately though, she'd started turning to Alexander first.

Yet when the shrimp platter arrived, the child instinctively looked toward Isabella. Years of peeled shrimp flashed through both women's minds.

"Mommy, can I have shrimp?" Sophia's sweet voice cut through the dining room chatter.

Despite the impending divorce and custody arrangements, maternal instincts kicked in. "Of course, sweetheart."

Isabella set down her wine glass and reached for the seafood fork.

Eleanor's sharp intake of breath made everyone freeze. "Isabella, where's your wedding ring?"

All eyes snapped to Isabella's bare left hand.

That platinum band had never left her finger since their wedding day - not even when Alexander had publicly humiliated her by never wearing his. Teagan had mocked her for it relentlessly.

Isabella's fingers barely faltered as she continued shelling the shrimp. "Left it at home this morning. Rushed out the door."

The lie came smoothly. The ring currently sat in the same envelope as the unsigned divorce papers. No need to upset Eleanor before the ink dried.

Eleanor's shoulders relaxed. "Ah, that explains it."

Conversation resumed, silverware clinking against fine china.

Later in the drawing room, Eleanor orchestrated seating arrangements with matchmaking determination. Isabella found herself pressed against Alexander's side on an antique loveseat.

His familiar bergamot cologne should have made her pulse race. Instead, she focused on her crème brûlée, savoring each caramelized bite in silence.

Eleanor beamed at them. "You make such a striking pair."

Physically, perhaps. Alexander's chiseled features complemented Isabella's delicate beauty perfectly. But their marriage had always been a gilded cage.

Victoria and Catherine exchanged knowing glances but held their tongues.

At Eleanor's insistence, the entire family stayed overnight at Whitmore Manor.

When Alexander disappeared into Eleanor's study for business discussions at eight, Isabella found herself shepherding a yawning Sophia upstairs.

"Mommy," Sophia hesitated in the bubble-filled tub, "are you busy tomorrow morning?"

The hopeful glint in her daughter's eyes stung. "No, darling. Why?"

Sophia's lower lip jutted out. "Nothing."

Isabella didn't press. After towel-drying Sophia's curls, she caught the child sneaking glances at her phone.

"Nine-thirty bedtime," Isabella reminded her. "No exceptions."

"Fine," Sophia huffed, already shoving Isabella toward the door. "Goodnight, Mommy!"

The lock clicked the moment the door closed. Isabella paused. That lock hadn't been meant to keep others out - just her in. Sophia was probably texting Victoria about tomorrow's change in plans.

Back in her room, Isabella showered and changed into silk pajamas from her permanent guest closet. She settled into the window seat with legal documents from her briefcase.

Midnight approached when she realized Alexander still hadn't returned. Was he avoiding her? Working? The unanswered questions drove her downstairs.

A voice from the darkened library stopped her cold.

"Everyone's asleep. You're hiding down here because Isabella's in your room, aren't you? Can't bear to face her?"
###Chapter 13

Victoria Whitmore's voice cut through the night air.

Isabella Sinclair turned sharply, spotting both Victoria and Alexander standing near the garden fountain.

Her footsteps faltered.

Alexander exhaled cigarette smoke into the darkness.

The distance between them stretched too far, with Alexander silhouetted against the moonlight, making his expression unreadable.

Victoria sighed dramatically. "Honestly, I get it. Victoria Kensington? Twenty-five with a PhD from Oxford? Running her family's empire? She's practically perfect."

She twirled her wine glass. "Gorgeous, brilliant, untamed - exactly your type. But that family history... Alexander, are you sure about this?"

Alexander's voice turned icy. "I know exactly what I want."

Victoria's nose wrinkled. She'd never liked Isabella, but Victoria Kensington didn't impress her either.

"But-" she started, then froze under Alexander's warning glare.

"Fine!" She threw up her hands. "God forbid I voice an opinion. I'll shut up now."

Isabella clenched her fists, the night wind biting her cheeks. A bitter laugh escaped her lips before she turned away silently.

As she retreated, Victoria's voice carried again. "Oh, did you hear? Isabella submitted her resignation from InnovaTech?"

Alexander's reply came cold and detached. "Daniel mentioned she messed up a client deal. I told him to terminate her per company policy."

Victoria's mocking laughter followed. "That explains it! She made it sound like quitting when she told me. Typical - getting fired but pretending it was her choice."

Alexander remained silent, as if discussing a stranger.

Upstairs, Isabella nearly collided with Henry Whitmore on the landing. Both startled, then Henry immediately apologized. "Are you alright?"

Aside from Eleanor, Henry was the only Whitmore who treated her with kindness.

Isabella forced a smile. "I'm fine."

When she'd married Alexander, Henry had been just a boy. He'd always found Isabella beautiful and kind, never understanding why his brother treated her so coldly. Even now, grown and aware of their strained marriage, he admired her.

Noticing her distress, he blurted, "Isabella, you're amazing. Alexander's an idiot if he can't see that."

Isabella hesitated. No point explaining their impending divorce. "Thank you, Henry."

"I'm grabbing a nightcap. You should rest."

"Goodnight," she murmured.

Back in her room, Isabella switched off the main lights, leaving only the bedside lamp glowing. She'd just settled when Alexander entered.

Their eyes met.

She studied him.

Once, she'd have jumped up to take his coat, prepare his pajamas, run his bath. Now she simply closed her eyes.

The absence of her usual attentions gave Alexander pause. He dismissed it as another of her moods.

Without preamble, he stated, "Sophia's school paperwork is done. Take her tomorrow."

"Understood."

That was all. He turned toward the closet.

This was their marriage.

Watching him, Isabella considered mentioning the divorce. But Alexander would handle it in his own time. He wanted this more than she did.

His phone rang.

Isabella recognized the change in his voice immediately - softer, warmer. Victoria Kensington, no doubt.

"I'll come now," he said abruptly, then left without another word.

Moments later, tires crunched on gravel as Alexander drove away.

Isabella turned off the light and slept.

At six the next morning, she rose to prepare Sophia for school. Alexander hadn't returned. She checked the time, unsurprised.

Sophia's door was locked. Isabella knocked.

Eventually, the door swung open to reveal a scowling Sophia. "Mom! You're giving me a headache!"

After last night's call with Victoria, Sophia had slept poorly, plagued by guilt over disappointing her.

Isabella remained calm. "We'll be late."

Sophia flopped back onto her bed with a dramatic sigh. "Fine."

Then, peeking through her lashes: "Can you put toothpaste on my brush?"

Isabella obliged.

While Isabella was in the bathroom, Sophia texted Victoria: "Good morning, Aunt Vicky!" before shuffling to brush her teeth.

Isabella handed her a warm towel afterward. "Which uniform?"

Sophia gave the closet a cursory glance. "I'll dress myself."

Once alone, Sophia dug out the camouflage shirt Victoria had gifted her - her secret rebellion.

She couldn't wait to show her loyalty!
###Chapter 14

The anticipation of Victoria's racing competition tonight and imagining her effortlessly cool demeanor instantly brightened Sophia's mood. She slipped into the outfit and immediately reached for her phone to check again.

Her smile faltered.

Victoria always responded to her texts within minutes. Yet this time, there was complete radio silence - not even after Sophia had finished dressing.

Was Victoria angry with her?

A wave of panic surged through Sophia as her fingers flew across the screen. Vic, pls don't be mad! U know I wanted YOU to take me to school, not Mom! Pls answer!

Still nothing.

Isabella reappeared at her door. "Sophia? Breakfast is ready. We need to leave soon."

Irritation flashed across Sophia's face. "I KNOW! God, Mom, stop nagging! You're so annoying!" She snatched up her backpack and stomped downstairs.

Isabella followed silently, though her gaze lingered on Sophia's unfamiliar outfit.

She'd always carefully selected Sophia's clothes, ensuring each piece met her daughter's approval. But ever since that Salzburg trip with Alexander, Sophia's style had undergone a dramatic transformation.

All because of Victoria's influence - introducing Sophia to rock climbing and skateboarding.

Victoria wasn't just academically brilliant; she was this impossibly cool, adventurous woman with countless hobbies. Sophia worshipped her, emulating everything from her fashion to her interests.

It pained Isabella to see her daughter growing so attached to Victoria, but she never voiced it. She'd even started buying clothes she thought would appeal to Sophia's new tastes.

Yet Sophia barely glanced at Isabella's selections, wearing only what Victoria chose for her.

That camouflage outfit? Definitely Victoria's doing. But Isabella pretended not to notice, maintaining her usual composure as they descended.

The rest of the household still slept, except Eleanor.

"Good morning, you two."

Isabella smiled. "Morning, Grandma."

Sophia mumbled a half-hearted greeting.

Eleanor caught her tone immediately. "What's wrong, sweetheart?"

Sophia remained silent, sulking.

Richard chuckled from the doorway. "Teenage morning grumpiness, nothing more."

Eleanor smiled at his comment but turned to Isabella. "Where's Alexander? Still asleep?"

"He had business last night." Isabella kept her voice neutral.

Eleanor's expression darkened. She could guess what kind of "business" that meant. But with Sophia present, she bit back any criticism.

As they prepared to leave after breakfast, Sophia dashed upstairs for something forgotten. Isabella waited below.

Then Sophia's phone buzzed on the table. The screen lit up: Victoria Kensington with a heart emoji.

Isabella froze.

She'd always respected Sophia's privacy, never snooped. But now, against her better judgment, she picked up the phone.

A quick scan of the messages revealed why Sophia had been so moody. Morning greetings to Victoria, lengthy daily chats - their entire communication laid bare.

Hearing the elevator, Isabella quickly replaced the phone.

Sophia's entire demeanor shifted when she saw Victoria's reply - promises she'd never be angry, explanations about oversleeping. The radiant smile returned instantly.

Isabella noticed but said nothing.

Oblivious, Sophia climbed into the car, immediately resuming her texting. She kept sneaking glances at Isabella, who remained focused on driving.

After thirty minutes of nonstop messaging, Sophia finally set her phone down, her good mood restored. "Mom, are you free this afternoon?"

Isabella kept her eyes on the road. "Why?"

"Just tell me!"

"I'm busy. What do you need?"

Sophia grinned. "Nothing."

Perfect, she thought. If Mom's busy, she can't pick me up. I can go straight to Victoria after class.

At school, Isabella accompanied Sophia to meet Elizabeth Moore, her homeroom teacher, who led them toward the classroom.

Then a high-pitched voice called out, "Ms. Sinclair!"

Isabella turned to see a small figure barreling toward her. She crouched just in time to catch the child.

"Charlotte?"

The little girl beamed, her twin braids bouncing. It was the same child Isabella had saved from that dog attack days before.

Before Isabella could say more, Sophia roughly shoved Charlotte aside.

"Sophia!" Isabella caught Charlotte before she fell. "Are you okay?"

Tears welled in Charlotte's eyes. "Why... why did you push me?"

Sophia had been confused by Charlotte's sudden appearance. But seeing Isabella's obvious affection for the girl sparked instant jealousy.

As Charlotte sniffled, Sophia's face twisted in contempt. "You're so pathetic. And pink is disgusting on you!"
###Chapter 15

Charlotte looked absolutely precious in her frilly pink dress, the kind of child that made strangers stop and coo. Her innocent charm naturally drew people's affection.

Calling her ugly would be nothing short of cruel.

Having been adored her entire life, this was Charlotte's first encounter with such harsh words.

Tears welled up instantly as she clung to Isabella's skirt.

Isabella immediately scooped her up. "That's not true, sweetheart. You're absolutely beautiful. Everyone thinks so, don't they?"

Charlotte's sniffles softened slightly. Before she could respond, Sophia's eyes burned with indignation watching Isabella comfort another child.

"I hate you! You're not my mommy anymore!" Sophia screamed before turning to flee.

Isabella caught her wrist mid-stride.

The outburst stung, but Isabella refused to humiliate her daughter publicly. She pulled Sophia close, kissing her forehead. "Darling, calm down—"

The kiss momentarily soothed Sophia's rage. But then fresh tears erupted. "Then don't hug her! And don't say she's cute!"

The realization hit Isabella like lightning—this was pure jealousy.

Despite her rejection, Sophia couldn't bear seeing Isabella's affection directed elsewhere.

Isabella suppressed a smile.

Instead of promises, she kissed Sophia's temple again and carried both girls to a quiet corner.

Seizing the opportunity, Sophia shoved Charlotte away.

Though younger, Charlotte lacked Sophia's possessive streak. The fiery glare intimidated her into retreating.

Holding Sophia close, Isabella murmured, "My fierce little lioness, listen. You love being bold and brilliant, but some prefer being soft and sweet."

"Mocking others for being different is unkind. We respect everyone's choices. Understand?"

Isabella knew her daughter's sharp mind would grasp this where others might not.

Sophia did understand. She knew she'd been cruel. But the burning jealousy remained.

She pressed her lips into a stubborn line.

Isabella smoothed her hair and wiped her tears. "Mistakes happen, darling. But we learn. No more hurtful words, yes?"

The gentle care melted Sophia's resistance. She nodded into Isabella's shoulder. "Okay."

Isabella kissed her cheek before turning to Charlotte. "This is Sophia, my daughter. She's sorry. Will you forgive her?"

Charlotte hesitated, still wary of Sophia's intensity. But Isabella's reassuring smile gave her courage. "Okay."

"Thank you, sweetheart." Isabella nudged Sophia. "And you?"

Sophia peeked from Isabella's embrace. "Sorry."

Charlotte offered a timid smile. "S'okay."

With the storm passed, Isabella exhaled in relief and guided both girls toward the classroom.

When Elizabeth came for Charlotte, Isabella knelt before Sophia. "All better now? Ready for class?"


###Chapter 16

Sophia Whitmore showed no remorse for publicly humiliating Charlotte earlier. The opinions of her classmates meant nothing to her.

Yet as Isabella Sinclair turned to leave, an unexpected tightness gripped Sophia's chest. "Mom—"

Isabella paused, wrapping her arms around her daughter. "Yes, sweetheart?"

"I want to—"

Sophia suddenly remembered how long it had been since she'd tasted her mother's homemade cooking. The realization struck her with unexpected longing.

But then she recalled her plans to watch Victoria Kensington's competition that evening. Her grip loosened as hesitation flickered across her face.

"Never mind."

Her mother's cooking could wait—there would always be another time. Victoria's competition, however, was a rare event.

The decision came easily.

"Alright then. Don't keep your teacher waiting."

"Okay."

Sophia finally released her hold, but paused at the classroom door. "Mom, don't forget to call me at lunch."

Isabella smiled warmly. "I won't."

Only then did Sophia enter the classroom.

Isabella lingered just long enough to see her daughter confidently introduce herself before taking a seat.

With a final wave, Isabella left for Whitmore Enterprises.

At the office, Benjamin Hayes waited at her desk with an unfamiliar woman in tow.

"This is Olivia Chambers," Benjamin announced. "She'll be taking over your position."

Olivia was stunning—dressed head-to-toe in designer labels. Her assessing gaze swept over Isabella's polished professionalism.

Though her smile didn't quite reach her eyes, Olivia extended a perfectly manicured hand. "Ms. Sinclair, what a pleasure. I'll be shadowing you this week."

"The pleasure's mine," Isabella replied politely.

Olivia continued smoothly, "I just completed my master's at Trellis College. Where did you study? Were you—"

Isabella arched a brow at the mention of Olivia's recent graduation. The girl likely had minimal work experience. Still, Isabella reserved judgment.

After all, she herself had risen to team leader despite others having more impressive academic credentials.

"Ms. Chambers," Isabella interjected gently, "we have a meeting shortly. Let's focus on work."

Olivia laughed, a practiced tinkling sound. "Of course! How silly of me. Business first."

En route to the meeting, Olivia leaned in conspiratorially. "I've heard Mr. Whitmore is devastatingly handsome. True?"

Isabella answered honestly. "He is."

Olivia practically vibrated with excitement. "Now I'm doubly eager to meet him! Though Benjamin mentioned he won't be in today—what a shame."

This was news to Isabella, though not surprising. Alexander managed multiple corporations and rarely spent consecutive days at Whitmore Enterprises.

At lunch, Olivia dragged Isabella to the cafeteria. As they settled with their trays, Isabella reached for her phone.

"Calling your boyfriend?" Olivia teased.

"My daughter, actually."

"You're married?"

"Yes."

Meanwhile, Sophia video-called Victoria Kensington. Alexander Whitmore appeared in frame as well.

Sophia pouted at the screen. "You two are cheating! Having lunch without me!"

"That's because you're at school," Victoria countered. "I'll pick you up later and we'll all have dinner. Deal?"

"Better."

Sophia's eyes narrowed as Alexander placed food on Victoria's plate.

"What would you like for dinner?" Alexander asked casually. "I'll have it prepared."
###Chapter 17

Alexander's words brightened Sophia's mood instantly. She excitedly listed all her favorite foods while he listened with genuine interest.

When she finished, Victoria complimented her appearance.

"Sophia, that outfit looks absolutely stunning on you. The colors are perfect."

"Really?"

Victoria smiled warmly. "Absolutely! How was school today? Did you make any new friends?"

The two engaged in lively conversation while Alexander remained quiet, enjoying his meal at a relaxed pace.

A passing waitress who didn't know their relationship glanced at them and mistakenly assumed they were a family. She shot Victoria an envious look.

Just then, Sophia noticed an incoming video call from Isabella.

It was the call she'd requested that morning. But now, caught up in her animated discussion with Victoria, she hesitated to answer.

Earlier that day, seeing Isabella hug another child had upset her deeply.

However, during class, her teacher had explained that mothers always love their children most, and every child holds a special place in their mother's heart.

This reassurance had comforted Sophia.

When Isabella noticed her unanswered call, concern grew. She decided to contact Elizabeth instead.

Elizabeth was in the children's rest area when she answered. "Sophia's fine. She's video chatting with her father and a woman right now. Should I go tell her-"

"No need," Isabella interrupted.

She could guess Sophia was talking with Alexander and Victoria, probably having lunch together. "It's alright. Let them enjoy their time."

After hanging up, Isabella sent Sophia a text instead, asking about her school day, new friends, and lunch choices.

She also reminded her to listen to her teacher and take her afternoon nap.

Nearly fifteen minutes later, Isabella finally received a voice message from Sophia.

"Got it, Mom."

By late afternoon, after working closely with Olivia all day, Isabella realized her new secretary was outgoing, sociable, and remarkably competent.

Around 6:00 pm, as Isabella prepared to leave, Olivia approached with a dinner invitation to thank her for the guidance.

"That's part of my job. No need for formalities, Ms. Chambers," Isabella replied politely.

Olivia persisted, but Isabella's phone rang unexpectedly.

The caller ID showed Catherine Whitmore - her mother-in-law.

Isabella blinked in surprise.

Catherine had always looked down on her, rarely interacting unless absolutely necessary. In all these years, she could count their conversations on one hand.

Baffled, Isabella answered. "Mother?"

"Henry's been street racing behind our backs. I don't trust him. I'm sending you the address. Go bring him home."

Catherine hung up abruptly. Moments later, a text arrived with a racetrack location on the city outskirts. Turning to Olivia, Isabella said, "I'm sorry, an emergency came up. I have to go."

Over an hour later, Isabella arrived at the racetrack. The massive venue buzzed with activity even at night, engines roaring and crowds cheering.

She called Henry repeatedly, but he didn't pick up.

With no other choice, she began searching on foot.

After nearly twenty minutes of pushing through the crowd, she finally spotted him.

Henry looked stunned when he saw her. "Isabella? What are you doing here?" She explained that Catherine had sent her to bring him home.
###Chapter 18

Henry raised his hand as if taking a sacred vow.

Today marked Victoria's first race since her return to the country. She was the undisputed queen of the racetrack, the most celebrated female racer on the continent—and my absolute idol. Missing this was not an option. I swear I'll leave right after the race. So don’t worry about me. Just go home.

But before Isabella could protest, a deafening roar erupted from the crowd ahead.

"Victoria!"

"My idol is here?" Henry gasped, instantly forgetting about Isabella. He joined the sea of cheering fans, lifting his binoculars to focus on the starting line.

Isabella blinked in surprise at Henry’s sudden fervor. Since when had he been into racing?

They weren’t exactly close, but she was certain he’d never shown any interest in the sport before.

"I wasn’t into it before," Henry admitted, his eyes gleaming with excitement. "But that was before I discovered Victoria! Do you have any idea how stunning and fearless she is? Just wait until you see her, Isabella. Trust me, you’ll fall for her too. She’s perfection. Everyone adores her!"

At that moment, Victoria made her grand entrance.

Henry erupted into cheers again, completely forgetting Isabella’s presence.

Isabella hadn’t eaten dinner yet.

But given Henry’s fanatic devotion and the overwhelming noise making conversation impossible, she decided to stay and watch the race with him. She’d drag him home afterward.

A short while later, Henry shoved the binoculars into her hands. "Isabella! Look, there she is! Number 38, in the red racing suit! Isn’t she the most electrifying woman you’ve ever seen?"

Though racing had never interested her, Isabella couldn’t resist Henry’s infectious enthusiasm. Reluctantly, she lifted the binoculars—and froze.

Victoria was none other than Victoria Kensington.

She’d heard rumors that Victoria dabbled in extreme sports, but she had no idea she was a professional racer with a legion of devoted fans.

Victoria stood tall and poised in her red racing suit, her figure both athletic and striking. Confidence radiated from her every movement, a mesmerizing blend of wild elegance and undeniable allure.

Isabella adjusted the binoculars, scanning the opposite stands. There, she spotted Alexander. His gaze was locked onto Victoria, utterly entranced.

Her grip on the binoculars tightened.

As the race was about to begin, Henry impatiently snatched them back. Meanwhile, Isabella’s attention remained fixed on Alexander’s side of the stands.

He wasn’t alone. Sophia and Alexander’s tight-knit circle of friends were all there, undoubtedly gathered to cheer for Victoria.

The race began with a thunderous roar as the cars shot past in a blur, igniting the crowd into a frenzy of screams and applause.

Henry thrust the binoculars back at Isabella.

"Look! My idol is fearless and flawless. She’s incredible! Watch her!"

Isabella took them reluctantly, focusing on Victoria. Moments later, Victoria executed a daring, perfectly calculated overtake on a sharp turn, leaving the audience breathless.

Isabella, who had never cared for racing, found herself captivated. She stood motionless, transfixed.

Suddenly, she understood why Alexander was so infatuated with Victoria.

It made perfect sense.

###Chapter 19

Even Alexander, usually so composed and restrained, couldn't hide his look of admiration. Beside him, Sophia and Oliver jumped from their seats, cheering wildly.

The race intensified to its peak. Henry raised the binoculars again, completely unaware that Alexander's group was also watching.

During a brief pause in the competition, Victoria momentarily took the lead.

Isabella asked Henry for the binoculars.

Henry grinned excitedly. "You've become a fan of VC too, haven't you? I told you - no one can resist her charm!"

Isabella gave a faint smile but didn't respond.

Her mind wandered to calling Alexander. She wanted to see his reaction, but quickly dismissed the idea, knowing he'd likely reject the call as usual.

Still, just this once, she thought.

Against her better judgment, Isabella dialed Alexander's number and lifted the binoculars again. Through them, she watched as he glanced at his phone and immediately declined the call before refocusing on Victoria.

His eyes held only Victoria.

Isabella took a deep breath, smiled to herself, and handed the binoculars back to Henry. She didn't watch the rest of the race or look in Alexander's direction again.

When the race concluded, Victoria had claimed first place.

Henry was overjoyed. He and his friends excitedly discussed approaching Victoria for an autograph.

"But VC's a billionaire heiress with a doctorate from Cambridge. Racing is just her passion project. She doesn't entertain fans or give autographs. She always leaves immediately after races. It's practically impossible to get one."

"True, and since this was an invite-only event, we had better odds. But the racers have private exits, and we don't have any connections to get backstage. Damn..."

As Henry and his friends lamented, news spread that Victoria had already left with her entourage to celebrate. Catherine called to check in, and Isabella declined Henry's plea to join his friends, insisting on taking him home.

Before leaving, Isabella stopped by the restroom.

On her way out, she accidentally collided with someone.

"Sorry," they both apologized simultaneously, stepping back.

Isabella looked up and froze.

It was Julian, one of Alexander's closest friends.

Julian recognized her too, and his already indifferent expression turned even colder.

Isabella noticed immediately.

She'd known Alexander since she was ten, but Julian and Alexander had been childhood friends, inseparable since their school days. Their bond remained unbreakable.

Yet Alexander had always excluded her from his inner circle, even after their marriage. So despite knowing Julian and Oliver for over a decade, they were barely acquaintances.

But Victoria, whom Alexander had known for only a short time, had already been introduced to all his friends.
###Chapter 20

When Victoria Kensington celebrated her birthday, Alexander Whitmore had Julian Montgomery and his circle arrange the festivities. Now, during Victoria's racing competition, Julian and the others showed up again to support her.

Rumors swirled about Victoria's closeness with Alexander's inner circle. Their bond had grown so strong that even in Alexander's absence, they never failed to include Victoria in their gatherings.

Julian and his friends had fully embraced her as one of their own. This acceptance had gradually eroded their interactions with Isabella Sinclair over the past two years, their indifference toward her becoming more pronounced.

Isabella had once attempted to forge connections with them. But they'd dismissed her from the start, never granting her an opportunity.

Pride prevented her from pushing the matter after their stance became clear. She maintained polite greetings during necessary encounters, though most were met with deliberate ignorance or outright disdain. This time, Isabella chose silence, walking past Julian without acknowledgment.

"Ms. Sinclair, I never took you for a racing enthusiast," Julian remarked coolly, assuming she'd followed Alexander here.

Isabella turned, her voice glacial. "What exactly are you implying?"

Julian didn't mask his contempt. "Merely observing that racing seems... incongruous with someone of your disposition. I found it curious."

"My disposition?" Isabella held his gaze steadily. "Mr. Montgomery, do we share such intimacy that you presume to know me? Enlighten me - what exactly is my disposition?"

Julian had always perceived Isabella as quiet, gentle, almost shy. But he believed this facade concealed a calculating nature - how else could she have orchestrated that despicable scheme to win Alexander's affection?

His silence spoke volumes, heavy with unspoken judgment. He considered her unworthy of further commentary.

Yet today, Isabella's tone carried an unfamiliar edge. The pretense of meekness seemed discarded, though not entirely. Her piercing gaze held both cold clarity and subtle mockery - as if laughing at his presumption of understanding her, at his self-righteous condemnation without full context.

Isabella cared little for Julian's thoughts. She turned away without another word.

Catherine Whitmore had rented Henry Whitmore an apartment near campus. By the time Isabella dropped him off, the clock showed 11:00 PM.

Despite his earlier dinner, Henry's stomach growled again. "Isabella, there's an amazing late-night spot nearby. My treat," he offered.

Isabella hadn't eaten. The prospect of warm comfort food appealed to her current mood. She agreed. As they settled at the diner, her stomach emitted a quiet protest.

Henry froze, then realization dawned. "Wait... you skipped dinner?"

She nodded.

His face fell. "God, Isabella, I'm so sorry. This is completely my fault—"

"It's fine. I wasn't hungry earlier."

Her gentle reassurance only deepened Henry's guilt. In that moment, he recognized her genuine kindness. What a tragedy that Alexander remained blind to it.
###Chapter 21

Alexander returned to the Whitmore estate close to 1 AM after celebrating Victoria's competition win.

Richard noticed Alexander carrying a drowsy Sophia and frowned. "You're back quite late, Mr. Whitmore?" Alexander merely hummed in response, offering no explanation.

After tucking Sophia into bed, Alexander entered his bedroom and flicked on the lights. The empty space where Isabella should have been made him pause. "She didn't come home tonight?" he asked Richard.

"Mrs. Whitmore? No, sir."

Alexander's eyebrow arched slightly in surprise.

Isabella had been absent more frequently these past few days. Unusual behavior for someone who rarely spent nights away. Had something happened with the Sinclair family?

Morning sunlight streamed through Sophia's curtains as she woke up grinning, still buzzing from yesterday's adventures with Victoria. Clutching her favorite stuffed unicorn, she skipped toward the master suite.

"Mommy! Mommy!" she called cheerfully.

The room stood empty.

Sophia's smile faltered.

Just then, Alexander emerged from the walk-in closet, fully dressed in his signature tailored suit.

"Where's Mommy?" Sophia asked, tilting her head.

Alexander adjusted his cufflinks casually. "Not home."

"Huh? Why not?"

"Ask her yourself."

Sophia immediately dialed Isabella.

Isabella had just finished her morning run when Sophia's call came through. She swiped to answer.

"Mommy! Where are you?" Sophia's eager voice filled the line.

Instead of answering, Isabella deflected. "What's wrong, sweetheart? Did you need something?"

Only Emily knew about Isabella's temporary apartment. She cherished her newfound independence and wasn't ready to disrupt that peace yet.

She had no intention of telling Sophia her current whereabouts.

With the phone on speaker, Sophia flopped onto the king-sized bed and whined, "I miss you. Can you take me to school today?"

"My place is too far. I wouldn't make it in time. Maybe next time, okay?"

Sophia's face fell. "Okay..." Then perking up, she added, "But you have to take me tomorrow! Promise!"

Isabella hesitated. Returning to that house filled her with unease.

"Mommy?"

Alexander overheard every word. Isabella's uncharacteristic hesitation caught his attention. Normally, she'd jump at any chance to spend time with Sophia.

After a beat, Isabella suggested, "Why don't you ask your father to take you?"

Sophia's lower lip trembled. "No..." Her eyes welled up. "You haven't taken me in forever!"

Relenting, Isabella sighed. "Alright, I'll take you."

"I love you mostest!"

Her agreement stemmed from duty, not sentiment. She'd brought Sophia into this world - that responsibility remained, regardless of circumstances.

Sophia's tears instantly transformed into a radiant smile.

As Alexander fastened his watch, he noticed Sophia still chatting away. "If you don't eat breakfast soon, you'll be late."

Sophia gasped. "Oh no! I haven't brushed my teeth yet! Bye, Mommy!" She hung up abruptly.

Setting her phone down, Isabella finished her breakfast before heading to Whitmore Corporation.

###Chapter 22

The morning held a crucial meeting where Alexander Whitmore would be present.

Isabella Sinclair and her colleagues had been seated in the conference room for over fifteen minutes when Alexander finally strode in.

His entrance made Olivia Chambers gasp. Her eyes sparkled with admiration, completely captivated by his presence.

As the meeting commenced, Olivia snapped out of her trance and tugged at Isabella's sleeve.

"Mr. Whitmore is absolutely breathtaking!"

Isabella had only glanced up briefly when Alexander entered. At Olivia's remark, she simply murmured, "Hmm," without looking up.

Olivia blinked in surprise at Isabella's apparent disinterest, then remembered Isabella was already married with a child.

Throughout the meeting, Olivia's pulse raced as she kept stealing glances at Alexander. She barely registered a word of the discussion.

Isabella, meanwhile, typed furiously on her laptop, capturing every detail.

When the meeting concluded, Alexander exited first, followed by the others in measured succession.

Olivia's heart continued its frantic rhythm long after Alexander's departure. Only when Benjamin Hayes approached to collect Isabella's notes did she finally return to reality.

Benjamin skimmed through the notes and nodded approvingly. "Impressive work."

"Just doing my job," Isabella replied.

After Benjamin left, Olivia realized she'd missed most of the meeting. "Could you share your notes with me?" she asked hastily.

Scanning the documents, Olivia frowned. "Ms. Sinclair, did you study architecture?"

Isabella shook her head. "No."

"Then how do you know all these industry terms?"

"I read some books to familiarize myself. Just surface knowledge."

Whitmore Group's diverse investments had driven Isabella to study multiple industries over the years.

"Really? Even medical texts?"

"Yes."

Olivia's eyebrows shot up.

"Taxation too?"

After two days working together, Olivia understood why Isabella led the secretarial team despite her youth. The woman was frighteningly competent.

"Which books did you read? Could you send me a list? I'd love to check them out."

"Of course. I'll compile it later."

By noon, Isabella had filtered through her library, selecting fifty beginner-friendly titles for Olivia.

Olivia paled at the extensive list.

At 3 PM, Alexander had a client meeting. Benjamin requested Isabella prepare coffee, insisting on delivering it himself.

Olivia's eyes widened. "You make Mr. Whitmore's coffee?"

But Benjamin's insistence on delivery suggested Alexander kept his distance from subordinates.

"Have you ever delivered coffee to Mr. Whitmore personally?" Olivia ventured.

"Occasionally, when Benjamin's team is swamped."

Though Olivia adored coffee, she'd never bothered learning to brew it. Now an idea struck her. "Ms. Sinclair, would you teach me to make coffee his way?"

Even slim chances were worth pursuing.

Isabella recognized Olivia's motives but didn't mind. "Certainly."

Having moved on from Alexander, she saw no harm in sharing the skill.

###Chapter 23

Benjamin Hayes froze in the doorway of the break room, catching the tail end of Isabella Sinclair's conversation with Olivia Chambers.

He and Daniel Prescott had been certain Isabella would never willingly leave the company. They'd bet on her finding some way to stay.

When Olivia took over Isabella's responsibilities, they expected fireworks. Olivia was gorgeous - how could Isabella let her work so closely with Alexander Whitmore?

Yet for days, Isabella had not only accepted Olivia but seemed to genuinely like her. Now she was even teaching Olivia how to brew Alexander's favorite coffee.

What game was she playing?

Isabella remained unaware of Benjamin's scrutiny. She declined Olivia's dinner invitation with a polite smile, eager to get home and continue her AI research.

Her phone rang as she stepped into her car. "Mom? Are you off work?" Sophia Whitmore's voice chirped through the speakers.

"What do you need?" Isabella started the engine.

"I want you to cook tonight. Can you make my favorite when you get home?"

Isabella's grip tightened on the wheel.

Technically, she and Alexander weren't divorced yet. He hadn't asked her to move out. Cooking for their daughter shouldn't be an issue.

But she was exhausted. And she had plans.

Sophia was her responsibility, but Isabella had a life too. She wasn't willing to sacrifice everything unconditionally anymore.

"Not tonight, sweetheart. Maybe another time."

Isabella had rarely refused Sophia anything before. This was her second rejection today.

Though Sophia assumed her mother was simply busy, she'd grown accustomed to being Isabella's top priority. The rejection stung.

"Mom! You're always busy now! I don't care - I want you to cook for me!"

Isabella felt a headache coming on.

Sophia huffed and hung up.

Tears pricked Isabella's eyes. She sat motionless for several minutes before finally pulling out of the parking lot.

At home, she ate a quick meal and opened her laptop. Nathaniel Graves called just as she began working.

"There's an industry event this weekend. Come with me? I'd like to introduce you to some people."

"Of course."

"How's the handover going?"

"Nearly done. Just a few more days."

"Perfect."

Meanwhile, Sophia waited, convinced her mother would rush home to comfort her. By 8pm, there was still no sign of Isabella.

Richard Thornton grew concerned. "Miss Sophia, perhaps you should eat something? Mrs. Whitmore seems quite busy tonight."

"No!" Sophia crossed her arms.

When Isabella didn't even call, Sophia's hurt turned to real anger. Richard's suggestion only made her cry harder. "I want Mom to cook!"

Richard had no choice but to call Alexander.

It took several rings before Alexander answered. "What?"

After Richard explained, Alexander said, "Put her on."

"Daddy..." Sophia sniffled.

"Eat your dinner."

Sophia wiped her tears but stayed stubbornly silent.

Alexander matched her silence.

Her crying intensified.

"I'll take you out this weekend. You choose where."

The sobbing stopped. "Really?"

"Yes. Now eat."

"Have you eaten, Daddy?"

"I'm at a function."

"Oh..."

"Go eat."

"Fine."

Sophia pouted but felt better. She hung up and went downstairs without further protest.

Back at the private dining room, someone teased, "Mr. Whitmore, you're quite popular tonight."

Alexander sipped his drink. "My daughter was refusing to eat. Had to handle it."
###Chapter 24

The guests exchanged knowing glances.

For years, rumors had circulated about Alexander Whitmore's marital status. Some claimed he'd been secretly married for ages, while others insisted he remained stubbornly single. The truth remained as elusive as the man himself.

Now that Alexander had casually mentioned having a daughter during dinner, the room buzzed with unspoken questions. Yet no one dared press for details.

After the meal, Sophia continued waiting for Isabella Sinclair's return.

By 9:00 pm, freshly showered and in pajamas, Sophia still hadn't heard her mother's arrival. She perched near the window, straining to hear any approaching vehicles. When headlights finally illuminated the driveway at 10:00 pm, she bolted downstairs.

"Mom—"

Her excited greeting died when Alexander walked through the door instead.

"Dad?"

Alexander handed his coat to Richard and immediately noticed Sophia's fallen expression. "What's wrong?"

"I thought it was Mom..."

Unfazed by the typical parental preference, Alexander paused. "She hasn't returned yet?"

Sophia shook her head.

He shrugged. "Must be tied up with that Rodriguez family matter. Didn't she promise to take you to school tomorrow? Get some sleep—you'll see her in the morning."

This reassurance brightened Sophia's mood slightly. "Okay."

Alexander retreated to his study to handle paperwork. By midnight, he assumed Isabella must have returned during his work session.

But their bedroom remained empty when he arrived.

Something was definitely happening with the Sinclair family.

The thought barely registered before Alexander stepped into the shower.

Morning arrived with Isabella waking early to fulfill her school run promise. She grabbed a quick breakfast before heading out.

As her car entered the familiar gated community, Isabella experienced a strange disconnect.

Seven years of memories lived in these streets, yet twenty days away had created an inexplicable distance. The unchanged scenery somehow felt foreign.

Richard spotted her immediately. "Mrs. Whitmore, you're back."

Isabella hesitated at the title but let it pass with a nod. "Where's Sophia?"

"Still asleep, ma'am."

Time was tight. If Sophia didn't appear soon, breakfast would be rushed. Rather than fetching her personally, Isabella sent Margaret upstairs.

"Mrs. Whitmore, would you care for breakfast?" Richard offered. "Everything's prepared."

Isabella offered a polite smile. "No thank you, I've eaten."

At that moment, Alexander descended the staircase.

Their eyes met briefly before Isabella offered the barest nod of acknowledgment.

Before Alexander could speak, Sophia came barreling downstairs and launched herself into Isabella's arms.

Isabella smoothed her daughter's sleep-tousled hair. "We're running late—go eat your breakfast."

"Okay!"

Just as Alexander predicted—morning had brought Mommy home.

Sophia buried her face in Isabella's sweater, inhaling her familiar perfume. Satisfied, she tugged Isabella toward the dining room. "Sit with me while I eat?"

"I already ate, sweetheart."

"Then just talk to me?"

As mother and daughter chatted, Alexander took his seat at the table.

Unable to refuse, Isabella sat opposite him.

Richard brought her water as she listened to Sophia's animated retelling of yesterday's school events. She pointedly ignored Alexander's presence.

The shift in Isabella's demeanor didn't escape Alexander's notice. She'd behaved identically during their last encounter at Whitmore Manor.

Frowning, Alexander set down his fork.
###Chapter 25

Alexander's phone buzzed to life. Isabella caught a glimpse of the screen flashing "Sweetheart" before she quickly looked away.

She told herself she didn't care anymore. But years of love don't fade in an instant.

That single word burned her vision. She focused on her coffee instead.

Alexander noticed her reaction when he glanced up. Without hesitation, he answered right in front of her. "Yes?" His voice softened noticeably.

Sophia noticed the change too.

In Sophia's memory, her father only used that tender tone with Victoria. Forgetting her mother's presence, she blurted out, "Dad, is that Victoria?"

"Yes." His reply was calm.

Sophia nearly asked to speak with Victoria too. Then she remembered Isabella's dislike for the woman. The words died in her throat, her excitement dimming.

Victoria!

Sophia frowned. If only Mom could get along with-

Victoria must have said something concerning. Alexander's brow furrowed. He abandoned his half-eaten breakfast and left abruptly.

Sophia watched him go with concern. But with Isabella present, she stayed silent.

Her appetite gone, Sophia stood. "Mom, I'm finished. Let's go."

Isabella noted every micro-expression. She knew exactly who occupied Sophia's thoughts.

But she said nothing.

"You barely ate. Take something for the ride."

"I'm not hungry."

Isabella didn't push.

In the car, Sophia immediately texted Victoria.

Isabella saw but didn't comment.

Victoria replied quickly - just a fever, nothing serious. But her raspy voice worried Sophia more. She typed rapidly, promising to visit after school.

Guilt pricked Sophia immediately.

She hadn't had Isabella's cooking in ages. Tonight was supposed to be their mother-daughter dinner. At least she hadn't mentioned it yet.

She stole a glance at Isabella behind the wheel. Seeing her mother focused on driving, Sophia relaxed.

At school, Sophia hugged Isabella tightly. "Bye, Mom!"

"Have a good day."

Sophia missed Isabella's flat tone as she skipped inside.

Back at the office, Isabella received notice: Alexander had postponed the 10 AM meeting. Some urgent matter.

She knew exactly where he'd gone.

Isabella focused on her work.

By 2 PM, Alexander seemed to have returned. Benjamin announced the rescheduled meeting and asked Isabella to prepare Alexander's coffee.

When Alexander entered the conference room, Isabella's fingers stilled on her keyboard.

He'd changed clothes. Not the same outfit from breakfast.

He'd been with Victoria. Maybe just comforting her. Maybe more.

The thought derailed her focus.

Alexander must have mistaken her distraction for something else. When she surfaced from her thoughts, his steel-gray eyes pinned her in place.

That same gaze held nothing but impatience for her, while Victoria received all his tenderness. Isabella's nails bit into her palms as she looked away.

The meeting ended quickly. Benjamin informed Isabella her handover was nearly complete. No need to come in tomorrow.

"I know."

She'd planned to mention it herself after finishing her tasks. At least this saved her a trip.
###Chapter 26

Benjamin Hayes wasn't prepared for her immediate agreement.

Isabella Sinclair extended her hand. "Thank you for everything these past years."

Still stunned, Benjamin shook it reflexively. "It was nothing."

Then, without hesitation, Isabella gathered her belongings and walked out.

He stared after her, unable to process what had just happened.

Daniel Prescott nudged him. "Earth to Ben?"

"Isabella just resigned."

Daniel blinked. "Seriously?"

He scoffed. "She'll be back. Probably running to Mrs. Whitmore for help within the week."

Benjamin stayed silent. But something about Isabella's demeanor lately made him think otherwise.

Isabella went straight home. No calls came from Sophia Whitmore—no doubt preoccupied with Victoria Kensington.

Late that night, Emily Donovan spiked a fever.

Isabella snapped her book shut, grabbed her keys, and rushed out.

Rain poured relentlessly, the streets nearly empty in the old district.

She stopped at a pharmacy near Emily's place. As she got back into her car, the passenger door swung open.

A masked figure slid inside, pressing a gun to her ribs.

"Don't move."

His voice was ice. The hat shadowed his face, but his gaze cut like a blade.

Isabella lifted her hands slightly.

He took her purse and phone. "Drive me where I need to go, and you walk away unharmed."

Before she could respond, he snapped, "Now."

The deserted street offered no help. The metallic tang of blood hit her—strong, fresh.

She started the engine. "Where?"

"Maplewood Docks. I'll direct you."

"No need. I know it."

The drive passed in tense silence, his gun never wavering.

Thirty minutes later, she pulled under a tree as instructed.

He exited swiftly but hesitated when she spoke.

"I have medical supplies."

The blood scent had worsened during the drive.

Ignoring her, he vanished into the night.

Isabella didn't press it. She turned the car around and left.

Minutes later, Julian Montgomery boarded a waiting boat.

He removed his mask as his phone rang. While someone tended his wound, he answered.

Oliver Westbrook's frantic voice crackled through. "Julian! My men lost you—where the hell are you?"

"Maplewood. Minor detour."

"Christ, you scared me half to death!"

After a clipped exchange, Julian hung up, staring at the distant tree with an unreadable expression.

Isabella returned to Emily's apartment.

Medicated and fed, Emily frowned. "Why do I smell blood?"

"Not mine."

The stranger's blood had smeared her belongings. She'd cleaned it—mostly.
###Chapter 27

Isabella's heart lifted as Emily's fever finally broke. With her best friend recovering, she returned home with renewed purpose. The upcoming banquet loomed large in her mind - she needed the perfect dress.

The afternoon found her browsing through The Grandeur's exclusive collection. Staff members buzzed around one particular gown like bees to honey, barely noticing her arrival until she stood before them.

"May I help you, miss?"

"Just looking, thank you."

Though born into the prestigious Sinclair family, Isabella had attended few formal events. Alexander and Catherine had always excluded her from their social engagements. Evelyn, her mother, had long withdrawn from high society's glittering circles.

While not a fashion expert, years of listening to Emily's industry tales had sharpened Isabella's eye for design. The boutique's dazzling array overwhelmed her - she sought something understated yet elegant.

Then she saw it.

A lavender chiffon masterpiece floated before her, its delicate floral embroidery catching the light. The mannequin wore a necklace that made Isabella's breath catch - diamonds winking like captured stars.

Her fingers twitched toward the fabric.

"Please don't touch!" The manager grabbed her wrist with surprising force. "My apologies," he said, releasing her quickly. "This is a custom piece for a VIP client. One of a kind. The insurance alone..."

Isabella nodded, disappointment sharp in her throat. Even the boutique's million-dollar dresses paled beside this creation.

She settled on an ivory silk gown with subtle floral motifs. As the cashier wrapped her purchase, whispers reached her ears.

"Thirty million for the set - can you imagine? That's a penthouse worn as jewelry."

"One night only too. The rich really play by different rules."

Isabella's lips curved wryly. Even if available, that dress belonged to another world entirely.

Emily called as she arrived home. "Dinner tomorrow - my treat!" When she heard about the banquet, Emily descended upon Isabella's apartment with makeup brushes flying.

Under Emily's skilled hands, Isabella's natural elegance transformed into something breathtaking. When Nathaniel arrived that evening, his sharp intake of air spoke volumes.

"You're stunning. That dress was made for you."

"Thank you."

As the car pulled away, Nathaniel mentioned, "You're returning to the office tomorrow?"

"Yes."

"Perfect timing. Victoria starts then - the algorithm prodigy I told you about. I'll introduce you."
###Chapter 28

Isabella's face froze. "Victoria? You mean Victoria Kensington? The one who just came back from Salzburg?"

Nathaniel nodded, surprised. "Yes. Do you know her?"

"She's my half-sister."

Nathaniel was stunned. Though he knew bits about Isabella's family background, this coincidence shocked him.

Isabella's eyes turned icy. "She's also Alexander's mistress."

The car tires screeched as they came to an abrupt stop.

Nathaniel's jaw dropped. "You—"

Isabella shook her head calmly. "I'm fine. I just don't approve of her joining our company."

Nathaniel agreed instantly. "Your decision stands."

A warm feeling spread through Isabella. "Thank you."

After a beat, she added, "But you'll be losing a brilliant mind."

Nathaniel chuckled and nudged her shoulder. "She might be an algorithm prodigy, but compared to you? She's nothing special."

Isabella blinked in surprise. She thought he was exaggerating, but his expression was dead serious. "Just stating facts."

This wasn't what she'd expected. After a moment's thought, she asked, "It's been weeks since her interview. Why hasn't she started yet?"

Nathaniel shrugged. "Said she had personal matters. Didn't press for details."

Fifteen minutes later, they arrived.

Noticing her pensive expression, Nathaniel asked, "What's troubling you?"

"I can't figure out why she'd choose our company."

Their firm was successful, but larger corporations existed. With Victoria's pedigree and education, she had better options.

Though Isabella was a major shareholder, her identity remained confidential. Victoria likely didn't know their connection, ruling out personal motives.

Nathaniel stroked his chin, then grinned. "During our chat, she mentioned being fascinated by our programming language - particularly Aurora."

Aurora was the coding language Isabella had co-created at seventeen.

Initially dismissed as ordinary, it had become their company's crown jewel in recent years.

Countless experts had tried to decode it without success. Now an industry benchmark.

Victoria clearly had her sights set on Aurora.

"Come to think of it," Nathaniel added, "we've recruited many talents because of Aurora these past years."

This realization struck Isabella anew.

Nathaniel tousled her hair affectionately. "That's why I say she doesn't compare to you."

Having worked together for years, he knew Isabella's genius firsthand. Before her arrival, he'd been considered the prodigy in their field.
###Chapter 29

Isabella and Nathaniel entered the grand ballroom where most attendees had already gathered. Isabella's striking beauty and poised demeanor instantly drew numerous admiring glances.

The event's host, Joshua Simpson, recognized Nathaniel immediately. He flashed a warm smile and began making his way toward them. Just as he approached, a new group of guests arrived at the entrance.

Joshua froze mid-step, his expression shifting to disbelief.

A hush fell over the crowd as all eyes turned toward the newcomers.

Still facing away from the entrance, Isabella and Nathaniel exchanged puzzled looks at the sudden change in atmosphere.

Before they could turn around, Joshua gave them an apologetic glance before rushing past to greet the new arrivals.

"Good evening, Mr. Whitmore, Mr. Montgomery, and Mr. Westbrook."

Isabella's pulse quickened as realization dawned. She turned slowly, her smile faltering for just a moment.

There they stood - Alexander, Julian, and Oliver.

Victoria had come too.

To Isabella's surprise, Victoria wore the exact same designer gown she'd seen at the boutique yesterday - the one priced at over 30 million dors.

Victoria's statuesque figure combined with the gown's exquisite craftsmanship created an aura of untouchable elegance that captivated the room.

"Is that Alexander Whitmore and his circle? They never attend these events!"

"What's the occasion tonight?"

"And who's that breathtaking woman with them? His girlfriend? I'd give ten years of my life for someone like her!"

"Personally, I prefer the one in ivory. There's something rarer about her quiet grace. Pity she's already taken."

Isabella overheard another conversation nearby.

"That gown! I saw it in the boutique yesterday! The manager said it was custom-made for someone's girlfriend. Now we know who dropped 30 million dors!"

"Thirty million? Are you serious?"

Isabella's gaze lowered slowly.

Seeing Victoria in the gown confirmed her suspicions. While the Kensington family was wealthy, such extravagance for a single event was beyond them. For Alexander, however, 30 million was pocket change.

Clearly, Alexander had planned this appearance weeks in advance, having the gown custom-made specifically for tonight's event.

Nathaniel, knowing how rarely Alexander attended social functions, was equally surprised by this coincidence. That he'd brought Victoria along was even more unexpected.

He studied Isabella's face with concern. "Bella—"

Isabella smiled serenely and shook her head. "I'm perfectly fine."
###Chapter 30

Isabella's initial shock had already faded into indifference.

The crowd surged around Alexander and his entourage, completely obscuring her presence.

To outsiders, Isabella appeared serene and composed. But Nathaniel knew better - beneath that calm exterior lay an iron will. Once she set her mind on something, she pursued it with relentless determination.

In her professional life, this trait served her well. When a project captured her interest, she'd pour every ounce of energy into it, regardless of market viability.

For Isabella, action always trumped speculation. The only way to know if something worked was to try it.

This philosophy extended to her personal life. She'd loved Alexander with such intensity that she'd gambled her future on him - abandoning further education to build a life together.

Though the price had been steep, Nathaniel had never detected a flicker of regret in her eyes. So when she claimed to be ready to move on, he believed her without question.

He flashed an easy smile. "Thirsty?"

Isabella returned the smile. "Absolutely."

They wove through the throng toward the bar area.

"Wine?" Nathaniel suggested.

"Just a glass."

While not a habitual drinker, Isabella could hold her liquor surprisingly well.

Their glasses clinked softly as they retreated to a quiet corner to observe the crowd.

Before long, an older gentleman approached. "Nathaniel! Didn't expect to see you here."

"Theodore!" Nathaniel greeted the professor warmly. "I was actually hoping to run into you."

Theodore Sinclair chuckled skeptically. "That so?"

"Honest. I wanted to introduce you to someone."

"Oh?"

When Theodore's gaze landed on Isabella, he was immediately struck by her striking beauty and poised demeanor. Though puzzled by Nathaniel's intentions, he trusted the younger man's judgment implicitly.

"Remember that programming language project you mentioned hitting roadblocks with?" Nathaniel gestured to Isabella. "This is Isabella Sinclair. She's brilliant with language programming - I guarantee she can help."

"Your protégé?" Theodore's eyebrows shot up.

Nathaniel's mentor Frederick Aldridge was a titan in the AI field. All his students, though young, were already making waves in tech circles.

Yet Isabella's name didn't ring any bells.

Nathaniel grinned. "The Cuap programming language? That was her team's work eight years ago."

In programming circles, few achievements carried more weight than Cuap.

Theodore's jaw dropped. "Seriously?"

"Dead serious. Talk to her - you'll see."

Eager now, Theodore fired off several technical questions to test Isabella's knowledge.

Their conversation quickly escalated into an animated discussion about his project's challenges. Theodore grew increasingly excited as Isabella offered insightful solutions, their exchange flowing effortlessly.

Nathaniel sipped his drink contentedly, happy to observe from the sidelines.

Then movement caught his eye. Victoria Kensington was making her way toward them.

When she noticed his gaze, Victoria offered a polite nod and smile.

Nathaniel froze momentarily, recalling Victoria's complicated status. Before he could react, she'd already reached them.

"Mr. Graves," she greeted smoothly.
###Chapter 31

Nathaniel was just opening his mouth when Isabella spotted someone moving toward them. She turned slightly and found herself staring directly into Victoria Kensington's cold eyes.

Victoria offered Nathaniel a polite smile, but when her gaze landed on Isabella, her expression turned to ice. She looked away immediately, dismissing Isabella as if she were invisible.

Just as Victoria was about to flash Nathaniel another smile, he unexpectedly turned to Isabella instead. "This is Ms. Sinclair, my dear friend," he said smoothly. "Would you like to get acquainted?"

His words carried three unmistakable messages. First, he and Isabella shared an intimate connection. Second, he knew about the bad blood between Victoria and Isabella. Third, he'd chosen sides - and it wasn't Victoria's.

Victoria hadn't known about Nathaniel and Isabella's prior relationship. The nature of their bond remained unclear to her. But his meaning was crystal clear now.

"Mr. Graves," she said icily, "are you implying I shouldn't bother showing up at InnovaTech tomorrow?"

Nathaniel set down his glass with an appreciative smile and applauded softly. "Ms. Kensington, you catch on quick."

He could've been diplomatic. He chose not to be. The message was clear - he stood with Isabella, and this decision was for her benefit.

Victoria remained utterly unfazed. No embarrassment colored her cheeks, no humiliation darkened her eyes. In her mind, InnovaTech's value paled next to the Whitmore family's prestige.

Nathaniel Graves wasn't important enough to humiliate her. With that thought, she turned away without another word.

Isabella watched the exchange, a warm smile playing on her lips. She was about to speak to Nathaniel when she noticed Alexander, Julian, and Oliver all turning their attention toward her.

Their focus seemed primarily on Victoria. Probably surprised to see her here too.

Julian and Oliver looked shocked, but Alexander's face remained impassive. Calm. As if she weren't his wife at all, but some stranger he'd never met.

"Something wrong?" Nathaniel followed her gaze.

Isabella shook her head with a smile. "Not at all."

By then, Victoria had already left. With her gone, Alexander and the others lost interest in Isabella's presence. She resumed her conversation with Theodore.

When Theodore excused himself, Isabella took a sip of her drink and caught Oliver smirking at her while Alexander's back was turned. Oliver raised his glass in her direction.

Isabella frowned, confused by Oliver's behavior. He shot her a disdainful look before turning away completely, as if she didn't exist.

Suddenly it clicked - Oliver must think she and Nathaniel had ganged up on Victoria. His smirk suggested this wasn't over. Her frown deepened.

Soon after, Joshua returned from mingling. After greeting everyone warmly, he asked Nathaniel, "You know Ms. Kensington?"

He meant Victoria.

Nathaniel grinned. "We've met. Why?"

"I learned a bit about her background earlier. She mentioned being from Salzburg, not Baumond."

"Her family's quite successful there. But compared to powerhouses like the Whitmores, Montgomerys, and Westbrooks here in Baumond?" Joshua shrugged. "They're small fish in a big pond."
###Chapter 32

Alexander's voice cut through the silence. "Well?"

Nathaniel responded thoughtfully. "Considering her background, it's astonishing she's even allowed in our social circles, much less the Whitmore family's inner circle. Yet Ms. Kensington has effortlessly infiltrated their core group and established powerful connections. She's truly exceptional."

"I was initially confused by Julian's sudden appearance at my dinner party," Nathaniel continued. "But I later learned he came specifically to introduce guests to Ms. Kensington."

"Julian's efforts to network for Ms. Kensington and bring Oliver and others along proves his serious intentions. If she were just a fling, he wouldn't bother. With Julian backing her, the Kensington family will flourish."

Nathaniel and Isabella listened intently, both remaining silent.

Finally, Nathaniel sighed deeply. "The Kensingtons are truly blessed to have a daughter like her. It's genuinely impressive."

As Nathaniel finished speaking, Isabella glanced around and realized Alexander and his group had already left the banquet hall early. Despite knowing she was present, Alexander hadn't so much as glanced her way all evening.

Thirty minutes later, Isabella and Nathaniel departed as well. When she arrived home, her phone buzzed with a call from Alexander.

Isabella hesitated, wondering if he was calling to reprimand her for what might have appeared as bullying Victoria alongside Nathaniel. After all, Oliver had just warned her at the banquet - likely because Alexander had put him up to it.

Two seconds later, she answered calmly. "Hello."

Alexander's icy command came through. "Come home."

She saw no reason to comply. "If you have something to say-"

"Sophia has a fever and wants to see you." The line went dead.

Isabella froze.

She grabbed her keys, slipped on shoes, and rushed out. Arriving at the estate, she exited her car.

Noticing Alexander's absence when she entered didn't concern her. She went straight to Sophia's second-floor bedroom.

Sophia lay battling a high fever with an IV drip. In discomfort, she reached out weakly. "Mommy," she whispered, seeking comfort in Isabella's embrace.

Careful of the IV needle, Isabella held her close and asked Margaret, "Has she eaten?"

"She threw up everything shortly after eating."

Isabella frowned and consulted the doctor for details. Turning to Sophia, who clung to her unwilling to let go, she asked, "Hungry? I'll make your favorite chicken noodle soup. You can have some after the IV."

Sophia nodded weakly.

Back when they were together, Isabella always nursed Sophia through illnesses. The child never tolerated others' cooking during sickness, always preferring Isabella's meals.

Sophia frowned. "Where's Daddy? Is he back yet?"

Isabella stiffened. She'd assumed Alexander had returned when he called. Not seeing him in the room, she thought he might be in the study. Sophia's question revealed he hadn't come home at all.

The party venue was actually closer to the estate than Isabella's current home. Moreover, Alexander had left at least thirty minutes before her.

Even if he'd taken Victoria home first, he should have returned by now. Unless... he hadn't left immediately after dropping Victoria off. Or perhaps he had no intention of coming home tonight at all.
###Chapter 33

Footsteps echoed outside the door. Alexander was back.

"Dad!"

He strode into the room, making straight for the bed.

Isabella tried to set Sophia down to give him space. But the little girl clung tighter, reaching for Alexander while still nestled in Isabella's arms.

He lifted Sophia effortlessly.

As he held their daughter, Isabella caught the familiar musk of his cologne. Mixed with it was a delicate floral perfume she recognized instantly - the same scent Victoria had been wearing at dinner.

Isabella looked away and stepped back until his scent no longer surrounded her.

Alexander rested his watch-clad hand against Sophia's forehead. "Her temperature?" His voice was all business. "Any improvement?"

Isabella repeated the doctor's words mechanically. "The fever broke, but it could spike again."

He nodded.

Settling on the bed with Sophia, he frowned when she squirmed. "Daddy, your jacket scratches."

Without a word, he shrugged off the tailored blazer and handed it to Isabella. She took it automatically, then froze as the mingled scents rose from the fabric. The reality hit her like ice water - their divorce was imminent.

Once, she would have treasured holding his jacket, pressing it close as if it could bridge the growing distance between them. Now she set it aside carelessly. "I'll make chicken noodle soup."

With both parents home, Sophia perked up immediately. "Okay. Thanks, Mommy."

Isabella forced a smile and left. She didn't see Alexander's lingering gaze on the jacket draped over the chair.

Twenty minutes later, soup simmering, she washed up and hesitated at the foot of the stairs.

At the second-floor landing, she turned and spotted Alexander at the far end of the hallway, phone to his ear by the window.

"The fever's down. Don't worry." His voice carried.

Was that Victoria he was reassuring? Did the woman actually care about Sophia's wellbeing? Isabella turned sharply and entered the nursery.

Sophia slept soundly post-IV, her forehead damp with sweat. Margaret was dabbing it gently when Isabella entered. The housekeeper immediately stood, offering the cloth.

Margaret expected Isabella to take over as usual. After all, she'd always handled everything for both Sophia and Alexander alone.

Isabella shook her head. Margaret blinked in surprise but quickly resumed tending to Sophia.

Perched on the couch, Isabella asked, "The doctor left?"

"Yes, ma'am."

"What did he say? Will the fever return?" She needed to know whether to stay.

"Doctor said it likely won't."

"Good." With Sophia recovering, her presence wasn't necessary overnight.

The soup bubbled softly. After a while, she went downstairs to find Margaret in the kitchen.

"Let me finish, Mrs. Whitmore." Margaret gave her a concerned look. "You look exhausted. Go rest."
###Chapter 34

Isabella stepped out of the kitchen, her hands still damp from washing vegetables. Alexander sprawled across the living room couch, his tailored suit jacket discarded over the armrest as he flipped through financial reports. His gaze flickered toward her for half a second before returning to the papers.

She halted mid-step. Before everything changed, she would've curled up beside him with a book, content to share the silence. Now the space between them crackled with unspoken accusations.

Turning abruptly, she headed upstairs. Not once did Alexander call her back. The absence of confrontation unsettled her. After what happened with Victoria at the gala, she'd expected fireworks. Instead, she got this... glacial indifference.

Sophia's bedroom door creaked open as Isabella reached the landing. "Mom?" Her daughter's voice sounded thin. "I'm starving. Is the soup ready?"

"Almost, sweetheart." Isabella pressed her palm against Sophia's forehead. "How's your fever?"

"Gone!" Sophia beamed, though dark circles still shadowed her eyes.

Relief loosened the knot between Isabella's shoulders. Back in the kitchen, she hummed as she stirred the simmering pot. "Sophia! Chicken noodle soup's served!"

She was ladling the golden broth into a bowl when Alexander appeared in the doorway. Sophia tugged his sleeve. "Dad's eating with us, Mom. Shouldn't you make more?"

Margaret materialized with an extra bowl before Isabella could respond. "Plenty to go around," the housekeeper winked.

Isabella hadn't planned to eat, but the pot held enough for three. She served Alexander first, noting how his long fingers cradled the spoon with aristocratic precision. Sophia inhaled her first bite. "This tastes like heaven! Why don't you cook this anymore?"

"You can have it every week if you want," Margaret chuckled.

"Promise?" Sophia's eyes sparkled.

Isabella kept her gaze fixed on her untouched bowl. Across the table, Alexander's silence felt heavier than the antique silverware.

"Mom?" Sophia's voice turned syrupy sweet. "Will you sleep in my room tonight? Please?"

The refusal died on Isabella's lips when she noticed her daughter's pallor. "Of course." Neither Alexander nor Sophia finished their portions. The leftover soup congealed in the pot as they left the dining room.

Post-fever Sophia still insisted on showering. Isabella hovered outside the steamy bathroom, arms crossed. "Don't catch a chill again."

After toweling off her daughter, Isabella hesitated outside the master suite. The empty room surprised her. She'd expected Alexander to purge every trace of her existence. Yet her perfume bottles still lined the vanity, her silk robe hung exactly where she'd left it. Even the novel on her nightstand remained dog-eared to the same page.

The walk-in closet revealed rows of untouched designer dresses. Of course he wouldn't remove them, she realized bitterly. Not while their divorce remained pending. Grabbing pajamas, she hurried to Sophia's room.

Sophia was already in bed, scrolling through her tablet. She frowned at the clothes in Isabella's arms. "You're showering here?"

"Thought I'd keep you company." Isabella ducked into the en-suite just as the bedroom door opened again. Alexander's deep murmur filtered through the running water. Her fingers tightened around the faucet handle.

The game of pretend continued. But for how much longer?
###Chapter 35

Alexander's eyes flicked toward the bathroom door.

Sophia piped up, "Mom's showering in there."

"Hmm." His gaze lingered. "Did you ask her to use our shower?"

"No. She brought her own clothes."

Alexander didn't press further. After a brief exchange, he simply told Sophia to get some rest before walking away.

Inside the bathroom, Isabella heard muffled voices but couldn't make out the words. The medicine had knocked Sophia out quickly. By the time Isabella finished showering, the girl was already curled up asleep.

She slipped into bed beside her daughter.

Sophia immediately burrowed into her arms, nuzzling against her shoulder. "You smell like vanilla," she murmured sleepily. "And you're so warm."

No one hugged like Isabella did—not even Victoria. But Sophia knew better than to mention that name around her mother.

Exhaustion claimed them both quickly.

Isabella slept fitfully. Sophia had always been a restless sleeper when sick, constantly kicking off the blankets. Like clockwork, Isabella woke every few hours to tuck her back in.

Dawn found her staring out the window, watching Alexander's familiar morning jog routine below.

After freshening up, she headed downstairs to cook breakfast. Thirty minutes later, she handed the kitchen over to Margaret. Confirming Sophia's fever hadn't spiked overnight, she grabbed her purse and keys.

The front door clicked shut just as Sophia stirred awake. "Where's Mommy?"

"Mrs. Whitmore had to step out," Margaret said.

Sophia's face fell.

"But she made your favorite pancakes before leaving."

That brightened the girl instantly. Though still recovering, her appetite had returned with a vengeance. She practically skipped downstairs.

Alexander entered the kitchen moments later. His eyes swept the room. "Where's Isabella?"

"She left earlier."

He accepted this with a curt nod.

Meanwhile, Isabella scarfed down toast at her apartment while packing her work bag. The doorbell interrupted her.

The security monitor showed Abigail Winslow and her daughter Charlotte waiting outside.

"Ms. Sinclair!" Abigail wrung her hands. "My mother-in-law's been rushed to hospital. Could you possibly take Charlotte to school?"

Isabella agreed—the kindergarten was on her way to work anyway.

Twenty minutes later, as she hunted for parking near the school gates, three familiar figures came into view.

Sophia bounced between Alexander and Victoria Kensington, clutching the woman's hand like it was a lifeline. Alexander walked protectively beside them, shielding them from passing cars.

Charlotte gasped. "Ms. Sinclair! Look, it's Sophia!"

Isabella's grip tightened on the steering wheel. "I see."

"Is that pretty lady Sophia's other mommy?" Charlotte asked innocently. "Does she have two mommies?"
###Chapter 36

Isabella didn't respond, simply ruffling Charlotte's hair. "Promise me you won't tell Sophia I sent you here?"

Charlotte nodded eagerly. "Cross my heart."

Ever since Sophia had snapped at her for hugging Isabella, the little girl had been wary around her. Sophia still seemed upset too - every time they passed each other, she'd glare daggers.

Alexander, Victoria, and Sophia made such a perfect picture together. Isabella watched them for a moment before turning away.

When Alexander and Victoria finally left, Isabella stepped out of the car with Charlotte.

Sophia's teacher recognized Isabella immediately. She'd just witnessed Sophia being dropped off by her father and another woman, so seeing Isabella now with Charlotte confused her. "Ms. Sinclair, you and Charlotte—"

"Mrs. Kensington had an emergency," Isabella explained smoothly. "She asked me to bring Charlotte today."

The teacher exhaled in relief. "Oh, I see. Sophia just arrived too, but—"

"I know." Isabella smiled knowingly.

Though puzzled, the teacher didn't press further. Isabella clearly understood the situation and didn't seem bothered by it.

Back in the car after dropping off Charlotte, Nathaniel called. "What's your ETA?"

"Ten minutes out."

"Perfect."

When Isabella arrived at InnovaTech, Nathaniel was already waiting at the entrance. He pulled her into an embrace the moment she appeared. "Welcome back, darling!"

Isabella returned his hug with a smile.

Meanwhile, Sebastian Holloway stood by a corridor window, phone to his ear. The commotion at the entrance caught his attention - especially when he spotted Isabella.

He quickly looked away as Victoria answered his call. "Morning, Victoria! When are you getting to the office?"

By the end of their conversation, Sebastian's expression had darkened. When he returned to his desk, colleagues immediately noticed. "Everything alright? You look upset."

Sebastian just shook his head silently.

As more employees trickled in, whispers spread. "Mr. Graves just arrived with some stunning woman."

"Really? Like celebrity-level gorgeous?"

"Even better. She's breathtaking!"

Sebastian's mind flashed to the beauty who'd embraced Nathaniel moments ago.

Then came the bombshell: "Heard she's our new hire starting today."

Sebastian froze. Victoria had been his junior at university. When she'd expressed interest in InnovaTech, he'd personally recommended her to Nathaniel.

Their initial meeting had gone well. Today was supposed to be Victoria's first day. But when he'd called to confirm her arrival time, she'd said Nathaniel had withdrawn the offer for "personal reasons."

As Sebastian wrestled with this revelation, Nathaniel entered the office with Isabella by his side.
###Chapter 37

Gasps filled the room as Isabella Sinclair stepped in. One excited employee blurted out, "Mr. Graves, is this stunning woman our new team member?"

"You're quick on the uptake." Nathaniel flashed a knowing smile.

He cleared his throat. "Let me introduce—"

Sebastian Holloway cut him off mid-sentence. "Did you fire Victoria Kensington because of her?"

A tense silence followed before Nathaniel nodded. "Correct. I'll explain—"

Sebastian's sharp gaze landed on Isabella. "Victoria earned her PhD from an Ivy League at twenty-five. Ms. Sinclair, your credentials must be extraordinary to replace her."

The air thickened. Earlier, Victoria had hinted at personal reasons behind her rejection, but Sebastian had seen Isabella and Nathaniel embrace. His mind jumped to conclusions.

No one at YodaVision matched Victoria's brilliance. Not just locally—nationally. He doubted this newcomer could compare.

Before Isabella could respond, he smirked. "You look too young to even have a master's degree."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. This conversation needed privacy, especially given the bad blood between Isabella and Victoria. But Sebastian's public confrontation derailed that plan.

"Sebastian—"

The engineer waved him off. "I'm speaking to Ms. Sinclair." His stare turned icy. "Cat got your tongue? Or is your alma mater too embarrassing to mention?"

Isabella's posture remained unshaken. "I haven't completed my doctorate, but—"

Sebastian snorted. Just as he suspected. Not every woman could be Victoria Kensington.

"But what?" He sneered. "Think you can compete with us just because men fawn over your looks?"

Nathaniel's voice turned dangerous. "That's enough!"

Sebastian ripped off his employee badge. "I resign."

Nathaniel froze. This escalation shocked even him.

"You've changed, Mr. Graves." Sebastian's disappointment cut deep. "I thought you valued merit over... distractions."

As he stormed out, Nathaniel called after him, "Take time to reconsider. My door stays open—"

The slam of the exit door drowned his final words.
###Chapter 38

"No need. I'm done with YodaVision for good!" Sebastian snapped as he stormed off without a backward glance.

Isabella valued talent deeply. She turned to Nathaniel, who gave a subtle shake of his head, signaling her to wait.

Nathaniel recognized Sebastian's brilliance but couldn't ignore the obvious - the man had been infatuated with Victoria since day one.

While Sebastian's feelings weren't Nathaniel's concern, his judgment had clearly been compromised. The way he'd lashed out at Isabella's arrival was completely unprofessional and unacceptable.

Moreover, their work involved government-classified technology protected by NDAs. Isabella's true identity couldn't be disclosed.

Sebastian's rash behavior stemmed from his blind admiration for Victoria. Even if Isabella demonstrated her skills later, he'd likely remain skeptical.

He'd probably insist Victoria could outperform her. The truth was, Isabella would inevitably surpass Sebastian soon enough.

If Sebastian believed Nathaniel favored Isabella, he might become a liability - a risk the company couldn't afford.

Isabella felt relieved seeing Nathaniel understood the situation perfectly.

Nathaniel cleared his throat. "While Isabella hasn't pursued a PhD, I assure you her technical skills are exceptional."

The office staff exchanged confused glances. They knew Sebastian had recommended a friend before, but without details, they remained in the dark.

A similar incident had occurred last year when a senior executive's mistress joined the team. The woman appeared polished and articulate.

She claimed to be a grad student from an elite university with solid knowledge. In reality, she couldn't grasp basic concepts. They eventually doubted she'd ever attended college.

History seemed to repeat itself with Nathaniel replacing Sebastian's highly-qualified referral with Isabella. No wonder Sebastian was furious. The team questioned Nathaniel's objectivity.

Noticing their skepticism, Nathaniel didn't press further. "What project was Sebastian working on recently?"

Dominic Vega, Sebastian's colleague, provided a concise briefing.

Nathaniel turned to Isabella. "Could you take over Sebastian's remaining work?"

"Of course," Isabella agreed.

She addressed the team graciously, "I look forward to learning from you all." They responded politely but cautiously, hoping she'd prove competent enough not to burden them.

While most colleagues remained indifferent, Dominic struggled to hide his displeasure.

His expression darkened momentarily before forcing professionalism. "All necessary files are here. Let me know if you need anything."

"Thank you," Isabella replied simply.

Dominic sighed internally. At least her attitude was decent.
###Chapter 39

Sebastian Holloway stormed out of YodaVision headquarters and immediately dialed Victoria Kensington's number.

"Isabella Sinclair joined YodaVision?" His voice was laced with disbelief.

Victoria's response was icy. "Hmm. Didn't you know?"

Sebastian had assumed Victoria orchestrated Isabella's recruitment. Clearly, he was wrong.

"No." Victoria's tone turned sharp. She'd believed Nathaniel Graves refused to hire Isabella out of spite. Now she wondered if Isabella had left Fleming Group entirely.

Sebastian's breath hitched. "Then what was this 'personal reason' you mentioned?"

"Just some unfinished business between us." Victoria's evasion was deliberate.

"But—"

"What's the problem?" Victoria snapped.

The realization hit Sebastian like a freight train. His resignation had nothing to do with Victoria. "How qualified is Isabella anyway? Rumor says she never completed her doctorate."

Victoria's laugh was cruel. "She doesn't even have a master's degree. Just an undergraduate diploma."

"What?" Sebastian nearly dropped his phone.

"Exactly." Victoria's voice dripped with disdain.

The revelation stunned her too. Isabella leaving Fleming Group was one thing. But skipping higher education to jump companies? It showed staggering lack of ambition.

Sebastian regrouped. "Victoria, what's your next move?"

"Training season starts next week. Work can wait." Her focus was absolute.

Sebastian exhaled. Of course. Victoria always compartmentalized perfectly. Somehow she balanced professional chess, equestrian sports, and corporate warfare without breaking stride.

Her ruthless efficiency was what set her apart. If Victoria chose this path, she'd already calculated every variable.

Meanwhile, in Fleming Group's executive suite, Alexander Whitmore barely glanced up from his documents. "Coffee, Daniel."

"Right away, Mr. Whitmore."

Olivia Chambers' hands trembled as she prepared the brew. Following Isabella's meticulous instructions, she measured each component with surgical precision. Daniel delivered the cup without comment.

Alexander stirred absently, then froze. The aroma was wrong.

One sip confirmed it. He slammed the cup down. "Again."

Daniel blinked. "Sir?"

Olivia panicked when the order came. "Another one? The sugar was exact! The temperature—"

"I don't know," Daniel admitted.

Her second attempt fared worse. Alexander rejected it by scent alone.

"What's happening here?" Alexander's voice could frost glass.

Daniel swallowed. "First attempt jitters. Temperature control issues."

Alexander's gaze sharpened. "Olivia? Where's Isabella?"

The silence stretched. "She resigned. Last Thursday."

Alexander's expression didn't change. He'd known about Daniel's complaints, the threatened termination. But this?

He nodded once. Isabella would be back. She always came back.
###Chapter 40

"Then, Daniel asked, What about the coffee—"

"Take it away. Just water for me."

"Understood."

At noon, Nathaniel attended a charity luncheon while Isabella ate alone in the corporate cafeteria. Her new colleagues maintained polite professionalism, keeping their distance. Isabella didn't mind the solitude.

She returned to her workstation after lunch. By 5 PM, she approached Dominic. "Mind reviewing this? I've nearly finished."

Dominic blinked. He scanned the files she'd sent, confusion morphing into shock as he processed the content. His jaw slackened.

"You—completed this already?" This workload typically took Sebastian ten days. Yet Isabella had not only deciphered it but perfected the assignment in under twenty-four hours.

Isabella nodded.

Dominic stared, speechless. Her solution wasn't just flawless—she'd conceptualized innovative approaches for his remaining tasks that he'd never considered.

The commotion drew other team members. One by one, they crowded around, their astonishment mirroring Dominic's.

Regaining composure, Dominic studied her. "Why aren't you pursuing a PhD?"

Isabella hesitated. "I never applied."

The irony stung—a room full of Ivy League postgraduates outshone by an undergraduate.

"Financial constraints?"

But her designer handbag and impeccable work contradicted that theory.

Isabella lowered her gaze. "Personal reasons." She offered a small smile. "Perhaps I'll reconsider graduate studies later."

After assisting several colleagues with their projects, Isabella left at 7 PM.

Nathaniel leaned against the lobby wall. "You obliterated their prejudices in one day. Earned their respect too. Not that I'm surprised."

Isabella grinned. "My treat for dinner?"

"Isn't that why I'm waiting?"

They exited together. Twenty minutes later, as they ascended the restaurant staircase, a child barreled toward them.

Isabella sidestepped, losing balance. Nathaniel's arm snapped around her waist, steadying her.

She exhaled, preparing to thank him—then froze. Alexander and Oliver stood ten feet away, watching. Oliver's eyebrows shot up; Alexander's expression darkened.

Isabella pushed Nathaniel away abruptly.

"Twist your ankle?" Nathaniel asked, oblivious to their audience.

"No."

"Good. Let's proceed."

She followed, deliberately avoiding Alexander's gaze.

Oliver whistled. "That was your wife, right?"

Alexander remained silent.

"Playing hard to get while cozying up to Nathaniel? Bold strategy to regain your attention."

Alexander's knuckles whitened around his glass. "Delusional."

"Let's go," Alexander said coldly, turning on his heel.
###Chapter 41

The private dining room at The Grandeur was already occupied when Alexander and Oliver arrived. Victoria Kensington and Sophia Whitmore were waiting for them.

Victoria arched an eyebrow. "You're in an unusually good mood today."

Oliver chuckled. "Just ran into someone rather amusing earlier."

After dinner, Alexander and Sophia returned home.

Sophia bounded up the stairs the moment they entered, calling out excitedly, "Mom! Mom!"

Margaret Dawson emerged from the kitchen, wiping her hands on her apron. "Mrs. Whitmore hasn't returned yet."

Sophia's face fell. "Again? She's been so busy lately." With a pout, she trudged upstairs.

Noticing Alexander's stillness, Margaret inquired, "Mr. Whitmore?"

He shook his head. "Nothing." Then followed his daughter upstairs.

That night, Alexander realized Isabella hadn't come home.

Next morning, Sophia woke up expecting her mother's signature breakfast. Seeing the ordinary spread on the table, she frowned. "Mom didn't make breakfast?"

"Mrs. Whitmore isn't home," Margaret confirmed.

Sophia looked puzzled. "Where did she go? Back to Grandma's place?"

"Perhaps." Margaret didn't dare speculate without confirmation.

Sophia turned to her father. "Dad—"

Alexander replied casually, "Call her yourself if you're curious."

"I'll ask her tonight."

Meanwhile, Isabella headed straight to YodaVision after breakfast.

Nathaniel Graves was about to discuss their new product line when his phone rang.

The caller asked bluntly, "Did your company cross the Whitmores?"

Nathaniel froze, glancing at Isabella before putting the call on speaker. "What?"

"We just intercepted some moves against your company from the Whitmore camp."

Isabella's hands clenched into fists.

Since that disastrous banquet where she'd confronted Victoria, Alexander had been silent. She'd assumed he'd let it go.

How wrong she'd been. He wasn't ignoring it—he'd simply chosen action over words. By targeting her company, he was making clear the price for challenging Victoria.

Nathaniel grasped the situation instantly.

He squeezed Isabella's hand. "Don't worry. Our government connections will protect us."

Isabella nodded stiffly.

Thank God for that. Otherwise—

With Alexander's resources, YodaVision would've been crippled if not destroyed.

He really would move heaven and earth for Victoria.

Nathaniel frowned. "If they can't touch YodaVision, will they go after the Sinclairs?"

Isabella shook her head. "No."

With Eleanor Whitmore still alive, Alexander wouldn't dare strike directly at her family. He still respected his grandmother too much.

"Good."

As evening approached, Sophia called. "Mom, when are you coming home? I'm starving."

"Didn't you ask Margaret to cook?"

"But I want your honey-glazed ribs!" The uneaten dish from last time had become an obsession.

Isabella hesitated.

Before she could respond, Sophia added, "Dad's away on business. It's so boring here. Come home soon."

Alexander was traveling?

Isabella paused. They were divorcing—his whereabouts shouldn't concern her.

But until Sophia turned eighteen, she remained her responsibility.
###Chapter 42

Isabella typed a quick reply. Understood. I'll return shortly.

That evening, she prepared honey-glazed ribs and homemade soup for Sophia. They spent the next two days together at the townhouse.

On Friday, Margaret called, inviting them for a family dinner. Isabella brought Sophia along to the Sinclair estate.

Only Margaret was home when they arrived. The rest of the family were either attending social events or still at school.

Margaret hadn't known about Sophia's return. Her face lit up when she saw the little girl walk in behind Isabella.

Sophia had always been close to her great-grandmother. Within minutes, she had Margaret laughing with her animated stories.

They decided to stay overnight. The next morning, Isabella rose early to make breakfast.

Watching her granddaughter expertly flip pancakes, Margaret sighed. "You never used to cook before marriage."

Isabella smiled knowingly. "It helps me think. I've grown to enjoy it."

Margaret noticed Isabella had gained some healthy weight since her last visit. The hollows in her cheeks had filled out.

After breakfast, Isabella went upstairs to check on Sophia. The girl was already brushing her teeth in the ensuite.

While gathering Sophia's pajamas, Isabella noticed a message flash on her tablet screen.

From Victoria Kensington: "Sophia darling, I'm returning this afternoon. Let's have dinner tonight. I'll take you shopping tomorrow."

Isabella deliberately looked away as she tossed the pajamas into the laundry hamper.

When she returned, Sophia was clutching her tablet. The girl quickly hid it behind her back when she saw Isabella.

"Pancakes are ready," Isabella said casually. "Let's go eat."

Sophia bounded off the bed. "Mom's pancakes! I've missed these!"

At the breakfast table, Margaret asked, "What would you like for dinner, sweetheart? I'll have the chef prepare it."

Sophia hesitated. She knew Margaret disapproved of Victoria. "Grandma...Dad's coming home tonight. I should have dinner with him."

Margaret's smile faltered, but she didn't protest. Over the past two years, Sophia had grown attached to Alexander.

Isabella pretended not to notice the lie. She served Margaret another portion. "I'll stay here with you."

It was unconventional for a wife to remain at her family home when her husband returned. But given Alexander's treatment of Isabella, Margaret couldn't care less about propriety.

"That's my thoughtful girl," Margaret said warmly.

Sophia looked relieved. Now she wouldn't need to make excuses to meet Victoria.

When it was time to leave, Margaret tried to pack snacks for Sophia.

Isabella intercepted them. "Save these for Charles' children."

She didn't accompany Sophia to the door. Instead, she called Alexander's butler to arrange transportation.

Margaret found this odd but didn't question it.
###Chapter 43

Sophia must have been thoroughly enjoying her time with Victoria. She hadn't reached out to Isabella all weekend.

Monday arrived, and Isabella went to work at YodaVision as usual. Just before clocking out, Emily called with a dinner invitation.

During their meal, Isabella excused herself to the restroom and unexpectedly crossed paths with Julian.

Without hesitation, Isabella pretended not to see him and walked straight past.

But Julian stopped abruptly, turning his head to watch her go.

Isabella noticed but deliberately ignored him.

When she exited the restroom, Julian was still standing exactly where they'd passed each other, as if waiting for her.

"Dining here?" he asked when he saw her emerge.

His tone suggested he'd been lingering there intentionally.

"Yes," she replied coolly. Then added with deliberate indifference, "Does Mr. Montgomery think I followed you here again?"

"That's not what I meant," Julian said after a slight hesitation.

Isabella didn't care to decipher his meaning. Nor did she want to.

She walked away without another word, and Julian didn't stop her.

After leaving the restaurant, Emily wanted to buy a birthday gift for her mother. Isabella accompanied her to an upscale jewelry boutique.

Emily had just fallen in love with an emerald necklace and begun discussing the purchase with the store manager when a familiar voice interrupted from the entrance.

"Hello, I'm here to collect my jewelry."

Isabella froze at the sound.

"Ah, Mr. Kensington!" The store owner immediately greeted the newcomer with a practiced smile. After giving Isabella and Emily an apologetic glance, he hurried over. "Your custom piece is ready and packaged—"

"Isabella?"

Reginald Kensington confirmed her identity before approaching. "Here to order custom jewelry too?"

Isabella glanced at him but remained silent.

Noticing her cold demeanor, Reginald's expression darkened. "Isabella—"

She turned away, ignoring him, and instead asked Emily, "Are you sure about this one?"

Emily, unfamiliar with Reginald, nudged Isabella discreetly. The older man carried an air of refinement despite his age. "Who is that?" she whispered.

Isabella didn't answer.

But Reginald persisted. "Isabella, how have you been lately?"

She pressed her lips together before finally acknowledging him. "What do you want?" Her voice was glacial.

"Do you have to speak to your father that way?" Reginald asked gently.

"How exactly should I speak to you?" she countered icily.

"I know I've made mistakes, but you must understand I've always cared about you."

Isabella let out a bitter laugh. "Oh yes, your care. That's why you encouraged Victoria to pursue my husband and told Alexander to take good care of her. Such touching concern."

"Isabella—" Reginald frowned. "I understand your feelings, but Victoria and Alexander truly love each other. You can't force emotions, so why—"

"Exactly. Emotions can't be forced. That justified your affair back then, and now she's proudly following her mother's footsteps as a homewrecker. How noble."

Reginald's face darkened. "Isabella! When did you become so willful?"

"Willful? So if I immediately divorce Alexander to make way for Victoria, would that make me obedient?"

"Reginald, what's going on?"

At that moment, Penelope and Genevieve entered the boutique. Penelope spotted Isabella first.
###Chapter 44

Isabella's lips curved into a cool smile. "Penelope Kensington. What an unexpected surprise. You haven't aged a day."

"Mother—" Genevieve's face darkened at the compliment.

She'd always known Isabella was beautiful, but seeing her now after years apart was like a slap to the face. That flawless complexion, that effortless elegance—it made Genevieve's blood boil.

Then she remembered. What did it matter? Alexander Whitmore would never look at Isabella twice. His heart belonged only to Victoria.

The thought soothed her bruised ego.

Reginald Kensington cleared his throat. "Penelope, what brings you here?"

"We missed you, Uncle Reginald," Genevieve cut in sweetly. Then her eyes landed on the open jewelry case. "Oh! Is this the anniversary gift you commissioned for Aunt Eleanor? It's exquisite!"

Reginald nodded. "Indeed."

"You always go above and beyond for their anniversary," Genevieve gushed. "Such a devoted husband!"

A faint chuckle escaped Reginald.

Emily Donovan had pieced together exactly who these people were. "Vipers," she muttered under her breath. She grabbed Isabella's wrist. "Let's go."

"Isabella." Reginald stepped forward. "Eleanor still cares for you deeply. You and Victoria are sisters—"

A harsh laugh escaped Isabella. "Are you deliberately trying to ruin my day?"

"How dare—"

"Uncle Reginald, don't waste your breath." Genevieve smirked. "My sister wouldn't claim her as family either. Look at her—does she even belong in Victoria's league?"

She turned to Isabella with malicious glee. "You must be so proud of yourself for blocking Victoria from YodaVision. But guess what? The harder you push her away, the tighter Alexander holds on."

Her voice dripped with triumph. "When he heard how you and that YodaVision CEO bullied her, he stormed their headquarters immediately."

"Of course, things didn't go exactly as planned—he couldn't actually touch YodaVision. But to make it up to Victoria? He handed us a billion-dollar project. The same one your precious uncle begged for. Hilarious, isn't it?"

Isabella's nails dug into her palms.

Emily scoffed. "Has Alexander even married Victoria yet? Calling him so familiarly—how desperate can you be?"

"You—"

"Enough, Genevieve." Reginald held her back with a sigh. "Isabella, Victoria is revolutionizing AI at YodaVision. Stop this petty vendetta."

"Finished?" Isabella's gaze could freeze hell over. "Then get out of my sight."

Penelope finally spoke up. "Isabella, is that any way to speak to your father?"

Genevieve nodded vigorously. "No manners at all!"

Ice laced Isabella's voice. "Correct. I wasn't raised by mistresses like you."

"How dare—"

"Enough." Reginald's disappointment was palpable. "Let's go."

With a final glare, Reginald collected his jewelry box and swept out with Penelope and Genevieve in tow.
###Chapter 45

Emily Donovan studied Isabella Sinclair's pale face with concern.

Isabella shook her head. "I'm fine."

The moment Reginald Kensington had divorced her mother Evelyn, he'd ceased being her father.

What truly hurt was how her existence had become a burden to her uncle Charles.

As for Alexander Whitmore's blatant favoritism...

The way he doted on Victoria Kensington while treating Nathaniel Graves and Benjamin Hayes with such cold calculation for Victoria's sake—never once considering her feelings—felt like a dagger twisting in her chest.

The pain was excruciating.

"Isabella..." Emily pulled her into a tight embrace, her own heart breaking for her best friend.

Isabella managed a weak smile but remained silent.

It would pass. She'd already resolved to move forward. She just needed time. She could do this.

"Want to get drinks?" Emily thought alcohol might help dull the pain.

Isabella declined. "No."

She'd rather return home and lose herself in data analysis. That was when she truly found peace—when numbers and patterns helped her reclaim her identity.

Emily didn't press further.

As they approached the parking lot, Isabella's phone rang. Sophia Whitmore's name flashed on the screen.

Isabella's faint smile vanished. She hesitated before answering. "Hello."

"Mommy, when are you coming home?" Sophia's whining voice carried through the speaker.

Isabella evaded the question. "What's wrong?"

"It's so boring here alone. Can you come keep me company?"

Alexander wasn't home and Victoria was busy. The mansion felt eerily quiet.

Sophia suddenly missed when Isabella would listen patiently as she rambled about cartoons and toys.

So she'd called, hoping to lure her mother back.

"I have work," Isabella replied coolly. "Another time."

While she had maternal responsibilities, she also had her own life to live.

Right now, she needed space to process everything.

"Fine..." Sophia's voice dripped with disappointment.

"I'll call you later if you need anything." Isabella ended the call.

Sophia flopped onto her bed, sulking.

Just then, Alexander returned. Noticing her mood, he asked, "What's wrong?"

"I called Mommy to come home, but she said she's busy..." Sophia buried her face in a pillow. "She's always busy lately."

Alexander merely hummed in response, settling on the couch to handle business emails without offering comfort.

Yet he remained in the living room instead of retreating to his study as usual.

This small gesture lifted Sophia's spirits enough to resume her puzzle game.

Meanwhile, Beatrice Kensington arched an eyebrow as Reginald's group returned. "What took so long?"

Reginald hesitated. "We ran into Isabella."

"Oh? You saw her?"

Beatrice Kensington was a striking socialite who'd married well and wielded considerable influence in both her marital and birth families.

She showed little interest in her long-estranged niece, focusing instead on practical matters. "Did you discuss Victoria joining YodaVision?"

Reginald shook his head. "She refused to listen."

Beatrice set down her coffee cup with a frown. "Honestly, I understand her resentment about Alexander choosing Victoria, but we've all met him. A man like that would never stay with a woman who only offers beauty."

"Even if it weren't Victoria, he would've left her eventually."
###Chapter 46

Beatrice Kensington smirked. In her mind, Isabella Sinclair was simply jealous that Alexander Whitmore had chosen Victoria Kensington over her. That's why she was deliberately blocking Victoria's entry into YodaVision.

Isabella had no real skills or knowledge - all she did was cause trouble. The thought made Beatrice scoff.

She was certain Alexander shared this opinion too.

The amusing part? Isabella remained completely unaware. Probably still gloating about sabotaging Victoria's opportunity.

Comparing Victoria's brilliance to Isabella's pettiness only reinforced Beatrice's belief in their incomparable differences.

Reginald Kensington sighed deeply. "I know." His thoughts mirrored Beatrice's exactly.

"But she refuses to listen."

"She's truly..."

"As stubborn as her mother."

Beatrice kept this last thought to herself - anything related to that woman was unpleasant to discuss.

"About Cuap..."

"Let's wait until Victoria returns," Reginald said, equally invested. Their company had poured millions into AI research with lackluster results.

Meanwhile, YodaVision earned billions annually simply by owning Cuap's technology. The envy was unbearable.

If they could acquire Cuap's core technology, their company's valuation would skyrocket overnight. Tens of billions would be easily within reach.

Victoria entered just as Reginald contemplated this.

"Father, Aunt Beatrice," she greeted coolly.

"Victoria!" Beatrice's face lit up with genuine admiration. "You're back."

Victoria took a seat. "What were you discussing?"

"Cuap," Reginald answered. "Since YodaVision fell through, what's your next move? Has Mr. Whitmore said anything?"

"Alexander promised to introduce me to Frederick Aldridge."

Frederick was the nation's foremost AI expert - his movements were classified, his access restricted to elite circles.

Nathaniel Graves was one of Frederick's few protégés. Rumor claimed Frederick himself had developed Cuap.

With the Nathaniel route blocked, Frederick became their only option.

"Excellent." Reginald smiled, though concern lingered. "But Nathaniel is Frederick's student. If he's poisoned the well..."

"That won't be an issue," Beatrice interjected confidently. "Frederick values talent above all else. Victoria's genius will speak for itself."

"If given the chance, Frederick might even take her as his personal student."

Reginald chuckled. "True enough."

"When will this meeting occur?" Beatrice pressed.

Victoria sipped her water calmly. "At next week's tech expo. Frederick will be attending."

They knew of the prestigious event - their company lacked the standing for invitations. But with Alexander's connections...

Two tickets appeared in Victoria's hand. "Alexander provided these. Only two though-"

"Who accompanies you doesn't matter," Reginald said urgently. "You must attend."

Beatrice nodded emphatically. "Absolutely."
###Chapter 47

Alexander Whitmore controlled multiple business empires, his schedule perpetually packed.

For the next forty-eight hours, he remained absent on corporate affairs, leaving Isabella Sinclair alone in their penthouse. Restless, she found herself dialing Olivia Chambers' number again.

Having buried herself in work for two days, Olivia had moved past their recent confrontation. She answered on the second ring.

"Mommy, when are you coming home?"

Learning Alexander wasn't present, Olivia arrived at the Whitmore residence straight after her shift.

Sophia Whitmore practically vibrated with excitement when Isabella walked through the door. The child clung to her mother's waist, chattering about schoolyard antics and demonstrating her latest mobile game obsession, demanding Isabella learn the controls.

Isabella indulged her daughter's whims - as long as homework was completed first. They spent ninety minutes battling cartoon monsters together, Sophia's laughter echoing through the penthouse.

That evening, Sophia refused to sleep alone. "Stay with me, Mommy!"

Isabella had no desire to occupy the master suite anyway. She tucked them both into Sophia's canopy bed.

Thursday evening, Isabella was transferring dinner plates when Sophia's squeal cut through the penthouse. "Daddy! You're home early!"

A baritone response vibrated through the marble foyer. "Finished negotiations ahead of schedule. Have you eaten?"

"Not yet! Mommy's just finished cooking."

"Is that so?"

Isabella froze mid-step, then deliberately exited the kitchen balancing three serving dishes. Alexander and Sophia entered the dining area simultaneously.

"Look, Daddy! Mommy made your favorite salmon!"

Isabella's gaze flickered across Alexander's tailored suit before fixing on the centerpiece. "Welcome back."

She handed her apron to Richard Thornton without making eye contact, then took her usual seat flanked by husband and daughter.

Between bites of roasted vegetables, Sophia tilted her head. "Daddy, your calendar said tomorrow?"

"Closed the Singapore deal early." Alexander's fork hovered over his plate. "Your mother's cooking improved."

Sophia beamed while Isabella concentrated on cutting Sophia's chicken into precise cubes.

The Whitmores maintained relaxed mealtime traditions. Sophia dominated conversation while Alexander provided terse but attentive responses. Tonight, the girl noticed the imbalance.

"Mommy, you're being quiet!"

"Just enjoying your stories, sweetheart." Isabella's smile didn't reach her eyes.

Richard observed the unusual dynamic. Normally, Isabella would inquire about Alexander's travels - polite if distant. Tonight, she avoided both speech and eye contact.

Alexander appeared unaffected, his expression impassive as ever.

The silence shattered when Eleanor Whitmore's caller ID flashed across Alexander's phone screen.

"Another overseas trip completed?"

"Just landed." Alexander activated speakerphone while slicing his salmon. "To what do I owe the pleasure, Grandmother?"

Eleanor's chuckle crackled through the line. "I haven't spoiled my great-granddaughter in weeks. The forecast predicts chilly weather - bring the family to the mineral springs tomorrow. My treat."

"Consider it done."

Sophia's cheer rattled the crystal stemware. "Hot springs! Can we get the private grotto again?"

Alexander's gaze pinned Isabella to her chair. "The car will collect you at seven."

Isabella finally met his eyes. "I'll drive separately after my board meeting."

Her salad fork clinked against the porcelain with finality.
###Chapter 48

"Mom, come home first! Then we can go together!" Sophia tugged at Isabella's sleeve. "The hot springs resort is so far away. It'll be boring going alone."

Isabella hesitated. Maybe she should accompany her daughter. "Alright."

Nathaniel Graves was currently developing a new app for their tech company. After dinner, he called to discuss some technical details.

While Alexander and Sophia chatted in the living room, Isabella stepped outside to take the call. The conversation lasted nearly forty minutes.

Sophia frowned when her mother returned. "Mom, you've been getting so many calls lately. And they're always so long. You never used to be like this."

Alexander's gaze lifted at their daughter's words.

Richard, the butler, noticed it too.

Isabella had never been one for lengthy phone conversations before.

An affair? Impossible.

Not when everyone knew how deeply she still cared for Alexander.

"It's just work," Isabella said briskly. "I need to finish something upstairs."

"Okay..."

Upstairs, Isabella booted up her laptop and began reviewing the files Nathaniel had sent.

Sophia returned to her room later. Seeing her mother absorbed in work, she didn't disturb her. After her bath, she peeked in again.

Over the years, Isabella had never completely abandoned her programming skills.

In her free time, she still coded. When Sophia was younger, she'd even tried teaching her basics.

Back then, Sophia would doze off during these lessons.

Now, watching silently from the doorway, Sophia realized—wasn't this similar to what Victoria Kensington did for work?

She observed for a while before finally going to bed.

Isabella worked until past 2 AM.

She'd spent the entire night in Sophia's room. Alexander hadn't come looking for her. Maybe he didn't care.

Or perhaps... this distance was exactly what he wanted.

The next morning, Isabella didn't prepare breakfast.

Sophia woke to find her mother still asleep beside her. Not wanting to wake her, the girl tiptoed out.

"Morning, Dad." She yawned when she saw Alexander in the kitchen.

He nodded silently.

"Mom's still sleeping."

"Hmm."

By the time Isabella came down, Alexander had nearly finished eating.

They exchanged no words. He left as soon as he was done.

Isabella headed to work shortly after.

That evening, she returned on time. Sophia was already waiting in the car, but Alexander hadn't returned yet.

After twenty minutes, Sophia huffed. "Dad's taking forever."

Isabella remained calm, flipping through a book patiently.

Then the house phone rang.

Richard informed them moments later, "Mr. Whitmore said he's detained with business. He asked that you and Miss Sophia proceed to the resort first—he'll join you later."

Isabella simply nodded. "Understood."

Alexander had promised to come later. But as night fell, he never appeared.
###Chapter 49

Alexander's prolonged absence infuriated Eleanor and left Sophia visibly upset.

Isabella remained unbothered, calmly brewing tea for Eleanor. "Perhaps an emergency came up," she suggested smoothly. "These things happen."

Eleanor retired early that evening, her mood clearly soured.

Sophia tried calling Alexander repeatedly, but each attempt went unanswered.

Morning light found Isabella alone in bed - Sophia had vanished without a trace.

After freshening up, Isabella searched the retreat grounds but found no sign of her stepdaughter.

Inquiries revealed Sophia had grown bored waiting for Alexander and arranged an early morning departure to go shopping.

Meanwhile, Eleanor had caught a chill from the night air, suffering a migraine that prompted her pre-dawn return to Whitmore Manor.

Not wishing to disturb Isabella's rest, she'd left without notice.

Now only staff remained at the luxury hot springs with Isabella.

The hasty departure struck Isabella as odd - Sophia could have simply waited to ask her to accompany the shopping trip.

This silent disappearance suggested another motive entirely.

Isabella suspected Sophia had received word about Alexander's whereabouts and rushed to meet him - and Victoria.

The morning rain didn't dampen Isabella's spirits. The covered hot springs offered perfect conditions for reading while soaking.

Solitude suited her - uninterrupted time to focus on her own affairs.

Come Sunday afternoon, as Isabella prepared for dinner before her return home, Eleanor called.

"Darling, I instructed Alexander to collect you tonight. Has he contacted you?"

He hadn't.

Despite his promise, Alexander remained absent without even a courtesy call.

Sophia hadn't checked in either since her abrupt departure.

Isabella saw no benefit in sharing this with Eleanor. "Yes," she replied simply.

Eleanor sounded relieved. "Good."

After inquiring about Eleanor's health, Isabella ended the call.

Evening fell with no sign of Alexander.

By 9 PM, Isabella grew tired of waiting. The retreat's remote location meant a ninety-minute drive home.

She arranged for a staff car instead.

Drowsiness overtook her during the ride until Emily's call startled her awake.

"You won't believe this!" Emily's voice crackled with outrage. "That scheming little-"

Isabella blinked. "Emily?"

"Not you, obviously! I'm talking about someone else entirely."

"What happened?"

"I'm at the Children's Hospital gala tonight. Guess who just made an appearance? Your worthless father-in-law and Victoria!"

Emily's anger vibrated through the phone. "Some society woman just called Victoria out as a homewrecker and drenched her in cabernet! The scene was spectacular!"

The gala's celebrity performances created background chaos on the livestream Emily sent.

Though distant, the footage clearly showed the confrontation - the wine toss, the shouting match, and then...

Alexander appeared.

The camera captured everything as he swept in to rescue Victoria, escorting her away from the scandalous scene.
###Chapter 50

The moment the confrontation began, Cassandra's fiancé stormed in to intervene. Their heated argument echoed through the venue.

Within minutes, the entire Kensington clan arrived in full force.

Emily had been right—the Kensingtons clearly came from old money. Their condescending attitude toward the Kensington family was palpable.

Reginald attempted to mediate with a diplomatic approach, but the Kensingtons weren't having it. They launched into a scathing verbal assault without hesitation.

Every member of the Kensington family visibly stiffened. Their expressions darkened with each cutting remark.

Then Alexander made his entrance.

His first act was removing his tailored jacket and wrapping it around Victoria's shoulders. After exchanging brief words with Cassandra's parents, he scooped Victoria into his arms and strode away without a backward glance.

The Kensingtons' demeanor shifted instantly when Alexander stepped in. Their arrogance evaporated like morning mist.

As he departed with Victoria, they scrambled after them, desperate to explain. The security team blocked their path effortlessly.

The video's final frames showed the once-haughty Kensingtons now humbled, visibly eager to reconcile with the Kensington family.

Meanwhile, Reginald and his relatives—who had been practically groveling moments earlier—now ignored the Kensingtons completely, following Alexander's lead without hesitation.

The gala's celebrity-filled venue ensured maximum exposure.

Though few recognized Victoria or Cassandra initially, scandal travels fast in elite circles.

When viewers realized the dashing rescuer was Alexander Whitmore, the video went viral instantly. Comments flooded in.

Wait—that's THE Alexander Whitmore? The tech prodigy?

Hold up—media always mentions his business genius but never his jawline!

No wonder he avoids the spotlight—with that face, he'd cause traffic jams everywhere!

As context emerged, the narrative shifted dramatically.

So...Cassandra caught her fiancé cheating...with Mr. Whitmore's girlfriend?

I know that guy—decent family, passable looks. But compared to Whitmore...

Let's be real here.

Alexander Whitmore operates on another plane entirely—wealth, intellect, and those damn cheekbones!

Victoria's fans soon identified her.

PhD at 25? Champion racer? Elite hacker? Is this woman even human?

Did you see the photos from her last race? The way Alexander looked at her—pure worship!

Ugh, they're disgustingly perfect together. Some people get all the luck!

Seriously—why would someone dating Alexander Whitmore even glance at another man? The math ain't mathing!

Rewatching the footage—Cassandra's man approached Victoria first. I get being jealous, but throwing wine? Classless.

Beautiful women can't win—too pretty and you get blamed for existing!

Isabella closed the browser tab abruptly.

Eleanor had promised Alexander would collect her from the spa retreat. Yet here it was, well past 10 PM, without so much as a text.

Perhaps he'd intended to come.

Probably got distracted playing white knight for Victoria...and simply forgot.

Isabella refused to dwell on it.

By 11 PM, she was home, showered, and in bed. Sleep came instantly—deep and dreamless.
###Chapter 51

The morning sun painted golden streaks across Isabella's bedroom as she prepared for another workday. Breakfast was quick - just coffee and toast before heading out the door.

Her phone buzzed during lunch. Sophia's name flashed on the screen. This marked their first contact since the hot springs incident.

"Hello?"

"Mom!"

Isabella swallowed her bite of salad. "Have you eaten?"

"Just finished!" Sophia's cheerful voice carried through the line.

That morning at the resort, Alexander had called Sophia with an invitation to join him and Victoria for some fun. Without hesitation, Sophia had slipped away while Isabella wasn't looking.

They'd enjoyed two full days of adventures before returning to the city yesterday afternoon. But Sophia hadn't come home last night.

Now back at school, guilt gnawed at Sophia. She feared Isabella's anger. The phone call was her peace offering.

But Isabella's casual question about lunch reassured her. No mention of the disappearance. No anger. Just relief flooded Sophia's system.

Of course her mother wouldn't be mad! Still, she noticed the change - no more daily check-ins or constant location updates. This new freedom suited Sophia perfectly.

Isabella truly didn't care about Sophia's whereabouts these past days. After discussing school briefly, she ended the call.

Nathaniel approached her desk later. "Tech expo tomorrow. Should we meet here and go together?"

"Sounds perfect."

Morning traffic crawled the next day when Isabella's car sputtered and died. The vehicle behind couldn't stop in time - metal crunched against metal.

Horns blared. Angry shouts erupted from blocked drivers. Isabella apologized profusely while calling for help.

This would take hours to resolve. The expo couldn't wait.

A shadow fell across her windshield. She looked up into Julian Montgomery's striking features. What was he doing here?

She acknowledged him with a curt nod, then called Nathaniel to explain. "Go ahead without me. I'll catch up."

"These things take forever," Nathaniel warned. "You might miss the whole event. Let me send someone to help, but it'll take thirty minutes minimum."

"Just get me there before it's over."

Before she could address the other drivers, Julian spoke. "I'll handle this. Where are you headed?"

Isabella blinked in surprise.

Five minutes later, she sat stiffly in Julian's luxury sedan. The spacious backseat still felt suffocating with him beside her.

"Thank you."

"Don't mention it."

Isabella frowned. This polite Julian was unfamiliar. Normally he treated her like furniture.

Their last encounter at the racetrack had ended badly. Even their recent chance meeting where he'd initiated greetings felt... off.

Thankfully, Julian took call after call, filling the silence. Isabella exhaled in relief.

Forty minutes later, the car stopped at the expo entrance.

"Thanks again," Isabella said as she exited.

Julian merely nodded.

She turned toward the venue. Behind her, a sleek black car pulled up beside Julian's.

Victoria Kensington did a double take. That license plate was unmistakable. She rapped on Julian's window.

"Julian! What brings you here?"

He stepped out. "Just dropping off a friend."

Reginald and Beatrice Kensington emerged from their vehicle. Recognizing Julian, they rushed to greet him.

Julian exchanged pleasantries until his phone rang. With the expo starting, the Kensington family moved on.

Inside, Isabella found Nathaniel waiting.

He leaned close. "Frederick Aldridge is attending today."

Isabella froze.

Nathaniel smirked. "Good thing you made it. If he'd caught you late..."

She understood immediately. Frederick didn't accept excuses. Tardiness equaled incompetence in his eyes.

He'd already disapproved of her marrying young and having Sophia right after graduation. Showing up late now, after finally reconnecting...

The thought of his disappointed glare made her shiver.

"Glad you're here on time," Nathaniel said.

Isabella exhaled deeply. That was too close.
###Chapter 52

The exhibition hall was already bustling with activity by the time Isabella Sinclair, Nathaniel Graves, and their group had their tickets verified.

Massive drones hovered near the ceiling while sleek flying cars occupied center stage. Humanoid robots interacted with visitors along the perimeter.

Each exhibit showcased cutting-edge technology. Isabella's breath caught at the dazzling display of innovation surrounding them.

Nathaniel's reputation preceded him. Within minutes, industry leaders began approaching to exchange greetings.

He made a point of introducing Isabella to several key contacts.

While smiling at a semiconductor CEO, Isabella's gaze drifted toward the entrance. Her eyes locked unexpectedly with Victoria Kensington's as she entered with her entourage.

Victoria froze mid-step. Seeing Isabella here was unexpected.

This exhibition catered exclusively to tech elite. Each invitation represented significant prestige.

As a major shareholder of InnovaTech, Nathaniel bringing Isabella—a mere undergraduate—into the company had raised eyebrows among staff.

But granting her this coveted ticket? That would surely cause resentment among InnovaTech's senior engineers.

Nathaniel had studied under Frederick Aldridge. Though he'd shifted focus to business, his AI expertise remained formidable.

He'd personally overseen his company's product development for years.

His technical prowess was undisputed. With Cuap as their core intellectual property, InnovaTech had flourished under his leadership.

Sebastian Holloway had once praised Nathaniel as an extraordinary visionary.

Victoria had begun questioning that assessment when he'd refused to hire her because of Isabella.

Now he was giving this valuable exhibition pass to an outsider?

It made no logical sense.

Victoria's expression darkened as these thoughts churned.

Reginald and Beatrice Kensington also spotted Isabella. Their frowns mirrored Victoria's surprise at her presence.

Isabella offered them the briefest nod before turning away.

Reginald noticed her conversing intimately with a tall, distinguished man. "That man—Victoria, do you recognize him?"

"That's Nathaniel Graves."

"Nathaniel Graves?" Reginald's eyebrows shot up.

He knew Isabella had left Whitmore Group for InnovaTech. But he'd assumed she held some junior position.

He hadn't expected Nathaniel to show her such favor.

Before Victoria could respond, an older gentleman approached.

"Ms. Kensington, Mr. Kensington, you made it."

"Mr. Pembroke." Victoria and Reginald greeted the businessman.

Originally, they'd only secured two tickets. But after last night's charity event revealed Victoria's connection to Alexander Whitmore, their social circle had taken notice.

Eager to curry favor with Alexander, Walter Pembroke had arranged an extra ticket upon learning the Kensingtons needed one.

News of Victoria's ties to Alexander had spread quickly after the gala.

Walter had barely exchanged pleasantries before others began approaching. Soon a crowd formed around the Kensingtons, drawing curious glances.

Meanwhile, Vincent Holloway, who'd been speaking with Isabella's group, glanced over and remarked, "The Kensingtons are making quite the spectacle. You've heard about their recent... developments?"

"Ms. Kensington's connection to Alexander Whitmore has everyone scrambling to get close."

His tone dripped with disdain.

Nathaniel was well aware of the charity event drama involving Victoria.
###Chapter 53

Nathaniel Graves studied Isabella Sinclair carefully. Noticing Vincent Holloway's dismissive attitude toward Victoria Kensington, he asked pointedly, "Mr. Holloway, do you have some issue with the Kensington family?"

Vincent shook his head. "I wouldn't call it an issue, but..." He hesitated. "Cassandra Lowe - the young woman who argued with Ms. Kensington last night - is like a daughter to me."

"I've watched her grow up. She can be hot-headed, but she's not irrational."

"Her fiancé, Frederick Ashford from the Ashford family, became quite involved with another woman two years ago - so much that he nearly broke off his engagement with Cassandra."

"But then, somehow, that woman ended up catching Alexander Whitmore's attention, and suddenly she stopped contacting Frederick..."

The implication was clear. Victoria had interfered in Cassandra's relationship before. But after climbing higher socially, she'd withdrawn.

What truly bothered Vincent wasn't the past - it was last night's charity gala incident.

He sighed. "Originally, my friend and Cassandra were supposed to attend today's expo. But after last night's scene involving Mr. Whitmore, the internet exploded. Netizens have been tearing Cassandra apart. She's devastated."

"Worse, those opportunistic businessmen noticed Victoria's connection with Mr. Whitmore and immediately started cozying up to the Kensingtons."

"To avoid becoming targets today, my friend and Cassandra decided not to come..."

Nathaniel and Isabella listened silently, unsure how to respond.

When Isabella glanced toward Victoria, she saw even more people crowding around her now.

After concluding their conversation with Vincent, Isabella joined Dominic Vega and the others to analyze the exhibition's technological innovations.

Exposure to so many cutting-edge advancements left both Isabella and Dominic exhilarated and completely absorbed.

Time passed unnoticed until Nathaniel suddenly approached Isabella and gestured toward a particular direction.

There stood Alexander. So he was here after all.

His tech company held significant influence nationally, and he was technically skilled himself. His presence didn't surprise Isabella.

Besides, with Victoria attending, how could he not show up?

Sure enough, there he was - standing right beside Victoria.

The surrounding crowd positioned them as the center of attention, making them appear like a legitimate couple.

Isabella took one brief look before turning away.

Then she spotted Oliver Westbrook. He was here too.

However, engaged in conversation, he hadn't noticed her.

Nathaniel asked, "Does he know you're here?"

Isabella shook her head. "Probably not."

After all, though she and Alexander had crossed paths occasionally recently, they'd never properly discussed their relationship.

Even when they did speak, it was always about their daughter, Sophia.

So how would Alexander know she was attending?

Nathaniel, clearly displeased, pressed, "You're really not going to greet him?"

Isabella and Alexander were still legally married. If she publicly asserted her identity as Mrs. Whitmore, Nathaniel wanted to see how Alexander and Victoria would react.

Isabella understood his implication. But she shook her head firmly. "No."

First, there was no need.

Second... if she cornered Alexander, he might retaliate by publicly reviving those old accusations about how she'd supposedly trapped him.

Even though she was innocent, she lacked evidence to prove it.

If things escalated, she'd be the one humiliated.

With so many business elites present, mishandling the situation could even affect her uncle's business. She wouldn't let momentary anger cloud her judgment.
###Chapter 54

Isabella averted her gaze when Dominic and his team signaled for her assistance with technical queries. Alexander Whitmore was instantly forgotten as she turned on her heel and strode toward them.

The moment she pivoted, Oliver Westbrook spotted her.

Victoria Kensington had just walked over to Reginald Kensington, leaving Alexander's side.

Oliver nudged Alexander sharply with his elbow, gesturing toward the unexpected sight. "Look who's here - your wife."

Alexander followed the motion and froze. There she was.

Isabella stood slightly apart from the group, tablet in hand, meticulously explaining complex exhibit concepts to Dominic Vega and his colleagues.

The discussion between Isabella and Dominic was so intense they remained oblivious to Alexander's piercing stare.

Oliver whistled low. "Who are those people with your wife? Is she really breaking down core tech concepts for them? Since when was Isabella this brilliant?"

Alexander's gaze remained locked on Isabella, his silence speaking volumes.

At that precise moment, as if sensing the weight of his stare, Isabella glanced up.

Their eyes connected across the crowded exhibition hall.

A heartbeat of hesitation.

The distance made it impossible to read Alexander's expression clearly, but she could swear she saw the ghost of a smile tugging at his lips.

Was that smile meant for her? Wishful thinking, probably.

Confused, Isabella looked away.

Oliver caught it too. "What's got you grinning like that?"

Alexander chuckled darkly. "Nothing."

Oliver didn't press, but raised an eyebrow at Isabella's composed reaction upon noticing them - especially Alexander.

She might as well have been looking at a stranger.

Was this her playing hard to get? Or simply being discreet?

If the latter, then considering Alexander's refusal to acknowledge their marriage publicly, her behavior made perfect sense. She'd maintained this careful distance at both the gala and now the expo.

Not a single trace of their relationship left for prying eyes.

Oliver had to admit - when it came to discretion, Isabella was masterful.

Victoria chose that moment to reappear. "What are you two conspiring about?"

Oliver recovered first. "Nothing important." Then, smoothly changing subjects: "Finished your discussion?"

Before Victoria could respond, an approaching group interrupted. "Professor Sinclair, allow me to introduce the algorithmic prodigy I mentioned - Ms. Kensington."

Theodore Sinclair was the same expert Nathaniel Graves had introduced to Isabella at the gala.

That night when Victoria had confronted Nathaniel, Theodore had been present.

But with his unremarkable appearance and Victoria's singular focus on other matters, she'd paid him no attention.

Now, meeting again, recognition failed to spark.

Their tense exchange that evening had gone unnoticed by Theodore, engrossed as he'd been in conversation with Isabella. He'd never inquired about it afterward.

Seeing Victoria now, he made no mention of their previous encounter. Simply extended a hand. "Ms. Kensington."

"Professor." Victoria's reply was perfectly polite.

With the Kensington tech division desperately needing talent, Victoria couldn't afford to offend someone of Theodore's caliber. Even Reginald made a point to come greet him.

Soon Victoria and Theodore were deep in discussion.

Surrounded by cutting-edge exhibits, their conversation stretched on.

Reginald and Beatrice Kensington, however, understood technology about as well as they understood ancient Sumerian.
###Chapter 55

Nathaniel Graves and Beatrice Kensington's primary goal at the tech expo was networking.

Of course, once Alexander Whitmore arrived, they kept discreet tabs on him while working. They were curious how he'd react upon seeing Isabella Sinclair.

But when Alexander spotted Isabella, his expression remained completely blank. He looked right through her as if she were a stranger. Not even a second glance.

The rumors must be true. Years ago, Isabella had allegedly used shady tactics to trap Alexander into marriage. He'd never cared for her.

Even after their wedding, he'd barely spent time at home. Pure disgust was all he felt toward her.

As the expo's main conference prepared to begin, staff notified key company representatives to gather for the summary meeting.

Representing YodaVision were Nathaniel and Isabella.

They walked ahead together.

Seeing Isabella granted access to the conference hall shocked Victoria Kensington and Beatrice.

Beatrice turned to Victoria. "Does Nathaniel truly value her that highly?"

They'd already sensed his regard when he brought Isabella to the expo. But this level of privilege was unexpected.

Unbelievable.

Isabella was a divorced single mother.

Beautiful, yes - but with Nathaniel's elite background, he could easily find someone far more accomplished.

Why invest in a woman about to enter her second marriage?

Victoria stayed silent.

Though they'd entered the expo, seating was limited. Since their company hadn't contributed exhibits, they'd normally be relegated to the back rows.

Yet Alexander had arranged front-row seating for Victoria beside him.

Hearing this, Reginald Kensington chuckled.

Isabella was present, yet Alexander placed Victoria at his side.

Beatrice smirked. "I hear Mr. Frederick Aldridge is speaking later. Front row means better access."

Victoria understood perfectly.

After spotting Isabella and Nathaniel in the middle rows, Beatrice had felt slighted. But Victoria's prime seating instantly lifted her spirits.

Victoria also noted Isabella and Nathaniel's location.

Following Alexander, she passed Isabella without acknowledgment, chin lifted.

Isabella and Nathaniel noticed them too.

Neither cared to acknowledge the group.

But whispers swirled around them.

"Mr. Aldridge is in the front row! Those seats guarantee conversation opportunities. So jealous."

"Exactly!"

Isabella and Nathaniel exchanged glances.

Nathaniel leaned closer, murmuring, "Don't worry. Even if she meets our mentor, she'll never impress him."

Their first encounter had revealed Victoria's true capabilities.

Isabella raised an eyebrow. "What if she's been hiding her skills?"

A fair point. Nathaniel had considered this possibility but...

Was it likely?

As he pondered, the host took the stage.

After lengthy remarks, the announcement came: "Please welcome our keynote speaker, Mr. Frederick Aldridge!"
###Chapter 56

Frederick Aldridge's reputation spanned continents, yet the genius remained surprisingly young - barely crossing into his forties.

His tall frame moved with effortless grace as he adjusted his frameless glasses. The moment the host concluded introductions, Frederick ascended the stage to deafening applause.

Reaching the podium's center, his piercing gaze swept across the audience. Instant silence fell like a curtain.

"I appreciate the organizers' gracious invitation..." His voice carried effortlessly through the hall.

After brief pleasantries, he delivered a masterful analysis of the exhibition's highlights, offering sharp insights between measured praises. When Q&A began, only select company representatives earned his attention.

Dozens more raised hands went unanswered. Exactly thirty minutes after his arrival, Frederick stepped down.

As the conference continued, Frederick moved toward his reserved front-row seat. Every executive along the aisle rose to greet him, sparking visible envy among technical staff in rear sections.

Alexander Whitmore sat precisely where Frederick would settle.

When the genius approached, both Alexander and Victoria Kensington stood.

Alexander extended his hand first. "Mr. Aldridge. It's been years."

They'd met over a decade prior during Alexander's early career.

Frederick's customary chill didn't thaw as they shook hands. "Indeed." His demeanor wasn't personal - even his own students received this frost.

Victoria seized her moment. "Mr. Aldridge, Victoria Kensington. An honor." Her manicured hand lingered mid-air.

Frederick granted her a fractional nod before his brief handshake ended the interaction. After acknowledging a few other approaching dignitaries, he took his seat.

Alexander occupied Frederick's right. An influential CEO immediately engaged Frederick's left.

The genius participated just enough to avoid rudeness.

Alexander appeared content simply listening to stage presentations.

Victoria burned to converse with Frederick but Alexander's presence created an obstacle. She leaned closer, whispering, "Did you two have some... disagreement?"

Alexander's lips curved. "No."

"Then why—"

Opportunities like this were vanishingly rare. Most would kill for five minutes with Frederick Aldridge.

Yet Alexander sat beside him like it meant nothing.

She considered asking to switch seats.

But Frederick now conversed with the powerful executive. Interrupting to introduce herself might offend both men.

The idea died unspoken.

Then Alexander murmured, "He thinks I'm mediocre."

Victoria's breath caught. Surely she misheard.

But Alexander's wry smile confirmed it. Yet he seemed... amused?

When he offered no elaboration, she let it drop.

As the event concluded, whispers spread - Frederick wasn't leaving immediately.
###Chapter 57

The moment the announcement was made, a wave of people surged toward the front rows.

Those seated in the back struggled to push forward, but by then, Frederick was already encircled by the elite figures who had occupied the front seats.

Isabella stood among them, yet she made no move to approach Frederick.

Nathaniel noticed her hesitation and urgently gestured for her to come over.

She obliged, walking toward him. "Aunt Beatrice."

Understanding his unspoken concern, she preempted his question. "Mr. Aldridge is surrounded by VIPs right now. Even if I fought my way in, I'd barely get a word in. Alexander suggested waiting for a private opportunity later."

Nathaniel nodded, realizing his own impatience. "You're right."

The crowd around Alexander consisted of industry titans they rarely had access to. Eager to expand Isabella's network, Nathaniel nudged her forward. But she remained composed. "I've already met them all."

Thanks to Alexander, these executives had treated her with utmost respect.

Nathaniel, aware of Alexander's high regard for Isabella, relaxed with a smile. "Good."

After a brief exchange, Isabella returned to Alexander's side.

The area was packed, yet the crowd parted effortlessly for her. Everyone recognized her as Alexander's companion.

Some executives, having finished their conversations with Frederick, shifted their attention to business discussions among themselves.

Noticing Isabella's return, one smiled warmly. "Ms. Sinclair is as brilliant as she is beautiful. Alexander, you've got exceptional taste."

These magnates valued merit over pedigree. Isabella's credentials spoke for themselves—graceful, poised, and sharp-witted. Her calm demeanor set her apart from the rest.

Their compliments were genuine.

Alexander responded with a faint smile while Isabella graciously acknowledged, "You flatter me, Mr. Thornton."

Their pleasant exchange was cut short when Frederick announced his departure, citing urgent matters.

No one dared detain him. Given his government connections, his business was unquestionably important.

And just like that, he was gone.

Meanwhile, Isabella and the tech teams from various companies were deep in discussion.

She and Nathaniel hadn't bothered fighting through the crowd to speak with Frederick earlier. They didn't need to.

Meeting Frederick wasn't easy, but it wasn't impossible either.

Sure enough, shortly after Frederick left, Nathaniel received a message.

He immediately whisked Isabella away from the hall to the parking lot, where they found Frederick.

He was typing on his phone when he noticed their approach and looked up.

Isabella stopped in her tracks. "Mr. Aldridge—"

Frederick gave a curt nod. "Hmm."

Then, in his trademark icy tone, he remarked, "I saw your exhibit. It was... adequate." His gaze swept over them dismissively. "Three years, and this is all you've achieved?"
###Chapter 58

A chill ran down Isabella and Nathaniel's spines.

Nathaniel spoke quickly. "We're already developing a new prototype. It should be ready by next year."

Frederick Aldridge responded with indifference. "Until it's completed, don't waste my time with meetings."

"Understood."

"Submit your technical analysis of today's expo by midnight."

Isabella and Nathaniel immediately realized he wanted a comprehensive report on all the showcased technologies.

"Understood."

Nathaniel hesitated before adding, "Mr. Aldridge... completing it in one night might be challenging."

That was putting it mildly. The task was nearly impossible.

He tried negotiating. "Would... a month be acceptable?"

With hundreds of exhibits to analyze, the report would require at least fifty thousand words. Maybe more. An overnight deadline was absurd.

Frederick didn't respond. His piercing gaze said everything.

Though always impeccably dressed and composed, his stare could make even seasoned professionals sweat.

Nathaniel straightened immediately. "Understood! It will be done!"

Isabella remained silent. The conversation was clearly over.

Then Frederick turned his attention to her.

She instinctively stiffened under his scrutiny. "Mr. Aldridge..."

"Look at your choice!"

He spat the words with icy contempt before striding away.

Isabella stood frozen.

Nathaniel murmured, "He meant your husband."

The implication was clear - How could someone like you marry such a man?

Isabella understood. But...

"Did they say something to him?"

During the conference, they'd been seated far from the front row.

They'd seen Alexander and Victoria approach Frederick after his speech.

But the actual conversation remained a mystery.

Nathaniel shook his head. "No idea."

As they processed this, Victoria and Beatrice emerged outside.

They witnessed the tense exchange with Frederick.

Watching Frederick leave, Beatrice told Victoria, "It doesn't matter. She lacks your expertise. Even knowing Frederick means nothing. She'll never qualify as his protégé."

Victoria nodded. "I know." Then added, "Let's go."

Isabella and Nathaniel had only stepped out briefly. They weren't leaving yet.

This conference offered invaluable networking opportunities. Leaving now would be wasteful.

After Frederick departed, they returned to the exhibition hall.

Later, they crossed paths with Alexander again. Neither approached the other.

To observers, they appeared as complete strangers.

Victoria's group remained too.

When Isabella had encountered Reginald at the jewelry store, he'd initiated conversation, claiming he still cared.

Today, despite multiple encounters, he never glanced her way. Not a single acknowledgment.

The contrast made Isabella scoff. But she understood perfectly.

With Victoria present, everyone knew he was her father now.

If he acknowledged Isabella, and people discovered she was Alexander's wife... what would that do to his precious reputation?
###Chapter 59

The public backlash would drown Victoria if this got out.

Reginald's blatant favoritism toward his daughter couldn't be more obvious.

Nathaniel Graves despised dealing with Reginald in such settings, but the opportunity to connect with Alexander Whitmore was too valuable to pass up.

When Isabella excused herself to the restroom, Reginald seized the moment with Victoria and Beatrice in tow.

"Mr. Whitmore," Reginald extended his hand with practiced charm. "Reginald Kensington, father of both Isabella and Victoria. A pleasure."

Alexander shook his hand politely. "Mr. Kensington. Likewise."

Reginald gestured toward Victoria. "Isabella has always been... headstrong. There've been misunderstandings between the sisters. As their father, I've tried mediating, but Isabella refuses to listen—"

"Is that so?" Alexander feigned interest.

Reginald sighed dramatically before brightening. "Still, I'm relieved she's acquainted with someone of your caliber. Knowing she's joined your company puts my mind at ease. Do look after her."

The words dripped with paternal concern.

Had Reginald not deliberately waited for Isabella's absence...

Had Alexander not known about her past with Alexander...

He might have believed the performance.

Instead, he smiled. "You flatter me, Mr. Kensington. Isabella's talent speaks for itself. We're fortunate to have her at Graves Innovations."

The trio assumed this was mere politeness.

What could a girl like Isabella possibly offer a man like Alexander?

Menial tasks at best.

Reginald kept this thought to himself. Victoria remained silent while Beatrice smirked.

"Mr. Whitmore," Reginald pressed on, "you're aware of Victoria's credentials. She's eager to contribute to Graves Innovations—"

Though Frederick Aldridge had already promised Victoria mentorship, aligning with Graves Innovations' rising star never hurt.

Alexander turned to Victoria. "Your interest honors us, Ms. Kensington. With your skills, you'd be an asset. However, Isabella and I are—"

Victoria interrupted smoothly. "I understand completely, Mr. Whitmore. No pressure."

She no longer needed Graves Innovations. But burning bridges with Alexander? Unwise.

They'd likely study under the same mentor soon.

Better an ally than an enemy.

Alexander's demeanor today was noticeably warmer than at the gala.

Whether genuine or facade, time would tell.

"Your understanding is appreciated," Alexander replied.

From afar, their exchange appeared congenial.

When Isabella emerged and froze at the sight, Beatrice caught her reaction and smirked.
###Chapter 60

Isabella spotted Alexander immediately. She maintained her composure and turned to Nathaniel. "We have prior engagements. Let's continue this conversation another time."

Nathaniel shook hands with them politely. "Of course. Another time then."

Without even glancing at Isabella, Victoria strode away with Reginald and Beatrice in tow.

Given Nathaniel's status, it wasn't surprising when several industry leaders approached him before noon, extending lunch invitations. Their subtle hints confirmed Alexander would be attending.

This gathering would bring together the who's who of the AI sector - the very people shaping the industry's future. The market's direction hinged on their decisions.

More than just networking, this was an opportunity to gain insider knowledge. Successful discussions could even lead to immediate business deals.

Nathaniel was clearly tempted.

He glanced at Isabella, silently seeking her opinion.

With Alexander present, would she...

"I'm coming," Isabella stated firmly.

Outside, they'd maintain their facade as strangers. But avoidance wasn't her style.

The group of executives led Isabella and Nathaniel toward Alexander's contingent.

Alexander watched their approach with an unreadable expression.

Victoria's brow furrowed momentarily before smoothing into indifference as she averted her gaze.

When Reginald and Beatrice joined them, their expressions darkened upon noticing Isabella.

Some attendees hadn't greeted Nathaniel yet, so they seized the opportunity as he approached.

When it was Alexander's turn, he extended his hand. "Mr. Graves."

"Mr. Whitmore," Nathaniel replied with practiced ease. "I've heard so much about you."

"The pleasure is mine."

After brief pleasantries, Alexander and Victoria led the procession to the parking lot. Isabella and Nathaniel followed several paces behind.

Reginald and Beatrice shot warning glances at Isabella, who pretended not to notice.

Alexander and Victoria shared a car, while Isabella rode with Nathaniel.

Beatrice huffed in frustration. "That girl has no sense of propriety."

The convoy comprised over twenty vehicles.

The private dining room's expansive round table accommodated everyone comfortably.

Naturally, Alexander and Victoria sat together.

Beatrice attempted to sit beside Isabella, worried she might cause a scene. But Nathaniel had already claimed the seat.

As everyone settled, conversation flowed while menus circulated.

Alexander handed the menu to Victoria. "Your choice."

She accepted it gracefully. "Any preferences?"

"Whatever you select," he replied.

Nearby guests chuckled. "Mr. Whitmore and Ms. Kensington make quite the pair."

Victoria selected several dishes she knew Alexander favored.

Reginald and Beatrice exchanged approving smiles.

Meanwhile, Nathaniel consulted Isabella quietly about her preferences.

Noticing the exchange at Alexander's side, he glanced over briefly before refocusing on Isabella. Her expression remained neutral as they finalized their order.

Seeing Isabella behaving appropriately, Reginald and Beatrice relaxed slightly.

Victoria leaned closer to whisper, "Relax. She wouldn't dare make a scene with Alexander here."
###Chapter 61

If Isabella dared to make a scene, it would certainly anger Alexander.

Knowing the current state of Isabella and Alexander's marriage, she wouldn't risk provoking him. Any outburst would only make him despise her more.

Beatrice felt slightly reassured by this thought, but still worried Alexander might show too much kindness toward Victoria, which could push Isabella over the edge.

Isabella, however, remained oblivious to their concerns. She wasn't paying attention to their interactions at all - her focus was entirely on the man seated beside her, Theodore Sinclair.

Theodore had known Isabella would attend the expo and made sure to greet her earlier.

Their last meeting at a gala had involved such stimulating conversation that he'd been eager to reconnect, but their busy schedules prevented it. Now that fate had brought them together again, he wasn't about to let the opportunity slip away.

Soon after sitting down, he leaned toward her, initiating conversation.

The table was large enough that their quiet exchange didn't disturb others.

Seeing Theodore engaged in what appeared to be pleasant conversation with Isabella, Victoria and Beatrice assumed they were merely discussing technical matters and paid them little mind.

A man seated on Theodore's other side chuckled. "Theodore, you never stop working, do you? Even during meals, you're discussing business. Your mouth hasn't had a break since this morning."

Another guest joined in the teasing. "Exactly! He was deep in conversation with Ms. Kensington at the expo earlier too."

When the attention turned to him, Theodore smiled but fired back. "Every time I try discussing technical topics with you all, you pawn me off on your engineers. Now that I've found someone actually interested, suddenly you miss me?"

Someone glanced between Victoria and Isabella before remarking, "Who would've thought the younger generation would be so passionate about AI and programming these days? Times are truly changing."

"Indeed," another agreed. "After speaking with Ms. Kensington earlier, Theodore was telling me how promising the youth are today. He even said our country's future looks bright!"

"Well, Ms. Kensington graduated top of her class from an Ivy League university. Isn't she the very definition of promising talent?"

Victoria offered a modest smile. "You're all too kind."

Given Alexander's prominent status and Victoria's position as his partner, it was natural for the group to shower her with praise.

As for Isabella, while they acknowledged her beauty, they only knew her as an employee at Nathaniel's company. Though rumors swirled about her relationship with Nathaniel, she lacked significant social standing. Naturally, the group paid her little attention.

When the food arrived, Victoria placed a portion on Alexander's plate, which he accepted without hesitation.

The conversation soon turned to discussing the future potential of various exhibits at the expo.

One guest couldn't resist commenting, "Speaking of which, Mr. Whitmore, the compatibility between your autonomous vehicle project and Mr. Graves' intelligent traffic programming language is truly remarkable. It's quite tempting, honestly. Are you really not considering a collaboration?"
###Chapter 62

The business discussion had dragged on for hours, yet Nathaniel Graves hadn't secured a single concrete deal.

Alexander Whitmore casually picked up a linen napkin.

He dabbed his lips.

Then he turned to Nathaniel with an amused smile. "It's true. I've been considering it. What's your take?"

Nathaniel never missed a business opportunity.

"Having Mr. Whitmore's interest is an honor for our company."

If Alexander and Nathaniel collaborated, Victoria Kensington would benefit greatly. Closer ties meant more chances to interact with Nathaniel. And that would make it easier to sway him to her side.

With this thought, she shot a venomous glare at Isabella Sinclair.

Isabella, however, remained engrossed in conversation with Dr. Theodore Sinclair. Though she kept half an ear on the table dynamics, she wasn't particularly concerned.

If Nathaniel genuinely wanted to work with Alexander, she had no objections. Money was money, after all.

As dinner concluded, the group migrated to the lounge area for further discussions.

Alexander's earlier mention of collaboration had been casual. Whether it would materialize remained uncertain.

Yet Gregory Thornton, another guest, seemed genuinely eager to partner with them. He'd already gathered his team to speak with Nathaniel before dessert was cleared.

Isabella joined them.

While technically proficient, negotiations were Nathaniel's forte.

She sat quietly, interjecting only occasionally. Noticing Nathaniel's empty glass, she picked it up. "I'll get you a refill."

Nathaniel smiled. "Thanks."

Seeing Isabella play the assistant role reinforced Victoria and Beatrice Kensington's belief that her position was merely menial.

Glass in hand, Isabella turned away. As she passed Alexander, someone abruptly bumped into her.

Caught off balance, she stumbled forward—straight into Alexander's arms. The room froze.

To observers, it appeared accidental. But was it truly coincidence that she fell precisely into Alexander's embrace?

Isabella was undeniably striking—her figure graceful, her porcelain skin flawless.

While Victoria was equally beautiful, many present privately conceded Isabella had the edge.

For most men, such an encounter would stir something.

But Alexander remained impassive.

He steadied her shoulders briefly before pushing her away, his expression unreadable.

Isabella only recognized his distinctive cologne when she was already against his chest.

Regaining composure, she calmly straightened. "My apologies," she murmured before walking away.

To Victoria and Beatrice, the message was clear—this had been deliberate.

Beatrice scoffed. "I told you she'd try something."

"Pathetic," Victoria smirked. "His reaction says everything."

"Indeed," Beatrice chuckled. "His indifference is rather reassuring, isn't it?"

Victoria lowered her head, smiling smugly.

Meanwhile, Reginald Kensington frowned.

He'd thought Isabella unassuming. Now he realized she was full of tricks. Who would've guessed?
###Chapter 63

Nathaniel spotted the incident immediately. He cut off his conversation with Gregory mid-sentence and strode toward Isabella.

"Are you hurt?"

She shook her head.

"Did you twist your ankle?"

"Just a little," she admitted. The throbbing pain confirmed it was more than just a minor sprain.

His concern sent warmth through her chest, but it also brought an unexpected pang of sadness.

She could feel the judgmental stares burning into her. They probably thought she'd thrown herself at Alexander on purpose. Even now, with her injury, they'd assume she deserved it.

Alexander hadn't even bothered to catch her properly, let alone check if she was okay after the fall.

Nathaniel was the only one who genuinely cared.

"Let me see."

"It's fine—"

Too many eyes were watching.

Ignoring her protest, Nathaniel scooped her up effortlessly. He carried her away from the crowd before setting her down gently. Kneeling, he removed her stilettos and examined the swelling.

He barked orders at the staff—call a doctor, bring flat shoes immediately.

His open display of concern shocked the onlookers. The way he disregarded appearances made some reconsider their earlier assumptions. Maybe they'd misjudged the relationship between Nathaniel and Isabella.

Victoria pressed her lips into a thin line and looked away.

Then she glanced at Alexander.

He'd clearly noticed the intimate exchange between Isabella and Nathaniel, yet remained utterly indifferent. He continued his conversation as if nothing had happened, completely unfazed by their closeness.

Seeing this, Victoria's tense expression relaxed. She rejoined the group's chatter with a smile, dismissing Isabella from her thoughts.

The restaurant's doctor arrived shortly, diagnosing a mild sprain and prescribing medication.

After the doctor left, Nathaniel applied the ointment himself.

Isabella reached for the tube, but he shot her a warning look.

She surrendered with raised hands, letting him take over.

Once bandaged, the staff returned with ballet flats.

Isabella tested her weight. "I can walk now."

"Good," Nathaniel said.

But touring the exhibition with an injury was impractical. Nathaniel decided she should skip the remainder. He'd already arranged video documentation she could review later.

Though disappointed, she had little choice.

Nathaniel informed the group before leaving early to take her home.

After their departure, the gathering gradually dispersed.

He dropped her off before attending to other business.

Exhausted from the day's events, Isabella planned to rest before discussing Frederick's assignments when Nathaniel returned.

Just as she set her phone aside, it rang.

An unknown number flashed on the screen.

Hesitating briefly, she answered. "Hello?"

"Julian Montgomery speaking."

Isabella froze, then bolted upright. "Mr. Montgomery?"

The chaotic day had made her completely forget about this morning's incident until his call.

"I've arranged for your car repairs," Julian said. "You can collect it—"

Before she could respond, he added, "If you're busy, I can have it delivered."
###Chapter 64

Isabella instinctively refused. "Don't bother. I'll handle the car myself."

Her blunt response was met with silence on the other end.

"Mr. Montgomery?" she prompted.

"Fine. I'll text you the repair shop details."

"Thanks. I appreciate it."

Julian ended the call without another word.

With her injured ankle, retrieving the car alone was impossible. After consideration, Isabella decided to ask Nathaniel for help.

Nathaniel agreed immediately. He promised to bring the car back after work.

That evening, Isabella ordered takeout. Just as she finished eating, her phone rang. Sophia.

"When are you coming home?" Sophia asked.

"I sprained my ankle," Isabella replied. "I'm staying elsewhere to recover. Don't wait up."

"What? Mom! Are you okay? Does it hurt badly?"

"It's manageable. Just needs rest."

Sophia sounded relieved but concerned. "Where are you staying? Dad's coming home soon. We'll visit tomorrow."

"No need. Focus on school."

"Okay..."

They chatted briefly before hanging up.

When Alexander returned, Sophia rushed to him. "Dad! Mom hurt her ankle! She's staying somewhere else!"

Alexander handed his tailored jacket to Richard. "I know."

Sophia blinked. "How? Did Mom tell you?"

He accepted water from Margaret. "No. I saw it happen."

"You were there?"

A noncommittal hum.

"Right! Mom works at your company—"

"Not anymore."

Sophia frowned. "Where does she work now?"

"Where she wants to."

After finishing his water, Alexander ruffled Sophia's hair. "Bedtime."

"Okay!"

At 8 PM, Nathaniel returned with Isabella's car.

She took the keys. "How much for repairs? I'll reimburse you."

Nathaniel collapsed on the couch. "No idea."

"What? How?"

"They just handed it over when I mentioned your name."

Isabella froze.

Julian had paid?

She hadn't expected that.

"Problem?" Nathaniel noticed her expression.

"Nothing." She shook her head.

"Let's start that assignment. I'm exhausted."

He meant the exhibit review Frederick assigned that morning.

"Okay." Isabella hesitated. "I need to make a call first."

"Go ahead."

She dialed Julian immediately.

He answered on the first ring.

"Mr. Montgomery, it's Isabella."

"I know. What is it?"

"About the car. Did you cover the repairs? I'll transfer the amount immediately."
###Chapter 65

Julian's voice was clipped when he responded after the brief silence. "I'll text you my account details now."

"Thank you," Isabella answered politely. "I appreciate your help today."

"No need." The line went dead before she could say more.

Nathaniel, who'd been working nearby, glanced up. "That was the man who helped with your car?"

Her phone pinged with Julian's message containing the repair invoice photo and banking information.

Isabella opened her payment app with a sigh. "Yes."

Nathaniel noted the formal tone she'd used with Julian. They clearly weren't close.

He knew Julian Montgomery well enough, and was aware Isabella had met him before. But their worlds barely intersected. Even hearing her say "Mr. Montgomery" hadn't immediately connected to Julian in his mind.

The transfer completed, Isabella sent a brief confirmation before refocusing on Frederick's assignment from earlier.

They worked side by side, distilling exhibit technologies into PowerPoint slides. Even streamlined, the volume kept them working until 2:17 AM when they finally emailed it to Frederick.

Nathaniel looked exhausted. Since he didn't have spare clothes here, Isabella didn't invite him to stay.

After he left, she limped to shower before collapsing into bed.

Her ankle injury wasn't serious, but Nathaniel had insisted she work from home tomorrow.

Morning light filtered through the curtains when Sophia's call came through.

"Mom? How's your ankle?" Her daughter's voice held tentative concern.

Isabella balanced on one foot while making tea. "Better today."

"That's good." Sophia sounded relieved, then awkwardly silent.

Isabella recognized the hesitation.

It hadn't always been this way. Sophia used to chatter endlessly - every schoolyard drama, every scraped knee poured into her mother's ears.

Somewhere in the past two years, those conversations had dwindled. Now Sophia took her worries to Victoria first. The distance between mother and daughter had grown imperceptibly until they struggled to fill phone silences.

This injury had prompted rare concern from Sophia. Sincere, but surface-level. Not like before.

Isabella remembered when a simple cold would bring Sophia to tears, clinging to her all day. Now that devotion belonged to Victoria. Like when Victoria fell ill last month - Alexander had rushed over immediately, and Sophia had bombarded her with messages before visiting straight after school.

If Sophia were truly worried, she could've demanded Isabella's address last night. Could've insisted on coming.

But she hadn't.

The silence stretched until Sophia turned to someone else. "Dad? Do you want to talk to Mom?"
###Chapter 66

Isabella's thoughts snapped back to the present at Sophia's words.

Yesterday, when she'd fallen, Alexander hadn't lifted a finger to help.

When she'd been hurt, his indifference had been palpable.

His behavior wasn't just about not caring—it was about ensuring Victoria wouldn't misunderstand.

In his heart, only Victoria's feelings mattered.

Whether Isabella lived or died was irrelevant to him.

Otherwise, how could he have been so cold when she'd fallen and injured herself?

Her expression hardened. Just as she was about to refuse, Alexander spoke first.

"Ask your mother," he told Sophia.

Sophia turned to Isabella. "Mom, Dad wants to know if you'll talk to him."

Isabella pressed her lips together briefly. "No. I'm busy."

Sophia relayed this to Alexander. "Dad, Mom said no."

"Okay," came his clipped response.

Sophia sighed. "Okay, Mom. Bye."

"Bye."

After hanging up, Sophia set down her phone and turned to Alexander. "Dad, I think Mom's upset about something." Her voice wavered slightly.

Alexander barely glanced at her. "Oh? Is that so?"

"Yeah. I don't know why, but I just feel it."

"Okay."

And that was that.

Over the next few days, Isabella continued working from home.

Sophia called daily to check on her injury, but as Isabella expected, she never mentioned visiting.

The project she and Nathaniel had submitted was reviewed by Frederick two days later.

Their core technical analysis—something most would treat as confidential—was torn apart by Frederick and dismissed as worthless.

For the next few days, Isabella and Nathaniel revised their presentation based on Frederick's scathing feedback while juggling their regular workload.

By Monday, Isabella's ankle had mostly healed. Though driving still made her wince, she returned to the office.

There, Nathaniel said, "It seems Alexander genuinely wants to collaborate with us."

Alexander hadn't reached out personally, but someone from his team had contacted Nathaniel last week.

Nathaniel had kept it from Isabella, worried it might upset her.

Later that day, a representative from Alexander's company was scheduled to visit their office. If discussions went well, they could finalize the initial partnership terms.

Maxwell Sterling, Alexander's technical director, represented his private tech firm—not the Whitmore Group.

It was Isabella's first time meeting him.

Learning Isabella was also in tech, Maxwell greeted her politely. "Hello, Ms. Sinclair."

"Hello," she replied.

The meeting progressed smoothly.

At noon, YodaVision hosted lunch for Alexander's team.

As they stepped out of the car at the restaurant, they collided with Alexander and Victoria, who had just arrived.

Isabella froze.

Nathaniel rubbed his temples. This was one coincidence he hadn't anticipated.

Maxwell's face lit up. "Mr. Whitmore!"

Alexander and Victoria turned.

Both seemed mildly surprised to see Isabella and Nathaniel.

After a brief nod to them, Maxwell hurried over to Alexander and Victoria.

Since they'd been spotted and had an ongoing collaboration, Isabella and Nathaniel reluctantly followed.

Maxwell clearly knew Victoria. "Ms. Kensington," he said warmly.

"Hello," Victoria replied coolly.

Maxwell didn't mind. Given Victoria's status as Alexander's favored companion—and likely future wife—her aloofness was expected.

Turning back to Alexander, Maxwell explained, "I was at YodaVision discussing our collaboration. Mr. Graves and his team invited us to lunch."

Alexander nodded and shook Maxwell's hand. "Thank you for your hard work."

"My pleasure," Maxwell said with a smile.

Alexander's gaze shifted to Nathaniel and Isabella. He acknowledged Nathaniel with a nod. "Mr. Graves."

He didn't address Isabella.

Nathaniel returned the nod, then suddenly suggested, "Since we've run into each other, why not join us?"

Alexander declined. "No, this is a personal outing. Next time, I'll treat you to a proper meal."

A personal outing—code for his date with Victoria. Clearly, he didn't want interruptions.

Nathaniel internally scoffed but outwardly smiled. "You're too kind, Mr. Whitmore."

Victoria, meanwhile, was pleased. While she wouldn't have minded more time with Nathaniel, her priority was always Alexander.

His protectiveness of their date thrilled her. She said nothing and left with him.

After they'd gone, Nathaniel asked, "Maxwell, you know Ms. Kensington?"

"Only met her a few times," Maxwell replied. "As you know, Mr. Whitmore dotes on her. He's brought her to the company several times."

So that was it.

Despite being married to Alexander for years, Isabella had never once visited any of his companies. He'd never allowed it.

But for Victoria, there were no such restrictions.

While Maxwell was distracted, Nathaniel leaned closer to Isabella. "Since the charity gala fiasco and last week's tech expo, the Kensington family has gained quite the network in Salzburg. Rumor has it they've secured several major projects in days."

Once those projects were completed, the Kensingtons would be firmly established in Salzburg.

Thanks to Alexander's backing, they'd achieved in days what took others years. Envy was inevitable.

Isabella lowered her gaze. "I see," she murmured.
###Chapter 67

The afternoon negotiations stretched for hours. By sunset, the two companies had laid the foundation for a promising partnership.

Two days later, Isabella Sinclair and Nathaniel Graves arrived at InnovateTech to finalize the contract terms.

Maxwell Sterling and Arthur Pembroke greeted them at the entrance.

Arthur arrived slightly late. "My apologies," he said as he entered the conference room. "I was in a meeting with Mr. Whitmore upstairs."

So Alexander was here?

Isabella noted this silently as they exchanged handshakes. "No problem," she replied.

The contract discussions resumed with Arthur's arrival.

Moments later, the door opened again.

At first, neither Isabella nor Nathaniel paid attention, assuming it was just another employee. But when Maxwell and Arthur immediately stood, they took notice.

"Ms. Kensington."

Isabella froze.

Her gaze lifted to meet Victoria Kensington's.

Nathaniel's brow furrowed.

Victoria gave Isabella a brief glance before addressing the executives. "Don't mind me. Carry on with your meeting."

Both men nodded deferentially, instructing Rosalind to serve Victoria coffee with utmost care.

Their behavior made one thing clear - they treated Victoria like the future lady of the company.

"Mr. Graves," Victoria acknowledged Nathaniel.

"Ms. Kensington," he nodded in return.

Victoria accepted the coffee and settled into the chair they brought for her. After taking a sip, her attention shifted to the contract documents.

"May I?" she asked.

"Of course," Arthur smiled.

Noticing Isabella and Nathaniel's glances, Arthur explained, "Ms. Kensington is Mr. Whitmore's partner. He shares all business matters with her."

The implication was obvious - Victoria had full access to confidential information.

Nathaniel smiled. "That's reassuring."

Isabella kept her eyes downcast.

The home office had always been forbidden territory for Isabella. Richard Thornton had made that clear on her first day at the villa.

In all her years there, she'd never been permitted inside.

Yet Victoria could freely review sensitive company documents, and this was common knowledge at InnovateTech.

The contrast highlighted the depth of Alexander and Victoria's relationship.

Victoria noticed their reactions. She knew their concern wasn't just about confidentiality - they were stunned by her privileged position.

After reviewing the documents, Victoria glanced at the silent Isabella, who avoided eye contact. Smiling, Victoria took another sip of coffee.

Her demeanor was that of a woman who belonged in the boardroom.

During a lull while Arthur amended a contract clause, Nathaniel asked, "Ms. Kensington, don't you work at InnovateTech?"

Victoria set down her cup and met his gaze directly.

"Alexander offered me a position here," she said. "But I prefer making my own way. No shortcuts."

Before Nathaniel could respond, Arthur chuckled.

"You're too modest, Ms. Kensington. Your AI expertise is renowned. Nobody would consider it a shortcut. Frankly, we'd be more efficient with you on board. Won't you reconsider?"
###Chapter 68

Victoria Kensington's lips curved into a knowing smile. Time would tell.

The unspoken message was clear - she could walk into Alexander Whitmore's company whenever she pleased.

Isabella Sinclair had grown accustomed to the special treatment Alexander showed Victoria.

She reached for her water glass just as movement caught her eye. Through the glass door stood Alexander.

Her fingers froze around the stemware.

Their eyes met briefly before his gaze slid away.

Turning back, Isabella caught Victoria's subtle smile directed at the doorway - a silent greeting meant only for Alexander.

Victoria turned to Arthur Pembroke. "I should be going now."

Only then did Arthur and Maxwell Sterling notice Alexander's arrival.

With noon approaching, his purpose was obvious - taking Victoria out for lunch.

As Maxwell and Arthur rose to greet him, Alexander waved them off. "Don't mind me. Carry on with your work."

They nodded and resumed their seats.

Alexander addressed Nathaniel Graves politely. "Apologies for not hosting you personally. Work demands kept me occupied."

"You're too kind, Mr. Whitmore," Nathaniel replied smoothly. "I completely understand the pressures of your position."

Alexander's brief glance at Isabella held no particular meaning before he exited with Victoria.

Given Alexander's numerous business ventures, Nathaniel wasn't surprised to find him at InnovaTech. Victoria's presence, however, was unexpected.

Nathaniel gave Isabella's shoulder a reassuring squeeze.

She shook her head slightly. She was fine.

Coming to InnovaTech, she'd braced herself for possible encounters with Alexander. Victoria's involvement was the real surprise.

Maxwell had mentioned Victoria visiting before, but Isabella assumed it was occasional. She hadn't realized Victoria moved through Alexander's company like she owned it, familiar with every employee.

The contract negotiations delved deep into technical specifications, ensuring clarity for future collaboration. Each clause required thorough discussion.

By the time terms were finalized, the clock showed well past five.

After Nathaniel signed, Arthur personally took the documents upstairs for Alexander's signature. "Mr. Whitmore is still in his office?" Nathaniel asked.

"Indeed," Maxwell confirmed. "He's immersed in another project."

Or was he?

Too busy - or deliberately avoiding Isabella?

The possibility crossed her mind.

Maxwell, being a fellow tech expert like Nathaniel, lowered his voice after the formalities concluded. "Ms. Kensington's been here all day. Rumor has it she's been with Mr. Whitmore the entire time. Their relationship appears quite... established."

Seated beside Nathaniel, Isabella couldn't help but overhear.

Arthur soon returned with the executed contract.

Nathaniel declined the dinner invitation, citing personal commitments. Arthur and Maxwell escorted them downstairs without pressing further.

As they waited for the elevator, fate intervened - bringing them face-to-face with Alexander and Victoria.
###Chapter 69

Nathaniel froze. What an unexpected coincidence.

Alexander responded with equal calmness. Indeed.

Nathaniel glanced at their group. Mr. Whitmore, why don't you take this elevator first? We'll catch the next one.

Of course. Until next time.

Until next time.

The doors slid shut, leaving Isabella, Nathaniel, and the others waiting in silence.

When the next elevator arrived, Isabella's phone buzzed the moment they stepped inside. Sophia's name flashed on the screen. Excusing herself, she answered. Hello, sweetheart?

Mom, are you done with work? When are you coming home?

Ever since Isabella had twisted her ankle, Sophia had made it a habit to check in daily. Yesterday, upon hearing her mother had recovered, she'd immediately asked when she'd return.

Work had been too hectic for promises then. Now, hearing the same hopeful question, Isabella softened. Just finished. I'll be home soon.

By the time she hung up, the elevator had reached the lobby.

Maxwell, unable to contain his curiosity, blurted, Ms. Sinclair, you have a child?

Isabella nodded. Yes.

Really? I had no idea.

He'd assumed she and Nathaniel were together. Their chemistry was undeniable, and Nathaniel's attentiveness toward her was impossible to miss.

Arthur mirrored his surprise. Isabella looked far too young to be a mother. Casually, he asked, Is your husband in tech like us?

Isabella paused briefly. In a way.

Maxwell, having debated coding frameworks with her before, knew her expertise rivaled the best. He'd naturally assumed her partner was industry elite too. He nearly asked for a name but stopped when he noticed her closed-off expression. Clearly, she wasn't interested in elaborating.

Nathaniel bit his tongue. The truth—that Isabella's husband was Alexander, their CEO—would've dropped jaws.

But with divorce papers looming, and future collaborations with Maxwell and Arthur inevitable, revealing it now could backfire. Someone might target Isabella to curry favor with Victoria.

Better to stay silent.

After leaving InnovaTech, Isabella and Nathaniel parted ways at the parking lot.

When Isabella pulled into the villa's driveway, Sophia was already waiting on the front steps. The moment she spotted her mother, she sprinted forward and threw her arms around—
###Chapter 70

Isabella gave her consent.

Sophia immediately requested that Isabella take her to school the next morning.

Isabella made the promise without hesitation.

It had been nearly ten days since their last encounter at the thermal springs resort.

That night, she remained at the Whitmore estate.

But she deliberately avoided the master suite.

Her intention was clear - she wanted to share Sophia's room.

The previous occasion had been when Sophia was ill.

This time, the child showed no signs of sickness, nor did she ask Isabella to stay.

Sophia noticed Isabella using her ensuite bathroom. The unspoken message was obvious - her stepmother planned to sleep here tonight. The choice puzzled Sophia, who wondered why Isabella wouldn't prefer the bedroom she shared with Alexander.

Truthfully, Sophia enjoyed sharing a bed with Isabella. The warmth and comfort of her embrace felt reassuring.

So she kept her questions to herself.

With Isabella staying over, Sophia needed extra caution when bidding goodnight to Victoria. Discovery would spell trouble.

The clock showed 11:00 pm when Isabella retired.

Alexander still hadn't returned.

Only next morning did Isabella realize he'd been out all night.

Her mind flashed back to their last encounter - yesterday at the elevator. Alexander had been leaving with Victoria.

The implication was clear - he'd likely spent the night with her.

Shaking off these thoughts, Isabella proceeded with her day. After dropping Sophia at school, she headed to YodaVision Co.

Sophia's affections clearly remained with Victoria. Her need for Isabella was sporadic at best.

Only when separated for extended periods, or when Alexander and others were absent, would Sophia remember her stepmother.

Otherwise, Isabella seemed unnecessary.

These past days proved it. Once learning Isabella's injuries had healed completely, Sophia stopped her daily calls. She never even questioned Isabella's nightly absences.

As for Alexander? He never cared about her whereabouts.

YodaVision had recently secured two major contracts with substantial payments. To celebrate, management announced a team-building event for Friday.

Employees voted on the location.

The thermal springs resort won by majority.

The news made Isabella pause, then smile bitterly.

Nathaniel noticed her reaction. "Not a fan of hot springs?"

"It's not that."

Memories flooded back - Alexander and Sophia abandoning her at the Fleming family's private springs just two weeks prior.

The wound still felt fresh.

Yet fourteen days had passed.

Time moved relentlessly forward.

Despite her reluctance, Isabella decided to participate. This marked her first company event since returning.

Their previous destination had been an exclusive Fleming property.

This time, they'd visit a sprawling commercial resort with extensive facilities.

Wrapped in a plush robe, Isabella approached the steaming pools.

Finding her colleagues absent, she entered alone. Barely a minute passed when she spotted a child - about Sophia's age - crouching dangerously close to the water's edge.

The pool measured four feet deep.

The girl appeared shorter than that.

Alarm bells rang as Isabella stood. Then - splash!

The child tumbled in.

Isabella rushed forward, pulling the sputtering girl to safety. Cradling the trembling form, she patted small shoulders while checking for injuries.

Between coughs and tears, the child clung to Isabella's neck as she carried her toward staff.

Near the entrance, Julian Montgomery came into view.

Before Isabella could react, the girl in her arms reached out desperately. "Uncle Julian!"
###Chapter 71

Lily.

Julian approached Isabella and gently took the little girl from her arms.

That's when he noticed Lily was completely drenched.

He froze for a second. His eyes locked onto Isabella. "What happened?"

Isabella had no idea this child was also his niece.

"She fell into the pool," she explained. "I pulled her out."

"Thank you," Julian said stiffly.

"Don't mention it." Isabella gestured toward the shivering girl. "You should get her changed before she catches cold."

Julian gave a curt nod. He opened his mouth as if to say something else, but Lily's frightened sobs cut him off. The child clung to him, trembling violently. With one last glance at Isabella, he carried Lily toward the elevators.

Isabella returned to the pool area.

After a relaxing soak, she changed into fresh clothes and headed to the dining hall.

Halfway through her meal, Julian reappeared with Lily in tow.

"Mind if we join you?"

Truthfully, Isabella wanted nothing to do with Julian Montgomery.

But good manners forced her response. "Not at all. Please."

"Stay here, Lily." Julian crouched to the girl's level. "I'll get your food."

Lily peeked at Isabella nervously. "Okay," she whispered.

Julian turned back to Isabella. "Would you watch her for a moment?"

Despite her reluctance, Isabella had no choice. "Of course."

The moment Julian left, an awkward silence fell between them.

Lily fidgeted in her seat, clearly uncomfortable. Isabella hesitated to speak, not wanting to scare her further.

Without knowing the child's dietary restrictions, she didn't dare offer any food from her plate.

After a long pause, Isabella finally said, "Your uncle will be back soon."

Lily's big eyes met hers. "Okay," she murmured softly.

"Does your nose still hurt from earlier?"

A small head shake.

Julian returned moments later with a plate for Lily. He set it down with careful precision, handing her utensils. The girl began eating quietly.

"Good?" Julian asked.

Lily nodded between bites.

Julian's gaze shifted to Isabella. "Lily, this is Ms. Sinclair. She's the one who saved you earlier. You should thank her."

Lily paused with her fork halfway to her mouth. She looked up at Isabella with wide eyes. "Thank you, Ms. Sinclair."

So this was Julian's way of expressing gratitude.

Isabella smiled gently. "You're very welcome."

Lily immediately turned her attention back to Julian. "Eat," he instructed simply.

The girl obediently resumed her meal.

Julian took a bite of his own food before addressing Isabella. "Here alone?"

"With colleagues," she answered. "Company retreat."

Julian didn't know she'd left Whitmore Industries.

Naturally assuming she meant Alexander's company, he stiffened slightly. "I see."

At that moment, Nathaniel spotted Isabella from across the room and waved.

Eager for any excuse to escape this awkward encounter, Isabella immediately returned the gesture. "Thank you again for earlier," she said quickly, rising from her seat. "I should go. Enjoy your meal."

Julian noticed how tense she'd been around him.

Her usual warmth was conspicuously absent.

He chalked it up to their unpleasant exchange at the racetrack last time.

With a silent nod, he let her go.

"Who was that?" Nathaniel asked when she reached him.

Julian's back had been turned during their interaction.

From behind, Nathaniel only saw a broad-shouldered man dining with a child, assuming they'd been sharing Isabella's table.
###Chapter 72

Nathaniel noticed how Isabella greeted the man with familiarity.

That's Julian Montgomery.

Julian? Nathaniel raised an eyebrow. Weren't you two barely acquaintances? How did you end up sharing a table?

His niece fell into the pool earlier. I rescued her, and he came to express gratitude.

Nathaniel gave a curt nod. I see.

Isabella mentioned she was with colleagues. Julian assumed the man who'd greeted her was just another coworker, so he didn't bother turning around.

When Isabella and Nathaniel walked away, Julian finally glanced back. A tall, well-built young man walked beside her.

From the rear view alone, they looked perfectly matched.

Their close proximity and easy body language suggested a comfortable relationship.

Uncle Julian!

Lily's voice snapped him back to reality. Finished eating? Let's return to our room.

Okay! Lily chirped.

Having already eaten, Julian wiped his hands and escorted Lily back.

Isabella returned to her suite intending to read on the balcony when her phone rang. Alexander's name flashed on the screen.

He only called for urgent matters.

After a brief hesitation, she answered coldly. Yes?

Grandmother expects us for dinner tomorrow night.

A pause. Understood.

The line went dead before she could respond.

Isabella couldn't care less about his abruptness.

She set the phone aside, steadied her breathing, and resumed reading.

That night, she slept soundly and woke refreshed at dawn.

The resort gym provided perfect space for her morning run. After cooling down, she decided to enjoy the hot springs again.

A woman in her fifties approached, holding little Lily's hand. Isabella recognized her from yesterday.

Clearly the Montgomery family nanny assigned to care for Lily.

Yesterday's emergency call had distracted the nanny, making her unaware of Lily's disappearance.

Had Isabella not been present when Lily fell into the pool, the consequences would've devastated the nanny.

Profuse thanks poured from the woman's lips.

No need, Isabella replied simply.

She'd assumed Lily would avoid water after yesterday's scare.

Julian must have helped her overcome the fear. Clutching both the nanny's hand and a floatation ring, Lily tentatively dipped her toes before slowly entering.

Moments later, the girl kicked her legs and paddled toward Isabella. Ms. Sinclair?

Isabella turned. Yes?

Lily remained silent but circled her happily, clearly in high spirits.

The nanny smiled. She's taken quite a liking to you.

Isabella offered a polite smile but said nothing.

Team-building activities demanded her presence soon.

Before leaving, she bid Lily farewell.

To her surprise, the child stretched out her arms. Ms. Sinclair, hug!

With no choice, Isabella lifted her from the water.

Wrapped in a dry robe, she carried Lily toward the elevators, planning to part ways at their floor.

As they waited, Julian appeared.

Uncle Julian! Lily beamed.

Julian reached for his niece. Torn between them, Lily kept one arm around Isabella's neck while stretching the other toward Julian.

During the transfer, Lily accidentally tugged Isabella's robe open.

Julian's gaze fell on the sapphire blue lace beneath.

The glimpse of fair skin, delicate curves, and that slender waist proved utterly mesmerizing.
###Chapter 73

Isabella's cheeks burned crimson with embarrassment. She hastily straightened the collar that Lily had pulled askew.

Julian's expression darkened instantly. When he regained composure, he turned away sharply.

The nanny standing nearby looked equally mortified.

Thankfully, no one else witnessed the incident - it would have been unbearably awkward.

The nanny quickly assisted Isabella in adjusting her dress.

Isabella was naturally reserved. No man except Alexander had ever seen so much of her bare skin.

Making matters worse, this man happened to be Alexander's closest friend. The discomfort twisted in her stomach.

Once properly dressed, she spoke stiffly, "I should go. There's something I need to attend to."

Only then did Julian turn back to face her. "My apologies."

Lily, realizing her mistake, gazed at Isabella with tear-filled eyes. "Ms. Sinclair, I'm so sorry..."

Knowing it wasn't intentional, Isabella softened. "It's alright, sweetheart. I know you didn't mean to."

She forced a smile and waved at the child before stepping into the elevator.

Julian watched the doors close, then spoke firmly to Lily in his arms. "We don't do that to people, understand?"

The little girl nodded solemnly. "I understand."

Isabella left the group activity early at 4 PM to attend dinner at Whitmore Manor. Nathaniel walked her to the parking lot. "Drive safely," he reminded.

"I will."

Their conversation was interrupted by an approaching vehicle.

At first, Isabella didn't notice the car. Then the rear window rolled down, revealing Lily's beaming face. "Bye, Ms. Sinclair!"

Isabella managed a small smile. "Goodbye, Lily."

Her smile faltered when she met Julian's intense stare. She gave him a curt nod, which he returned. His gaze flickered to Nathaniel before looking away.

Nathaniel rubbed his chin as Julian drove off. "Did you see how he was looking at me?"

Isabella shrugged. "Why would he?"

Nathaniel couldn't explain it - just an unsettling feeling of being scrutinized.

Hesitantly, he suggested, "Maybe he thinks there's something between us? Keeping an eye out for Alexander?"

Isabella's smile vanished. "Trust me, that's not it."

Julian was just as close with Victoria.

Undoubtedly, he'd prefer seeing Alexander with Victoria.

Both Julian and Oliver probably wished Isabella would find someone else and leave Alexander alone. Why would they care if she was unfaithful?

Isabella got in her car and drove off.

Night had fully fallen when she arrived at Whitmore Manor.

Only Eleanor and the staff were present.

Eleanor came to greet her, but her smile faded when she saw Isabella alone. "Where's Sophia?"

It was common for Alexander to arrive separately, so Eleanor didn't ask about him.

But Sophia always came with Isabella.

Since recovering from her ankle injury and their vineyard lunch, Sophia hadn't contacted her.

Isabella had no idea where Alexander and Sophia spent this weekend, or who accompanied them. She didn't ask.

"They should be here soon," Isabella lied smoothly.

In truth, she doubted they'd show. Hadn't they pulled this same disappearing act during the hot springs trip?

Eleanor didn't press further, assuming Isabella knew their schedule.

They chatted until 7:30 PM with no sign of Alexander or Sophia.

Eleanor frowned. "Where could they be?"

Remembering the hot springs incident, her displeasure grew. "Isabella, call them."

Isabella reluctantly dialed Alexander.

He answered immediately, anticipating the reason. "We'll be there in twenty minutes."

Before she could respond, Sophia's voice came through. "Bye, Victoria!"

Isabella's gaze dropped.

Of course they were with Victoria.

Then Victoria's voice: "Goodbye, Sophia."

Followed by her soft words to Alexander: "I should go now."

"Alright," he replied.

Alexander's cold tone snapped her attention back. "Anything else?"

"No."

He hung up before she could.

Isabella sighed.

Eleanor demanded, "What now? Is he canceling again? That boy—"

"No," Isabella forced a smile. "Just traffic. They'll be here soon."

Eleanor's expression softened slightly but remained displeased. "Let's eat. He can have leftovers."

Richard reminded gently, "Ms. Whitmore is coming too..."

Eleanor relented. "Fine. For Sophia's sake."

Isabella smiled silently.
###Chapter 74

Twenty minutes later, Alexander returned with Sophia.

Eleanor's eyes immediately locked onto the little girl, bypassing Alexander completely. Her face lit up with a grandmother's delight. "You're back, darling!"

"Hi, Grandma!" Sophia sprinted toward Eleanor. After receiving a tight hug and having her hair playfully tousled, the child finally turned to Isabella. "Hi, Mommy."

Isabella responded with a soft hum. As she embraced her daughter, the faintest trace of Victoria's expensive perfume clung to Sophia's clothes.

She chose not to comment. Instead, she simply gave Sophia a gentle push toward the dining area.

Alexander took the seat beside Eleanor and slid a carefully wrapped package across the table. "My apologies."

It contained Eleanor's favorite rare Arabica coffee beans - the kind money couldn't easily buy these days.

Eleanor recognized the peace offering for Alexander's absence during their last family gathering.

She huffed dramatically. "You've appeased me, but what about Isabella? Did you bring her anything?"

Alexander remained silent, his gaze flickering briefly toward Isabella.

Just a glance. Empty of any real emotion.

Eleanor had meant to prompt Alexander to show more consideration toward his wife.

But Isabella no longer needed such gestures.

She kept her eyes averted. "Grandma, the food's getting cold. Let's eat," she said with practiced ease.

Eleanor assumed Isabella was protecting Alexander again.

Just like all those times before when she'd make excuses for his neglect.

The older woman sighed. "You always take his side."

Isabella simply smiled, offering no defense.

Alexander's expression remained as unreadable as ever, unaffected by his wife's apparent defense.

But time was passing, and the meal couldn't wait any longer.

Eleanor stood, taking Sophia's small hand in hers. "It's been too long since we dined together, sweetheart. Sit by me tonight?"

Sophia nodded obediently. "Okay."

"Such a good girl." Eleanor shot Alexander a meaningful look as she spoke.

Isabella recognized her grandmother-in-law's not-so-subtle matchmaking attempt.

She didn't bother checking Alexander's reaction, simply following Eleanor to the dining room.

As she took her seat across from Eleanor and Sophia, she caught movement in her periphery - Alexander pulling out the chair beside hers.

Finally satisfied, Eleanor beamed. When the first course arrived, she instructed Alexander, "Serve Isabella first."

Isabella kept her gaze lowered. "It's fine, Grandma. I can—"

Her protest died as Alexander placed her favorite mashed potatoes before her.

She hesitated. "Thank you."

Silence from Alexander.

Eleanor's instructions always carried deeper meaning - she wanted Alexander to anticipate Isabella's needs throughout the meal.

So when Isabella reached for a dish, Alexander would immediately pass it. He remembered her preferences perfectly.

But this meant nothing to Isabella.

After years of these dinners, even someone with average memory would recall such details.

After dinner, Alexander engaged Eleanor in conversation.

Isabella listened quietly from the side, never initiating conversation with her husband, rarely meeting his eyes.

Eleanor sighed, noticing the complete lack of connection between the couple despite their years of marriage.

By nine, Eleanor began showing signs of fatigue, waving them off to retire for the night.
###Chapter 75

Isabella gently bathed Sophia and carefully blow-dried her soft curls.

Sophia sat quietly watching her mother work the dryer through her hair. She noticed something different about Isabella today - the usual stream of cheerful chatter was absent.

Before, Isabella would fill these moments with stories about her day or funny anecdotes.

Catching Sophia's thoughtful gaze, Isabella paused the dryer. "What's on your mind, sweetheart?"

Sophia shook her head quickly. "Nothing."

Maybe she was imagining things.

Or maybe Isabella simply wasn't in the mood for conversation tonight.

Once her hair was dry, Sophia bounced onto the bed. "Mommy, will you sleep with me tonight?"

Isabella hesitated briefly. "Would you like me to stay, darling?"

"I don't mind! But..." Sophia bit her lip. "You haven't spent much time with Daddy lately. Don't you want to sleep in your own room?"

Isabella forced a smile. "You're right. I'll go back later."

The divorce papers still hadn't been finalized. If she insisted on staying with Sophia when the child hadn't asked, Eleanor would certainly make a scene about it.

Leaving Sophia's room, Isabella noticed light spilling from beneath her bedroom door.

Alexander sat at the desk, fingers flying across his laptop keyboard, engrossed in work.

He glanced up briefly when she entered before returning to his screen.

Avoiding his gaze, Isabella went straight to the wardrobe. She selected fresh pajamas and disappeared into the bathroom.

When she emerged, steam curling from the doorway, Alexander remained absorbed in his work.

Dressed in silk pajamas, Isabella settled onto the bed with her skincare routine. Still early, she picked up a novel to read.

The room filled with comfortable silence as both occupied themselves with separate activities.

As midnight approached, Isabella's eyelids grew heavy. She marked her page, turned off the bedside lamp, and settled under the covers.

She expected to lie awake - it had been weeks since they'd shared a bed.

But then she remembered Alexander might leave for Victoria's place after finishing work.

He probably wouldn't even stay the night.

This thought somehow relaxed her. The rhythmic tapping of keys became a lullaby, and she drifted off surprisingly fast.

She slept deeply that night, wrapped in comforting warmth.

Morning light teased her awake to an unexpected sensation - warm breath tickling her neck.

And arms. Someone's arms around her.

Reality crashed in, freezing her limbs mid-stretch.

Her mind snapped to full alertness.

Isabella opened her eyes to find herself curled against Alexander's chest.

He held her tightly in sleep, their bodies pressed together with no space between them.

His body heat seeped into her skin.

This made no sense.

She'd deliberately slept near the edge.

There'd been ample space between them when she fell asleep.

No way she could have migrated this far across the bed.

Unless...

Unless Alexander had grown accustomed to holding Victoria like this during their separation.

He must have confused them in his sleep, pulling her close without realizing. The thought made her stomach twist.

She carefully lifted her hand from his chest, fingers curling into a fist. She began inching away.

Suddenly, Alexander's arms tightened. He pulled her closer, nuzzling her hair. "Five more minutes," he murmured against her forehead.

The sleepy kiss sent an electric jolt through her body.
###Chapter 76

Alexander's sleepy murmur was never meant for Isabella.

In all their years of marriage, he'd never once held her like this in his sleep. Never once kissed her forehead at dawn.

So Isabella knew with absolute certainty - he'd mistaken her for Victoria.

Her lips pressed into a thin line. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes.

Alexander remained asleep, oblivious.

Staring at his peaceful face, she swallowed the bitter lump in her throat. She inhaled sharply and began easing out of his embrace.

Their bodies were pressed so tightly together that even the slightest movement disturbed him.

Just as she lifted his arm from her waist and sat up, his eyes fluttered open.

She froze mid-motion, one leg still tangled with his.

Their gazes locked in that electric moment.

Alexander came fully awake. Realizing his mistake, he stiffened momentarily before untangling their legs with deliberate care.

Isabella withdrew completely. Turning away, she slipped into her slippers and headed for the bathroom without a word.

When she emerged, the bedroom was empty.

She found Alexander at the end of the hallway, phone pressed to his ear, still in pajamas.

Their eyes met briefly before she looked away and descended the stairs.

Eleanor was already in the dining room.

Moments later, Sophia bounded down the stairs.

"Perfect timing!" Eleanor beamed. "Now that everyone's awake, let's have breakfast."

"Yay!" Sophia cheered.

Alexander joined them, taking the seat beside Isabella.

Remembering the morning's incident, she edged away slightly, increasing the space between them.

Sophia munched on her toast, studying her father with curious eyes. "Daddy," she piped up suddenly, "do you always cuddle Mommy when you sleep?" Her innocent question hung in the air.

Isabella choked on her tea.

Alexander remained silent.

Her face burned from coughing, her discomfort growing. But Eleanor's delighted grin only widened. "Oh? What makes you ask that, darling?"

"I went to find Mommy earlier," Sophia explained between bites. "And I saw Daddy hugging her really tight—"

Eleanor's knowing "Ohhh" stretched out as she glanced between them with undisguised amusement.

Alexander's expression gave nothing away.

Isabella's stomach twisted. She knew exactly who he'd meant to hold.

Her phone rang - a welcome distraction.

It was Margaret.

"Hello, Grandma," Isabella answered.

Margaret explained that Caroline had returned with souvenirs and wanted to arrange a family meal.

"I'm at Whitmore Manor with Sophia now," Isabella replied, glancing at Eleanor.

Originally, Eleanor had planned for them to pick fruits at the estate.

Recognizing Margaret's voice, Eleanor - who'd been friends with her for decades - immediately suggested, "Take Sophia with you."

Then she turned to Alexander. "It's been too long since you visited Margaret. Since you're free today, go with Isabella."

Alexander took a deliberate sip of coffee. "I have business later."

Isabella wasn't surprised.

She'd expected nothing less.

For Victoria, he'd cancel meetings. Clear his schedule. Move mountains.

But for her? There was always "business later."

That was the difference between Isabella Sinclair and Victoria Kensington.

Eleanor frowned. "What could possibly be so urgent? You haven't visited with Isabella in months!"
###Chapter 77

"Grandmother," Isabella interrupted Eleanor. She maintained her composure as she continued, "It's fine. Sophia and I can return alone if Alexander is occupied."

Isabella refused to impose on Alexander. Her indifference toward him had grown beyond such trivial concerns.

Eleanor misread the situation entirely. She assumed Isabella's words stemmed from consideration, an attempt to spare Alexander inconvenience.

This misplaced kindness twisted Eleanor's heart with both sympathy and frustration. The matter was settled.

After breakfast, Isabella lingered to chat with Eleanor before preparing to depart. Eleanor insisted on sending gifts to her longtime friend Margaret, pressuring Isabella into becoming the unwilling courier.

Alexander remained home that morning, joining Eleanor to see Isabella and Sophia off.

Sophia clung to Alexander's leg. "Daddy, will you be home tonight?"

He tousled her hair gently. "Of course."

Not a single word passed between Isabella and Alexander.

Once Sophia bounded into the car, Isabella waved at Eleanor and drove away.

Through the rearview mirror, she watched their figures recede - Alexander and Eleanor standing motionless as the distance grew.

Upon arriving at the Sinclair estate, Isabella parked in the courtyard. Margaret and Caroline emerged to greet them.

Caroline's brows knitted at the car's overloaded trunk. "Why so many packages?"

"Grandmother Eleanor insisted," Isabella explained.

The once-close friendship between Margaret and Eleanor had cooled considerably since Isabella married Alexander.

Margaret scoffed at the explanation but held her tongue.

Isabella noticed construction across the street and seized the distraction. "New neighbors moving in?"

"Apparently so," Caroline confirmed. "Work began last week. The crew mentioned the owner wants to occupy quickly. For such an extensive renovation, they're progressing remarkably fast."

Their neighborhood of historic villas housed families who'd lived side-by-side for generations, creating an intimate community.

As they unloaded bags, Caroline mused, "Let's hope they're decent people."

Difficult neighbors could disrupt their peaceful coexistence.

Inside, Caroline presented Isabella with a steaming bowl of bone broth. "I heard you've been exhausted lately. Made extra for you to take home."

Isabella accepted it gratefully. "Thank you, Aunt Caroline."

Charles didn't return until dinner, delayed by work commitments.

Isabella's guilt resurfaced, remembering how Nathaniel's rejection of Victoria's application at YodaVision had provoked Alexander's retaliation - costing Charles a valuable project.

"Uncle Charles, I'm truly sorry about what happened."

Charles waved it off. "Ancient history. As I told you, Rodriguez Corporation couldn't have handled that project regardless. Don't trouble yourself."

This conversation couldn't reach Margaret's ears. Her fury would be uncontainable if she learned Alexander had sabotaged the Sinclairs for Victoria's sake.

Charles subtly nudged Isabella when Margaret approached, signaling her to drop the subject.

Isabella smoothly transitioned to safer topics.
###Chapter 78

Margaret Sinclair would turn seventy next month.

Isabella Sinclair sat with Charles Sinclair, discussing plans for the birthday celebration.

Margaret had no interest in elaborate festivities. A simple family dinner would suffice.

Caroline Sinclair interjected, "It's her seventieth! We should make it special."

Isabella and Charles agreed.

Seeing their enthusiasm, Margaret reluctantly gave in to their suggestions.

Sophia Whitmore had school the next day. After dinner, Isabella left the Sinclair residence with her daughter.

Upon arriving at Whitmore Manor, Sophia bounded out of the car, her face lit with excitement.

Isabella remained seated. "Take your bath and go to bed early," she instructed. "I have some errands to run."

Sophia's smile faltered. "What?"

She leaned against the car window, brows knitting together. "Are you busy, Mom?"

Isabella kept her expression neutral. "Yes. Focus on your studies. Call me if you need anything."

Sophia's lips pursed in disappointment. "Okay."

With Alexander frequently absent due to work, Sophia assumed her mother's absence was work-related and didn't question further.

Richard Thornton came out to greet them. "Is Dad home?" Sophia asked.

"Yes, he's in his study," Richard replied.

Isabella's voice remained even. "I'm leaving now, Sophia."

"Alright..." Sophia stepped back, confused.

Richard frowned. "Going out again at this hour, Mrs. Whitmore?"

"Just some things to attend to." Isabella turned to Sophia. "It's cold. Go inside."

Sophia waved goodbye and entered the house with Richard.

After watching them go, Isabella reversed the car and drove away.

Inside, Sophia asked, "Where's Dad?"

"Study," Richard answered.

Upstairs, Sophia found the study door ajar. Alexander stood by the window, cigarette in hand, gazing outside.

"Dad?"

He turned. "Hello, sweetheart."

"Mom had to leave again."

Alexander stubbed out his cigarette. "I saw."

Sophia wrinkled her nose. "She's been as busy as you lately."

Alexander chuckled. "True."

Yawning, Sophia announced, "I'm going to bed. Goodnight, Dad."

"Sweet dreams."

Isabella went straight to bed after returning home.

The next day, she arrived at work early.

That afternoon, she and Dominic Vega visited InnovaTech for system maintenance with their team.

Neither Alexander nor Victoria Kensington appeared during their visit.

In the following days, including Thursday when she cooked for Sophia, Alexander remained conspicuously absent.

She heard he wasn't traveling—just occupied with unspecified errands that kept him from dinner.

Isabella didn't inquire whether these errands involved Victoria or other obligations. On Friday evening, as she considered dinner options, Sophia called. "Mom, Dad won't be home this weekend. When are you coming back?"
###Chapter 79

Alexander expected Isabella to look after Sophia over the weekend.

For the past two years, Alexander had been the primary caregiver for Sophia, regardless of circumstances. Whether due to personal commitments or professional obligations that made it difficult to bring Sophia along, the responsibility now fell to Isabella when he wasn't available.

Isabella returned to the villa.

At dinner, she asked Sophia, "Any special plans for this weekend?"

Sophia hesitated, then shook her head. "Not really."

Isabella recognized the look in Sophia's eyes. It wasn't disinterest in going out, but rather disappointment that Alexander and Victoria wouldn't be joining them. Without them, nothing seemed appealing.

Rather than point it out, Isabella suggested, "How about horseback riding?"

Sophia's face immediately brightened. It had been ages since she'd ridden, and the idea clearly excited her. "Yes!" she agreed enthusiastically.

The next morning, Isabella took Sophia to the equestrian club.

While changing into her riding gear, Isabella overheard Sophia chatting with instructor Ethan Blackwell. With her back turned, Sophia was saying, "My dad and one of my aunts are amazing riders. They're so cool! I wish they could be here today."

Isabella paused by the doorway, choosing not to interrupt.

Ethan noticed her first. "Ms. Sinclair."

Isabella nodded. Ethan asked, "Shall I arrange another instructor for you?"

"That would be perfect," Isabella replied.

Though experienced, it had been nearly four years since she'd ridden properly. When Sophia was younger, Isabella had brought her here frequently, but always focused on supervising Sophia rather than riding herself.

Ethan led Sophia away while Isabella headed to a separate arena.

Her assigned instructor initially assumed she was a beginner. Watching Isabella mount the horse with effortless grace, he couldn't hide his surprise. "You're quite skilled, Ms. Sinclair?"

"I've had some experience," Isabella admitted.

After a brief warm-up, she took full control. With a sharp crack of the whip, her white stallion let out a spirited neigh and surged forward.

After completing several laps, Isabella dismounted to check on Sophia.

Approaching Sophia's training area, she froze about thirty feet away.

Alexander and Victoria had arrived.

They'd come to the equestrian center too.

Sophia was clinging to Victoria's leg, her excitement palpable as the three conversed animatedly. Soon, Sophia and Victoria mounted together, with Sophia in front and Victoria behind her. Alexander rode alongside them on another horse.

The two horses moved in perfect sync, their riders laughing and chatting. From this distance, they looked every inch the picture-perfect family.

Isabella watched until their figures disappeared into the distance. Unnoticed, she finally turned away and left.

She changed out of her riding clothes, took a sip of water, and sat quietly.

Her phone rang shortly after. Alexander.

Isabella answered. "Hello."

"I'm at the equestrian center," Alexander said. "I'll take Sophia from here."

"Alright," Isabella replied.

The line went dead with Alexander's characteristic abruptness.

Isabella had been expecting this call. With Sophia's weekend plans now settled, she collected her bag and left the club.
###Chapter 80

The steering wheel felt cold beneath Isabella's fingers as she drove away from the equestrian center.

She had no destination in mind.

Emily and Nathaniel were busy with their own plans. Returning to the Sinclair mansion without Sophia seemed pointless—Margaret would only worry more.

Her thoughts swirled as she passed Sunshine Park. Families picnicked on the grass. Couples strolled hand in hand. Young adults pushed elderly parents in wheelchairs.

Their laughter stung. A hollow ache spread through her chest.

After twenty more minutes of aimless driving, she abruptly pulled over.

Her phone felt heavy in her palm. Three rings later, a familiar voice answered. "Dr. Whitmore speaking."

"How is my mother today?"

The nursing home courtyard smelled of lavender and antiseptic.

Evelyn sat motionless on a bench, her once-vibrant eyes now vacant. The woman who'd twirled Isabella around their garden now barely recognized her own daughter.

Even after all these years, the sight still stole Isabella's breath.

A quiet voice interrupted her thoughts. "No change." Henry Whitmore adjusted his glasses. "She's stable, but..."

Isabella understood. Any mention of the past could trigger another episode. These rare moments of calm were too fragile to risk.

When Evelyn's gaze flickered toward her, Isabella retreated behind a tree.

"I trust you'll take good care of her," she told Henry and the nurses.

"Of course, Ms. Sinclair."

Through the lounge window, she watched Evelyn trace patterns on her own palm. After leaving the new books and toiletries at reception, Isabella forced herself to leave.

The park beckoned again on her drive back. Colorful kites danced against the blue sky. Before she could reconsider, she turned into the parking lot.

Warm sunlight. Children's laughter. The scent of cotton candy.

Everyone belonged to someone. Except her.

She hovered near a kite vendor when tiny fingers curled around hers.

"Ms. Sinclair?"

Isabella looked down. "Lily?"

The girl nodded solemnly, not letting go.

Julian Montgomery appeared moments later. His greeting died when he saw Isabella. "Here alone?"

"Yes."

"No Sophia?"

Isabella shook her head.

Lily tugged her hand. "Fly with me?"

"I shouldn't—"

"Join us," Julian cut in. "We're short on kite experts."

When she hesitated, he added, "I'll just watch. Think of it as doing Lily a favor."

The girl's hopeful eyes decided it.

They chose a sapphire butterfly kite together.

Isabella remembered kite-flying with Sophia, but this one was larger than expected. Lily struggled to hold the string.

Julian stepped forward without being asked. Their fingers brushed during the handoff.

The kite soared.

Lily's delighted laughter filled the air.

For the first time that day, Isabella didn't feel quite so alone.
###Chapter 81

The kite soared effortlessly into the sky, drawing bright smiles from Isabella and Lily.

Julian watched Isabella's radiant expression, his gaze darkening slightly.

Noticing his stare, Isabella tilted her head. "Something wrong?"

"Nothing," he replied simply.

She didn't press further, leading Lily a little farther away. Julian kept his distance, honoring his promise not to intrude.

When they grew tired of flying the kite, Isabella and Lily moved to the lakeside to fish. They crouched by a vendor's small pond, studying the darting fish before attempting to catch them with tiny nets.

Soon, midday arrived.

Julian hadn't packed any food, having only planned a short outing. Seeing Lily's hunger, he suggested lunch at a nearby café.

After a relaxing morning, Isabella felt lighter and agreed without hesitation.

Over the meal, Isabella chatted animatedly with Lily.

Julian stayed silent, content to slide their favorite dishes closer whenever they reached for them.

Isabella, engrossed in conversation, didn't notice his subtle gestures.

A moment later, Julian's phone buzzed.

Glancing at the screen, he excused himself. "I need to take this."

Isabella nodded.

It was Oliver.

Stepping away, Julian answered. "What is it?"

"Where are you? Have you eaten? A friend just sent over fresh seafood. Alexander and the others are coming. Join us?"

Julian glanced at Isabella and Lily. "Already ate. Next time."

"Tonight, then. Yacht party. Alexander confirmed. Bring your niece—we haven't met her yet. Perfect chance for introductions."

Julian's voice remained firm. "She's shy. Crowds make her uncomfortable."

"Relax. Sophia will be there. They're the same age—they'll get along. Seven o'clock. Don't be late." Oliver hung up before Julian could refuse.

After lunch, Isabella and Lily chased butterflies and rode bicycles until exhaustion set in.

Lily eventually dozed off.

Isabella, equally worn out, decided to head home. She left quietly.

Julian watched her car disappear before departing himself.

When Lily woke and found Isabella gone, her face fell. "Where's Ms. Sinclair?"

"She went home," Julian said.

"Oh..." Disappointment laced her voice.

That evening at seven, Julian boarded the yacht as agreed.

Alexander and the others had already arrived. Oliver waved him over.

Spotting Lily, Oliver grinned. "This must be the famous Lily. Hello, I'm Oliver Westbrook, your uncle's friend."

The yacht buzzed with activity, making Lily shrink into herself.

Then Victoria arrived with Sophia in tow.

Julian tensed slightly at their appearance.

Hearing Lily was shy, Sophia extended a hand. "There's a kids' play area over there. Want to join me?"

Lily looked to Julian. Only after his encouraging nod did she take Sophia's hand.

Oliver smirked as they walked away. "First time playing babysitter? How's it feel?"

"It's fine."

Lily might be shy, but she was well-behaved—easy to manage.

Alexander handed Julian a glass of wine. "Drink?"
###Chapter 82

Julian studied Alexander for a moment before accepting the crystal glass with a nod of thanks.

Their glasses clinked softly as they began conversing between sips of aged whiskey.

Oliver observed them quietly from his seat.

After several minutes, Alexander gave Julian a meaningful look.

Julian arched an eyebrow in silent question.

Oliver cut in first. "You're not yourself today."

Alexander chuckled lowly, clearly agreeing with the assessment.

Julian's voice remained even. "Am I?"

Oliver smirked. "Aren't you?"

Julian took a measured sip without responding.

Their conversation was interrupted by an approaching guest exchanging pleasantries.

When they were alone again, Julian checked his watch. Concerned Lily might be hungry, he started toward her just as she returned with Sophia.

"Uncle Julian, can I have that pink macaron?" Lily pointed eagerly at the dessert display.

Given Lily's food sensitivities, Julian shook his head. "Wait here. I'll check the ingredients first."

Lily nodded obediently.

Sophia, accustomed to independence, helped herself to the buffet. She even offered Alexander a plate. "Father, would you like some?"

Alexander ruffled her hair affectionately. "I'm fine, darling."

The girls settled nearby with their treats. Victoria joined them, sharing a chocolate truffle with Sophia.

"Thank you, Victoria!" Sophia beamed.

Lily studied Victoria curiously before whispering to Sophia. "Is she your mother?"

The question created an instant tension in the air.

Sophia blinked before shaking her head. "No."

Lily pressed gently, "So...you don't have a mother either?"

"I do," Sophia clarified. "She's just not here."

Later, when staff distributed souvenir keychains, Lily immediately claimed two crystal ones - the last remaining.

Sophia's eyes lingered on them. "Could I have one? I'd like to give it to Victoria."

Lily hesitated. "I want to give one to my friend too."

Thinking of Isabella, Lily continued excitedly, "Today Uncle Julian and my friend took me kite flying. We fished and rode bicycles too. She's so pretty - she'll love this crystal!"

The adults had been only half-listening until now. At Lily's words, Victoria, Oliver and Alexander all turned sharply toward Julian.

Oliver recovered first, grinning. "Well well, Julian. Keeping secrets?" He leaned forward. "How long has this been going on? Alexander, did you know about this?"

Alexander simply sipped his drink, watching Julian expectantly.

Julian remained impassive. "We happened to meet."

Oliver snorted. "At lunch too, apparently? No wonder you handled Lily so easily today - you had help!"

Julian's silence spoke volumes.

Alexander studied him before stating simply, "You like her."

Julian froze, his lips parting slightly before closing again without denial.

Victoria's smile faltered momentarily.

Oliver's jaw dropped. "Wait - seriously?" His teasing had uncovered actual feelings. "Who is she? Do we know her? Why haven't we met her yet?"
###Chapter 83

Julian stayed silent, making Oliver assume he didn't want to discuss it yet since the situation wasn't critical. Realizing he wouldn't get answers from Julian, Oliver smirked and knelt to ask Lily, "Lily, how many times have you seen the lady who had lunch with you today? Do you know her name?"

Julian's grip on his keys tightened instantly. "Oliver!"

Lily didn't understand the adults' tension. Though not very familiar with Oliver, since he asked about Isabella, she considered it seriously and answered brightly, "Three times!"

Oliver pressed further. "And her name?"

When Julian and Isabella met earlier, he hadn't even called her Ms. Sinclair. Lily, unable to recall the name, turned to Julian for help. "Uncle Julian, what's her name?"

Julian lowered his gaze. "Next time you see her, ask her yourself."

Lily beamed. "Okay!"

Oliver muttered under his breath, "So possessive."

Julian ignored him.

Meanwhile, noticing how much Sophia adored the crystal keychains, Lily hesitated before deciding to gift her one despite her own reluctance.

Sophia accepted it with delight. "Thank you, Lily!"

Victoria also expressed gratitude.

Lily smiled. "You're welcome."

Seeing Sophia's joy, Lily suddenly asked, "Sophia, aren't you picking one for your mom too?" Sophia froze momentarily, her voice softening. "I'll do that later."

"Oh."

After dinner, Isabella read briefly before heading to shower.

Just as she stepped out, her phone rang—Charles.

"Bella, I just saw Penelope in our neighborhood."

"Penelope? Victoria's aunt?"

Isabella froze mid-motion, still processing, when Charles continued, "At first I thought nothing of it, but when I got home, I saw her entering the villa opposite ours—the one under renovation!"

Isabella's expression darkened as she sat upright on the bed.

Charles, usually composed, now spoke through gritted teeth. "They're doing this deliberately! Everyone in Salzburg's business circle knows Alexander helped the Kensingtons establish—"

Even with Sinclair Corporation struggling, Charles remained in those circles—he'd known but spared Isabella the details to avoid upsetting her.

If the Kensingtons needed permanent residency in Salzburg, buying property made sense.

But choosing the house directly opposite the Sinclairs? No one would believe that coincidence.

Isabella understood Charles' implication.

Gripping her phone, she said, "I'll call Alexander."

"Good."

Under normal circumstances, Charles wouldn't involve Alexander. But this was different.

If Penelope moved in, daily provocations would follow. With Margaret's fragile health, the stress could be dangerous.

After hanging up, Isabella immediately dialed Alexander. The line rang until—

"Hello?"

Victoria's voice answered.
###Chapter 84

Isabella wasn't shocked when Victoria picked up. Of course Alexander and Victoria were practically glued together these days.

So what if she answered his phone?

Isabella kept her voice steady. "I need to speak with Alexander."

Victoria's icy tone dripped with recognition. "He's showering. Tell me what you want."

Tell her? Well, this did involve Victoria after all.

Charles had spotted Victoria's uncle Geoffrey and his wife Penelope in the neighborhood today. But Reginald had likely bought the villa across from theirs.

If Reginald purchased that property, it was clearly intended for Victoria's grandmother Agnes and her mother Eleanor.

So if Isabella told Victoria, would she stop them from moving in?

Not a chance.

Besides, Isabella doubted Victoria was unaware of Geoffrey's family planning to live right opposite the Sinclair residence. Telling her would be pointless - maybe even counterproductive. Isabella hung up without another word.

Over an hour passed. No callback from Alexander.

Maybe Victoria hadn't told him. Or maybe he simply didn't care to respond.

Either way, it changed nothing.

Composure intact, she dialed again. This time, his phone was off.

Her fingers tightened around her phone briefly before she called Richard instead. "Are they home?"

"No, they're out. Why?"

"Nothing." She ended the call.

Sleep eluded her that night.

At 9:15 the next morning, she tried Alexander again.

The call connected - then immediately disconnected.

She didn't know if it was Victoria or Alexander who'd hung up. Nor did she care.

Grabbing her purse, she headed out.

Soon she stood before Alexander's villa.

Richard greeted her warmly. "Mrs. Whitmore, you're back?"

Isabella nodded. "Yes."

"Shall I have lunch prepared?"

"Yes, thank you."

Upstairs, she paused outside the master bedroom before entering. Setting her bag down, she sat on the bed.

Everything remained exactly as she'd left it.

Her skincare products from when she'd stayed to care for Sophia had been returned to their places.

Even the clothes she'd taken were hanging neatly beside Alexander's in the walk-in closet.

As if she'd never left.

She didn't call again. He never called back.

Dinner was a solitary affair.

She considered asking Eleanor for help, but that would only complicate matters.

Besides, while Alexander respected his grandmother, whether he listened was another story.

After eating, she opened her laptop and buried herself in work.

Night fell.

Just as she assumed Alexander and Sophia wouldn't return, car headlights illuminated the driveway.

Sophia noticed first. Spotting Isabella's car, she turned excitedly to Alexander. "Dad! Mom's home!"

"Hmm."

Alexander glanced at the familiar vehicle before entering with Sophia.

Sophia immediately asked Richard, who'd come to greet them. "Where's Mom?"

"Mrs. Whitmore is upstairs."
###Chapter 85

Sophia bounded up the stairs with infectious energy, her laughter echoing through the grand hallway.

Isabella had just powered down her laptop and organized her workspace when she stepped out of the master suite. Before she could react, Sophia launched herself into her mother's arms with an enthusiastic hug. "Mommy!"

Isabella gently stroked her daughter's hair but didn't return the embrace.

Too excited to notice, Sophia began chattering animatedly about her day. The sound of approaching footsteps made Isabella look up, her eyes meeting Alexander's across the hallway.

His expression remained unreadable while hers stayed composed.

Looking down at Sophia, Isabella said, "Go ask Margaret to help you with your bath. Mommy needs to speak with Daddy." Alexander paused mid-step at her words.

After two delightful days outdoors, Sophia was in high spirits. Though reluctant, she didn't argue and obediently headed to her room where Margaret waited to assist her.

Isabella turned to Alexander, who leaned casually against the wall, scrolling through his phone. "Can we talk in private?"

"Fine."

She entered the study first. As Alexander followed, she added, "Close the door."

She wanted to ensure their conversation wouldn't disturb Sophia, especially if it turned contentious.

It struck her that in all their years of marriage, they'd never had a proper argument.

Alexander had never cared enough to fight with her.

As for Isabella, every moment with him was precious - too precious to waste on quarrels.

Alexander shut the door and turned to face her. "What's this about?"

Isabella went straight to the point. "Victoria's uncle Geoffrey purchased the villa across from Uncle Charles'. They've been renovating for weeks now. I expect they'll move in soon."

Victoria's mother Eleanor bore the Kensington name.

But the tangled history between the Sinclair, Whitmore, and Kensington families didn't begin with Eleanor and Evelyn.

It stretched back to their grandmothers' generation.

Back then, Victoria's grandmother Agnes and Isabella's grandmother Margaret had been inseparable friends.

Agnes had married beneath her station and struggled financially. Margaret had frequently supported her family. Later, Eleanor and Evelyn had become close friends as well.

The Whitmore and Sinclair families were social equals.

Reginald and Evelyn had fallen in love naturally, and their relationship had been strong initially. Everything changed when Eleanor returned after university.

To elevate Eleanor's status, Agnes had coldly severed ties with Margaret.

Over the years, whenever the Kensingtons encountered Charles or Margaret, their attitude dripped with condescension - a stark contrast to their former desperation when seeking help.

Isabella didn't need to elaborate. She knew Alexander understood this history.

Surely, with this context, he would...

Alexander did understand. He also grasped what Isabella was asking.

He withdrew a cigarette, pausing before lighting it. "Do you mind?"

Isabella shook her head.

After taking a long drag, he asked, "You want me to make them leave?"

"Yes."

Alexander exhaled slowly, the smoke curling between them as he considered.

This mattered deeply to Isabella. She could overlook many things, but not this.

Her hands clenched into fists, her eyes glistening as she looked at him. "I'm begging you. If you agree, I'll—"

"Fine," he interrupted.

Isabella froze. She hadn't expected such immediate agreement.
###Chapter 86

Tears sprang to Isabella's eyes, her mind going momentarily blank. She quickly composed herself. "Thank you." Her voice trembled slightly as she asked, "What are the—"

Alexander stubbed out his cigarette before she could finish. His fingers brushed away a stray tear tracing her cheekbone. "Get some rest."

Isabella stood frozen, watching his retreating form. The unexpected gesture left her momentarily disoriented. When she finally collected herself, uncertainty gripped her.

His instruction to rest early—did that imply she should stay overnight?

Technically, they were still married despite living separately. One night under the same roof shouldn't matter.

But the master bedroom? Absolutely not.

Taking a steadying breath, she gathered her things—a change of clothes, toiletries—and headed for Sophia's room instead.

Morning came early. Isabella awoke before seven.

Sophia stirred soon after, wrapping small arms around her neck. "Mommy, will you take me to school today?"

"Of course," Isabella agreed.

They descended for breakfast after freshening up.

Alexander entered the dining room mid-meal, taking his seat across from them.

"Morning, Daddy!" Sophia chirped.

"Morning." Alexander's gaze flickered to Isabella before dropping to his plate. Silence settled over the table.

Isabella mirrored his quiet. His agreement to help changed nothing between them. The chasm remained as wide as ever.

After dropping Sophia at school, Isabella headed straight to work.

The tech expo had sparked numerous ideas between her and Nathaniel. The InnovaTech partnership had consumed their time until now.

Finally free to develop their concepts, they dove into planning sessions. The workload piled up rapidly.

Isabella planned to order takeout and work late. At six, her phone buzzed—Alexander's name flashing on screen while she was knee-deep in blueprints.

She excused herself from the conference room. "Hello?"

"Grandmother's here." Alexander's voice was clipped. "Come home."

The line went dead before she could respond.

Returning to the meeting, she briefed Nathaniel. "Family emergency. Email me the meeting notes—I'll review everything tonight."

Nathaniel waved her off. "Go. We've got this."

Thirty minutes later, Isabella pulled into the estate driveway. Alexander's car already occupied its usual spot.

Inside, she found him on the living room sofa with Eleanor and Sophia. He noted her arrival without comment.

Eleanor rose with a warm smile. "Isabella, darling! You're just in time for dinner."

Alexander took the seat beside Isabella without prompting this time.

Eleanor piled food onto Isabella's plate, tutting. "You're skin and bones! Don't they feed you at that office?"
###Chapter 87

Eleanor's tone was sharp, but her eyes softened when they landed on Alexander.

He remained impassive, already reaching for a serving dish to place food on Isabella's plate.

"Thank you," Isabella murmured.

Eleanor announced she'd brought various health supplements. After dinner, she insisted on personally preparing medicinal soups for both of them.

Isabella had no choice but to nod in agreement.

Having spent her youth in Salzburg, Eleanor had mastered the art of slow-simmered broths.

When dinner concluded, she marched into the kitchen to supervise. Isabella tried to assist, only to be gently but firmly shooed away.

Left with no alternatives, Isabella settled onto the living room sofa.

Sophia and Alexander occupied the same space—one engrossed in her puzzle, the other scrolling through work emails. Silence blanketed the room.

Nathaniel's message pinged Isabella's phone about a work matter. She immediately dove into the discussion, fingers flying across the screen.

Her concentration was so complete that she missed Eleanor's return from the kitchen.

Alexander, however, had already set his phone aside.

When Isabella finally noticed, she quickly locked her screen. "Grandmother."

Eleanor surveyed the trio and sighed. "You all—"

She shook her head before sitting beside Isabella. "What has you so preoccupied?"

"Just work matters."

Eleanor snorted, gesturing toward Alexander. "Can't you discuss work with him? Or is he just decorative furniture?"

Isabella froze. She hadn't mentioned resigning from Whitmore Industries.

Her eyes flicked to Alexander.

He seemed oddly pleased, making no move to correct Eleanor or reveal Isabella's employment status.

Perhaps he feared Eleanor would insist on her returning to the company.

Eleanor swiftly changed topics, then dragged both Isabella and Alexander into the garden for a walk.

After their stroll, Eleanor yawned. "I'll bathe and rest now. Don't forget to drink the soup when it's ready."

Isabella opened her mouth to respond, then froze as the implication hit her. She turned wide eyes toward Alexander.

Anticipating her reaction, he said, "Grandmother plans to stay with us for a while."

"What?" Isabella gasped.

Alexander offered no further explanation. "I'm going to the study."

With that, he disappeared upstairs.

Sophia bounded down moments later, tugging Isabella upstairs to help with her puzzle.

An hour later, Margaret entered with a tray. "Mrs. Whitmore, the tonic is ready."

She placed a bowl before Isabella.

"Thank you."

"Mrs. Whitmore Senior said to drink it hot."

"Of course."

Margaret departed to deliver Alexander's portion.

After finishing her soup, Isabella reminded Sophia about bath time.

With Eleanor staying over, sleeping in Sophia's room wasn't an option tonight.

Once Sophia was settled, Isabella returned to the master suite.

Alexander's absence suggested he remained in the study.

Nathaniel had sent additional documents requiring review.

She addressed several straightforward items, but complex issues demanded deeper consideration. Pondering them, she stepped into the bathroom.

Post-shower, she realized she'd forgotten pajama bottoms.

Her earlier clothes were damp from splashed water.

Assuming Alexander hadn't returned, she hesitated before pushing the door open.

And collided with his piercing gaze the moment she stepped out.
###Chapter 88

Isabella froze, her words catching in her throat. The situation felt awkward but not entirely unfamiliar.

They were married, after all. Over the years, they'd shared intimate moments like any other couple. Though she secretly wished Alexander would fall for her, she'd never resorted to overt seduction.

Not because the thought hadn't crossed her mind. She simply knew such tactics wouldn't work on him.

That's why she always wore modest two-piece pajama sets at home. The oversized top she currently wore fell mid-thigh, perfectly decent even without the matching bottoms.

"I forgot my pants," she explained quickly, wanting to avoid any misunderstanding.

The loose cotton shirt should have been innocent enough. But Isabella underestimated how the fabric draped over her curves. The high-low hemline accentuated her legs while certain movements hinted at more than intended.

Fresh from her shower, her skin glowed with natural radiance. The effect was unintentionally alluring - more provocative than any lingerie could be.

Alexander glanced at her twice before looking away. "Okay," he said flatly.

Relieved he didn't seem affected, Isabella turned toward the walk-in closet without another word.

When she returned properly dressed, Alexander remained in the bedroom. Seeing no reason for conversation, she moved past him to her vanity.

Alexander gathered his clothes and disappeared into the bathroom. The sound of running water filled the silence.

Isabella completed her nighttime routine and slipped between the sheets. Unlike their first night sharing this bed, sleep didn't come easily tonight. His earlier promise weighed on her mind.

She lay awake for what felt like hours before Alexander emerged from the bathroom. The lights clicked off, and the mattress dipped as he settled on his side.

The space between them felt vast despite the king-sized bed. Neither spoke as darkness enveloped the room.

Eventually, exhaustion claimed her.

Morning light revealed Alexander's empty side of the bed. Isabella dressed quickly and descended to find Eleanor already in the kitchen.

Before Eleanor could speak, the front door opened. Alexander strode in, his gray workout clothes clinging to his damp skin. "Morning," he greeted his grandmother.

Eleanor's expression darkened. "You're both up early."

Isabella frowned at the odd comment. Wasn't waking early a good thing?

Alexander answered before she could. "I studied pharmacology, Grandmother. That soup you gave us last night? Doesn't work on me."

He disappeared upstairs without another word.

Isabella's breath hitched. It took her two full seconds to comprehend his meaning - Eleanor had tried to drug them.
###Chapter 89

The worst part? It wasn't just any ordinary sedative.

Alexander had recognized its effects immediately. He must not have touched the soup at all last night. Isabella never expected Eleanor to resort to such measures.

She opened her mouth to protest, but Eleanor sighed dramatically before she could speak. "Sometimes having a grandson who's too clever is troublesome. I was hoping for another great-grandchild. Isabella dear, do try harder with Alexander, won't you?"

Isabella's words died in her throat.

Even though Alexander had agreed to help her yesterday, she knew their relationship had no future.

Last night could have been disastrous. Another child? Absolutely impossible.

Just then, Sophia came bounding down the stairs.

Isabella's expression cooled slightly at the sight of her daughter, reminded of Sophia's obvious admiration for Victoria.

During breakfast, Alexander casually took the seat beside Isabella again.

Neither initiated conversation.

Yesterday, Isabella had taken Sophia to school. Today, the girl requested her father's company.

"Alright," Alexander agreed.

Eleanor immediately suggested, "Why don't you take Isabella along? You both work at—"

"No need," Isabella interrupted. "He's always in meetings. I don't have a car anyway."

Eleanor waved her hand dismissively. "Nonsense! Just call the driver when you finish work."

Before Isabella could protest further, Eleanor declared, "It's settled."

Isabella glanced at Alexander, who remained silent—his tacit agreement.

After breakfast, Isabella found herself in Alexander's car with Sophia.

Sophia climbed in eagerly, thrilled to have both parents taking her today.

Isabella couldn't remember the last time she'd ridden in Alexander's vehicle.

As she moved to enter after Sophia, Alexander suddenly spoke. "Other side."

Isabella froze mid-step, then wordlessly circled the car as the driver opened the opposite door.

Now Sophia sat between them.

Alexander was engrossed in his phone, typing rapidly.

Sophia peeked over his shoulder. "Oh! It's Victoria!"

Alexander merely hummed in response.

Perhaps remembering Isabella's presence, Sophia shot her several quick glances before falling silent about the messages.

Bored, Sophia soon climbed out of Alexander's lap and opened the car's storage compartment. Isabella didn't mean to look, but her peripheral vision caught the contents.

A tube of lipstick. A designer clutch. Sophia's tiny backpack from last summer. The first two items clearly belonged to Victoria.

Suddenly, Isabella understood why Alexander had redirected her seating. That spot was reserved for Victoria—she wasn't permitted to take the other woman's place.
###Chapter 90

The memory made Isabella's throat constrict painfully. The car suddenly felt suffocating. She reached to roll down the window, then hesitated. Her hand hovered over the button before dropping away. Instead, she turned to stare blankly at the passing scenery.

Soon they arrived at Sophia's school. Isabella exited the car to escort her inside while Alexander remained seated.

"Daddy—" Sophia began.

"Your father's busy."

Sophia's shoulders slumped. Isabella knew how differently Alexander behaved when bringing Sophia to school with Victoria. He'd always walk them both to the classroom door.

Today, with Isabella present, she couldn't tell if he was genuinely occupied or simply avoiding public appearances with her.

Deciding not to press the issue, Isabella turned to Alexander. "You can go ahead. I'll take a cab to Innovatech."

Alexander glanced sideways at her. "It's fine. The office is on my way."

But Isabella no longer wanted the ride. She opened her mouth to insist, then stopped herself. If he didn't mind, why should she make it awkward?

She waited until Sophia disappeared inside with her teacher before returning to the car.

Silence filled the Bentley during the drive. Ten minutes from Innovatech, Nathaniel's documents pinged on her phone.

Isabella became engrossed in reviewing them, barely noticing when they arrived.

Alexander's voice startled her. "We're here."

The luxury Bentley drew stares outside the office building. Since she and Alexander would have minimal future interactions, Isabella wanted to avoid unnecessary attention.

She grabbed her bag hastily. "Thanks for the ride."

Alexander studied her briefly. "Mm."

Then to the driver: "Drive."

Isabella hurried inside.

By noon, Nathaniel had arranged a business lunch. As their car entered the restaurant lot, Isabella spotted Alexander exiting his vehicle—followed immediately by Victoria.

Nathaniel rubbed his temple. "Perfect timing."

Isabella nodded. Then she noticed Reginald, Evelyn, and others waiting nearby. They rushed over upon seeing the couple.

"Should we wait until they're inside?" Nathaniel asked.

"No." Isabella squared her shoulders. "I've done nothing wrong."

As they exited, Alexander and Victoria faced their direction. The two couples locked eyes.

Alexander remained impassive, his gaze sliding over them dismissively. Victoria's expression turned icy at the sight of Isabella.

Isabella guessed Victoria's reaction stemmed from her request to Alexander—to stop Victoria's uncle from moving near Charles.

For Alexander, it was a simple favor. But Victoria clearly resented any interaction between them.

Reginald noticed Victoria's tension and followed her glare to Isabella. His frown deepened.

Evelyn observed the scene with visible satisfaction, pride gleaming in her eyes at how thoroughly Alexander prioritized Victoria.
###Chapter 91

Alexander was present too. So Isabella refrained from any impulsive actions or words.

Nathaniel approached, but he bypassed Isabella completely. Instead, he addressed Alexander directly with a practiced smile. "What an unexpected pleasure, Mr. Whitmore. Fancy seeing you here again."

Alexander returned the smile politely. "Indeed. Quite the coincidence."

"I've been meaning to take you to dinner, Mr. Whitmore," Nathaniel continued smoothly. "But my schedule has been rather hectic lately."

"No need for apologies, Mr. Graves," Alexander replied. "I understand how demanding your position can be."

Of course Nathaniel was busy. Otherwise, he would have started working at Whitmore Technologies after their initial meeting a month prior.

Reginald also sought to establish a connection with Alexander. Noticing that Alexander didn't object to Nathaniel ignoring Isabella, he took it as permission to approach.

Beatrice followed his lead. After exchanging pleasantries with Alexander, Reginald turned to Isabella. "Hello, Bella."

Isabella remained silent.

Reginald didn't press further, shifting his full attention back to Alexander. After concluding their conversation, they returned to Alexander's side without acknowledging Isabella.

The group then entered the restaurant together.

Nathaniel watched their retreating figures with growing frustration. "It's like you're invisible to them."

Isabella shrugged indifferently. "Let's go. Our business partner is waiting."

As evening fell, Isabella found herself working late again. At nearly 7:00 pm, Eleanor called to inquire about her return time.

Under normal circumstances, Isabella would have gone home earlier with Eleanor visiting. But her project required immediate attention, and she couldn't bring herself to abandon it now.

After a brief hesitation, Isabella replied, "I'm sorry, Grandma. I have to work late tonight."

Eleanor sighed. "You and Alexander are both so busy. How will you ever move your relationship forward at this rate?"

Did that mean Alexander would be home tonight too?

"I'm sorry, Grandma," Isabella repeated.

"At least promise you'll eat something, no matter how busy you are."

"I will." After hanging up, Isabella's takeout arrived. She worked straight through until 10:00 pm before finally leaving the office.

Having not driven today, Isabella had arranged for her driver half an hour earlier. He should have arrived by now.

Descending to the lobby, Isabella spotted the waiting car - but it wasn't her usual driver. Alexander's vehicle stood there instead, with Alexander himself in the backseat.

When Isabella hesitated, Alexander rolled down the window. "Grandmother insisted I give you a ride."

Accepting the inevitable, Isabella circled the car and took the same seat she'd occupied that morning.

The car merged smoothly into the nighttime traffic. Silence settled between them once more.

Alexander remained engrossed in his phone, paying Isabella no attention until she broke the quiet.

"Did they agree?" she asked.

She was referring to her request about keeping Victoria's uncle from moving in. Alexander's odd expression that morning suggested Victoria had consented.

But what about the others?

Alexander didn't look up from his phone. "They did."

Isabella hesitated before pressing forward. "I want to buy the villa. Is that acceptable?"

This would finally resolve her dilemma.

Alexander paused, then turned to study her. "You may."

Relief washed over Isabella. "Thank you."

Alexander simply nodded. "Of course."
###Chapter 92

Eleanor Whitmore was still awake when Alexander and Isabella returned home. Only after confirming they'd arrived together did she finally retreat to her chambers, visibly relieved.

Upstairs, Isabella immediately called Charles with updates. The moment she ended that call, Nathaniel Graves' number flashed on her screen.

Thirty minutes later, Isabella hung up and entered the master suite. Alexander had already showered and was reclining against the headboard, engrossed in a leather-bound novel.

His gaze flickered upward briefly when she entered, then returned to the pages without comment.

Isabella averted her eyes. She took an unusually long shower, meticulously applying her favorite jasmine-scented conditioner. By the time she finished her nighttime routine, the clock showed midnight.

She stole another glance at Alexander.

Before, his cold indifference had become familiar territory. Sharing intimate spaces with him never unsettled her.

But after his unexpected assistance today, the dynamic shifted slightly. This new ambiguity left her uncertain how to navigate their interactions now.

Still, she reminded herself, nothing would fundamentally change between them.

With that thought, Isabella slipped silently into bed. The moment her head touched the pillow, Alexander closed his book and switched off the lights.

Had he been waiting for her just to perform this small courtesy?

The realization startled her. She dismissed it as imagination and soon drifted into uneasy sleep.

Morning brought another attempt from Eleanor to orchestrate a shared ride. "Alexander should drive you to work again today."

"I'm meeting a client," Isabella lied smoothly. "Having my own car will be more convenient."

Eleanor's frown deepened as she shot meaningful looks at Alexander, silently demanding he offer to chauffeur Isabella personally.

Alexander continued eating his omelet, deliberately ignoring his grandmother's pointed stares.

Isabella noticed and quickly lowered her gaze to her coffee.

Recognizing defeat, Eleanor dropped the subject.

Truthfully, Isabella had no client meetings. She simply couldn't bear another awkward car ride with Alexander. Nor did she wish to accumulate more debts of gratitude.

With little actual work, she remained at YodaVision until past nine. Returning home, she was surprised to find Alexander already there - unusual for someone who typically worked late.

The bedroom was empty when she entered. Setting down her purse, she noticed an unfamiliar document on her vanity.

This was odd.

Though they shared a bedroom, strict boundaries divided their spaces. His belongings stayed to the left, hers to the right. Neither trespassed into the other's territory.

Personal items - wallets, watches, skincare products - always remained in designated areas. Nothing was ever out of place.

Which meant this document couldn't have appeared by accident.

Curious, Isabella approached. The embossed seal on the folder made her pulse quicken. She flipped it open with trembling fingers.

As suspected - the deed to the villa across from Charles' office. Her name alone graced the ownership papers.

Before she could process this, Alexander's footsteps sounded in the doorway. She turned, clutching the documents. "I saw the deed. Thank you."

He opened his mouth to respond, but she continued hurriedly, "I don't have the full amount right now. Please give me time to-"
###Chapter 93

The neighborhood might be older, but it had undeniable charm. Given the astronomical property prices downtown, this place was easily worth two to three billion dors.

Isabella Sinclair didn’t have that kind of money right now.

Alexander Whitmore had just gotten home, loosening his tie. He seemed amused by her question, raising an eyebrow. "Planning to pay me for the villa?"

"Yeah, I—"

"Save it." He tossed his tie onto the dresser. "I can afford to give you that."

Then he set his watch down and walked into the bathroom without another word.

Isabella stared after him, momentarily stunned. She had always been careful not to impose on him since their marriage. That was why she never asked him for anything.

Now that she thought about it, this villa was the only thing Alexander had ever given her willingly in all these years. Maybe it was a parting gift—something to mark the end of their marriage.

With that thought, she tucked the deed into her drawer.

The next three days passed in a blur of work. On the fourth day, she finally had a break.

Both she and Alexander had been swamped lately, leaving little time for Sophia. At noon, the little girl called, asking if Isabella could pick her up from school. It had been ages since she’d done that.

With most of her work wrapped up, Isabella left early and drove to Sophia’s school in the afternoon. Sophia begged for a home-cooked meal, so the moment they got back, Isabella changed and headed straight to the kitchen.

Eleanor Whitmore was thrilled to see Isabella home early. When she noticed her cooking, she immediately called Alexander. "Come home for dinner."

"I’m working, Grandma."

Eleanor’s face darkened at first, then brightened with an idea. She hung up and turned to Isabella. "Take dinner to his office, dear."

Isabella hesitated. "If he’s busy, we shouldn’t disturb him."

"Busy or not, he still needs to eat. Right?"

"Grandma—"

Before she could argue, Eleanor clapped her hands. "It’s settled!"

With that, she ordered Margaret and the staff to prepare extra dishes. Her enthusiasm left Isabella no room to protest.

But there was one problem—Isabella had no idea which office Alexander was at today. How was she supposed to deliver dinner?

For all she knew, he might have other plans after work. She’d just be wasting her time.

Seizing a moment when Eleanor was distracted, Isabella slipped upstairs and called Alexander. He didn’t answer right away.

When he finally picked up, his voice was clipped. "What is it?"

"Grandma wants me to bring you dinner tonight."

Before he could respond, she added, "If you already have plans, I’ll tell her."

She was certain he wouldn’t want her showing up at his office. This call was just so they could both avoid an awkward situation.

"I do. Just tell her—"

Then, another voice cut in. "I brought dinner, Alexander."

Isabella froze.

"Okay," Alexander replied to the woman—Victoria Kensington.

Then, back to the phone, he said, "Tell Grandma I already have dinner plans."

Isabella wasn’t surprised. "Loud and clear. I’ll let her know."

"Good." He ended the call.

###Chapter 94

Isabella slipped her phone into her pocket and descended the stairs. She informed Eleanor that Alexander wouldn't be joining them for dinner.

The entire night passed without Alexander returning home.

By morning, Eleanor was fuming. "Unbelievable! I know his work keeps him occupied, but to not come home at all?"

Isabella merely offered a knowing smile. Alexander could have returned if he'd truly wanted to. Everyone needed sleep, after all.

The memory of Victoria's voice on the phone last night resurfaced. Alexander must have found better company elsewhere. That explained his absence.

Meanwhile at YodaVision Co., the major projects for the next two years had been outlined. Isabella had completed the framework in just two days, but Nathaniel insisted they refine their concepts. He sent documents to Frederick for feedback, expecting a lengthy delay.

Frederick was notoriously busy and unpredictable. They anticipated waiting days, possibly weeks, for his response.

To their astonishment, Frederick called within hours. "Impressive work."

His brief approval carried immense weight. Coming from someone with Frederick's exacting standards, those two words were high praise indeed.

Frederick continued, "Your foundation in AI development and historical context is flawless. Competent work."

His words were clearly directed at Isabella, making her eyes sting unexpectedly.

Before she could respond, he added, "However, you're becoming complacent. Without continuous improvement, you'll stagnate. Frankly Isabella, you're slipping."

"I understand, Mr. Aldridge," Isabella replied immediately. "I'll dedicate myself to catching up on recent advancements."

"Good." Frederick never wasted words. The call should have ended there.

Noticing his unusual availability, Isabella ventured, "Are you free for dinner tonight, Mr. Aldridge? My treat."

Nathaniel perked up at the suggestion. It had been ages since they'd shared a meal with Frederick. "Yes, join us if you can."

Frederick's response was typically blunt. "Prior engagement."

Their disappointment was palpable. Isabella was about to ask when he might be available when Frederick dropped his bombshell.

"Alexander made the arrangements." The statement left them stunned.

Nathaniel recovered first. "Why would Mr. Whitmore contact you?" His voice held barely concealed curiosity.

"Apparently he wants to introduce someone." With that, Frederick terminated the call.

Nathaniel turned to Isabella. "You don't think he's introducing Victoria, do you?"

Until recently, Nathaniel hadn't known about the Kensington family's tech interests. Victoria had sought employment at YodaVision specifically for access to Cuap programming language.

Public knowledge credited Frederick with creating Cuap alongside his team of developers.

With her YodaVision opportunity gone, Victoria likely sought direct access to Frederick - possibly even an apprenticeship.

The realization made Nathaniel curse violently. "That conniving bitch!"
###Chapter 95

Isabella shared the same suspicion. She was convinced this was Alexander's way of compensating Victoria after preventing her uncle from occupying the penthouse opposite Charles.

Alexander adored Victoria. He'd never intentionally make her feel inadequate just to accommodate Isabella.

Nathaniel remarked, "If Victoria's been hiding her true potential all along, then—"

His voice trailed off. Both he and Isabella were Frederick's protégés—that much was undeniable.

Though Frederick maintained a cold demeanor toward them, their bond ran deeper than appearances suggested.

Beneath his frosty exterior, Frederick possessed a compassionate heart. His high standards didn't negate his genuine care for them.

Yet Frederick was also a man of unwavering principles. Should Victoria demonstrate exceptional talent, he wouldn't reject her as an apprentice simply because of her feud with Isabella.

This was Nathaniel's primary concern.

Isabella, however, regained her composure swiftly. "Let's focus on our immediate tasks," she suggested.

Her priority now was executing her responsibilities flawlessly.

Isabella didn't return to the Whitmore estate until late that evening. Eleanor had retired for the night, and Alexander was conspicuously absent—likely not returning at all.

Emerging from her shower, Isabella froze when she spotted Alexander in the bedroom. His unexpected appearance surprised her. She gave a brief nod in acknowledgment.

She didn't inquire about his dinner with Frederick, nor did he volunteer any explanation. After a momentary glance, he disappeared into the bathroom.

The next morning, Isabella slept in. Descending the stairs, she heard Eleanor's acerbic voice. "It was past eleven when I retired last night, Alexander, and you were still missing. I'd nearly given up hope of seeing you home again!"

Alexander sat calmly sipping tea across from Eleanor, offering no response.

She rapped the table sharply. "Have you lost your tongue?"

Setting down his cup, Alexander noticed Isabella's approach. His gaze flickered toward her briefly before returning to Eleanor. "Weren't you the one demanding my presence for your morning outing?"

"I thought you'd ignored me again!" Eleanor scoffed.

"Wouldn't dream of it," Alexander replied, though his indifferent expression suggested otherwise.

Eleanor clutched her chest dramatically before waving Isabella over. "Join us, dear."

Taking a seat, Isabella asked, "Are you two planning an excursion, Grandmother?"

"Correction—we three are going," Eleanor corrected with a chuckle. "Where would you like to visit, Isabella? Your wish is my command."

Isabella considered herself rather uncreative when it came to leisure activities. "I'm content with anything. The choice is yours, Grandmother."

Eleanor's eyes sparkled with mischief. "What about the thermal springs? Our last attempt was... interrupted." She shot Alexander a pointed look. "This time, certain individuals will make proper amends."

Alexander continued drinking his tea, utterly unfazed by the implied accusation. The previous incident might as well have never occurred for all the reaction it provoked.

Isabella averted her gaze. While she'd visited the springs before and currently felt little enthusiasm, she wouldn't deny Eleanor's request. "That sounds lovely."
###Chapter 96

Isabella finished packing her suitcase after breakfast, carefully selecting outfits and essentials for the hot springs getaway. She only packed for herself—not for Alexander.

Their marriage was nothing more than a facade now. Alexander wasn’t truly her husband anymore. He belonged to Victoria Kensington, and she doubted he’d appreciate her touching his things.

Not that Isabella wanted to, either.

Meanwhile, Margaret helped Sophia with her packing. In the past, Isabella would’ve double-checked everything, worried Sophia might forget something important. But now? She didn’t spare it a second thought.

Once her own suitcase was zipped shut, Isabella carried it downstairs without hesitation.

Alexander and Sophia joined her shortly after.

When they arrived at the retreat, Alexander disappeared to make a phone call. Eleanor found Isabella unpacking in her room and handed her a small box.

"I got this for you," Eleanor said with a knowing smile. "Wear it in the springs."

Isabella hesitated, recognizing the glint in Eleanor’s eyes. "I brought my own swimwear—"

"It’s nothing scandalous," Eleanor assured her. "Open it."

Inside was a bikini—similar to what Isabella usually wore, but when she unfolded the bottoms, her cheeks warmed. The fabric was soft, the cut just a little more daring than she was used to. And the color—deep crimson—made her fair skin glow.

Eleanor chuckled. "You’ll thank me later."

Isabella sighed. "Fine."

Just then, Alexander walked in. His gaze flickered to the box before she snapped it shut. He pretended not to notice, turning away casually.

"What brings you here, Grandmother?" he asked.

"To make sure you two actually enjoy the springs!" Eleanor nudged him toward the bathroom. "Go change."

Alexander didn’t argue. Moments later, he emerged in a robe, his expression unreadable.

Isabella slipped into the bathroom next. When she came out, Alexander was already gone.

She was about to head to the springs alone when Eleanor appeared. "Alexander’s in the private one to the left," she said, grinning. "Hurry up."

The private spring was small—intimate. Barely enough space for two people without their limbs brushing.

Eleanor’s plan was obvious.

Isabella hesitated but finally stepped inside.

Alexander was already in the water, his robe discarded. His eyes locked onto her as she approached.

The bikini Eleanor had chosen was more revealing than Isabella had realized. The red fabric clung to her curves, the soft material leaving little to the imagination.

She swallowed hard, suddenly hyperaware of his gaze.
###Chapter 97

Isabella hesitated as she studied her reflection in the mirror. The crimson bikini was daring, but she didn't dislike it. With a deep breath, she fastened the ties.

She still wore the plush white robe when she stepped out. Alexander's intense gaze made her suddenly aware of how little fabric covered her body.

After a brief pause, Isabella lifted her chin and walked forward with deliberate confidence. She placed her towel and phone on the stone ledge before letting the robe slip from her shoulders.

Alexander's sharp inhale was audible.

She knew he'd recognize Eleanor's handiwork. He might assume this was some sort of invitation, but Isabella had no such intentions.

Let him think what he wanted. She refused to let his potential misinterpretation stop her from wearing something she actually liked.

This resolve steadied her hands as she discarded the robe. She deliberately avoided checking for his reaction.

The warm mineral water enveloped her as she settled at a careful distance from him.

Alexander turned his head away. Silence stretched between them.

From her periphery, she could see the defined ridges of his abdomen. Isabella quickly averted her eyes.

Just when she thought they'd spend the entire soak in silence, Alexander pushed a floating tray toward her. "Hungry?"

The resort staff had prepared an assortment of fruits and pastries. "Thanks," she murmured.

He didn't respond.

She plucked a grape but found she had no appetite. After one bite, she nudged the tray back toward him.

The crystal-clear water revealed everything beneath the surface. As the tray drifted back, she couldn't miss his complete lack of physical response.

To an outsider, it might suggest disinterest. But Isabella knew better - his indifference stemmed from genuine lack of attraction.

She could parade in the most scandalous lingerie and it wouldn't affect him. This outcome was exactly as she'd predicted.

With divorce looming, she had no intention of intimacy. That's why she'd worn the bikini without concern - it held no power over him.

Isabella discreetly looked away.

The hot springs worked their magic, the heat seeping into her muscles. Drowsiness crept in, though she fought sleep.

Eventually, the fatigue won. "I'm going in," she announced, rising.

"Alright," came his clipped response.

She wrapped herself in the robe just as Alexander exited the water. Their paths nearly crossed at the elevator where Eleanor waited.

"Finished already?" Eleanor's eyes darted between them.

"Yes," Isabella confirmed.

Eleanor opened her mouth, then noticed Alexander approaching. The space between them told the whole story - another failed matchmaking attempt.

"A friend just arrived in town for medical treatment," Eleanor said with a sigh. "I must go, but you two should enjoy the rest of your stay."

She squeezed Isabella's hand before turning to Alexander. "Be nice to her. Understood?"

"Understood," he replied flatly.
###Chapter 98

The elevator doors slid open with a soft chime. Oliver Westbrook stepped out, catching Isabella Sinclair completely off guard. She hadn't anticipated his presence at the hot springs resort.

Eleanor Whitmore and Alexander Whitmore showed no surprise whatsoever. Clearly, they'd been expecting Oliver all along.

Oliver's gaze landed on Isabella first, one eyebrow arching in silent greeting. Then he turned to Eleanor with practiced charm. "Leaving so soon, Mrs. Whitmore? Won't you stay for lunch?"

The Whitmores and Westbrooks went way back. Eleanor had watched Oliver grow up. She smiled fondly at him. "I'll leave you young people to enjoy yourselves."

They escorted Eleanor to the entrance, watching her car disappear down the winding driveway. Sophia immediately bounced on her toes. "What brings you here, Mr. Westbrook?"

Oliver crouched to pinch Sophia's rosy cheeks. "Your father summoned me. Came straight after seeing your grandmother off. Good friend material, don't you think?"

"Dad called you?"

"Indeed." Oliver's smile widened. "I even alerted Julian and Victoria the moment I heard your grandmother was leaving. They're en route as we speak. Happy?"

His eyes deliberately sought Isabella's reaction.

She met his gaze evenly, recognizing the calculated move.

Sophia's initial excitement faltered as she glanced uncertainly at her mother.

Isabella pretended not to notice. She ruffled Sophia's hair instead. "Have fun with them. I'm heading home."

Without sparing Alexander or Oliver another glance, Isabella turned on her heel and walked away.

Oliver studied Isabella's retreating figure, noting her complete lack of reaction. No discomfort. No concern. Absolute indifference.

With Sophia still present, Oliver couldn't speak freely. He leaned toward Alexander instead. "What's going on?"

Alexander remained impassive. "Did you come alone?"

"Are you kidding? Hot springs demand company. Brought my date, obviously—"

Oliver cut himself off mid-sentence, tilting his head. "Wait. You're changing the subject."

Alexander didn't deny it. "Your date's here."

A statuesque blonde approached them, bathrobe parted to reveal a scandalous bikini beneath.

Back in her room, Isabella changed into comfortable loungewear and settled at the desk. Her laptop screen illuminated with research from the latest tech expo.

Thirty minutes later, compiled data filled her screen. A sudden idea struck.

She dialed Nathaniel Graves. "Got a minute?"

"At a masquerade ball. What's up?"

Isabella outlined her concept.

She could practically hear his expression shifting through the phone. "Give me fifteen. Heading back now."

"Fine." Hanging up, Isabella resumed work until chatter from downstairs interrupted her concentration. Julian and Victoria must have arrived.

Rising, she shut the window against the noise.

Her stomach growled. Room service took her order promptly, promising quick delivery.

When the knock came, Isabella opened the door to find—

###Chapter 99

The staff member was heading toward the elevator when he collided with Alexander and his group in the hallway. Oliver asked, "This meal—"

"Madam Sinclair ordered it," the staff replied instantly.

Clearly, he meant Isabella.

Alexander's group didn't pressure the staff. They let him continue his work. After the staff left, Oliver chuckled. "Looks like we won't need to invite Isabella to lunch."

Alexander responded casually, "We should ask her to join us."

Victoria froze at his words. Her lips pursed as she stared at him. Julian and Oliver exchanged surprised glances.

Oliver laughed. "You're right. Mrs. Whitmore Senior explicitly told you to look after Isabella. She'll have our heads if we exclude her from lunch."

The hot spring retreat was Whitmore property. Eleanor likely had her own people monitoring everything. Every move Alexander's group made would be reported back to her.

Victoria relaxed slightly at Oliver's explanation. She'd feared Alexander was developing real feelings for Isabella due to Eleanor's meddling. Clearly, she'd been overthinking.

Julian also looked away after Oliver's remark.

Just then, Sophia returned. Alexander ruffled her hair. "Go upstairs and ask your mother to join us for lunch."

Sophia blinked in surprise. "Mom's coming to lunch?"

"Yes."

Sophia's jaw dropped. She frowned at Victoria. She didn't want her mother joining them. Isabella would undoubtedly target Victoria, ruining everyone's mood.

Victoria smiled warmly. "Go on, sweetheart."

After hesitating, Sophia headed upstairs.

When the doorbell rang, Isabella was already eating. She checked the monitor, saw Sophia, and set aside her meal. Opening the door, she asked, "What is it, Soph?"

Sophia bit her lip before meeting Isabella's gaze. "Hi, Mom. Dad sent me. He wants you to join us for lunch downstairs."

Isabella declined. "I'm already eating here. Enjoy your lunch without me."

Sophia exhaled in relief. "Okay. I'll tell Dad that, alright?"

Isabella noticed Sophia's reluctance. "Sure. Bye."

"Bye!" Sophia chirped, turning to leave. After two steps, guilt struck her.

"Are you sure you'll be okay alone, Mom? Should I stay with you?"

Downstairs was lively and fun. Leaving Isabella alone felt wrong. Yet Sophia's offer lacked enthusiasm—she clearly preferred joining Alexander's group.

Isabella wouldn't force reluctant company. She crouched to Sophia's level. "I enjoy solitude. Go have fun with them."

Sophia brightened instantly. "Alright. I'm going now."

"Go ahead," Isabella said.

Sophia dashed off.

Isabella watched her daughter disappear before closing the door. Alone again, she returned to her meal.
###Chapter 100

Sophia rushed downstairs to inform Alexander. "Mom's already eating in her room. She's working on something."

Oliver arched an eyebrow at this revelation. So Isabella knew her place after all. Julian lowered his gaze, remaining silent.

Victoria suppressed a knowing smile. Of course Isabella wouldn't dare join them. Nobody actually wanted her presence at this gathering anyway.

The coward could have come down if she wanted, but all that awaited her were mocking stares and deliberate exclusion. Better for everyone that she stayed hidden in her room like the pathetic creature she was.

Alexander barely reacted to Sophia's message. "Understood."

He wasn't particularly insistent on Isabella's attendance either. "Let's begin without her," he announced, gesturing for everyone to start eating.

Victoria's lips curved in satisfaction as she elegantly took the seat beside Alexander.

Meanwhile, Isabella had finished her lunch and returned to work. Nathaniel had arrived home by now, and fresh ideas kept flooding her mind.

When she finished explaining her concepts to Nathaniel over the phone, his reaction was explosive. "Holy shit! You're an absolute genius!" His voice boomed through the receiver.

"The way you grasp these concepts so quickly - you're a natural, Isabella! I always knew you had this in you!"

Before she could respond, Nathaniel groaned in frustration. "Seven damn years wasted! If you hadn't left for that marriage, AetherTech would be dominating the industry by now!"

Isabella winced and pulled the phone away from her ear.

Nathaniel quickly caught himself. Clearing his throat, he refocused on their breakthrough. This discovery required expanding their team immediately.

Nathaniel contacted Dominic Vega first, then rallied the rest of AetherTech's staff. These weren't just employees collecting paychecks - they were passionate learners eager to grow.

Though Dominic's team struggled to fully comprehend the technical aspects at first, Nathaniel's explanations soon had them buzzing with excitement. They volunteered for overtime without hesitation, officially joining the project.

An in-person meeting would have been ideal, but the two-hour commute to AetherTech wasn't practical. Inspiration struck unpredictably - better to capture it immediately before it faded.

They settled on a video conference instead.

During a lull in their discussion, Nathaniel asked casually, "You alone in there? Where's Alexander and the others?"

"Probably still eating downstairs," Isabella replied indifferently.

"Just Alexander and Sophia?"

"Victoria, Oliver, and Julian are there too."

"And they left you alone up here?"

"Sophia invited me down. I declined."

"Good. At least Alexander's not completely heartless."

Isabella disagreed. Like Oliver, she suspected Alexander only extended the invitation to avoid Eleanor's nagging.

More importantly, everyone downstairs was firmly in Victoria's camp. Even if Isabella joined them, they had nothing to fear - she couldn't possibly challenge Victoria's position. That's why they didn't mind her presence.

Four intense hours later, as dinner time approached, they agreed to a two-hour break before resuming work.

Isabella organized their progress before closing her laptop. She needed fresh air - a short walk would clear her mind. She could pick up some apple cartons for Nathaniel and the team on her way back.
###Chapter 101

The hot spring resort stretched endlessly before Isabella. She had no clue where Alexander and the others might be. Descending the stairs, she didn't encounter them.

Since twilight hadn't fully settled yet, Isabella summoned two staff members to accompany her up the mountainside.

The evening breeze carried a slight chill, but her layered outfit kept her warm. She savored the crisp air while gathering apples, the rhythmic activity clearing her thoughts.

With multiple hands helping, they quickly filled several crates with ripe fruit.

Rather than heading back immediately, Isabella lingered to admire the spectacular sunset painting the sky.

Footsteps and a child's voice interrupted her reverie.

Turning, her eyes locked with Julian's.

He appeared equally surprised by their unexpected meeting, hesitation flickering across his features.

"Ms. Sinclair!" Lily's excited voice rang out from the video call.

Julian had been showing his niece the orchard through his phone, planning to bring her fresh apples tomorrow. Running into Isabella hadn't been part of his agenda.

Despite their recent encounters and Julian's past assistance, Isabella maintained emotional distance. Her expression cooled at the sight of him, though softened slightly upon hearing Lily's cheerful voice.

Julian noted her shifting demeanor.

"Lily wants to speak with you," he said, keeping his distance. "If you have time?"

That day at the nursing home had left Isabella emotionally drained. Though Lily had been the one requesting her company, the little girl's presence had actually helped Isabella breathe through the suffocating weight of her grief.

Isabella nodded.

Julian handed over his phone without approaching, maintaining a respectful three-foot gap.

Their conversation revealed Lily was traveling with her grandmother, explaining her absence from the resort. Isabella shared the sunset view with the delighted child before returning the phone after fifteen minutes.

"Thank you," Julian said as they concluded the call.

"No need."

Darkness was settling, but the illuminated path made descent easy. Without another word, Isabella turned toward the resort.

Julian followed silently at a distance.

Their wordless journey ended when they encountered Victoria at the entrance.

Victoria's lips pressed into a tight line at seeing them return together. Isabella walked past without acknowledgment.

"Julian, you two—" Victoria began.

"We happened to be in the orchard at the same time," Julian replied flatly.

Knowing Julian had gone to video call Lily among the apple trees, Victoria relaxed slightly. A coincidental meeting made sense.

"They're at the pavilion," she said. "The bonfire preparations are ready. We were about to call you."

Julian nodded.

They walked toward the gathering side by side, the unspoken tension lingering like the evening mist.
###Chapter 102

The bonfire feast tonight featured hearty stew, perfectly charred grilled chicken, and sizzling barbecue skewers.

Aromatic steam rose from the simmering chicken stew. The marinated chicken pieces were already skewered and ready for grilling. Beside the roaring fire, a long banquet table displayed an impressive spread of premium ingredients - all prepped and waiting.

Flames danced brightly in the night.

Alexander and his companions had already taken their seats around the fire pit.

When Julian and Victoria returned, Victoria immediately claimed the spot beside Alexander.

Oliver couldn't resist temptation and had already started nibbling on the marinated chicken skewers.

Seeing the group assembled, he was about to officially begin the feast when he suddenly remembered Isabella.

Turning to Sophia, he said, "Sophia, go ask your mother to join us. Tell her we have amazing food down here."

He fully expected Isabella to decline, just like she had at lunch. But appearances had to be maintained.

Victoria understood the gesture too. The invitation was merely a formality - whether Isabella came or not was her choice.

"Go ahead, Sophia," Victoria added.

Sophia frowned, reluctant to move. Secretly, she didn't want her mother joining them. But with everyone watching, she had no choice.

Just as she set down her drink, Alexander spoke up. "I'll go."

His words brought instant silence.

Alexander stood and left without another word.

Oliver blinked, then chuckled awkwardly. "Well... having Alexander invite her personally does show more sincerity."

Sending a child to fetch Isabella every time had been rather thoughtless.

Victoria nodded in agreement.

This was clearly just another attempt to appeal to Eleanor. Alexander's gesture meant nothing.

He'd never shown any real affection for Isabella before. That certainly wouldn't change now.

But Sophia pressed her lips together anxiously. If her father went to call her mother... she might actually come down.

Her mother had never been able to refuse Alexander anything.

Meanwhile upstairs, Isabella had returned to her room, ordered room service, and opened her laptop.

She'd barely started working when the door opened.

Startled, she turned to see Alexander entering with his key card.

Assuming he'd returned for something, she merely glanced at him before refocusing on her screen.

Then she heard his deep voice. "There's a bonfire party downstairs. It's quite lively. Why don't you join us?"

She paused. Like Oliver and the others, she assumed this was just another performance for Eleanor's benefit.

It meant nothing. And even if it did, she no longer cared.

"I have work," she said flatly. Then, turning slightly, she added, "Don't worry. If Eleanor asks, I'll cover for you."

Alexander chuckled at her words, his dark, unreadable eyes studying her.

Under his gaze, Isabella's fingers tensed slightly on the keyboard.

After all these years together, she still couldn't decipher him.

She'd never truly understood what went on behind those enigmatic eyes.

Once, she might have tried to unravel the mysteries of his heart. But now...

Isabella pressed her lips together firmly. "Thank you for asking, but I'd rather stay here."
###Chapter 103

Alexander chuckled silently before responding, "Understood."

Without another word, he turned on his heel and exited the room.

When he returned downstairs, Oliver and Julian were already halfway through their meals. His solitary reappearance drew surprised glances from the group.

Like Sophia, they'd assumed Isabella would never refuse an invitation delivered personally by Alexander himself.

"Did she decline?" Julian inquired between bites.

Alexander shook his head. "She did."

Then he addressed the waiting staff with crisp efficiency. "Prepare the seafood platter, grilled lamb chops, and lobster bisque. Deliver them to Mrs. Whitmore's suite immediately."

Victoria's lips pressed into a thin line at his words.

Isabella's refusal to join them meant nothing. Neither did Alexander sending food to her room.

But hearing him refer to her as "Mrs. Whitmore" made her stomach twist. The title sounded too permanent, too official.

She quickly rationalized that the retreat staff wouldn't know Isabella by name. What else would he call her?

Upstairs, Isabella's stomach growled audibly.

When the doorbell chimed, she opened it to find a server wheeling in an elaborate cart. The staff member meticulously arranged the dishes, lifting each silver dome with a flourish.

But the moment the aromas hit her, Isabella frowned. "There must be some mistake. I didn't order this."

The rich scent of truffle-infused bisque filled the air. The table now boasted an extravagant spread - fresh oysters, wagyu beef, and black truffle pasta.

It looked divine. But completely wrong.

"No mistake, ma'am," the server assured her. "Mr. Whitmore specifically requested these for you. Your original order will arrive shortly."

Isabella blinked.

This spread could feed four people easily. And now her actual meal was still coming?

The result? She ate. And ate. And ate.

When her scheduled video conference with Nathaniel approached, she was still picking at dessert.

Nathaniel logged on early to request files, only to find Isabella mid-bite. "What on earth are you eating? That looks incredible."

Isabella angled her camera to show the feast.

As other team members joined, audible gasps came through the speakers.

"You're eating all that alone? Just started?"

"Actually," Isabella dabbed her lips, "I'm nearly finished."

"Did you order the entire menu?"

She hesitated. "Not exactly."

Nathaniel's smirk was audible. "Let me guess - your husband?"

"His staff delivered it," she corrected.

"At least the man has some redeeming qualities."

Isabella didn't bother explaining this was all for Eleanor Whitmore's benefit.

As the meeting time arrived, she finally pushed her plate away, stomach uncomfortably full.

She summoned staff to clear the table, moving her laptop to a cleaner space. Once discussions began, the meeting stretched well past ten. No one seemed inclined to wrap up.

Isabella was deep in technical specifications when the suite door swung open.

Alexander walked in.

Her camera angle captured the intrusion. She quickly adjusted the frame, but not fast enough.
###Chapter 104

The camera angle only captured a tall, broad-shouldered figure entering the room with effortless grace.

His commanding presence alone marked him as someone extraordinary, though his face remained out of frame.

At first, the team at InnovaTech had speculated about Isabella and Nathaniel's relationship.

They only discovered later that Isabella was already married with a nearly grown daughter.

Yet Isabella rarely spoke about her personal life. Her husband remained an enigma to the team.

Given Isabella's striking beauty and her rapidly proven competence—surpassing even Nathaniel's—everyone burned with curiosity.

What kind of man could possibly deserve such a breathtaking, brilliant woman?

Now, Alexander Whitmore had finally appeared—only for Isabella to immediately swivel the camera away.

Dominic and the others were about to tease her when Alexander's deep baritone cut through, "Still working?"

Isabella glanced up. "Mm."

Alexander simply nodded, retrieving clothes before disappearing into the bathroom.

Isabella's attention snapped back to the meeting, though two female colleagues couldn't resist whispering, "Your husband has an incredible voice."

??

Alexander wasn't just handsome—his voice was like velvet, rich and impossibly smooth.

Flustered by their admiration, Isabella merely said, "Thank you..."

By now, the hour had grown late. Though the team remained energized, overworking served no one.

Nathaniel decided to wrap up remaining tasks, deferring the rest for tomorrow.

Still, finalizing everything took considerable time.

When Alexander emerged from the shower, damp hair curling at his nape, the meeting continued.

Noticing Isabella's focus, he remained silent.

Then Sophia burst in. "Mom—!"

Isabella turned toward the door, but Alexander intervened first. "Mom's working."

Sophia immediately quieted, padding over to whisper in Alexander's ear, "Dad, can I sleep with Victoria tonight?"

A nod. "Alright."

Sophia threw her arms around his neck, forgetting to whisper in her excitement. "Thanks, Dad!"

Fortunately, Isabella had just finished.

She ended the call, only to freeze at the sight of Victoria lingering in the doorway.

Her lips pressed into a thin line.

Alexander and Sophia noticed Victoria too.

Without a word, Alexander rose and left with Victoria.

Sophia hesitated, glancing between them and Isabella's tense expression.

"Mom..." she ventured softly.

Isabella busied herself organizing documents. "Did you shower?"

"Yes."

"Sleepy?"

"Mm... very."

"Then go to bed."

Sophia exhaled in relief. "Okay! You should rest too."

"I will. Goodnight."

After a quick hug, Sophia skipped out.

Alone, Isabella gathered her nightclothes, noticing neither Alexander nor Sophia had closed the door.
###Chapter 105

Isabella assumed Alexander wouldn't return.

She moved to shut the door before heading to the bathroom. But as she reached for the handle, she collided with Alexander who had unexpectedly turned back.

Her breath caught. She stepped aside quickly.

Perhaps he'd only returned for something forgotten - his luggage still sat unpacked in the corner.

Yet when Alexander entered, he casually closed the door behind him. His posture suggested he intended to stay the night.

This surprised her.

Before she could speak, Alexander brushed past her toward the bed.

As he moved by, Isabella caught the distinct floral notes of Victoria's expensive perfume clinging to him. Worse, a smudge of lipstick stained the collar of his sleep shirt.

He'd showered and changed before leaving earlier. The evidence was undeniable - Victoria had marked him after their departure.

She'd noticed the unnatural redness of his lips immediately. At first, she'd dismissed it as imagination.

Now she knew better.

Alexander settled onto the bed, clearly preparing to sleep here tonight.

Unexpected. She'd thought...

But with Eleanor's watchful presence in the house, spending the night with Victoria would be too risky. Had Victoria sought him out earlier out of jealousy? Fear that something might happen between them?

And Alexander, ever the gentleman, had clearly reassured her. The perfume and lipstick told their own story - they'd shared an intimate goodbye.

Isabella pushed the image away.

Thirty minutes later, emerging from the bathroom, she found Alexander reading. The book in his hands was hers.

Her jaw tightened. She disliked him touching her belongings without permission. As she opened her mouth to object, he glanced up. "Do you mind?" he asked, noting her expression.

She did mind. But beyond some personal annotations in the margins, it contained nothing sensitive - certainly nothing related to today's business discussions.

"A little," she admitted coolly.

Alexander studied her face. "I'll ask next time," he conceded.

Next time?

She doubted their strained relationship would ever place them in shared quarters again.

He returned to reading, then remarked unexpectedly, "Your notes show remarkable insight."

A compliment.

Isabella pretended not to hear. She snatched up the hair dryer and retreated to the bathroom.

When she emerged again, Alexander still read.

After completing her nighttime routine, she slipped into the far side of the bed.

Alexander didn't join her immediately.

She never noticed when he finally turned out the light - sleep claimed her quickly.

Dawn found her awake early.

Sunlight barely touched the horizon. The other side of the bed lay empty.

Silence filled the room - Alexander had already gone.

So early? Perhaps he'd never slept here at all.

She'd arranged with Nathaniel to return to the office today for urgent matters.

After breakfast, she packed efficiently, grabbed her suitcase, and opened the door.

Sophia's petulant voice carried down the hall: "Victoria promised to stay with me last night! But she left in the middle of the night!"

Sophia was complaining to Margaret.

Hearing this, Isabella understood - Alexander hadn't spent the night in their room.

He'd gone to Victoria instead.

Couldn't they bear a single night apart? Was their passion truly so consuming?
###Chapter 106

Isabella spotted Sophia heading out with her suitcase. "Mom?"

"Hmm?" Isabella snapped out of her thoughts, shutting the door behind her. "Work calls. I'm leaving first. Stay here with your father."

Sophia nodded eagerly. "Got it, Mom."

Dragging her luggage downstairs, Isabella nearly collided with Alexander and Victoria in the lobby.

Seeing her departure, Alexander simply asked, "Leaving?"

"Yes." Her reply was ice-cold.

"Did you arrange transportation?"

"I did."

He made no move to stop her. "Very well."

Without another word, Isabella exited the building and disappeared into a waiting car.

Oliver woke unusually early that day.

At lunch with Alexander and the others, he suggested, "Why don't you invite her down?" Clearly referring to Isabella.

Alexander remained impassive. "No need. She's already gone."

Oliver's eyebrows shot up. "Gone?"

Julian paused mid-bite.

"Work commitments," Alexander explained, knowing full well about Nathaniel rejecting Victoria because of Isabella's position at YodaVision.

Oliver remembered Alexander's excuse last night about Isabella being too busy for dinner. He chuckled darkly. "Busy yesterday, busy today—how convenient."

As if YodaVision would collapse without her.

Everyone knew she'd gotten the position through connections. Neither particularly competent nor a major shareholder.

Such a transparent excuse. Pathetic, really. Oliver couldn't even muster a response.

Victoria caught the implication, lowering her head to hide her smirk.

Meanwhile, Isabella worked tirelessly at YodaVision until nightfall.

After two exhausting days, she finally prepared to leave when her uncle Charles called.

Thirty minutes later, she arrived at the Sinclair residence.

Charles and his wife Caroline were there with their sons William and Edward.

Isabella greeted them warmly.

Edward asked, "Where's Sophia? Didn't you say she's back? Why isn't she joining us?"

"She's still at the hot springs."

Assuming Sophia was with Alexander, Edward didn't press further.

Before entering, Isabella's gaze lingered on the villa across the street.

If only she'd brought the keys from her hot springs trip. She could've begun erasing all traces of the Kensington family and started renovations...

Charles and Caroline had been planning Margaret's birthday celebration.

They'd summoned Isabella not just for input, but with a specific task.

"These invitations are for the Whitmores and Victoria," Charles said. "Make time to deliver them this week."

Isabella hesitated before accepting. "Understood."

After dinner, she chatted with Margaret and Charles until nine.

As she prepared to leave, Margaret escorted her out, squeezing her hand. "If the Whitmores decline, don't insist. Their presence means nothing to me!"
###Chapter 107

The whisper in Alexander's voice didn't escape Isabella's notice when he discreetly passed the invitation to Margaret Sinclair's birthday celebration. She caught every nuance.

"I know," she replied simply.

Margaret Sinclair and Eleanor Whitmore shared a decades-long friendship. Under normal circumstances, Eleanor would never miss such an event.

But tradition dictated that guests older than the birthday celebrant shouldn't attend. For years, Margaret's birthdays had been quiet family affairs.

Alexander had never once attended. He always claimed work commitments kept him away.

Isabella knew better. Even when he had free time to socialize with friends, he'd make excuses. Every year, she'd ask anyway, hoping this time would be different.

This year, she hadn't bothered asking. But Margaret's seventieth birthday changed everything. Charles Sinclair had invited prominent business associates. Given the families' ties and their pending divorce status, protocol demanded the Whitmores receive an invitation.

Whether they attended remained their choice.

Isabella had planned to return to her apartment that evening. Instead, she turned the car toward Alexander's villa.

The house stood empty when she arrived. Neither Alexander nor Sophia had returned yet. Eleanor had returned to Whitmore Manor days earlier to handle family matters.

Isabella set down her purse and headed for the shower.

Thirty minutes later, the sound of tires on gravel announced their return. She remained seated, calmly drying her hair.

Sophia burst into the master bedroom first. "Mommy! We're home!" The child smelled distinctly of Victoria Kensington's signature perfume.

Isabella barely reacted, humming in acknowledgment as she turned off the hair dryer. "Have you bathed yet?"

Sophia shook her head.

"It's past ten. School tomorrow." Isabella's tone left no room for argument.

Alexander entered as she spoke. Their eyes locked briefly before she looked away.

"Mommy, help me shower!" Sophia tugged at her arm.

"Let me finish drying my hair first."

Sophia scampered off to gather pajamas.

Alexander settled across the room. "When did you get back?"

"Not long ago." She kept her attention on her hair.

He didn't press further, moving toward the walk-in closet to prepare for his shower.

Isabella remembered her purpose. She switched off the dryer and retrieved an invitation from her bag. "Grandmother's birthday is coming up. This is for the Whitmore family."

As she approached, Victoria's cloying perfume clung to him.
###Chapter 108

Isabella subtly raised her hand to cover her nose for a brief second before stepping back, creating more space between them without being obvious.

Alexander didn't seem to notice her slight movement. He opened the invitation and glanced at it. "70th birthday?"

"Yes." This time, she didn't ask if he was free that evening or beg him to make time. She simply stated, "Please inform your parents."

It was unclear whether Alexander picked up on her changed approach.

He gave her a brief nod, set the invitation aside casually, and said, "Understood." Then he turned and walked into the bathroom.

Isabella watched his retreating figure for a moment before putting away the hairdryer and heading to Sophia's room to help her bathe.

By the time she finished washing Sophia's hair, drying it, and tucking her into bed, nearly an hour had passed. Sophia clung to her arm, snuggling close as she asked, "Mommy, will you sleep with me tonight?" Given the current tension between her and Alexander, the answer was obvious.

Isabella returned to the master bedroom to gather her things. As she prepared to leave, she told Alexander, "I'll be sleeping in Sophia's room tonight."

Alexander was reading a book. At her words, he merely hummed in acknowledgment without looking up, neither questioning her decision nor attempting to stop her.

The next morning after breakfast, Isabella took Sophia to school as requested before heading to the office.

Margaret's birthday was approaching, but Isabella had been so swamped with work over the past month that she hadn't even bought a gift yet.

During lunch, she called Emily and asked her to go shopping that evening to pick out a present. When Emily heard it was for Margaret, she immediately agreed.

Meanwhile, Isabella still hadn't delivered the invitation to Victoria.

After ending her call with Emily, she tried calling Victoria.

The call connected, but no one answered.

Isabella knew Victoria disliked her - in fact, the woman seemed to dislike everyone from the Sinclair family. It was entirely possible she was deliberately ignoring the call.

Still, out of respect for Eleanor, Isabella had to go through the motions.

When the call disconnected, she tried again. This time, it was declined immediately. The message was clear - Victoria was intentionally avoiding her.

Isabella didn't care. She was just following protocol.

She sent Victoria a text explaining the reason for her call and asking when she'd be available to receive the invitation.

After sending the message, she didn't bother checking for a reply and returned to her work.

That evening after dinner, Isabella and Emily spent hours shopping but couldn't find a satisfactory gift.

Suddenly, Emily suggested, "There's a charity auction the night after tomorrow. Maybe we could find something there? But I don't have an invitation..."

She hesitated. The invitations had gone out weeks ago. Getting one now would be difficult. "Unless..."

The implication was clear - she was suggesting Isabella ask Alexander for help.

Around nine, after parting ways with Emily, Isabella returned to Alexander's villa.

When she arrived, she found him already home - busy working in his study.
###Chapter 109

Isabella Sinclair knew Alexander Whitmore's study was off-limits. She settled in their bedroom with a book, waiting patiently.

The clock struck nearly 1:00 am when Alexander finally appeared.

Seeing him, Isabella closed her novel. His indifferent gaze met hers. "Problem?"

She didn't mince words. "There's a charity auction at The Grandeur in two days—"

Alexander loosened his tie with practiced elegance. Nodding, he cut in, "You need an invitation?"

Her eyebrows lifted slightly. "Yes."

"Consider it done." He turned toward the walk-in closet.

Minutes later, the shower turned on.

His easy agreement surprised her. But with his promise secured, she relaxed.

It was late. She marked her page and slipped under the covers. Sleep claimed her before the water stopped running.

With the auction approaching, Isabella left YodaVision early the next day. The Whitmore estate stood empty when she arrived—except for Sophia.

Her stepdaughter clung to her immediately. "Make your famous lasagna tonight?"

Isabella agreed.

After dinner, Richard Thornton approached. "Mrs. Whitmore, this arrived for you." The envelope contained two invitations to tomorrow's event.

Alexander had come through. Two tickets, no less.

But sending them via staff? That meant he wouldn't be home tonight.

As she prepared for bed, her phone buzzed.

Emily Donovan's messages appeared. The attached Instagram screenshot froze Isabella's fingers.

Fireworks painted the sky in the photo. Victoria Kensington's profile glowed with a radiant smile. Alexander's broad back faced the camera.

Caption: "Magic under the stars."

Other couples blurred in the background. Clearly a popular romantic spot.

Victoria called the fireworks magical. But her blissful expression revealed the truth—the real magic was Alexander's presence.

So this explained his absence. A date with Victoria. Without Sophia.

Isabella studied the image, emotions curiously flat. Only one question surfaced. She texted Emily:

"You follow Victoria now?"

How else would she get this?

"A mutual friend showed me. I asked for the screenshot." Emily omitted how envious that friend was.

Their entire circle knew Victoria had captured Alexander's heart. And not just captured—he treated her like rare porcelain.

Remembering the extra ticket, Isabella typed: "Auction tomorrow. Want to come?"

Emily replied instantly: "Try stopping me!"

Alexander never returned that night. Exactly as Isabella predicted.

After fireworks came intimate dinners. Then undoubtedly, more private celebrations.

His absence didn't bother her. In fact, she relished having the king-sized bed to herself.
###Chapter 110

The following morning, Isabella and Emily prepared for the auction with understated elegance.

Neither wore anything overly extravagant, yet their natural beauty turned heads the moment they stepped into the grand hall.

Emily, a familiar face in high society, had attended several auctions before. But Isabella was an enigma—someone the elite hadn’t seen before.

Whispers spread like wildfire. Which influential family did she belong to?

Their seats were modest, placed toward the middle-back section.

They arrived just in time. Moments after settling in, the auctioneer took the stage.

Then, a stir erupted near the front.

Isabella’s breath hitched when she spotted them.

Emily leaned in, voice low. "Alexander and Victoria. They’re here too." A pause. "Did you know?"

Isabella shook her head.

She hadn’t expected him. He hadn’t mentioned it.

Since the last high-profile event, Victoria had cemented her place among the elite. Now, seated beside Alexander, she commanded attention effortlessly.

Last time, her outfit had cost a fortune. Tonight was no different.

The diamond jewelry alone was staggering—but her gown was the real showstopper.

Designed by Imes, a legend who only crafted three pieces a year, each worth millions.

The numbers added up quickly. Tens of millions spent on her in just two appearances.

The message was clear: Alexander spared no expense.

Victoria shimmered in sapphire satin, the lights catching every delicate bead. With her striking features, she was undeniably the center of attention.

Front-row seats weren’t just about visibility—they were a statement of power.

Murmurs of envy rippled through the crowd as Alexander and Victoria took their places—dead center.

The very middle of the first row.

That wasn’t just prestige. That was dominance.

Emily’s lips pursed. "They get the spotlight while we’re stuck in the shadows."

Isabella had long stopped caring about Alexander’s blatant favoritism.

Her goal tonight was simple: find the perfect birthday gift for her grandmother. Seating arrangements didn’t matter.

Emily huffed. "Does he even know where we are? He hasn’t glanced back once."

The tickets had likely been arranged by his staff. Whether he knew their exact location was irrelevant.

Even if he did, he wouldn’t bother looking.
###Chapter 111

The memory still stung. When Nathaniel had taken her to those high-profile events before, Alexander had acted like she didn't exist at all.

Her thoughts were interrupted as the auction began. The auctioneer stepped onto the stage, and the murmuring crowd fell silent.

Isabella had studied the catalog thoroughly. She'd marked two potential targets - an exquisite emerald set and a rare embroidered masterpiece by a famous artist.

Which one she'd actually bid for would depend on how the night unfolded.

The auction progressed swiftly.

Isabella remained focused, only lifting her paddle when items she wanted came up.

Across the room, neither Alexander nor Victoria had made any bids yet.

Then Emily nudged her sharply. Victoria had finally raised her paddle for a dazzling diamond bracelet.

The piece was unmistakably designed for young women, created by an internationally renowned jeweler.

No question - Alexander was buying this for Victoria.

The opening bid was set at 1.5 million. Victoria immediately doubled it to 3 million. Other bidders pushed it to 4 million.

Isabella watched as Victoria leaned toward Alexander, whispering something. Then came the clear, confident voice: "Eight million."

The room erupted in murmurs.

While beautiful, the bracelet wasn't worth half that amount. Four million had already been excessive.

But Victoria clearly adored it. And Alexander, with his bottomless pockets and penchant for extravagance, wasn't about to let anyone else win it for her.

The shock in the room was palpable - not just at the reckless spending, but at the blatant display of favoritism.

As expected, no one dared challenge the 8 million bid. Victoria claimed her prize with a triumphant smile.

Emily gritted her teeth. "That's enough to give anyone cavities."

Before Isabella could respond, the next lot was announced.

An antique vase took center stage.

Victoria's paddle went up again.

Starting at 5 million.

Bids climbed in modest increments until Victoria's turn. She doubled the highest offer to 10 million.

Several competitors dropped out, but the room was filled with deep pockets.

Then a masculine voice cut through: "15 million."

Isabella turned to see a strikingly handsome young man.

"That's Dominic Fairchild," Emily whispered.

Isabella gave a slight nod.

Victoria hesitated, glancing at Alexander.

The realization hit Isabella - Victoria wasn't bidding for herself. This was clearly intended for Beatrice Kensington, Alexander's grandmother who collected antiques.

Alexander gave a subtle nod. Victoria raised her paddle. "25 million."

Dominic chuckled. "30 million."

Victoria leaned closer to Alexander, appearing ready to withdraw.

But Alexander shook his head.

Victoria lifted her paddle again. "40 million."

Dominic's voice rang out immediately. "50 million." He flashed a challenging smile toward Alexander's box.

Victoria frowned, whispering to Alexander, "Perhaps... we should let this one go?"

Fifty million was absurd for a single vase.
###Chapter 112

Alexander let out a low chuckle. "Don't worry about it. Didn't you say your grandmother would love this piece? Go ahead and place your bid."

Seeing his relaxed expression, Victoria felt warmth spread through her chest. She raised her paddle confidently. "Sixty million."

Dominic Fairchild immediately countered. "Seventy million."

Then he called out loudly to Alexander, "Mr. Whitmore, my family has been collectors of such artifacts for generations. Would you do me the honor of letting this one go?"

Alexander turned with a polite smile. "My apologies, Mr. Fairchild, but my own family shares this passion." Their conversation carried clearly through the auction hall, reaching Isabella and Emily's ears.

The vase was intended for Beatrice Kensington, Victoria's grandmother. Yet Alexander referred to her as his own family, making his allegiances painfully clear.

What a stark contrast to how he treated Isabella's relatives.

Victoria raised her paddle again. "Eighty-five million."

This time, Dominic didn't counter.

When the gavel fell, Victoria had secured the antique vase for eighty-five million, drawing envious glances from the crowd. Yet even after winning, she couldn't shake a lingering unease.

The Kensington family was wealthy, and her grandmother spent lavishly on her antique collection each year.

But nearly one hundred million for a single piece? That was unprecedented. Her family would be shocked beyond words.

Especially since Alexander had initially suggested bidding one hundred million. She'd scaled it back, thinking eighty-five million more reasonable.

His casual extravagance made her heart flutter.

Emily cursed under her breath. "Damn! That's almost a hundred million!"

Combined with the previous auction item, the total approached nine figures.

This time, envy burned through Emily's entire body.

Isabella pressed her lips into a tight line, her expression darkening.

Emily noticed immediately. "Bella, are you... okay?"

Seeing Alexander spoil his mistress - especially the daughter of her father's mistress - would upset anyone.

But Isabella's mood had nothing to do with that. "Alexander can spend his money however he likes. It's none of my concern."

"What worries me is if he and Victoria want the same piece I do. With my current funds, I can't possibly outbid them."

Emily brightened. "But she's already won two items. Surely she won't bid again?"

"Hopefully."

But Isabella knew better. With Alexander's limitless wealth, he could drop another few hundred million tonight without blinking.

Just then, the embroidered painting she'd been waiting for appeared on stage.

Opening bid: five million.

Someone immediately offered six.

Isabella raised her paddle. "Seven million."

At first, Victoria hadn't noticed her. But the moment Isabella spoke, recognition flashed across Victoria's face.

Their eyes met briefly before Victoria turned away and raised her paddle again. "Ten million."

Isabella's stomach dropped.

Victoria had recognized her. And Alexander must have too - yet he didn't even glance back.

Emily swore loudly. "You've got to be kidding me! She's bidding again?"

Dominic joined the fray. "Fifteen million."

Isabella tightened her grip on the paddle. "Eighteen million."

Without turning, Victoria called out, "Twenty-five million."
###Chapter 113

The bid skyrocketed again, and Isabella Sinclair felt her stomach drop.

Her funds were running dangerously low.

Originally, she'd set her auction limit at thirty million. The Sinclair family's financial situation was precarious, leaving little room for extravagant spending.

But now...

Dominic Fairchild raised his paddle. "Twenty-eight million."

Isabella countered immediately. "Thirty million."

Her voice was soft but carried an undeniable charm. It made Dominic turn his head, his lips quirking into an amused smile when he recognized her.

Isabella returned the gesture with a polite nod.

Then Victoria Kensington struck again. "Forty million."

Isabella's fingers curled into fists.

Dominic wasn't backing down. "Forty-three."

"Forty-five," Isabella shot back.

Victoria didn't hesitate. "Fifty."

Isabella's mind reeled. Thirty million had been her initial limit, but the moment Victoria entered the bidding, she'd mentally stretched it to fifty.

She could go higher.

There was the penthouse Alexander Whitmore had gifted her—worth hundreds of millions. That money had practically fallen into her lap. Why not use it?

But logic prevailed. This piece wasn't worth fifty million.

She had the funds, but recklessness wasn't an option. Selling the penthouse could secure something far more valuable.

With a slow exhale, she lowered her paddle.

Emily Donovan leaned in. "Call Alexander."

Isabella had considered it. But would Alexander stop Victoria for her?

Unlikely.

Still, she pulled out her phone and dialed.

Across the room, Alexander felt his phone vibrate. He glanced at the screen—an unknown number.

Victoria peered over. "Who is it?"

Just digits. No name.

Alexander smirked and declined the call without a word.

The rejection shattered the last shred of hope in Isabella. Her mind blanked for a second.

Emily seethed. "He ignored you?"

Isabella said nothing, slipping her phone back into her bag.

The bids climbed—ninety-five million now.

Dominic rubbed his temples and turned to Alexander. "Mr. Whitmore, care to let me have this one?"

Alexander's smile was polite but firm. "Next time."

Dominic exhaled sharply and raised again. "One hundred twenty million."

Victoria didn't blink. "One fifty."

Dominic stayed silent.

Emily gritted her teeth. "I've never seen Dominic back down like this."

The Fairchild family was every bit as powerful as the Whitmores—both were elites among elites.

Yet tonight, Dominic's restraint made it seem like his resources paled in comparison to Alexander's.

But that wasn't true. Dominic was simply pragmatic. Alexander, on the other hand, was burning money without hesitation—all to please his woman.

With no further bids, the embroidered masterpiece went to Victoria.

Alexander turned to Dominic. "Thank you for your generosity."

Dominic forced a smile. "Don't mention it."
###Chapter 114

Emily whispered, "At this rate, let's pray Victoria doesn't set her sights on that emerald collection."

Isabella's thoughts mirrored her friend's concern. But realistically, what were the chances?

The auctioneer announced the starting bid for the emerald set at ten million.

"Fifteen million," came the first counteroffer.

Isabella raised her paddle next. "Eighteen million."

"Twenty million."

"Twenty-five million."

Both women exhaled when Alexander remained silent.

Just as Isabella prepared to bid again, Victoria's paddle shot up. "Fifty million."

Gasps rippled through the crowd. Isabella's nails dug into her palms before she countered, "Sixty million."

"Sixty-five."

"Seventy."

Isabella hesitated. Her grandmother's milestone birthday deserved something extraordinary - but eighty million?

Victoria didn't flinch. "One hundred twenty million."

The air left Isabella's lungs. She set down her paddle with deliberate calm.

The room buzzed with shocked murmurs about Alexander Whitmore's bottomless wealth. No other bids followed.

The emeralds belonged to Victoria.

Though nothing else interested her, auction rules mandated all guests remain until the end. Isabella sat through increasingly extravagant lots until Alexander's total spending hit three hundred sixty million.

Emily finally snapped. "This is insanity! Even for him! That mistress must have him completely bewitched!"

Isabella had no response. The answer came soon enough - Alexander stopped bidding. When the gavel fell, both women exited immediately. Isabella never glanced toward Alexander's section, but Emily noticed Dominic approaching him and Victoria.

Outside, an elegant older woman intercepted them. After exchanging pleasantries with Emily, the woman's assessing gaze landed on Isabella. "And who might this lovely stranger be?"

Emily made introductions.

The woman's smile cooled upon hearing Isabella's family name. "Ah, Mr. Sinclair's niece. Quite striking..."

She knew the rumors - the unstable mother institutionalized for decades, the failing family business. No matter how polished Isabella appeared, those stains wouldn't wash out.

What a waste of potential.

The unspoken judgment hung between them as conversation continued. Nearby, Alexander's group emerged from the auction house.

Dominic extended a hand. "Another time, then."

More well-wishers swarmed Alexander, forcing him to turn - directly facing Isabella. Their eyes locked.

Isabella flinched first, looking away instantly.

Alexander resumed conversations without reaction. Noticing his indifference, Victoria's lips curved in triumph.

After ten draining minutes of socializing, Emily dragged Isabella toward the refreshments. "I need wine. Lots of wine."
###Chapter 115

The area was nearly deserted. Just as Emily was about to speak, voices floated over from the nearby seating area.

"Dominic, are you actually interested in Alexander's girlfriend?"

"Interested? Not exactly. But she's certainly... intriguing."

Isabella and Emily froze. It was Dominic Fairchild and his entourage.

Their backs were turned, and a row of cocktail glasses obstructed their view, so they didn't notice the two women standing nearby.

"At the auction earlier, I noticed you couldn't take your eyes off that delicate beauty beside Emily. She's probably still in the main hall - why don't you go say hello?"

Isabella hadn't expected the conversation to suddenly pivot to her.

Before she could react, Emily's eyebrows shot up, already mentally dragging Isabella over to play matchmaker.

But Dominic shook his head dismissively before Emily could act. "Nah."

Emily blinked in surprise.

What was this? Sudden disinterest?

"She's pretty enough," Dominic continued, swirling his drink. "But so quiet and docile - like a porcelain doll with no personality. Frankly, boring."

"Oh come on! And you claim you're not into Victoria?"

Clearly, he'd spoken with Victoria and found her more captivating, losing interest in anyone else.

"That's not it," Dominic hesitated.

His friend laughed. "I get it. Victoria's your new type now? But that still proves you're into her, doesn't it?"

Before Dominic could respond, his friend added, "Honestly, Victoria has that ice queen allure. Challenging, untouchable - way more exciting."

"Ever since Victoria entered our circle, half the men have been obsessed with her. Too bad she's Alexander's. Can't deny that man has impeccable taste."

Emily's smile turned rigid.

Her expression darkened. She wanted to storm over and give them a piece of her mind, but Isabella stopped her with a gentle hand. "It's fine," Isabella said calmly. Maybe she wasn't extraordinary. Maybe she wasn't exciting.

But she knew exactly who she was. Strangers' opinions meant nothing to her.

After finishing their drinks, Dominic and his group left.

Emily was still fuming. "I used to think Dominic had decent taste! But even he's fallen for Victoria's act?"

Before Isabella could respond, a sleazy-looking man sauntered over. His bloodshot eyes raked over Isabella with obvious intent. "Emily, who's your lovely friend—"

"Don't even think about it," Emily cut him off coldly. "You? With my friend? Trash. Get lost."

The man's face darkened. "Emily, you—"

She shot him a look sharp enough to draw blood.

The Donovans weren't to be trifled with. Knowing better than to push further, he slunk away with a muttered curse.

Emily downed her drink in one angry gulp. "How many creeps have hit on you tonight? And why do all the decent men only want Victoria?"

Isabella patted her back soothingly.

The truth was simple - Victoria was exceptional. But before she could say so, Emily's face suddenly went cold.

Following her gaze, Isabella turned to see Victoria standing nearby, holding two water glasses.

No one had noticed her approach, but the smug curve of her lips confirmed she'd heard Dominic's entire conversation.

As they watched, Victoria's smirk deepened.

Without a word, she cast Isabella one glacial, disdainful glance before turning on her heel and walking away, the click of her heels echoing in the sudden silence.
###Chapter 116

What the actual hell? Emily was seething, her fingers twitching with the urge to claw Victoria's perfect face right then and there.

That woman was nothing but a mistress's daughter—and now a mistress herself! What gave her the right to act so high and mighty? Miss Kensington? Please. She was trash wrapped in designer labels.

Isabella calmly refilled her glass. "Miss Kensington?"

Victoria was exactly like what Dominic's friend Simon had described—a vapid socialite who somehow had every spoiled heir wrapped around her finger.

Now they all called her "Miss Kensington" like she was some untouchable goddess.

Emily scoffed. "Fine, let those idiots worship her. But Alexander? And Dominic?"

She caught herself too late, realizing how insensitive that sounded. "Wait, Bella, I didn’t mean—"

Isabella shook her head. "It’s fine."

Since childhood, Reginald, Beatrice, even her own grandmother Eleanor had always favored Victoria. Then two years ago, Alexander fell for her at first sight, and even Sophia started calling her "Mom."

She’d never once confessed how that made her feel. Never shed a single tear over it.

If she’d wanted to break down, any one of those betrayals would’ve been enough to wreck her. But she’d survived.

Compared to that, Dominic and his friends meant nothing. Hearing their conversation earlier hadn’t even stung.

Emily hesitated, then pulled her into a tight hug. "Bella..."

Isabella smiled. "It’s late. Let’s go home."

"Okay! And about your grandma’s birthday gift—we’ll find something perfect next time. I refuse to believe this city doesn’t have one decent present!"

"Alright."

She squeezed Emily’s hand, and they left together.

As they stepped into the parking lot, they nearly collided with Alexander and Victoria, who were also heading out.

Alexander glanced their way, but Isabella pretended not to notice, sliding into the driver’s seat without a word.

Emily shot them a glare before slamming the passenger door shut.

The car peeled away.

Victoria turned to Alexander.

"Let’s go," he said flatly.

She smiled sweetly. "Of course."

Her gaze flickered toward the retreating taillights, her smile deepening.

After dropping Emily off, Isabella was about to leave when Sophia called.

"Mom, when are you coming home?"

She started the engine. "Not tonight. Go to sleep. I’ll visit soon."

"Oh... okay."

Sophia’s tone was unmistakably bored.

Lately, she’d been glued to Victoria’s side.

But with Victoria and Alexander at the auction tonight, she had no one to entertain her. So now, suddenly, she remembered Isabella.

"Goodnight," Isabella said.

"Mmm, night, Mom."

The next two days were a blur of meetings and deadlines. She’d meant to shop for her grandmother’s gift but never found the time.

On the third afternoon, Nathaniel treated the team to lunch as a reward for their hard work.

On her way back from the restroom, Isabella froze.

Down the hall, Victoria exited a private dining room with seven or eight others, including Reginald, Beatrice, and a striking older woman—Victoria’s mother, Eleanor Kensington.

Victoria was arm-in-arm with an elegant elderly lady.

Isabella looked away. "The Kensingtons."

Nathaniel hesitated. "That older woman... is she—"

"Eleanor Kensington. She’s no one to me now."

He pulled her into a quick hug. "Ready to go back?"

"Yeah."

She’d legally changed her surname years ago. The Kensingtons were strangers.

But one thing did bother her.

Rumors had swirled that Victoria’s uncle’s family—the Shaws—were buying property in Salzburg, planning to relocate.

She’d suspected the Kensingtons would follow. She just hadn’t cared enough to track their movements.

But seeing them all here confirmed it. They were moving in.

That evening, Isabella left work early to meet Emily for shopping. An hour later, they still hadn’t found anything.

While Emily tried on dresses, Isabella’s phone rang.

Sophia. "Mom, when are you coming home?"

"What’s wrong?"

"Dad’s away, and I’m bored!"

Normally, Sophia would’ve run to Victoria. But with tomorrow being the weekend and Victoria undoubtedly busy with Eleanor’s arrival, the girl had nowhere else to turn.

"Stay put. I’ll be back tomorrow."

"Promise? Morning?"

"Promise."

By nightfall, they still hadn’t found a gift.

Her grandmother’s birthday was days away. She considered settling for something mediocre but couldn’t bring herself to.

The next morning, Isabella returned to Alexander’s villa.

While Sophia ate breakfast, she remembered something upstairs.

The moment she entered the master bedroom, two ornate velvet boxes sat gleaming on her vanity.
###Chapter 117

The items placed on her vanity table were clearly meant for her, just like the property deed before.

Isabella frowned slightly as she opened one of the round brocade boxes.

Her breath caught when she saw the contents. It was the emerald jewelry set she'd wanted at the auction last week!

The rectangular box looked heavier. Could it be...?

She set down the first box and opened the second. As expected, it contained a scroll.

Unrolling it carefully on the round table, an exquisite embroidered painting shimmered into view - so lifelike it seemed to breathe.

Holding both auction items she'd coveted days ago, Isabella stood silent for a long moment.

These were clearly the gifts Alexander had purchased for Eleanor's birthday.

One would be presented in Martha's name. The other as a joint gift from the couple.

"Mom! I'm done eating! Let's go!" Sophia came bounding up the stairs.

Noticing the open boxes, she peeked inside. "Oh, Dad brought these days ago. Said they're for you."

Isabella hummed in response, carefully rerolling the scroll and replacing it.

After storing the boxes safely, they departed.

Sophia wanted to try target shooting, so Isabella took her to the range. Then came the rollercoasters. After hours of amusement park fun, Isabella needed time for herself.

Sophia begged to stay longer.

Previously, Isabella would have relented - always putting her daughter first.

But today, she remained firm. "I have other commitments. The bodyguards can stay with you."

Sophia pouted, clinging to her mother. "Mommm..."

This tactic always worked before.

But this time, Isabella gently disentangled herself. "It's important. We'll come again soon."

Seeing her mother's resolute expression, Sophia reluctantly agreed. "Fine..."

After arranging the bodyguards, Isabella drove to a distant antique market she'd never visited.

She browsed extensively before finding it - an exquisite scholar's writing set. Fountain pen, iron gall ink, blotting paper, and handmade paper crafted from rare materials with masterful artistry.

It captivated her instantly. Though costing over ten million, a fraction of the embroidery and jewelry's price, she knew her grandmother best.

This set would bring Eleanor far greater joy than those showpieces.

Running her fingers over the textured paper and pen carvings, Isabella could already see Eleanor's delighted expression.

Yes, this was her personal birthday gift for Grandma.

As for Alexander's purchases...

The thought was interrupted by Emily's call.
###Chapter 118

Emily?

Sorry, Isabella. I need to leave Salzburg tomorrow for an urgent matter, so I can't join you to shop for your grandmother's birthday gift.

It's fine. I've already found something perfect.

She had never stepped foot in this antique boutique before. Coming here was just a whim, thinking if nothing caught her eye, she could always go shopping with Emily the next day.

But fate had other plans.

Emily sounded delighted. Really? That's wonderful!

Isabella smiled softly. Mm.

Then Emily suddenly remembered. Oh, before I forget - you mentioned seeing the Kensingtons recently. I did some digging these past few days.

Turns out they're actually planning to settle down in Salzburg. They've been house-hunting all week.

At the mention of the Kensingtons, Isabella's smile dimmed slightly. I see.

As for Victoria's maternal relatives, I heard they've already purchased a property. They'll be moving in soon. Apparently, they've even started sending out invitations for a housewarming party.

Understood.

After ending the call, Isabella drove back toward the city center.

Next week was Grandmother Margaret's birthday. On Sunday, Isabella took Sophia to the Sinclair estate to discuss banquet preparations with Charles and Caroline.

Alexander didn't return that Sunday, so Isabella stayed overnight at the villa.

He only reappeared on Tuesday.

Knowing she wouldn't be returning to the villa in coming days, she took the two ornate gift boxes with her when leaving.

She had initially assumed the presents left on her dressing table were for her.

But upon opening them, she realized Alexander intended for her to gift them to her grandmother.

After dropping Sophia at school, Isabella headed to the office.

InnovaTech was launching multiple new projects simultaneously, making the week even more hectic for both Isabella and Nathaniel.

Alexander must have returned as scheduled since Sophia hadn't called her in days.

On Wednesday evening, Isabella and Nathaniel were dining with a client.

Just as they entered the private dining area, she spotted Alexander with Victoria, Reginald, Beatrice, and others. This time, both Beatrice and Victoria's mother Eleanor had come to Salzburg. Naturally, as their future son-in-law, Alexander had to show proper hospitality.

How considerate - he'd just returned from a business trip yesterday, yet already made time to entertain them.

He always prioritized Victoria.

Last time, Beatrice's group hadn't noticed her. But tonight, they all saw her.

They hesitated, seeming to want to speak, but perhaps because Alexander was present, they remained silent.

As for Victoria and Alexander, their positioning prevented them from seeing her.

Expressionless, Isabella averted her gaze and walked away.

Beatrice's group watched her leave but didn't follow.

Over an hour later, as Isabella and Nathaniel exited the restaurant, they encountered Victoria's entourage again in the parking lot.

They appeared to be leaving too.

Alexander was noticeably absent - he must have departed already.

Before Isabella and Nathaniel could react, their client Gregory Whitmore spotted Victoria's family and enthusiastically approached.

Ms. Kensington! Mr. Kensington!
###Chapter 119

Oh, it's Mr. Whitmore.

Seeing Gregory approach, Reginald and Beatrice politely shook hands with him and exchanged greetings. Mr. Whitmore, are you here discussing business with Mr. Graves?

Yes, Mr. Graves' company has several projects that interest me greatly. I came to negotiate the details.

Reginald paused when he noticed Nathaniel and Isabella remained standing in place without approaching, but dismissed it as unimportant.

Gregory, unaware of the tension, found Nathaniel's behavior peculiar. As businessmen, even if Nathaniel didn't know the Kensington family personally, basic courtesy dictated he should greet them and potentially make valuable connections.

While Beatrice and Reginald conversed with Gregory, Eleanor briefly acknowledged him before walking toward Isabella and Nathaniel, accompanied by Victoria.

Nathaniel glanced at Isabella.

Yet Isabella watched their approach without moving.

Eleanor spoke gently, "Bella, it's been too long."

Isabella remained silent.

Seeing her stubborn expression, Eleanor sighed. "Bella, you—"

Victoria interrupted coldly before she could finish. "Bella, whatever misunderstandings or grievances you hold against me concern only myself, you, and your mother."

"They have nothing to do with Reginald or Beatrice. Don't push away those who genuinely care for you."

Victoria Kensington.

Isabella remembered how, before divorcing her mother, Reginald had once described Victoria with admiration. He'd claimed Victoria embodied her name—regal and composed, dignified yet graceful.

She'd been his unattainable ideal; his eternal infatuation.

He'd insisted only after meeting Victoria did he understand true love. That their feelings had been mutual.

He'd told her that despite Victoria's aloof demeanor, she possessed remarkable qualities. He'd urged her not to emulate her mother's troublesome behavior and to recognize Victoria's excellence.

Unlike typical stepmothers, Victoria had always treated her decently. But her manner remained frosty and detached, as if inherently superior.

Years later, Victoria remained as stunningly unapproachable as in Isabella's memories.

So when Victoria spoke these words—not with a stepmother's placating tone, but with her characteristic detachment—they carried unsettling sincerity. Her pride made the words more persuasive. A woman of her standing wouldn't demean herself by harassing a stepdaughter.

Any conflict must stem from the stepdaughter's unreasonableness.

Victoria implied the past issues between herself, Evelyn, and Reginald shouldn't affect Beatrice and Reginald's affection for Isabella.

Yet Isabella craved her father's love and familial bonds. That longing intensified after her parents' divorce.

Back then, Isabella had been barely nine. She'd loved both parents equally, unable to choose between them.

But secretly, she'd sided with Evelyn. She'd pitied her.

So during the custody battle, even with Evelyn's mental breakdown, Isabella refused to stay with Reginald and Beatrice. She'd insisted on following Evelyn.

Even after choosing Evelyn, she'd clung to affection for Reginald and Beatrice. But to spare Evelyn's feelings, she'd hidden it.

A year post-divorce, Beatrice visited Salzburg for business and secretly arranged to meet her.

Having missed her grandmother terribly, Isabella sneaked out, hiding it from Charles and the others.

Unbeknownst to her, Beatrice had brought Victoria along.

Beatrice insisted they were sisters who should get along.

Isabella resisted.

But seeing Beatrice's disapproving gaze, hearing she resembled Evelyn too much—too stubborn, too unforgiving—Isabella grew upset and began doubting herself.

Was she truly just an ungrateful child?
###Chapter 120

The memories remained vivid in Isabella's mind, even after all these years.

That day still haunted her. She remembered rushing to the restroom, heart shattered, only to return and find Beatrice holding two ice creams - one for her, one for Victoria.

A careless waiter had brushed against one cone, leaving an ugly grease mark on its perfect swirl.

Victoria had immediately claimed the pristine one.

Beatrice had simply smiled and ruffled Isabella's hair, making no effort to replace the soiled treat.

When she returned, Beatrice wordlessly handed her the damaged ice cream without explanation for the missing chunk.

The Kensington family could have bought a thousand ice creams without blinking. Ten thousand, even.

Yet Beatrice couldn't be bothered to get a replacement.

That moment burned itself into Isabella's consciousness - the realization that Beatrice's affection had long since faded.

She'd never forget young Victoria's expression either - watching her accept the tainted dessert with barely concealed malice.

Reginald had orchestrated countless similar humiliations.

Now, thinking back, Alexander hardly mattered anymore.

Observing Beatrice's practiced concern and Eleanor's self-righteous lecturing, Isabella let out a bitter laugh and redirected the conversation to Alexander and Victoria.

"You claim to care about me. I want to believe that. But if your idea of caring means helping Victoria destroy my marriage, what does that say?"

Neither Beatrice nor Eleanor flinched. They'd clearly anticipated this response.

Beatrice sighed dramatically. "Bella, you know how things stand between you and Alexander. Why chain someone who doesn't love you? Divorce means freedom. Grandma is—"

"Let me guess - doing what's best for me?" Isabella interrupted.

She studied them coldly. "You've recycled this speech so often - doesn't it bore you? If you're going to dismiss me, at least invent something new."

"How can I take you seriously when you won't even put in the effort? Next time, try originality."

Before they could respond, she continued, "Not that it would change anything. Actions speak louder than words, don't they?"

Her sharp retort left them momentarily speechless.

Beatrice recovered quickly. As she opened her mouth to respond, Isabella turned to Gregory, who had just returned. "Mr. Whitmore, are we finished here? Shall we go?"

Gregory had sensed the tension. He cleared his throat awkwardly. "Of course."

Turning to Beatrice and Eleanor, he nodded. "Mrs. Kensington, Ms. Kensington, we'll take our leave."

Beatrice smiled graciously, but her sigh when looking at Isabella was heavy with disapproval.

Ever since Reginald divorced Evelyn, every act of defiance from Isabella had been met with these disappointed sighs from him and Beatrice.

As if she was the problem. The difficult one. The disappointment.

The conditioning ran so deep that after moving to the Sinclair estate with her mother, Isabella developed an actual phobia of disappointed sighs.

For years - until she was nearly thirteen - despite the Sinclair family's kindness, she'd been painfully obedient. Terrified of mistakes. Afraid to breathe wrong.
###Chapter 121

Nathaniel and Isabella exchanged a glance as they walked away from Gregory Whitmore.

Gregory caught up with them. "Is there some tension between you and the Kensingtons?"

Isabella's lips pressed into a thin line. "Not at all."

She wasn't lying - it was far worse than a simple misunderstanding.

But Gregory misinterpreted her response, assuming she genuinely had no issues with Victoria's family.

"Good to hear." Gregory adjusted his tie. "Given how highly Alexander values Ms. Kensington, their family's influence is skyrocketing. The Whitmores, especially Alexander, aren't to be trifled with. Even if you don't want to associate with them, don't make enemies either."

Isabella's lips curved into a bitter smile. The irony was almost amusing.

Who else would be advised to maintain good relations with their husband's mistress because said husband favored the other woman too much?

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "We're not intimidated by Alexander Whitmore."

Their company had government protection thanks to the CUAP project.

Alexander's previous attempts to acquire their firm had failed. With their current project, Nathaniel knew they'd soon have even stronger governmental backing.

Within a year, their company would expand beyond Alexander's reach.

Nathaniel's confidence came from Isabella's strategic planning.

Margaret Sinclair's birthday approached this Saturday.

Isabella no longer cared whether Alexander attended. But Sophia's presence was non-negotiable.

To prevent her daughter from sneaking off to see Victoria again, Isabella made an early call on Thursday morning.

It was their first conversation since Sophia's return from Salzburg.

"Mom!" Sophia's voice brightened when she saw the caller ID, nearly dropping her fork.

Alexander sat across the breakfast table, watching.

"Are you eating?" Isabella recognized the muffled speech.

"Yes! Did you eat already?"

"I did." Isabella got straight to the point. "Grandmother's birthday is Saturday. Clear your schedule - you're coming with me to celebrate."

Sophia's enthusiasm dimmed. "Oh..."

She'd missed seeing Victoria last weekend and hoped to make up for it.

Isabella knew that hesitation all too well. "Is your father there?"

Sophia glanced at Alexander. "Yes. Do you want to talk to him?"

"Put him on."

Alexander took the phone, his voice cool. "What is it?"

"Margaret's birthday is Saturday. Ensure Sophia accompanies me to the Sinclair estate without any... detours."

"Understood."

"I'll pick her up Friday evening."

A pause. Then Isabella added, "Thank you."

Alexander's response was a noncommittal hum.

Not once had she asked if he was free that day.

Just like always.

The auction gift he'd given her made his intentions clear - she'd be delivering his present to Margaret herself.
###Chapter 122

Alexander had made it clear he wouldn't be attending the celebration.

Isabella saw no reason to press further.

She ended the call without another word.

For years, she'd invited Alexander to join them at the Sinclair estate for Margaret's birthday. Yet he hadn't even noticed she'd stopped extending the invitation this time.

After hanging up, Alexander handed the phone back to Sophia. "Your mother will pick you up for Grandma's party tomorrow evening. Behave yourself on Saturday and don't wander off."

Sophia pouted. "But—"

Alexander's impassive stare silenced her.

Realizing negotiation was futile, the girl mumbled, "Fine..."

"That's my girl." He gave a curt nod.

Sophia jutted her chin stubbornly. "I want to visit Victoria on Sunday. And you're coming with me."

"Agreed." A faint smile touched his lips.

Friday evening found Isabella arriving at Whitmore Manor after work.

Alexander's presence in the foyer surprised her—he rarely returned this early.

He was on a call when she entered. Noticing her arrival, he inclined his head briefly before turning away to continue his conversation.

Richard had prepared dinner, expecting Isabella and Sophia to eat before leaving for the Sinclairs'.

But Isabella insisted on dining at her family's estate.

Richard hesitated, glancing at Alexander for guidance.

Still on his call, Alexander moved the phone slightly from his ear. "Do as Mrs. Whitmore says," he instructed before resuming his conversation.

Isabella turned to Sophia. "Let's go, sweetheart."

"Okay!" Sophia waved at Alexander. "Bye, Daddy!"

He returned the gesture. "See you later."

Without exchanging a word with Alexander, Isabella led Sophia out.

He watched them leave, offering no further farewell.

This year's celebration for Margaret was particularly lavish. After arriving at the Sinclair estate and eating, Isabella helped with final preparations.

By the time everything was ready, midnight approached.

She rose early the next morning.

Before breakfast, Isabella, Charles, and several relatives gathered around Margaret to offer birthday wishes and present their gifts.

Sophia tugged Isabella's sleeve anxiously when she saw the gifts. "Mom..."

Isabella crouched to her level. "What is it?"

The girl's cheeks flushed with embarrassment. "I forgot to get Grandma a present," she whispered.

Then, with childish accusation, she added, "Why didn't you remind me?"

Isabella smoothed her daughter's hair. "I brought gifts from myself, your father, and Nana. You're still young—it's understandable. But next time, remember to prepare something for Grandma."

Her tone was gentle, but her eyes held a chill.

True, she hadn't reminded Sophia.

Yet if the girl truly cared, she would have remembered on her own.

The gift didn't need to be extravagant—a simple drawing or asking Isabella to take her shopping yesterday would have sufficed.

But Sophia hadn't mentioned it until now.

The contrast with how she treated Victoria was stark.

For Victoria's birthdays, Sophia would count down the days with palpable excitement.

Isabella recognized the lack of sincerity.

That's precisely why she hadn't reminded her.
###Chapter 123

Sophia didn't catch the subtle coldness in Isabella's voice. She exhaled in relief at Isabella's words.

Alexander handed his present to Margaret first, with Isabella following suit.

The initial gift was an embroidered landscape painting. "Grandmother had Benjamin prepare this specially for you," Isabella explained.

Margaret unfolded the delicate fabric, studying it carefully. Her lips curved into a pleased smile. "She's always been thoughtful."

Next came the emerald jewelry set. "This is from Alexander," Isabella said.

The gems sparkled with impeccable clarity under the chandelier lights.

Margaret's eyes lingered on the necklace for a heartbeat.

But remembering its origin, she snapped the velvet case shut. "Lovely pieces. Do thank him for me."

She never inquired if Alexander would attend her celebration.

The question didn't interest her enough to ask.

Isabella noted Margaret's indifference toward Alexander. There was a time she would've defended him passionately.

Not anymore. She simply presented her own gift - the one she'd personally selected.

Just as Isabella predicted, Margaret adored the antique scholar's writing set above all other presents.

Margaret couldn't stop admiring the craftsmanship. She immediately retreated to her study to test the new brushes.

Breakfast passed with warm chatter and laughter.

Margaret seemed genuinely happy throughout the meal.

Yet...

Fleeting shadows of loneliness flickered in her eyes when she thought no one was looking.

Isabella, Charles, and the others understood. Today was meant for family.

But one chair remained conspicuously empty.

Isabella looked away, blinking rapidly. No one mentioned Evelyn's absence to preserve the festive mood.

By midmorning, close associates of the Sinclair family began arriving.

The main celebration would occur at their reserved hotel banquet hall that evening.

While greeting guests, Charles' son Thomas noticed Sophia sitting apart, distracted. He gently pinched her cheek. "You're miles away, little one."

Isabella knew instantly - Sophia was thinking about Victoria.

She'd obeyed Alexander's orders, staying at the Sinclair estate without protest.

But her mind clearly wandered elsewhere.

Sophia had bombarded Victoria with messages all day. The sparse replies suggested Victoria was equally preoccupied.

Come afternoon, the family relocated to the hotel.

Guests trickled in around six.

Charles accepted gifts and ushered people to their seats. One businessman hesitated. "My apologies, Mr. Sinclair. Another engagement calls me away. I'll just stay for a quick toast."

Charles and Isabella exchanged glances but didn't press. They assumed this was an isolated case.

Within thirty minutes, however, numerous associates delivered gifts and excused themselves. Some sent assistants instead of attending personally.

The banquet hall's empty tables painted a dismal picture.

All their meticulous preparations seemed wasted. Margaret would be heartbroken when she saw.

Charles could accept personal conflicts graciously.

But his expression darkened with each departure.

Noticing the pattern, he pulled aside Arthur Langford, a close acquaintance. "Everyone keeps mentioning another event. Might I ask where you're headed?"

The mass exodus couldn't be coincidence.

"The Kensington residence," Arthur admitted. Then added, "It's Mrs. Kensington's housewarming. They've recently relocated to Baumond. Since they're new here, they're hosting tonight."

Isabella and Charles froze.

They'd thought the video scandal was their last hurdle. The Kensingtons' timing couldn't be accidental.

Margaret and Eleanor Kensington had celebrated birthdays together for decades.

Could Eleanor possibly forget today's significance?

No. This was deliberate.

The housewarming was scheduled precisely because they remembered.

Arthur remained oblivious to the Sinclair-Kensington feud.

He lowered his voice apologetically. "We can't refuse, Charles. Not with Mr. Whitmore backing them. It's business."

Skipping the Kensingtons' event would be interpreted as a slight.

And with rumors swirling about Alexander marrying Victoria soon...

Offending the Kensingtons now meant offending both Victoria and Alexander.

That was a risk no one dared take.
###Chapter 124

Some guests hesitated to cross Alexander Whitmore.

Others saw this as the perfect opportunity to align themselves with the prestigious Kensington and Sinclair families.

The Sinclair family had faced financial struggles in recent years. Meanwhile, the Kensingtons and Sinclairs enjoyed Alexander's powerful backing. The choice was obvious.

Arthur Langford left after apologizing to Charles Sinclair.

Isabella Sinclair and Caroline Sinclair initially paid no attention.

But as more guests arrived only to depart quickly, and with dinner service about to begin, the banquet hall grew increasingly empty. Rows of vacant seats finally alerted them that something was wrong.

Frowning, Isabella and Caroline approached. "Why are so many guests leaving? What's happening?"

Charles and Margaret exchanged uneasy glances.

There was no choice but to tell the truth.

Charles explained, "The Kensingtons have relocated to Salzburg and are hosting a housewarming party today. They've personally invited most of our guests, so..."

This explained the rapidly emptying venue.

As he spoke, Charles and Margaret watched Isabella with concern.

They worried this might overwhelm her.

After everything the Kensingtons had done to the Sinclair family, forgiveness seemed impossible. As long as Evelyn remained in the nursing home, the grudge would persist.

It was understandable that Isabella would despise them even more after this birthday sabotage.

But Isabella was made of stronger stuff.

Upon hearing the news, her fingers merely tightened on the table's edge. Then her gaze turned icy as she stated bluntly, "That Whitmore heir is behind this, isn't he?"

How else could the Kensingtons, newcomers to Salzburg, attract so many guests?

Certainly not on their own merits.

"Yes..." Margaret lowered her eyes, tears forming. "I'm sorry, Grandmother."

"This isn't your fault."

Isabella gently cupped Margaret's face. "You were too trusting to anticipate their cruelty."

"Grandmother—"

"It's fine."

Isabella surveyed the nearly empty banquet hall. With so few remaining guests, the space looked desolate. She remarked calmly, "It's just a birthday. Having you all safe and happy is gift enough."

"Never let someone else's malice become your burden, understand?"

Her words carried unspoken echoes of Evelyn's tragedy.

Immediately, Margaret and Charles responded, "We understand."

Margaret had invited Nathaniel Graves and Emily Donovan.

They arrived just then.

Both knew the bitter history between the families.

Upon hearing what happened, Emily cursed, "Disgusting! I've never met people so shameless!"

Nathaniel gave Margaret's shoulder a reassuring squeeze.

Moments later, his phone buzzed. Reading the message, he paused before saying, "I'll bring in some reinforcements."

Margaret blinked. "What?"

Nathaniel smiled mysteriously. "You'll see."

Meanwhile, at the Kensington residence's banquet hall...
###Chapter 125

The steady flow of arriving guests brought genuine smiles to Diana and Lawrence's faces.

Exactly as the Sinclair family had anticipated, they hadn't forgotten Margaret's birthday.

Truth be told, after decades of celebrating it, forgetting was simply impossible.

That's why today's housewarming party wasn't accidental timing at all.

They still seethed remembering how their carefully planned move across from the Sinclairs got disrupted by Isabella's interference and Alexander's unexpected assistance.

But Alexander more than compensated, ironically leaving them in a better position than before.

This made them even more pleased about scheduling their housewarming to clash with the Sinclairs' event and successfully poaching their guests.

Their party must be nearly deserted by now. Genevieve suppressed a smirk. Couldn't even retain their own guests - after all that effort. How utterly humiliating. Once word spread, everyone would know the Sinclairs had lost both influence and connections. Who'd want to associate with them then?

Penelope clapped and laughed. "Absolutely right."

Though the Kensingtons had invited Salzburg's elite, most were unfamiliar faces.

Tonight's housewarming doubled as a networking opportunity.

Victoria wore the diamond bracelet Alexander had purchased for her at the auction.

Many knew Alexander had spent over 400 million dollars acquiring four prized lots that evening.

Seeing his devotion to Victoria, numerous guests sought to curry favor.

Noticing her bracelet, they gushed, "That piece complements you perfectly, Ms. Kensington. Mr. Whitmore has impeccable taste."

Though clearly flattery, Victoria's beauty enhanced anything she wore. Her elegant ensemble tonight made the diamonds sparkle brighter, accentuating her regal presence.

"Thank you," Victoria responded.

Many had researched the Kensingtons' preferences beforehand.

Several knew Beatrice had a passion for antiques.

Someone remarked, "I heard Madam Kensington collects antiques. Was that Ming vase from last week's auction acquired specifically for her?"

The phrasing implied Alexander already considered himself part of the Kensington family.

Victoria nodded. "Indeed it was."

Beatrice genuinely adored that vase.

Just imagining the antique brought a smile to her face.

A 100-million-dollar treasure, after all.

Alexander's devotion to Victoria was undeniable.

Hearing this, Diana felt a twinge of envy.

As Victoria's elder, Beatrice received priceless antiques while she got nothing.

But Victoria had mentioned Alexander purchased two other items that night - both more valuable than the vase.

Alexander knew today was the Kensingtons' housewarming.

Diana assumed at least one of those treasures was meant for them.

This thought lifted her spirits considerably.
###Chapter 126

Just then, Julian and Oliver arrived.

The moment the Kensingtons and their relatives noticed the two, they immediately approached.

After all, these men were anything but ordinary in Salzburg.

It was only natural that they were treated with such reverence.

Genevieve had met Julian before.

The moment she laid eyes on him again, a faint blush colored her cheeks, barely concealed beneath her makeup.

Penelope smirked, noticing Genevieve's reaction.

The Montgomerys were just as prestigious as the Whitmores, and with Julian's undeniable charm, the Kensingtons were more than pleased to see Genevieve's interest in him.

With Alexander and Victoria practically a done deal, and now Genevieve and Julian potentially forming a match, the Kensingtons would undoubtedly solidify their influence in Salzburg.

With that thought, their enthusiasm toward Julian and Oliver grew even more pronounced.

Victoria frowned at her family's behavior.

She found it embarrassingly obsequious.

As friends, she and Julian were equals. Yet, her family was practically fawning over him. How humiliating.

But she couldn’t call them out in front of everyone, so she bit her tongue.

The Kensingtons had climbed the ranks over the past decade, but they still lacked the deep-rooted legacy of families like the Whitmores.

To Julian and Oliver, the Kensingtons simply didn’t measure up.

They tolerated it only out of respect for Victoria.

After presenting their gifts, Julian asked, "Where’s Alexander? He’s not here yet?"

Victoria replied, "He’s been handling some last-minute complications with his overseas business. He worked late the past few nights. Since things aren’t fully resolved, he’ll be arriving later."

Julian and Oliver nodded.

Since Victoria was close with them, she personally escorted them to their seats.

The hour grew late—it was time to begin dinner.

But Alexander, the guest of honor, hadn’t arrived. Lawrence hesitated, unsure whether to proceed.

He turned to Victoria and Eleanor for guidance.

Victoria said, "We can start without him."

The guests had come all this way—it would be rude to keep them waiting, even if they were willing.

But would Alexander mind?

"He won’t," Victoria assured.

She spoke with such certainty, it was clear how close they were.

Seeing the Kensingtons confidently proceed without Alexander only reinforced how much he valued Victoria. The guests took note, their eagerness to strengthen ties with the family growing.

Meanwhile—

Though many guests had left, Margaret ensured every formality was observed without exception.

After confirming all attendees had arrived, she took the stage to express her gratitude and apologize for the earlier disruption. The crowd responded with warm applause.

The moment she finished, Charles signaled the staff to begin serving dinner.
###Chapter 127

Nathaniel held up a hand. "Could we pause for a moment, Mr. Sinclair? There's another guest arriving in ten minutes."

Charles knew exactly how Nathaniel and Isabella were connected.

Nathaniel had always looked out for Isabella like family.

That's why Margaret and Charles were deeply grateful to him.

Hearing this, Charles asked, "Is he coming alone? We've got space at the head table if he'd like to join us."

"He'd be honored," Nathaniel confirmed.

"Excellent."

Charles nodded to the staff, instructing them to serve the other tables first while holding their main course.

As the appetizers arrived, Nathaniel checked his phone. He leaned toward Isabella. "Our guest is here. I'll go greet them."

Isabella nodded. The moment she turned, a familiar baritone voice cut through the chatter. "No need. I'm already here."

Isabella spun around. "Mr. Aldridge?"

Frederick gave a curt nod.

The other guests gasped when they recognized the tech mogul. Some rubbed their eyes in disbelief.

It was Frederick Aldridge in the flesh - the billionaire genius who dominated business headlines.

Who wouldn't know that striking profile and commanding presence?

Rumors swirled about his powerful connections, but his brilliance alone made him legendary.

Finding him at Margaret's birthday celebration was beyond shocking.

Margaret and Charles froze when they saw him.

They scrambled to their feet the moment they regained composure.

Despite his icy reputation, Frederick showed proper respect to elders he valued.

He'd met Margaret before.

In three long strides, he reached her side, gently guiding her back into her chair. "Please, don't trouble yourself."

Margaret sat, flustered. "This is such an honor, Mr. Aldridge."

"The honor is mine, Mrs. Sinclair." Frederick took the seat beside her. "My apologies for not visiting sooner."

He signaled Nathaniel, who handed him an elegant gift box. "This was rushed - I hope you'll forgive the lack of preparation."

Margaret beamed. "Your presence is gift enough."

After exchanging pleasantries, Frederick noticed Isabella and Nathaniel hovering awkwardly behind him like misbehaving students.

One sharp glance sent them scrambling into adjacent chairs.

Margaret spoke again. "Thank you for guiding Isabella all these years."

"Hardly worth mentioning," Frederick said. "Her recent research breakthroughs prove her talents weren't wasted. You've no cause for concern."

Neither Frederick nor Margaret had stopped Isabella when she abandoned her studies for Alexander.

They believed facing consequences was crucial for growth.

Some lessons could only be learned through personal mistakes.

The real tragedy would be letting failures define one's future.

Fortunately, Isabella had chosen to rebuild herself.

Margaret had worried, especially after Evelyn's example.

But she knew overprotecting would backfire. Sometimes, people needed to find their own path.

Hearing Frederick's words, Margaret relaxed. "Good. That's all I needed to hear."
###Chapter 128

Isabella sat quietly beside Frederick.

He was still engrossed in conversation with Margaret, not once glancing her way.

She turned slightly toward Nathaniel. "I appreciate this, Nathaniel."

Margaret's mood had visibly lifted since Frederick's arrival.

"No thanks necessary." Nathaniel shrugged. "Mr. Aldridge simply responded about that project proposal you drafted recently. When I mentioned this event, he insisted on coming. Really, you should be thanking your own brilliant mind."

Before Isabella could respond, someone mentioned Alexander's name.

Her breath caught as she turned toward the entrance.

All eyes followed Alexander's confident stride toward Margaret. "Happy birthday."

He presented an elegant gift box. "In case the first gift didn't suit your taste, I brought an alternative. I hope this one pleases you."

Margaret hadn't expected Alexander's attendance.

His presence brought no joy.

While the Kensingtons were shameless, without Alexander's backing, they'd never dare act so boldly in Salzburg.

With perfect social grace, Margaret accepted the gift. "How thoughtful," she said coolly before instructing a waiter, "Please set another place at the table."

Alexander remained unfazed by her chill. Noticing Frederick, he nodded. "Mr. Aldridge."

Frederick returned the brief acknowledgment.

When Alexander's gaze met Isabella's, he held it deliberately. He directed staff to place a chair between her and Frederick before seating himself.

News of Frederick's attendance at Margaret's birthday spread like wildfire.

Within minutes, it reached the Kensingtons.

Their guests reacted with shock.

"The Sinclairs have connections this powerful?"

"Is that Nathaniel Graves in the photo? And the stunning woman beside him is actually Charles Sinclair's niece? He's never mentioned her before. This explains everything."

"What do you mean?"

"They attended the tech expo together recently. Clearly something's developing between them."

The Graves family's prestige combined with YodaVision's success made Nathaniel a rising star under Frederick's mentorship.

If Charles' niece and Nathaniel became involved, the Sinclairs' influence would skyrocket.

Neither the Kensingtons nor Sinclairs anticipated Frederick's appearance at Margaret's celebration.

Watching guests reassess the Sinclairs' standing due to Nathaniel and Frederick's presence, the Kensingtons couldn't mask their displeasure.

Genevieve, uninformed about tech circles, knew Victoria sought mentorship but hadn't bothered learning the name.

"Is Frederick Aldridge important? Why the fuss?" she asked.

Victoria answered flatly, "He's a globally renowned AI pioneer who advises governments. My ideal mentor."

Genevieve gaped. "That's... impressive."

After a pause, she added, "So this is why Uncle Reginald was furious with Isabella for costing you that meeting?"
###Chapter 129

Victoria scoffed. How utterly shameless of her!

Just the thought made her blood boil. Could there be some special connection between them? Why else would such an important figure attend her grandmother's birthday?

No, Victoria replied icily. They barely know each other.

From her perspective, Isabella only met Frederick through Nathaniel.

So Frederick's presence today was likely just a courtesy to Nathaniel.

Oh, I see, Genevieve murmured.

Julian and Oliver sat at the adjacent table directly behind Victoria.

Julian had been quietly enjoying his meal until he overheard the conversation about Frederick attending Margaret's party. He paused mid-bite. The Sinclair family's celebration?

Oliver quickly explained, Today's the birthday of Isabella's maternal grandmother. Both the Sinclair and Kensington families scheduled their events on the same day, with overlapping guest lists. Most attendees chose this one because of Alexander and Victoria.

Oliver hadn't known this earlier.

He'd only just pieced it together from the banquet hall chatter.

Understanding dawned on Julian. So the Sinclair gathering is practically empty then?

Oliver shrugged. From what I heard, three-quarters of the tables are vacant.

Then he chuckled darkly. Quite pathetic really, watching guests slip away without being able to stop them.

Amusement laced Oliver's tone.

Julian's expression shifted abruptly. He stood without warning.

Oliver blinked in surprise. What's wrong?

Need to make a call, Julian muttered.

Without waiting for a response, Julian strode out purposefully.

Victoria and Genevieve turned, watching Julian's abrupt departure.

Victoria frowned. Where's Julian rushing off to?

Said something urgent came up, Oliver supplied.

Oh.

Victoria didn't press further.

The seat beside her remained conspicuously empty.

She'd reserved it specifically for Alexander.

Beatrice checked her watch. Alexander still isn't here, Victoria. Should you call him?

Victoria had been considering the same thing.

She retrieved her phone and dialed Alexander.

The call didn't connect.

Dozens of guests had flocked to the Kensington housewarming. The family moved between tables, offering drinks and networking.

Naturally, Victoria participated.

After all, most attendees came because of her.

With Victoria present, guests showed proper deference.

As the Kensingtons approached with drinks, attendees rose politely.

After exchanging pleasantries, someone inquired, Has Mr. Whitmore arrived yet, Ms. Kensington?

He's on his way, Victoria assured them. Should be here shortly.

As she spoke, a nearby guest remarked, My friend just texted that Mr. Whitmore is at the Sinclair celebration.

Mr. Whitmore is there too? Really?

There are photos circulating. Look!

Goodness, it is him!

All eyes turned to Victoria.

Most guests barely knew the Kensingtons. They'd attended partly for Alexander, partly because the Sinclair family's declining business seemed beyond recovery.

But now, not only had Frederick appeared at Margaret's party, even Alexander was there celebrating.

Which made everyone wonder - why had they bothered coming here at all?
###Chapter 130

Victoria remained perfectly composed upon hearing Alexander was attending the Sinclair family's celebration.

Eleanor Whitmore shared an exceptionally close bond with Margaret Sinclair. Naturally, she'd send Alexander as her representative to Margaret's 70th birthday since she couldn't attend personally.

This wasn't news to Victoria.

Still, a pang of irritation flickered through her despite knowing Alexander's presence was merely following orders.

The guests immediately speculated about trouble between Victoria and Alexander when they realized he'd chosen the Sinclairs' party over hers.

"Madam Whitmore and Madam Sinclair are dear friends," Victoria stated coolly. "Alexander is only there at Madam Whitmore's request."

Rumors had circulated about the Sinclair and Whitmore families being close.

Yet without visible interactions between them, most dismissed it as mere gossip.

Victoria's explanation suggested there might be truth to those rumors after all.

Just then, an attendant entered carrying an ornate gift box toward Victoria and the Kensingtons.

"Ms. Kensington," the attendant addressed Victoria, "Mr. Whitmore encountered unexpected business and may arrive late. Concerned about missing your event, he asked me to deliver this gift on his behalf."

Victoria accepted the package gracefully. "Thank you."

Given Margaret and Eleanor's friendship, it made perfect sense for Alexander to pay his respects at Margaret's birthday first.

Clearly anticipating guests would question his relationship with Victoria, Alexander had thoughtfully arranged for this gift delivery despite his current location. This gesture demonstrated his care and consideration for her.

Moreover, no one could possibly claim Alexander didn't value Victoria after witnessing such thoughtful gestures.

The guests exchanged awkward glances. While the Kensingtons weren't pleased about Alexander's choice, they kept their displeasure private. As the tension dissipated, Lawrence raised his glass in a toast, thanking everyone for coming.

Thanks to Lawrence's intervention, the atmosphere quickly regained its celebratory mood.

Warmth blossomed in Victoria's chest at Alexander's consideration, melting away her earlier irritation.

Noticing Julian's continued absence, she turned to Oliver. "Where's Julian?"

"Let me check."

After a brief phone call, Oliver reported, "He had urgent business and had to leave. He sends his apologies."

"That's fine."

Victoria pressed further. "Did he mention what kind of emergency?"

"I didn't ask."

Oliver initially dismissed it, then suddenly remembered. "Could it be related to that woman he likes?"

Victoria's smile stiffened. "He hasn't mentioned her recently. I wouldn't know," she replied tersely.

"You're right." Oliver stroked his chin thoughtfully. "We should ask him next time."

Victoria lowered her eyes with a quiet "Mm-hmm."

Meanwhile, having settled at the Sinclairs' main table, Alexander stole a glance at Isabella.

Her initial surprise at his arrival had been evident.

But she'd quickly schooled her expression.

Noticing his gaze, she asked flatly, "Something wrong?"

Alexander averted his eyes. "Nothing."
###Chapter 131

Silence stretched between Isabella and Alexander.

Isabella's younger cousins rarely had the opportunity to see Alexander in person. Now that he stood before them, their curious gazes lingered.

Years of commanding power had instilled an undeniable authority in Alexander's presence. When he noticed their stares, he acknowledged them with a brief nod.

The intensity of his gaze made them look away immediately, too intimidated to maintain eye contact.

Alexander showed no reaction to their discomfort. His attention shifted elsewhere, his expression remaining impassive.

This was the man Isabella had loved with reckless abandon. Even now, after all this time, she couldn't escape the hold he had on her.

Given how Alexander had treated his own niece for years, it was impossible for Charles not to resent him.

But what could he do?

The Sinclair family was powerless against Alexander.

As the host, Charles had no choice but to extend basic courtesies. He stood, raising his glass. "We didn't expect Mr. Whitmore to join us tonight. Please forgive any shortcomings in our hospitality."

Alexander mirrored the gesture, clinking his glass against Charles's. "You're too kind, Mr. Sinclair."

He deliberately addressed him formally, not as Uncle Charles.

The pointed choice of words didn't go unnoticed. Alexander had no intention of acknowledging the Sinclairs as family.

Isabella had known this truth for years. Now, she neither wanted nor needed his acceptance.

She knew he'd only come because of Eleanor.

Her voice turned icy. "We appreciate Grandmother's kindness. If you have other engagements, don't let us keep you."

His presence was making everyone uncomfortable.

Alexander replied smoothly, "I'm in no hurry."

Isabella frowned, uncertain of his intentions.

Instead of addressing her, Alexander turned to Frederick. "Our company has been developing new stealth technology capable of evading all known radar systems. Mr. Aldridge, would this interest you?"

"All radar systems?" Frederick's expression sharpened with professional curiosity. "Please continue."

Alexander launched into technical details without hesitation, discussing proprietary information openly.

Isabella hadn't expected Alexander to engage her mentor like this. Yet as she listened, she recognized his deep understanding of AI applications.

If Frederick found the topic compelling, how could Isabella and Nathaniel remain indifferent?

What began as polite attention soon became complete absorption. They leaned forward, forgetting their meals entirely.

Charles considered reminding them to eat, but seeing their rapt attention, he held his tongue.

Before tonight, no one present had known Alexander well. His presence should have created tension.

Yet somehow, he'd effortlessly taken control of the conversation.

Of course, tonight's focus remained Margaret.

Alexander knew better than to overshadow the occasion.

After several minutes of discussion, he concluded, "If you'd like to explore this further, Mr. Aldridge, perhaps we could schedule a proper meeting?"

The offer hung in the air between them.
###Chapter 132

Alexander gave a curt nod. "Fine."

Nathaniel acknowledged him before turning to Isabella. "Are you heading home tonight?"

Isabella had been replaying the exchange between Nathaniel and Alexander in her mind. When addressed directly, she hesitated briefly before answering, "No."

Nathaniel stood abruptly. "Understood. I'll collect Sophia myself then."

His departure was imminent.

Isabella responded icily, "Very well."

Without another word to her, Alexander approached Margaret. "Madam Sinclair, I must take my leave now."

Margaret remained seated, her tone equally frosty. "Don't trouble yourself."

The dismissal didn't faze him. He nodded slightly at Charles in silent farewell before exiting the banquet hall.

Outside the Grandeur, Julian had just stepped from his car when Alexander emerged. His movements faltered momentarily.

Alexander entered his vehicle without hesitation and drove off.

Julian watched the taillights disappear but made no move to follow.

The event concluded with Frederick and Nathaniel departing together.

Meanwhile, Sophia had overindulged in sweets earlier. When dinner was served, she'd barely touched her meal before escaping upstairs to play video games.

After most guests had left, Isabella finally went to retrieve her.

Seeing her mother enter, Sophia removed her headphones. "Finished already?"

"Yes." Remembering Alexander's earlier words, Isabella added, "Your father's coming to get you tonight. Call him to confirm the time."

Excited about tomorrow's playdate with Victoria, Sophia eagerly agreed. "Okay!"

The call connected instantly. Moments later, she announced, "Dad says fifteen minutes."

"Pack your things then. We'll wait downstairs."

Sophia nearly asked for help packing - her mother usually assisted. But sensing Isabella's mood, she thought better of it.

When the time came, Isabella escorted her downstairs.

In the elevator, Sophia swung their clasped hands. "Mom?"

Isabella glanced down. "Hmm?"

"You're quieter lately." She'd noticed the daily check-ins had stopped, along with her mother's usual stream of questions.

Strangely, she preferred this change. But now she realized the silence extended beyond phone calls - even in person, her mother spoke less.

Like she'd... withdrawn.

Isabella knew her daughter wasn't oblivious. That it took this long for Sophia to notice only proved one thing - she'd grown accustomed to being ignored.

"Just tired," Isabella deflected.

The night wind cut like knives.

Exiting the lobby, the icy gusts stung their faces.

Sophia shivered violently, digging her heels in. She buried her face against Isabella's midsection. "Too cold, Mommy. Carry me."

At nearly six, Sophia was heavy.

Though it strained her, Isabella bent and lifted her anyway.
###Chapter 133

Sophia wrapped her tiny arms around Isabella's neck, pressing her face into the warmth of her scarf to escape the biting wind.

Isabella's coat was soft against Sophia's cheek, and the little girl snuggled deeper, nuzzling her nose against the fabric with a contented sigh.

Alexander was never late. By the time Isabella carried Sophia to the parking lot, his sleek black car had already pulled up beside them.

The moment they appeared, the car glided to a smooth stop.

Even with her father waiting, Sophia didn’t budge from Isabella’s arms. Instead, she grinned at Alexander through the lowered window. "Daddy, carry me in!"

Alexander didn’t speak. He simply stepped out and lifted Sophia from Isabella’s embrace.

Giggling, Sophia kicked her legs playfully as he settled her against his chest.

As he leaned in, Isabella caught the faintest trace of a familiar scent—Victoria’s perfume.

It hadn’t been there earlier when he sat beside her.

Which meant after leaving them, he’d gone to the Kensingtons.

Alexander met her gaze. "It’s cold. You should head home."

Isabella took a deliberate step back. "I will."

Sophia waved enthusiastically. "Bye, Mommy!"

Isabella gave a small nod in response.

She didn’t wait for them to drive away. The moment Alexander secured Sophia inside, she turned on her heel and walked toward her own car.

Alexander watched her retreating figure for a long moment before finally looking away. "Drive."

The car merged seamlessly into the evening traffic.

Just as Isabella reached for her door handle, a voice stopped her. "Isabella."

She hadn’t noticed anyone approaching, assuming it was just another stranger in the parking lot. But at the sound of her name, she turned—and found Julian standing there.

She assumed it was coincidence. The hotel wasn’t exclusive to them, after all.

Offering a polite nod, she unlocked her car, ready to leave.

Julian didn’t move. His hesitation was palpable.

Isabella paused, hand on the door. His expression suggested he had something to say.

Her voice cooled. "Did you need something?"

Julian hesitated.

In the end, he didn’t mention the evening’s events. Instead, he said, "Lily has a gift for you. Maybe we could arrange dinner in the next few days?"

Lily had been through something traumatic—physically and emotionally. She’d once told Isabella she reminded her of her late mother.

Isabella liked Lily. Under normal circumstances, she’d set aside her issues with Julian to spend time with her.

But meeting just for Lily’s sake…

Before she could respond, Julian added, "There’s a project your uncle’s working on. I can help."

Isabella stiffened.

He didn’t elaborate. "Think about it. Call me whenever you decide."

She didn’t answer. Trusting him was impossible. He was close to both Victoria and Alexander.

Even if his offer was genuine now, what guarantee was there that he wouldn’t use it against her later—just like Alexander had?
###Chapter 134

Julian Montgomery seemed to sense Isabella Sinclair's hesitation. "I can assure you," he said firmly, "personal matters will never affect business dealings between me and your uncle."

Isabella studied his face. "You're certain about this?"

"Absolutely."

She knew Charles Sinclair's company was struggling. After a brief pause, she nodded. "Alright then."

"Just tell me when you're available," Julian said. "I'll arrange the meeting."

"Fine," Isabella agreed.

The night breeze ruffled her dark hair as Julian glanced at her. "It's getting cold. You should go inside."

The words struck her - identical to what Alexander Whitmore had said earlier that evening.

She gave a curt nod and slid into her car without another word.

Julian remained standing there.

As she drove past him, Isabella lowered her window just enough to acknowledge him with a brief nod before accelerating away.

He watched until her taillights disappeared before entering his own vehicle.

Back at the Sinclair estate, Margaret, Charles, and Caroline were still awake, though William and Edward had retired upstairs.

"You're back," Margaret observed as Isabella entered.

"Yes." Seeing her grandmother's outstretched hand, Isabella set down her purse and joined her on the sofa. Margaret clasped her granddaughter's hands. "Isabella, have you... moved on from Alexander?"

Her demeanor toward him tonight had been markedly different. The change was impossible to miss. "Yes," Isabella confirmed. "We're proceeding with the divorce."

Margaret's face lit up. "Good. That's very good."

But then concern creased her brow. "Sophia's quite attached to him, and truthfully, he's been wonderful with her these past two years. He won't relinquish custody easily. This could be—"

Isabella had no intention of fighting for custody. But she kept that to herself.

"I understand," she said instead. "We'll discuss it properly. It's late—everyone should rest."

While the others retired, Isabella's night was far from over.

Frederick Aldridge and Nathaniel Graves had been debating various topics during their ride home. By the time Isabella reached her room, Nathaniel had already sent her a detailed task list.

His message read: For the professor. Deadline: 6 AM tomorrow.

Isabella took a sip of water before responding: Understood.

Without bothering to remove her makeup or shower, she immediately booted up her laptop and began working.

At precisely 4:17 AM, she sent the completed files.

Nathaniel, also buried in work, responded moments later: Professor wants us at his office before nine.

Acknowledged, Isabella typed back.

No further conversation ensued.

After shutting down her computer, she finally attended to her neglected skincare routine.

By the time she finished showering, the clock showed 5:23 AM.

She set a three-hour alarm before finally turning off the lights.

When the alarm jarred her awake, every muscle protested. But she forced herself up and into the shower.

Her exhaustion was evident when she descended the stairs.

Margaret frowned. "You should sleep longer."

"Can't. Meeting with Professor Aldridge."

Knowing Frederick's exacting standards, Margaret simply said, "You shouldn't drive in this state. Take the chauffeur."

Isabella nodded.

At Frederick's villa, the three immediately sequestered themselves in his study and began working.
###Chapter 135

The clock struck noon before Isabella and Nathaniel finally paused their work for lunch.

Just then, Isabella's phone buzzed with a message from Emily. "Skiing this afternoon? Join us!"

Isabella pressed the voice memo button. "Can't today. Have prior commitments. You go enjoy."

"Alright then."

Later that evening, while stepping out of Frederick's study for water, another message arrived from Emily.

This time, it contained photos. The subjects were unmistakable - Alexander, Victoria, Sophia, Julian, and Lily.

Emily's follow-up message popped up: "We were having such fun until we ran into them! Total mood killer."

Isabella only needed to glance at one photo before swiping away the rest.

Her response came calm and measured: "Just focus on your own fun. Ignore them."

Emily's reply was immediate: "We might stay till evening. Want to join?"

"No. Busy."

"Fine then."

Tucking her phone away, Isabella retrieved her water glass and returned to the study. The work continued uninterrupted until nightfall.

Nathaniel stretched his stiff muscles. "Mr. Aldridge, let's treat you to dinner."

Frederick didn't even glance up. "Prior engagement."

Both Isabella and Nathaniel blinked in surprise.

"Dining with Alexander tonight."

Nathaniel shot Isabella a look, but she simply sipped her water, expression unreadable.

Frederick grabbed his keys, pausing at the door. "Lock up when you leave." Then, as an afterthought: "I won't be late."

"Understood, professor."

Meanwhile, Sophia, Alexander, Victoria and their group had spent the entire day skiing in high spirits.

Exiting the slopes, Sophia beamed at Alexander. "Dad, let's have seafood for dinner!"

Alexander tweaked her nose affectionately. "Victoria and I have important business. The car's waiting - tell the chef your preferences when you get home."

Sophia's smile vanished instantly. "What business? Why can't I come?"

Alexander's smile remained gentle but firm. "Adult matters, sweetheart."
###Chapter 136

The moment Sophia and Julian disappeared from view, Alexander and Victoria slid into their luxury sedan, heading toward The Grandeur.

Frederick Aldridge arrived at their private dining room just minutes after they did.

"Mr. Aldridge." Both Alexander and Victoria rose to greet him when he entered.

Frederick showed no reaction to seeing Victoria there.

She extended her hand politely. "Hello, Mr. Aldridge. I'm Victoria Kensington. We met previously at the Salzburg Tech Expo—"

"I remember." His tone remained flat as he gave her hand a perfunctory shake.

Once seated, Victoria took the chair beside him. "I've long admired your work. It would be an honor to discuss AI advancements with you directly."

"Hmm."

Alexander's phone vibrated. He stood abruptly. "Excuse me, I need to take this. Please continue without me."

Victoria nodded.

As soon as Alexander stepped out, she offered Frederick the menu. "Shall we order first? We can discuss over dinner."

Frederick pushed it away. "Not necessary."

Victoria blinked, caught off guard.

Before she could respond, he cut straight to the point. "You want me to mentor you?"

His bluntness surprised her, but Victoria wasn't intimidated by the legendary AI pioneer.

Meeting his gaze squarely, she answered, "Yes. AI is my passion, and studying under you would elevate my skills exponentially."

She'd prepared extensively for this meeting.

Opening her laptop, she asked, "May I show you my doctoral research project?"

Frederick scrolled through her work, analyzing the data. After reviewing several datasets, he remarked indifferently, "Above average for a PhD thesis."

Victoria's confidence surged at the backhanded compliment.

Just as she opened her mouth to speak, Frederick released the mouse and fixed her with an unreadable stare. "You completed this project this year?"

"Yes."

"That's all?"

Victoria hesitated, uncertain whether he expected more impressive work or found her lacking.

But she'd been top of her class at Yardley University, won numerous awards, and earned high praise from her advisor—a leading Salzburg AI researcher involved in national aerospace projects.

His endorsement carried weight.

Straightening her shoulders, she said, "I conducted a technical analysis of the autonomous vehicles showcased at last month's expo. Would you like to hear my findings?"

"Proceed."

For the next twelve minutes, Victoria delivered an in-depth technical breakdown of the vehicle's perception, planning, and control systems.

Alexander briefly returned, only to excuse himself for another call.

Just as Victoria was elaborating on sensor fusion algorithms, Frederick abruptly stood. "Enough."

She immediately fell silent.

Frederick delivered his verdict with clinical precision.

"Your fundamentals are adequate, but you're not at the level I require in a protégé."
###Chapter 137

Victoria froze for a split second before pressing her lips into a thin line.

This wasn't the response she'd hoped for.

Frederick was already turning to leave when she rushed forward. "Mr. Aldridge," she blurted out, "how can I improve?"

He paused briefly. "Research more. Stay updated with industry advancements."

Just then, Alexander returned.

Before he could speak, Frederick stated, "My business here is concluded. I'll reach out in a few days."

"Understood."

With that, Frederick left.

Alexander studied Victoria's expression. "That bad?"

She nodded bluntly. "He rejected me."

"What exactly did he say?"

Victoria recounted the entire conversation, including Frederick's blunt assessment.

"You're clearly talented," Alexander said. "And his advice is sound."

Victoria hesitated. Lately, she'd neglected deep research and rarely kept up with tech breakthroughs.

Had Frederick noticed her lack of dedication? Did he consider her professional attitude lacking? Was that why he'd refused her?

Realizing it was her work ethic - not her skills - that had cost her this opportunity, she felt marginally better.

Alexander squeezed her shoulder. "There's always next time."

"I'll try again." Victoria believed correcting her approach would meet Frederick's standards.

She regretted wasting months on racing. Had she focused, she might already be his protégé.

Frederick returned to the villa.

Inside, Isabella and Nathaniel were prepping ingredients for stew.

"You're back early," Nathaniel noted.

Frederick shrugged off his coat. "Hmm."

Nathaniel glanced at Isabella emerging from the kitchen, then smirked. "So no new apprentice, then?"

Frederick ignored him, accepting a bowl from Isabella.

Silence spoke volumes.

Nathaniel chuckled, winking at Isabella. "Told you I had her pegged from day one."

Isabella smiled, shooing him back to the kitchen for meat. "Yes, yes, you're brilliant." When he returned, Nathaniel asked, "Where would you rank her technically?"

"Marginally above average PhD level."

"Great minds."

Over the past decade, their nation's AI advancements had likely surpassed global benchmarks.

As a pivotal industry figure, Frederick constantly interfaced with cutting-edge tech and elite talent.

Victoria's skills were impressive for a layperson. Among top-tier candidates? Merely adequate.

Compared to Frederick's inner circle, she lagged far behind.

As for Nathaniel and Isabella? That was an entirely different caliber.

At twenty-five, Victoria couldn't hold a candle to what Isabella had achieved years prior with CUAP.
###Chapter 138

Nathaniel noticed how drained they looked and dismissed Isabella and himself early that evening.

Exhausted from the long day, Isabella headed straight for the shower upon arriving home before collapsing into bed.

The next morning brought urgent matters requiring their attention at InnovaTech.

By afternoon, they carved out time to visit the tech firm. The moment they stepped inside, technical discussions consumed them.

Within minutes, Dominic and Simon entered, escorted by InnovaTech staff. Both men's eyebrows shot up at the sight of Isabella.

Simon smirked. "She actually works here? What are the odds."

Dominic merely shrugged. Hardly knowing her, how would he be aware of her employment status?

"Ms. Sinclair?" An InnovaTech employee clarified. "She's not on our payroll. She's YodaVision's technical specialist, here to assist with system issues."

A prickling sensation made Isabella turn.

Her gaze landed on the auction commentators from days prior. She offered them the briefest glance before turning away, features schooled into perfect neutrality.

Simon chuckled. "Well, that's a cold shoulder."

Dominic showed no interest in pursuing the topic.

Before he could speak, Victoria entered from the corridor.

Spotting them, Victoria paused mid-step, surprise flickering across her composed features.

"Ms. Kensington." Dominic's entire demeanor shifted at her appearance, the indifference vanishing instantly.

Victoria inclined her head slightly. "Mr. Fairchild. Mr. York."

Dominic approached. "Do you work with InnovaTech, Ms. Kensington?"

"Not officially," Victoria replied. "I specialize in algorithmic development. Came to expand my knowledge base."

Though born in the capital, Dominic rarely stayed long. His recent return had introduced him to Victoria's growing reputation.

The whispers painted an extraordinary picture - university graduate at eighteen, PhD candidate at a global top-tier institution. The resume alone intimidated him.

Beyond academia, she supposedly dominated racing circuits and esports tournaments while excelling in rock climbing and skydiving. Each revelation made her more compelling.

Unfortunately, she belonged to Alexander.

Maintaining respectful distance, he remarked, "Your dedication to self-improvement is remarkable."

"You flatter me, Mr. Fairchild." Victoria's humility despite her achievements only deepened his admiration. "Recognizing one's limitations is the first step toward growth."

Their company, CodeFlux Inc., partnered with InnovaTech on the same project where YodaVision handled system architecture while CodeFlux managed materials.

Victor Pembroke, another project lead, approached upon noticing their arrival.

The group migrated toward Isabella and Nathaniel's workstation.

"Mr. Graves," Victor began introductions, "these gentlemen are—"

Nathaniel glanced up, arching an eyebrow. "Mr. Fairchild. Mr. York." His gaze shifted. "And Ms. Kensington."

Isabella hadn't looked toward the entrance again, but Nathaniel's mention of Victoria snapped her attention back. She didn't need to turn to know who had arrived.
###Chapter 139

Isabella didn't glance up from her intense discussion with the Salzburg tech team.

Victor flashed a knowing smile. "Mr. Graves, are you acquainted with Mr. Fairchild and Mr. Holloway?"

Nathaniel gave a curt nod. "We've met."

As scions of Salzburg's elite families, their paths had crossed before.

Though Nathaniel had chosen a different professional trajectory, making their relationship merely cordial.

After exchanging brief pleasantries with Nathaniel, Dominic and Simon followed Victor to another section of the venue.

Victoria remained behind with Nathaniel.

She'd noticed Isabella immediately, but after one dismissive glance, refocused her attention on Nathaniel.

"Mr. Graves, did you just arrive?" she inquired smoothly.

Nathaniel's technical prowess and status as Frederick Aldridge's protégé made him valuable.

Despite sensing his coolness toward her - likely due to Isabella's influence - Victoria maintained her charm.

Once she secured Frederick as her mentor too, they'd be working closely together.

"I've been here thirty minutes," Nathaniel answered distractedly, scribbling notes. "You seem well-settled, Ms. Kensington."

Victoria smiled. "I arrived at Salzburg Tech this morning. After a busy day, I needed refreshments upstairs."

The unspoken implication being Alexander Whitmore's private office.

Nathaniel's pen stilled. His tone turned glacial. "Is Mr. Whitmore here?"

"No, he's at Whitmore Group."

Meaning she had unrestricted access to his workspace - no secrets between them.

Nathaniel's noncommittal "hmm" ended the conversation. He strode toward Isabella, notebook extended.

Isabella glanced at his notes, nodded understanding, then resumed work.

Victoria interjected, "What technical issues are you discussing? Perhaps I could assist."

"This is specialized work, Ms. Kensington," Nathaniel replied coolly. "It wouldn't be appropriate."

As Victoria opened her mouth to protest, Isabella approached with data reports.

Victoria's expression frosted over instantly.

Isabella ignored her initially, but meeting Victoria's icy glare, returned an equally chilling stare.
###Chapter 140

Dominic's voice cut through the hum of computers. "Do you know that woman?"

At the mention of Isabella, Victoria's fingers froze mid-keystroke. Her first thought was that Dominic might be interested in her.

Isabella was undeniably stunning. But remembering the auction whispers and Dominic's current tone, Victoria realized her mistake.

She kept her face blank. "Not really. Why?"

Dominic gestured toward Isabella and Nathaniel. "The way she talks with Nathaniel - she seems competent."

Victoria shrugged. "I wouldn't know. Heard she only has a bachelor's degree."

"Just a bachelor's?"

"Mhm."

That explained everything. With lower qualifications than Victoria and none of her striking presence, Isabella's insecurity about Nathaniel made perfect sense.

Dominic could sympathize with her fear of losing Nathaniel.

But turning every accomplished woman into competition? Assuming they all wanted to steal her man? That was pathetic.

His neutral opinion of Isabella soured into mild distaste.

Across the room, Nathaniel finally had a free moment. His gaze drifted through the glass partition to Dominic and Victoria in the conference room.

After watching them for several seconds, he leaned close to Isabella. "Dominic likes Victoria?"

Isabella was deep in data analysis. It took her a second to process the question. "Probably."

She genuinely didn't care. After answering, she pulled Nathaniel back to work with a sharp tug. "Focus."

The sooner they finished, the sooner they could leave.

Nathaniel smirked. "Poor taste." That ended his gossip session.

Dominic noticed Nathaniel looking their way and assumed he was watching Victoria. When Isabella frowned and pulled Nathaniel away, he thought she was jealous of his attention toward Victoria.

Victoria hit a technical snag and paused.

She considered asking Nathaniel for help, but when she looked over, he and the InnovaTech engineers were all listening intently to Isabella.

Their rapt attention made Isabella look like some tech genius.

Victoria quickly looked away.

Isabella and Nathaniel worked straight through until 5:30 pm before finally wrapping up.

Arthur invited them into the conference room for a break and some water.

Meanwhile, the contract between CodeFlux and InnovaTech had been finalized.

Seeing Dominic's team had also finished, Arthur suggested, "It's getting late. Dinner together?"

Dominic's interest sparked as he glanced at Victoria.

Victoria pretended not to notice. "Sorry, Alexander is picking me up from Fleming Group. We have plans. Enjoy your meal."

With Victoria declining, Dominic lost all interest. "I've got things to handle too. Rain check."

Victoria showed no reaction, though she'd expected this.

Nathaniel observed everything, now certain Dominic liked Victoria.

It was obvious Dominic only backed out because Victoria wasn't going.

With both refusing, Arthur turned awkwardly to Nathaniel. "Mr. Graves?"

Nathaniel clinked his teacup against Isabella's with a grin. "We're free, right, Belle?"
###Chapter 141

Isabella recognized that smirk of Nathaniel's was a veiled dig at Dominic. She gave a slight nod in response.

Victoria noticed how genuinely attentive Nathaniel was toward Isabella, her brows knitting together in displeasure.

Though Dominic and his team had claimed prior commitments prevented them from joining dinner, their business here was concluded. They descended the elevator with Isabella and Nathaniel, preparing to exit InnovaTech headquarters.

Just then, Victoria's phone rang. After a brief conversation, she announced, "Alexander's arriving shortly. I'll depart with your group."

When they reached the lobby, Alexander's luxury sedan was already idling at the curb.

Spotting them, he emerged from the vehicle, exchanging polite greetings with both Dominic and Nathaniel. His gaze flickered over Isabella without acknowledgment.

Victoria immediately positioned herself at Alexander's side as if drawn by magnetism. Together, they epitomized the picture-perfect power couple.

While Dominic made small talk with Alexander, Nathaniel's lips curved into an amused smirk. "Mr. Whitmore," he interjected coolly, "we have dinner reservations to keep. We'll take our leave."

"Safe travels, Mr. Graves," Alexander replied smoothly.

With that, Nathaniel guided Isabella away.

Following their meal with Arthur and the executives, Isabella drove home alone.

The moment her keys hit the foyer table, Julian's call lit up her screen. She hesitated before answering. "Mr. Montgomery."

"The contract's signed," Julian stated without preamble. "Verify with your uncle, then call me back." The line went dead before she could respond. Isabella hadn't anticipated Julian moving this swiftly. Yet trust remained in short supply.

After brief consideration, she dialed Charles. "Uncle, has Sinclair Enterprises finalized the Harper Group partnership?"

"Indeed." Charles sounded pleased yet perplexed. "Isabella, how did you hear about this development?"

"Industry chatter," she deflected, quickly shifting to family inquiries before ending the call.

She immediately redialed Julian, who answered on the first ring.

"I'm available this weekend," Isabella stated.

"Saturday or Sunday?" Julian's tone was all business. "Your preference or mine?"

"You decide."

"Understood."

After hanging up, Isabella showered, then caught up on the latest AI sector breakthroughs until fatigue set in.

Morning brought a light breakfast. As Isabella gathered her things, Julian called again.

"Lily wants to ski this weekend," he informed her. "Do you ski, Ms. Sinclair?"

"Competently," she confirmed.

"Require equipment?"

"I'll provide my own."

"Saturday then."

"Agreed."

At the office by eight, Isabella's day passed routinely until Sophia's afternoon call. "Mom, I'm craving your lasagna!"

That evening found Isabella at the Whitmore estate. Alexander was abroad on business, so she stayed overnight.

While preparing Sophia for school next morning, Isabella remembered the ski trip and retrieved her equipment from the basement storage. No need for last-minute shopping.

"Mom's going skiing?" Sophia's eyes sparkled with excitement. "Take me too!" Her recent resort visit with Victoria had left her wanting more.
###Chapter 142

Isabella stopped mid-step and turned to Sophia. "When were you thinking of going?"

Sophia bit her lip, hesitating.

Isabella understood immediately. The girl was waiting for a time when Alexander and Victoria wouldn't be available, so she'd have no choice but to ask her instead. But predicting their schedules was impossible, hence the hesitation.

Looking away, Isabella said, "It's fine. Just tell me when you want to go. If I'm free, I'll take you."

Sophia's face lit up. "Promise?"

Work kept Isabella busy all week.

Friday evening came early. She'd just arrived home and was contemplating dinner when her phone buzzed - Sophia calling. Isabella hesitated before answering.

"Mom! I'm free tomorrow! Let's hit the slopes!"

Isabella had indeed promised. But tomorrow wasn't convenient.

Her schedule was packed with obligatory social engagements. She couldn't afford distractions.

"Not tomorrow," she said firmly. "Pick another day."

Sophia's voice turned whiny. "But I really want to go Saturday! Please, Mom?"

"This Saturday won't work. Next week, if you still want to go."

Sophia tried another tactic, voice dripping with sweetness. "Mommy..."

Isabella remained unmoved. "Next week. And eat properly - no picking at your food." She ended the call.

Sophia didn't call back.

Knowing the girl, she was probably sulking. Isabella shrugged and headed to the kitchen.

The next morning, Julian called as she was getting ready. "Should I send a car?"

"No need."

After breakfast, she drove to the resort. Julian and Lily were already waiting.

Julian nodded in greeting while Lily broke into a run. "Ms. Sinclair!"

Isabella caught the girl in a gentle hug.

She studied Lily's beaming face. "You've grown. And those cheeks!" She pinched them lightly. "Even prettier now."

Lily nodded eagerly. "I've been eating all my veggies!"

Isabella smiled. Before she could respond, Lily produced a small object from her pocket. "This is for you!"

A delicate crystal keychain - a miniature pink purse with a white kitten inside.

It looked strikingly similar to the one Sophia had on her backpack recently, just a different color.

Given Julian's frequent outings with Alexander's group, matching accessories between the girls weren't surprising.

Isabella didn't comment.

"It's lovely," she said instead. "Thank you, Lily."

Pleased, Lily grabbed her hand. "Let's go skiing!"

"Alright."

As they walked inside, Julian asked, "Did you eat? We brought breakfast."

"I'm fine, thanks."

"Suit yourself."

Gear on, goggles adjusted, they headed for the slopes.

Lily was still learning, but Isabella - an experienced skier - guided her patiently.

The resort was packed that weekend.
###Chapter 143

Julian stayed close to Isabella and Lily, shielding them from the bustling crowd.

The slopes were unusually packed today.

Within the first hour, two skiers collided with them.

Lily remained unharmed, but Isabella crashed straight into Julian.

His arms instinctively encircled her waist, pulling her firmly against his chest.

Pressed against his muscular frame, Isabella froze momentarily before squirming uncomfortably. She tried pushing away, only to wince in pain.

Julian tightened his grip. "Did you twist your ankle?"

"I think... yes."

He summoned a staff member to assist Lily before scooping Isabella into his arms.

She'd expected him to let the staff handle it. The sudden lift made her gasp. "Put me down—"

"The medic's waiting," Julian interrupted. "Let's get that ankle checked first."

Isabella stopped resisting.

Inside the lodge, Julian carefully set her down.

The examining physician confirmed a minor dislocation. After a quick adjustment, she was cleared.

"Still want to ski?" Julian asked.

"I'm fine." Isabella didn't want to ruin Lily's fun.

Seeing the doctor's approval, Julian didn't object.

Unbeknownst to them, someone watched from a distance.

"Genevieve? What's caught your eye?"

Genevieve squinted. "I think I recognize someone."

The man's profile resembled Julian's. But with a woman and child? Surely not him.

As she stepped closer for a better look, the man replaced his goggles and moved away.

Over the next hour, Isabella and Lily had two more minor collisions, both harmless.

When Julian reached to steady her, Isabella subtly withdrew her hand. "I'm good now."

Only then did he release her wrist.

At lunchtime, they retreated to a nearby restaurant. Julian handed Isabella the menu.

Mid-meal, Lily suddenly asked, "Ms. Sinclair, what's your first name?"

"Isabella. Isabella Sinclair. You can call me Ms. Isabella."

Lily beamed. "Ms. Isabella."

Isabella smiled, gently patting the girl's cheek.

Exhausted from skiing, Lily dozed off before dessert. Julian lifted her, wiping chocolate from her mouth.

Isabella set down her fork. "Shall we call it a day?"

"Alright." Instead of rising, Julian met her gaze. "Can I invite you out again?"

"Sure."

He'd helped today, and Lily clearly enjoyed her company. A few more outings seemed fair.

"Thanks."

"No need."

With Lily asleep and conversation lulling, Isabella excused herself.

Julian watched her car disappear before carrying Lily to his vehicle.

At home, Lily stirred. "Ms. Isabella left already?"

"Yes." Julian suddenly added, "From now on, just call her 'Ms. Sinclair,' okay? And keep her name secret. Don't tell anyone."

Lily nodded obediently. "Okay."
###Chapter 144

Isabella drove away after lunch with Julian and Lily. On her way home, Emily called.

"Bella, where are you? I'm exhausted! Come pick me up for dinner."

Isabella didn't mention she'd already eaten. "Where are you?"

"Yorkshire Manor," Emily said. "That classical courtyard-style residential complex developed last year. Been house-hunting with my aunt all morning. Dead tired."

"Okay."

After hanging up, Isabella adjusted her GPS toward Yorkshire Manor.

Ten minutes later, Emily called again. "Damn! Guess who I just ran into?"

Isabella paused. Lately, only one person could make Emily curse like that.

"Alexander and Victoria with her entire family! He's giving the Kensingtons a property tour!"

Isabella's expression remained neutral as she hummed in response.

Usually when Alexander and Victoria went out, they brought Sophia along. The reason he'd left his daughter home alone today? Entertaining the Kensingtons.

Made sense. The Whitmores had already settled into their new home. If the Kensingtons planned to stay in Salzburg, they'd need property too.

Arriving at Yorkshire Manor, Isabella parked and texted Emily her location.

Emily replied she'd be out soon.

Isabella asked where she was. Emily said she'd stopped by the sales office to use the restroom and sent the location.

Just as Isabella stepped out, she spotted Eleanor, Reginald, and Beatrice walking toward the parking lot.

They were all smiling, clearly in excellent spirits.

Isabella exited her car, but the trio entered from the opposite side and didn't notice her.

Minutes later at the sales office entrance, Isabella collided with Alexander and Victoria. They were exiting surrounded by seven or eight sales executives.

Alexander glanced sideways at her while Victoria, clinging to his arm, shot her a cold look.

Isabella averted her gaze indifferently and walked past them toward Emily.

Seeing her, Emily gritted her teeth. "Properties here start at 300 million. The staff told me Alexander bought the Kensingtons the premium villa - over 600 million!"

Isabella simply hummed.

Studying her expression, Emily added, "And apparently they chose this development because Victoria's mother loves the architectural style—"

Isabella's steps faltered almost imperceptibly. No wonder Eleanor had looked so pleased earlier.

Suppressing her emotions, Isabella said calmly, "I need the restroom."

"Okay."

Inside, Isabella clenched her fists. She'd grown numb to stories of Alexander doting on Victoria.

But hearing him catering to Eleanor still—

Voices outside caught her attention.

"That Mr. Whitmore has impeccable taste. His girlfriend is stunning."

"Right? And her mother—so elegant and classy. The best part? Her husband and in-laws indulge her every whim. Everything revolves around her preferences. She's utterly spoiled!"

"Ugh, comparing her to my own in-laws makes me furious."

"Exactly! Mr. Whitmore treats his girlfriend like royalty. They're not even married yet, and he just dropped 600 million on a villa for her family. Some women really win the genetic lottery."
###Chapter 145

Isabella stepped out of the restroom, realizing ten minutes had slipped by unnoticed.

After sharing dinner with Emily, an unexpected longing to visit the nursing home tugged at her heart.

But the memory of Evelyn's fragile state and the doctor's strict orders against familiar visitors made her pause.

She'd already pulled up to the nursing home's gates when she changed her mind, turning the car around toward home.

Locked in her home office, she buried herself in work until her phone's sharp ring shattered her focus.

Alexander's name flashed on the screen.

Isabella barely glanced at it, finishing her data entry before setting the phone aside.

The call ended on its own. Three minutes later, it rang again.

She let it go to voicemail.

A text appeared: Eleanor wants us at Whitmore Manor for dinner tonight.

No reply.

Across town, Alexander stared at his silent phone, jaw tightening.

"Daddy!" Sophia's voice echoed down the staircase as she barreled into his arms.

He steadied her with a distracted hum.

Noticing his phone, she tilted her head. "Who are you texting?"

"Your mother isn't answering."

Sophia's face scrunched up at the mention of Isabella.

Alexander pinched her cheek. "That pout every time I mention Mom. Did you upset her?"

"Me?" Sophia's eyes widened. "She promised to take me skiing today! Then she said she's too busy!"

"If Mom's busy, shouldn't you be understanding?" He ruffled her hair. "Grab your jacket."

"Where?"

"Great-grandma's dinner."

Sophia huffed but followed him out.

Meanwhile, Isabella was unpacking takeout when Eleanor's call came at 7:02 PM.

She couldn't ignore this one. "Hello, Grandmother."

"Isabella dear, Alexander said you're swamped. When will you finish?"

The manor was the last place she wanted to be tonight.

Since Alexander had provided the excuse, she ran with it. "It'll take days. My apologies."

"No matter, child." Eleanor's voice warmed. "Just don't work yourself to exhaustion."

"I won't."

"Alexander returns tomorrow. I'll send treats with him. Eat properly."

"Of course."

As the call ended, Eleanor turned to her grandson lounging with a newspaper. "Next time she refuses to come, don't bother showing your face either."

Alexander arched a brow. "Should I camp on her doorstep then?"

Eleanor threw up her hands.
###Chapter 146

The call ended abruptly. Isabella returned to her work with renewed focus.

Her mind felt clearer after the intense mental exercise. The tension had eased considerably.

Nathaniel's text lit up her phone screen. Drinks tonight?

Thirty minutes later, she walked into The Velvet Lounge.

Nathaniel greeted her at the entrance. "Whiskey sour or something lighter?"

She bit her lip. "Maybe just one cocktail."

His sharp eyes studied her face. "Rough day?"

"Better now," she deflected.

Nathaniel didn't push. He signaled the bartender for a peach bellini.

Isabella cradled the chilled glass, taking measured sips while Nathaniel bantered with his colleagues. Neither noticed the pair observing them from the VIP balcony.

Simon Fairchild smirked. "So that's Nathaniel's new pet project."

His companion followed his gaze. Recognition flickered across his face.

Simon nudged him. "Your type?"

The man ignored the question. "You know her?"

"Dominic's almost-conquest," Simon drawled. "The one who slipped through his fingers."

His friend's gaze lingered on Isabella. Amidst the pulsing neon and bass-heavy music, she stood out like a snowflake in hell - untouched, untouchable.

She didn't belong here. Yet her very incongruence made her magnetic.

Nathaniel turned to her. "Feel like dancing?"

"I don't know how," she admitted.

"Neither do I." He grinned. "Let's embarrass ourselves together."

On the dance floor, she mirrored his awkward movements. Gradually, the rhythm found her. Her shoulders loosened. A faint smile touched her lips.

The alcohol warmed her veins. A delicate flush bloomed across her cheekbones, making her eyes spark like cut glass. With each sway, an unconscious sensuality emerged - more potent for its innocence.

Simon whistled low. "Damn. Ms. Kensington's got that ice queen act, but this one... she's fire wrapped in silk."

His companion remained silent.

Isabella's phone buzzed against her thigh. She checked the screen mid-step. Every muscle locked.

Nathaniel followed her gaze and nearly choked. "Is that Frederick Aldridge?"

They scrambled off the dance floor.

As they exited, Isabella glanced up. Simon and his mysterious friend watched them with undisguised interest. She averted her eyes quickly.

Outside, she answered with trembling fingers. "Mr. Aldridge."

"Pick me up tomorrow. Noon sharp." The line went dead.

She stared at her phone. "What just happened?"

Nathaniel grabbed her shoulders. "Well?"

"He wants me to drive him somewhere tomorrow."

"No explanation? No 'bring Nathaniel too'?" He checked his own phone. "Nothing. The betrayal."

The night air carried the bar's pulsating energy. Despite everything, Isabella felt lighter.

She playfully punched Nathaniel's arm. "Feeling better?"

"Not until you pay my therapy bills," he grumbled.

"Put it on my tab."
###Chapter 147

Of course, that was merely playful banter. Nathaniel would never actually allow Isabella to foot the bill.

He also feared Alexander might discover he'd taken her drinking at a bar. After settling the payment discreetly, they left together.

At noon the next day, Isabella arrived at Frederick's residence to pick him up.

"Mr. Aldridge, where are we headed?" she asked as he slid into the passenger seat.

Frederick provided an address.

Thirty minutes later, they entered an upscale restaurant where a waiter escorted them to a private dining room.

Two distinguished middle-aged men rose from their seats upon their arrival. "You made it."

With his usual detached demeanor, Frederick introduced them. "Richard Fairchild, Walter Ashford. My protégé, Isabella Sinclair."

Isabella recognized them immediately - one a high-ranking military official, the other a prominent political figure.

Despite their status, both men greeted her warmly, extending their hands. "We've heard so much about you."

Though momentarily surprised, Isabella maintained her composure, shaking their hands respectfully. "The honor is entirely mine."

Richard and Walter chuckled, gesturing for her to join them at the table.

As she settled into her seat, Richard remarked, "We've been wanting to meet you for years. Frederick kept postponing introductions until today."

"Recently, our team has been studying your revolutionary system," Walter added. "With some free time finally available, we insisted on this meeting."

After initial pleasantries, the conversation turned serious - discussing advanced systems, semiconductor technology, and renewable energy solutions.

Frederick remained characteristically silent throughout, sipping his tea and sampling dishes without participating.

An hour later, Richard poured Isabella a fresh cup of tea, which she accepted graciously.

Setting down the teapot, he studied her with keen, experienced eyes. "If I recall correctly, you're in your twenties?"

Isabella nodded. "Twenty-five."

"So young," Richard mused. Walter immediately picked up on his colleague's implication. "Are you seeing anyone?"

Isabella hesitated briefly. "I'm married." Though divorce papers were already drafted.

Given the company, she refrained from elaborating on personal matters. Both men showed visible surprise, but their professionalism never wavered.

A fleeting shadow crossed Isabella's eyes when mentioning her marriage - subtle yet revealing to these seasoned observers. The unspoken tension suggested marital troubles, meaning divorce might be imminent.

This presented an opportunity for their eligible sons.

Normally, even daughters from elite families struggled to enter the Fairchild and Ashford circles, let alone a divorcée.

But Isabella represented an exception - her brilliance transcended conventional social barriers.

With YodaVision's cutting-edge technology, the company's trajectory appeared unstoppable.

More importantly, Frederick's position would likely pass to her eventually. Her potential was simply limitless.

Beyond her professional achievements, they admired her humility and grace - rare qualities in someone so accomplished at such a young age.

Their admiration grew with each passing moment.

Frederick, who had remained silent throughout this exchange, finally lifted his gaze, shooting them a warning look sharp enough to cut glass.
###Chapter 148

The moment Isabella stepped through her front door after lunch, her phone buzzed with Nathaniel's call.

When she explained Frederick's request to meet, Nathaniel responded instantly. "Richard and Walter? Of course I know them."

He added with a scoff, "That Dominic is actually Richard's son. With such an accomplished father, it's baffling how the son turned out so incompetent at his age."

Isabella hadn't expected Dominic's lineage, but it hardly mattered to her.

Tuesday arrived with InnovaTech's autonomous vehicle prototype testing.

Isabella and Nathaniel arrived at the tech campus at dawn. Dominic, Simon, and their entourage were already present when they arrived.

The group offered curt nods before deliberately looking away.

Nathaniel couldn't be bothered with pleasantries either, guiding Isabella toward the testing preparations.

Noticing everything was ready but the test hadn't commenced, Nathaniel frowned. "Why the delay?"

Maxwell answered, "Mr. Whitmore wants to observe personally. We're waiting for his arrival."

Then Maxwell glanced around. "Where's Ms. Kensington today?"

Hadn't Victoria claimed she was coming to InnovaTech for training? Why had she vanished after mere days?

Maxwell chuckled. "Ah, Ms. Kensington wanted skill enhancement, right? Mr. Whitmore said the fastest improvement comes from leading a project team."

"Last week he revived a shelved project. She's been assembling her team upstairs in meetings all morning."

Nathaniel's jaw dropped. He shot Isabella a look, but she was absorbed in reviewing previous test data, showing no reaction to Alexander creating a team for Victoria.

With a sigh, he playfully ruffled her hair.

Isabella swatted his hand away. "Stop that." Her tone was even—clearly unaffected. Nathaniel relaxed.

Alexander arrived then, flanked by Julian and Oliver.

Both men visibly startled upon seeing Isabella, their shocked gazes lingering.

Isabella remained impassive, barely acknowledging them before turning away.

Alexander greeted the group politely. "Appreciate everyone's efforts."

"Shall we begin, Mr. Whitmore?" Maxwell inquired.

"One moment—we're expecting someone else." Alexander checked his watch. "I'll check upstairs. Please wait."

He departed.

Isabelle didn't need to guess—Alexander was waiting for Victoria. Meaning they couldn't start until she finished her meeting.

Nathaniel clenched his fists, barely suppressing his irritation.

Soon Alexander descended with Victoria. And trailing behind them—Genevieve.

Genevieve showed no surprise at Isabella's presence. Victoria had warned her.

Seeing Alexander's wife reduced to waiting like staff while Victoria made her grand entrance, Genevieve's smirk dripped with smug satisfaction.

Isabella didn't bother questioning Genevieve's professional attire at InnovaTech. She simply looked through her.

Victoria offered a gracious apology. "Sorry for the delay."

Her tone was sincere. Yet when she spoke, her eyes acknowledged Dominic's group and Nathaniel—never once glancing at Isabella.
###Chapter 149

Isabella didn't even receive a glance from Victoria. The apology clearly wasn't meant for her.

Dominic was too preoccupied to notice Isabella's presence. "Just a few minutes delay," he dismissed casually.

"How gracious of you, Mr. Fairchild," Nathaniel rose abruptly, his voice icy. "Now that we're all present, let's not waste any more time. Begin."

Alexander maintained his diplomatic tone. "Our apologies, Mr. Graves. Please proceed."

Nathaniel gave a cold snort before grabbing Isabella's hand and storming out first.

Alexander noticed Nathaniel's possessive grip but quickly averted his gaze, his expression carefully neutral.

Julian, however, kept staring at the couple with undisguised curiosity.

The spotlight remained firmly on Alexander and Victoria throughout the event.

At the test track, staff members addressed them respectfully: "Mr. Whitmore, Ms. Kensington, all systems are ready."

Their deferential manner left no doubt - they considered Victoria the future Mrs. Whitmore.

"Initiate the test," Alexander commanded.

"Yes, sir."

The monitors displayed real-time driving data clearly.

After the test driver completed the circuit, staff invited Alexander and Victoria for a firsthand experience.

Alexander agreed immediately. They entered the vehicle together.

Onscreen, their animated conversation and lingering gazes spoke volumes.

Isabella watched the feed with perfect composure.

Nathaniel looked ready to vomit.

Oliver expressed interest in trying the vehicle, but when Genevieve approached him, Julian cut in sharply. "You go ahead. I'll pass."

Genevieve's words died in her throat.

Maxwell turned to Nathaniel and Isabella. "Mr. Graves, Ms. Sinclair, would you care to test the vehicle?"

As the actual technical experts present, they'd originally planned to evaluate the system. But after today's events, their enthusiasm had evaporated.

Nathaniel scoffed. "Hard pass."

Isabetha leaned close, whispering technical specifications about the engine. "Are you certain you don't want to try?" she murmured.

Nathaniel's eyes narrowed. "How do you know these details?"

Isabella tapped her temple. "Glanced at their data earlier. Photographic memory has its perks."

Nathaniel's mood visibly lifted. "Recreate it with me later."

"Deal." She pulled him into the vehicle.

Thirty minutes later, testing concluded.

Alexander announced, "Thank you for your efforts today. Shall we dine together?"

"Splendid idea," Dominic agreed.

Nathaniel's voice dripped with sarcasm. "Regrettably, we're occupied. Enjoy your meal." He turned sharply. "Maxwell, see us out."

Alexander nodded. "Another time then."

Maxwell hurried to comply. "Of course, sir."

Nathaniel's mocking smirk said everything his words didn't. He exited with Isabella's hand firmly in his.

Simon whispered to Dominic, "Why does Nathaniel seem to despise Alexander and his entourage?"

Dominic had noticed the animosity since their first encounter here.

He'd initially dismissed it as imagination. Now he wasn't so sure.
###Chapter 150

Nathaniel's anger still simmered as they drove away from InnovaTech.

A sudden thought struck him. He turned to Isabella. "That woman in the navy suit standing behind Victoria - she was staring at you oddly. Do you know her?"

"Victoria's cousin," Isabella replied flatly.

Nathaniel's grip tightened on the steering wheel. "First Alexander brings Victoria into InnovaTech, now he's hiring her relatives too? At this rate, the company will be renamed Kensington Enterprises by next quarter."

Isabella shared his sentiment but only hummed in response. Given Alexander's obsession with Victoria, she wouldn't put it past him to sign over the entire company. Letting the Kensington clan infiltrate InnovaTech was child's play compared to that.

Nathaniel changed the subject before his blood pressure spiked further.

That evening, they worked late into the night at Nathaniel's lab, replicating the specs for Alexander's autonomous vehicle prototype.

Snow began falling during their drive home.

Isabella was reaching for her bathrobe when her phone buzzed. Alexander's name flashed on the screen.

She let it ring out, gathered her toiletries, and stepped into the shower.

Two missed calls and one text waited when she emerged: "Sophia has parent-teacher conference tomorrow."

Isabella typed a terse reply: "Not available." She set the phone aside without another thought.

Across town, Alexander was reviewing contracts while Sophia played games on her tablet. The girl's face lit up when she saw Isabella's response.

"Daddy! Mom can't come tomorrow! Can we ask Victoria instead?"

Alexander didn't look up from his documents. "Hmm."

Sophia bounced on the couch, waving her arms. "Yes! This is perfect!"

"I'll be attending too," Alexander added.

Sophia grinned. "Obviously. Where Victoria goes, you follow."

The next afternoon at YodaVision, Isabella was deep in discussion with Dominic when her phone chimed.

A message from Sophia's teacher: "Mrs. Whitmore, will you be attending today's conference?"

Isabella replied: "Occupied with work. Unable to attend."

Minutes later, another message arrived with a photo attachment: "Mr. Whitmore attended with another woman today..."

The image showed Alexander and Victoria seated together, Sophia clinging to Victoria's arm. Isabella felt nothing. This was exactly what Sophia had wanted - Victoria playing mother while she stayed away. And Alexander would never let Victoria go alone.

Though the teacher seemed concerned, Isabella simply responded: "Aware of the situation. No issue. Thank you, Ms. Moore." She set her phone down and refocused on her work.

The week passed in a blur of meetings and prototypes. Before she knew it, Friday morning arrived.

She'd barely finished her coffee when Julian called. "Lily wants to go camping overnight. You in?"

Isabella paused. "Full overnight setup?"

"Already handled," Julian assured her. "Security, gear, provisions - all arranged. Just bring yourself."
###Chapter 151

Alright.

Isabella Sinclair returned to the Sinclair estate for lunch on Saturday morning. She asked Charles about the new project.

Once she confirmed everything was running smoothly, she finally relaxed.

By 2:00 PM, she drove to the campsite.

Julian Montgomery and Lily had just arrived as well.

Julian’s team was already setting up the tents and prepping the grill.

Snow had been falling for days, blanketing the mountains in thick white layers.

The moment she stepped out of the car, Lily tugged at her sleeve excitedly. "Let’s build a snowman!"

Isabella had built snowmen with Sophia before.

So, it wasn’t difficult for her.

Soon, they finished a small, lopsided snowman.

Lily had even brought a scarf for it. Once they were done, she asked the helpers to fetch the carrot and scarf she’d packed.

Julian approached her.

Isabella stayed silent.

He crouched beside her. "So, you’re working at YodaVision now?"

She smoothed the snowman’s round head. "Yes."

He remembered how coldly she’d dismissed Alexander and Victoria at InnovaTech. Like she’d already moved on. "When did you start?"

"A while ago."

He wanted to ask more, but her tone made it clear she wasn’t interested. So, he changed the subject. "Just five times total."

She paused. He was referring to the five outings she’d promised Lily.

"Okay," she agreed.

Lily returned with two scarves. She wanted to build a bigger snowman beside the small one—like them, one tall, one short. She even pulled Julian into helping.

He complied without protest.

When the larger snowman was done, Lily insisted on photos with both of them.

Julian took out his phone. Through the screen, he watched Isabella’s rare, genuine smile and snapped several shots.

Time flew by in laughter and snow. By the time they finished, dusk had settled. The scent of grilled meat filled the air, and the tents glowed warmly against the darkening sky.

"Hungry?" Julian asked.

She nodded.

He handed her a skewer.

The campsite buzzed with winter campers. Though not overcrowded, the energy was lively. A bonfire party was scheduled for later.

"Want to check it out?"

"Sure."

Just as Julian was about to reply, his phone rang.

Oliver Westbrook.

He stepped away to answer.

"Drinks tonight?" Oliver said.

"Pass. You go ahead."

"Why—"

Lily dashed over with another skewer. "Uncle Julian! This one’s for you!"

He bent down to take it.

Oliver heard her voice. "You’re grilling?"

"Yeah."

"Where?"

"Out," Julian said flatly. "Camping."

"Damn, that’s perfect! Snow, camping, bonfire—why didn’t I think of that?" Oliver paused. "Wait, you went without us?"

"I’ll invite you next time."

"Hold on—Lily’s there, right? Where exactly? I’ll come. Better yet, I’ll tell Alexander. We can all—"

"Gotta go," Julian interrupted, hanging up before Oliver could finish.

###Chapter 152

The night had swallowed the mountains whole, leaving only biting cold in its wake.

Julian ended the call and turned back toward their campsite. Isabella and Lily sat close together, sharing snacks and whispers. He ducked into the tent and emerged with two jackets - one oversized, one child-sized.

He handed the larger one to Isabella.

"I'm fine," she protested. "Not cold."

"Just take it."

Julian shook out the coat and draped it over her shoulders before carefully bundling Lily into the smaller one.

Isabella hadn't realized how chilled she'd been until the wind stopped slicing through her. She pulled the edges tighter without further argument.

After dinner, they joined the bonfire gathering.

Someone whistled. "Damn, you three look like a perfect little family!"

Isabella stiffened. "We're not."

The group chuckled knowingly, exchanging glances that said this was just a temporary technicality.

Lily soon scampered off to play with other children.

Clusters of families and friends filled the clearing - laughing, building snowmen, hurling snowballs. The energy was infectious.

Without Lily between them, silence settled over Isabella and Julian.

What was there to say?

Mentioning Alexander and Sophia would only reopen wounds.

Work talk risked stirring up InnovaTech memories.

Julian broke first. "Settling in at YodaVision?"

Isabella twisted dry grass between her fingers, shaping it into delicate wings. "Mm."

"Nathaniel seems to look out for you."

"Yes."

"Did you study AI in college?"

Another noncommittal hum.

"How'd you meet Nathaniel?"

Silence.

Julian recognized the wall when he hit it. He'd learned not to push.

He excused himself to take several calls at the tree line.

When he returned, darkness had fully claimed the mountainside.

Isabella had crafted an entire flock of grass butterflies. Lily treasured them, carefully tucking each one into her pocket.

The sight froze Isabella's smile.

Sophia used to collect her little creations with that same reverence.

Gone now.

That night, Lily begged to sleep beside Isabella.

Julian's questioning glance held no expectation, only quiet waiting.

Isabella nodded.

Lily burrowed close, radiating contentment.

They shared a tent, not a sleeping bag. No risk of midnight cuddles.

But mountain winds care little for boundaries. By dawn, Lily was feverish.

Isabella hadn't slept well either, shadows bruising her eyes.

Julian prepared to drive Lily to the hospital. Isabella intended to leave separately until Lily's weak fingers clutched hers, pleading through glassy eyes.

They piled into Julian's car.

Exhaustion claimed them both within minutes.

Julian's gaze traced Isabella's delicate features. His fingers twitched toward a stray curl brushing her cheek.

Her lashes fluttered.

He withdrew.
###Chapter 153

Isabella dozed lightly in the car, her rest fitful at best. Blinking awake, she noticed Julian withdrawing his hand but didn't comment. "Are we there yet?" she asked instead.

"Almost."

Two minutes later, the car stopped outside the hospital. Julian stepped out with Lily in his arms. "Need someone to drive you back?" he offered.

She shook her head. "I'm fine. I can manage."

Julian didn't press further.

As Isabella neared home, her phone buzzed with a text from Alexander. "Grandmother wants us three to visit the Sinclair residence together after she sees your grandmother," it read.

A response was necessary.

She called him immediately.

He answered on the first ring. "Yes?"

"I'll pick up Sophia now," Isabella said.

She assumed Alexander wouldn't actually want to accompany her to the Sinclair residence. He'd been dodging these visits with increasingly creative excuses lately.

Besides, her family wasn't exactly eager to see him either.

There was a brief pause before Alexander replied, "Alright."

Hanging up, Isabella drove to his villa.

Sophia stood waiting outside with a tiny backpack when she arrived.

The moment Sophia spotted Isabella, she clung to Alexander's side, avoiding eye contact.

Isabella assumed the girl was still sulking about being left behind during last week's ski trip.

Alexander studied Isabella's face. "Didn't sleep well last night?"

The question caught her off guard.

She must look terrible - no makeup, hair slightly disheveled, exhaustion written across her features.

"Mm," she hummed noncommittally, seeing no need to elaborate.

Richard interjected, "Trouble sleeping? We have excellent incense. I'll place some in your room later."

Isabella shook her head. "No need, Richard. I slept fine. Just wasn't used to camping last night."

Richard frowned. "Camping in winter? Hope you don't catch cold."

She smiled. "It was actually fun. Snowball fights, building snowmen, hide-and-seek by the bonfire."

Everyone else at the campsite had seemed to enjoy themselves immensely.

She'd envied them.

Alexander set aside his newspaper at this, his gaze lingering thoughtfully on her.

Sophia, meanwhile, grew visibly more upset.

Isabella hadn't even tried to make up with her after their last argument.

How could she go camping without her when it sounded so wonderful?

Dragging her backpack, Sophia jumped off the couch with a huff and bolted upstairs.

Isabella frowned, opening her mouth to speak.

But Alexander's voice cut through first. "Come back here, Sophia."

His tone held no anger.

Yet Sophia froze instantly.

Pursing her lips, she turned and stood stiffly.

Alexander gave her a look.

Seconds later, the girl trudged back downstairs, dragging her backpack.

But she didn't approach Isabella.

Instead, she went to Alexander and tugged his hand. "Will you come too, Daddy?" she asked sweetly.
###Chapter 154

Alexander didn't glance at Isabella. He gently tapped Sophia's nose. "I'm occupied, sweetheart. Be good and stay with Mommy, alright?"

"Fine," Sophia replied indifferently. She shot Isabella a look before walking over. Then she extended her hand, waiting for Isabella to take it.

This was her way of offering an olive branch.

Isabella grasped her daughter's hand, exchanged brief pleasantries with Richard, and left.

When they arrived at the Sinclair residence, Eleanor had already been waiting.

Noticing Alexander's absence, Eleanor frowned. "Where's Alexander? Too busy again?"

"Yes," Isabella confirmed.

Eleanor angrily pulled out her phone to call him. Meanwhile, Margaret saw no reason for Alexander to be present, knowing the divorce was imminent.

"Work keeps him tied up," Margaret intervened, stopping Eleanor. "No need to force him."

Sophia and Edward went upstairs to play video games.

Isabella settled into conversation with both Margaret and Eleanor.

Eleanor was thoroughly impressed by Margaret's two new art pieces. Learning they were created using the exquisite scholar's writing set Isabella had gifted Margaret for her birthday, Eleanor's interest peaked.

Upon examining the writing set herself, Eleanor marveled, "And Alexander? Surely he didn't forget your birthday present?"

"He did get me something."

Though Margaret's expression darkened at the mention of Alexander, she admitted, "An exquisite emerald jewelry set. The embroidery painting he delivered on your behalf was equally remarkable."

Eleanor chuckled. "That's more like it. At least he listened to me."

Isabella remained silent during their exchange.

After some time in the study, Eleanor and Margaret moved to the courtyard for tea.

Margaret gazed at the neighboring house. "Isn't it odd how the renovations suddenly stopped? They were working around the clock before. I assumed the owners were in a hurry to move in."

Eleanor smiled. "Perhaps circumstances changed."

"Perhaps."

Isabella had considered selling the property but feared it might fall into Kensington or Sinclair hands.

So she left it untouched.

With the Kensingtons involved, she had no desire to inspect the house either.

It remained in limbo.

Suddenly, Isabella sneezed, a chill running down her spine.

"Are you unwell?" both women asked simultaneously. "Coming down with something?"

Isabella grabbed a tissue. "Possibly."

She'd likely caught the same bug as Lily, though her symptoms were milder.

Margaret and Eleanor had been friends for decades.

Yet Eleanor knew nothing about the birthday party incident or Alexander's involvement with Victoria.

Their conversation flowed effortlessly between various topics.

Moments later, Emily called, reporting she'd spotted Alexander dining with the Kensingtons - again.

"Why does this always happen to me? I don't want these discoveries!" Emily exclaimed.

She asked Isabella's whereabouts.

"At Grandmother's."

"You went alone?"

"No, Mrs. Whitmore Senior is with me."

Understanding dawned. "So instead of being with you, Alexander is entertaining Victoria's family?"
###Chapter 155

Isabella remained silent.

She sneezed violently after ending the call.

Caroline grew concerned Isabella might be coming down with something. She prepared homemade chicken broth. After drinking it, Isabella's eyelids grew heavy, and she drifted into sleep.

Upon waking, she realized she was burning up.

The fever raged high, making her head swim.

Sophia approached with worried eyes. "Mommy, are you sick?"

Isabella murmured weakly.

Eleanor fretted over her condition. She insisted on taking Isabella back to Whitmore Estate to see their physician Gregory, who could provide proper treatment.

Margaret agreed the illness had struck suddenly and urged Isabella to return with Eleanor.

Soon they arrived at Whitmore Estate. Gregory examined Isabella and administered medication. After taking the pills, Isabella retreated upstairs and fell asleep again.

When she awoke, the fog in her mind had lifted slightly.

She opened her eyes to find the bedside lamp glowing. Turning her head, she saw Alexander seated nearby, absorbed in a book.

The sight startled her.

Then she remembered - she was at Whitmore Estate, in Alexander's childhood bedroom.

Hearing movement, Alexander glanced up. "Awake?"

Her throat burned. She didn't feel like speaking, so she stayed quiet.

As she reached for her jacket to rise, Alexander handed her a glass of water.

Isabella hesitated before accepting it silently.

Alexander didn't press for thanks. He reached to check her temperature, but she dodged his hand with surprising speed despite her condition.

Withdrawing, he stood. "Gregory's downstairs. I'll fetch him."

Without waiting for response, he left.

Moments later, Gregory, Eleanor, Alexander and Sophia all entered.

Gregory assessed her. "Your fever's breaking, but continue the medication. Stress and exhaustion weakened your immune system. Proper nutrition will restore your strength."

Isabella nodded.

"Hungry, dear?" Eleanor asked.

Isabella had barely eaten at lunch before collapsing into bed.

Though evening had fallen and her stomach growled, food held little appeal.

Eleanor insisted she try. She instructed Alexander to bring up the specially prepared meal.

Alexander returned with a tray.

Eleanor and Gregory departed, leaving Alexander reading in the chair.

Isabella noticed the book in his hands - the same one she'd been reading at the mountain retreat.

She frowned. "You—"

Alexander smiled. "I found your margin notes fascinating. Gave me new perspectives, so I kept it. I revisit it sometimes."

Isabella bit her lip and looked away.

What little appetite she'd had vanished completely.

Alexander studied her. "After all these years, you still haven't learned to fight back?"

She turned her face away.

He sighed. "Fine. Eat something."

###Chapter 156

Isabella had explicitly stated in the divorce papers that she wouldn't claim a single penny.

With no property disputes or custody battles over Sophia involved, she assumed Alexander would expedite the process without hesitation.

Yet three months had passed since she'd handed him the documents and left the country. Still, no response came.

Frowning, Isabella lifted her gaze, about to question Alexander directly.

A knock interrupted her thoughts. Henry's voice carried through the door. "Heard you weren't feeling well, Isabella. Better now?"

Alexander answered before she could. "Come in."

The door had been left slightly ajar from earlier comings and goings.

Henry stepped inside at Alexander's invitation. "Hey Alex."

"Henry."

His concerned eyes landed on Isabella. They weren't particularly close, and his awkwardness showed. She broke the silence first. "Much improved, thank you."

Henry scratched his neck. "Good. That's... good."

"Been a while since your last visit, hasn't it?" Isabella offered a polite smile.

"Yeah. Missed home cooking, so I flew back. Grandma mentioned your fever right after I landed."

Eleanor appeared moments later, visibly relieved at Isabella's improved color. "The broth's ready. Gregory says you can have some now. Would you prefer dining downstairs or shall I have Alexander bring it up?"

Isabella's appetite hadn't returned, but the room felt stifling. "I'll come down."

Descending the staircase, Henry noticed Sophia's absence. "Where's Soph?"

"Prior engagement. She'll have hers later."

Isabella settled at the dining table. Accepting the bowl from Richard, she blew gently across the steaming surface before taking slow sips.

Alexander took the adjacent seat. When his phone buzzed, he angled himself away subtly, fingers flying across the screen - clearly guarding his conversation.

Isabella observed silently over the rim of her bowl.

Eleanor's patience snapped. "Must you do that during meals?"

"Just a minute," Alexander muttered.

Isabella finished her broth swiftly.

"More?" Eleanor offered.

She declined with a headshake and stood. "No thank you."

Though Alexander shifted position, she'd already glimpsed Victoria's name on his screen. Project consultation, apparently.

Noticing her attention, he edged further away.

Isabella had already looked elsewhere. She retreated to the parlor, picking up the morning paper.

Henry reappeared shortly with a bowl of freshly washed berries. "Want some?"

She glanced up. "No, you enjoy them."

Alexander chose that moment to ascend the stairs, phone still glued to his hand.

She turned the page pointedly.

Henry settled beside her, stealing furtive glances until Isabella sighed. "What is it?"

"Look, I'm no genius like you and Alex. Got stuck on some physics problems." He rushed on before she could respond, "Asked my brother but he's busy. Told me to come to you instead."
###Chapter 157

Isabella paused briefly before taking Henry's test papers from him.

Henry had always been a bright student with solid fundamentals. She quickly scanned through the questions, offering him a few pointers. He grasped the concepts immediately.

"Wow, you're incredible! Thanks, Isabella!"

Once he understood, Henry casually crouched by the coffee table and started scribbling down his answers.

The moment he finished, he shoved the papers and pens aside. "Done! Now I can finally check my phone!"

Isabella smiled faintly, setting aside the newspaper she had nearly finished. Feeling slightly more energized, she decided to head upstairs to grab a book to pass the time.

Then Henry leaned in, lowering his voice. "My dream girl competed in another race recently, Isabella. She was even more amazing this time. I got the footage. Want to see?"

The smile on Isabella's face dimmed. "No, thanks. I'm not really into racing."

"Oh?"

Henry looked surprised. He'd brought it up because he thought she was interested. "You were watching the race through binoculars for so long that day. I assumed you liked it."

Isabella replied coolly, "I wasn't watching the race. Just some people I knew."

Seeing her clear disinterest, Henry dropped the subject. He turned back to Victoria's race replay, muttering to himself, "I heard she's skipping the next one. Shame. I was hoping to see her compete again. When will I get another chance if she's not racing this time?"

He sighed dramatically.

"I'm going upstairs for a book," Isabella interjected.

"Okay!" Henry beamed. "Glad you're feeling better, Isabella, but don't push yourself too hard!"

"Thanks. I won't."

Without another word, she stood and headed upstairs.

Alexander wasn't in the room when she returned.

She noticed the book he'd borrowed lying on the table. She picked it up and tucked it back into her bag.

She usually brought one or two books whenever she stayed overnight.

But she couldn't find the others in the room. Assuming they might be in Sophia's, she turned and walked toward her daughter's room.

Sophia hadn't closed the door.

Just as Isabella approached, Sophia's voice drifted out. "I'm so bored, Victoria! Stay and chat with me a little longer."

Isabella froze, leaning against the wall.

"Seriously," Sophia giggled. "Don't worry, Victoria. I'll make sure to have the soup ready!"

"Okay, bye, Victoria!"

She even blew kisses into the phone.

Sophia didn't leave her room immediately after hanging up.

Isabella's throat still ached from her illness. She coughed lightly before stepping into Sophia's room. Only then did Sophia finally look up.

She was sprawled across the bed, swinging her legs happily. When she spotted Isabella, she bounced up. "Mom? What are you doing here?"

"Looking for a book," Isabella replied flatly.

Sophia skipped over and grabbed her hand. "Nana said the soup's ready. Want to go downstairs together?"

Isabella pulled her hand away. "I've already had mine. If you haven't, go ahead."

Still riding the high from her call with Victoria, Sophia didn't notice anything off about Isabella's tone.

"Alright, I'll head down now!"

Isabella only gave a quiet hum in response.
###Chapter 158

Isabella found her book after Sophia had left. Clutching the novel, she settled by the large second-floor window and began reading.

Thirty minutes later, Eleanor arrived with a steaming bowl of herbal medicine. "There you are, dear."

Isabella set aside her book and accepted the bowl. "You didn't need to bring it up, Grandma. I would've come down if you'd called."

"You should rest, not exhaust yourself moving around."

Eleanor sat on the opposite couch, sighing. "I wanted to ask Alexander to bring this to you, but he's glued to his keyboard in the study. It's the weekend—what could possibly be so urgent?"

Earlier, Alexander had been guiding Victoria through some project details. Isabella assumed he'd retreated to the study for easier typing.

She remained silent, lifting the bowl to her lips.

The medicine had cooled slightly, and Isabella drank it in quick gulps. Eleanor frowned. "That's terribly bitter, darling. Slow down."

Isabella placed the empty bowl aside. "It's fine, really."

She rinsed her mouth with water, and Eleanor handed her a candy.

Isabella didn't take it.

Dinner was nearly ready, but since she'd already eaten, she returned to her book.

Eleanor headed downstairs.

Half an hour later, Eleanor and Sophia returned, their expressions tight.

"Alexander is going to the office at this hour? He'll work himself sick!" Eleanor snapped.

Isabella, absorbed in her reading, hadn't even heard the car leave.

If Alexander was leaving now, it must be related to Victoria's project. Sophia flopped onto Isabella's lap, pouting. "Dad wouldn't let me go with him."

Of course he wouldn't.

If he did, everyone at InnovaTech would discover he was married—and that he had a daughter Sophia's age.

Victoria would be humiliated.

Alexander would never allow that.

Isabella nudged Sophia away gently. "I'm still recovering, sweetheart. Sit somewhere else."

"Okay..."

Still feeling slightly unwell, Isabella washed up and went to bed by ten.

The next morning, she realized Alexander hadn't come home.

Thanks to Gregory, Isabella recovered quickly.

Eleanor insisted Gregory check on her again, and he prescribed two more doses. Isabella needed to return to work, and Eleanor couldn't dissuade her. Instead, she demanded Isabella return that evening for her medicine, claiming she couldn't brew it properly herself.

Seeing Eleanor's stubborn expression, Isabella reluctantly agreed.

Sophia begged Isabella to drive her to school, but Isabella refused. "Next time, sweetheart. I didn't bring my car."

Sophia grinned. "You can take Dad's! I'll call him—he'll say yes."

Without waiting for a response, Sophia dialed Alexander.

The call connected almost immediately.

Sophia nearly blurted out the responder's name—but caught Isabella's sharp gaze and swallowed the word.

"Never mind," Sophia muttered, hanging up.

She thought she'd hidden it well, but Isabella had caught it—the way Sophia had almost said Victoria's name.
###Chapter 159

The phone was answered by Victoria Kensington, unmistakably.

Sophia Whitmore shifted uncomfortably under Isabella Sinclair's gaze. "Mom, could you take me to school next time?"

Isabella nodded. "Okay."

Since Isabella and Henry Whitmore were heading in the same direction, they shared a ride.

Henry used the car ride to catch up on the morning studies he'd missed.

Noticing his hesitation on a few points, Isabella gently corrected him.

Henry gave her an impressed thumbs up. "Sharp memory, Isabella!"

They soon arrived at Henry's high school.

Isabella had graduated from the same institution years ago.

The familiar campus triggered a flood of nostalgic memories.

Her reminiscing was interrupted as Henry quickly exited the car. "Bye, Isabella!"

"See you."

The car merged back into the busy city traffic.

At YodaVision headquarters, Nathaniel Graves lightly pinched Isabella's cheek. "You look pale. Are you feeling unwell?"

"I had a fever yesterday."

"And you still came to work today?"

Isabella shrugged. "I'm much better now."

"I'm heading to InnovaTech. Want to come along?"

"Why not?" Isabella replied while reviewing test data.

"Alright, I'll wait for you."

"Okay."

Spotting discrepancies in two data sets, Isabella went to Dominic Vega for corrections.

Nathaniel appeared just as she was about to review documents on her desk. "Time to go."

At InnovaTech, they skipped formalities and dove straight into work.

After about an hour, when most tasks were completed, Maxwell Sterling handed them coffee.

Nathaniel took a sip. "This is excellent - richer than your usual brew. Your company perks keep improving."

Maxwell grinned mischievously. "All thanks to Ms. Kensington."

Nathaniel rolled his eyes.

Victoria again? he thought.

He set the cup down and glanced at Isabella.

"I'm thirsty," Isabella murmured, continuing to sip her coffee.

Nathaniel was speechless.

Maxwell couldn't resist gossiping. "Didn't Mr. Whitmore give Ms. Kensington full project control?"

Nathaniel nodded.

Maxwell continued, "It's her first major project, so she's anxious. Her team worked past 10 pm last night."

"I see," Nathaniel replied coldly.

"At least she's dedicated. She's not treating it like a game just because she's Mr. Whitmore's girlfriend."

Nathaniel scoffed. "Or maybe she lacks the skills and needs overtime to compensate?"

Maxwell understood the implication.

"People need time to improve, right?"

"Perhaps," Nathaniel said indifferently.

He glanced at Isabella. "When Isabella led her first major project here, she handled it with perfect composure from start to finish."

After several collaborations, Maxwell recognized Isabella's superior capabilities compared to Nathaniel's.

He believed Nathaniel's claim completely.

He added, "At least she has the right attitude. With that and Mr. Whitmore's support, she'll go far."
###Chapter 160

Maxwell let out a heavy sigh. "Victoria Kensington sure has all the luck, doesn't she?"

Without waiting for responses from Isabella and Nathaniel, Maxwell leaned closer and lowered his voice. "Even though Victoria's team pulled weekend shifts, the project barely moved forward. Last night around seven, Alexander Whitmore returned to the office to assist with the critical phase. That's when things finally started progressing."

He paused dramatically.

"Here's the kicker," Maxwell continued, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "Apparently, Alexander and Victoria stayed overnight in the upstairs office suite. They still haven't emerged this morning."

He shot Nathaniel a knowing look, eyebrows waggling suggestively.

Nathaniel immediately understood the implication.

Maxwell was clearly suggesting that after finishing work, Alexander and Victoria had... other activities upstairs.

Nathaniel's hands flew to cover Isabella's ears. "Good heavens, what am I hearing?"

Isabella had already caught every word. The ear-covering came far too late.

Besides, when Sophia had called Alexander earlier, it was Victoria who answered. That explained everything.

Just as Nathaniel opened his mouth to respond, Victoria materialized in the doorway.

Nathaniel dropped his hands with a scoff. "Haven't they surfaced yet?"

Maxwell spotted Victoria too and coughed awkwardly. "Ah, seems they have now."

Victoria looked exhausted but strangely radiant.

Between the overtime and whatever transpired upstairs with Alexander...

Maxwell abruptly found the ceiling fascinating.

Given the circumstances, her fatigue made perfect sense.

After nodding briefly at Nathaniel, Victoria joined her team's meeting.

Isabella and Nathaniel returned to work after their brief respite.

As lunchtime approached, they debated dining options.

That's when Alexander strode in.

His gaze flickered to Isabella before quickly darting away as he entered the meeting room where Victoria waited.

The team stood to greet him.

Victoria remained seated, smiling up at him. "You made it."

Alexander nodded. "Progress?"

"Much clearer now. The pieces are finally coming together."

"Good."

Victoria's lips curved. "All thanks to your assistance last night."

Alexander returned her smile. "My pleasure."

He addressed the team. "Appreciate everyone's hard work these past days. Lunch is on me later."

Excited murmurs rippled through Victoria's team, reinforcing the perks of working with her.

Then Victoria suggested, "Shall we invite Mr. Graves too?"

Meaning Nathaniel, Isabella, and Maxwell's entire team.

Though Alexander offered the meal, Victoria proposed expanding the guest list - the kind of suggestion typically made by someone in an intimate relationship.

"Fine by me," Alexander agreed easily.

With that, Victoria exited the meeting room and approached Nathaniel and Isabella.
###Chapter 161

Nathaniel's face lit up with a smile as he immediately greeted Isabella. "Ms. Sinclair."

Isabella smiled and nodded before turning to both him and Maxwell. "Alexander is treating my team to dinner. Would Mr. Graves and Mr. Sterling care to join us?"

She deliberately ignored Victoria.

Maxwell was eager to accept, but he glanced at Nathaniel and Victoria first.

Nathaniel declined without hesitation. "Ms. Sinclair, we appreciate the invitation, but we already have plans."

Isabella frowned. "Mr. Graves—" She hadn’t expected him to remain so firm despite her repeated attempts.

Her gaze flickered toward Victoria, who sat nearby, sipping water.

Victoria met her eyes with a cold stare.

Isabella quickly looked away.

What did Victoria have that made Nathaniel so loyal? Beauty alone couldn’t compare to her own brilliance.

Since Nathaniel refused, Isabella maintained her polite smile. "Another time, then." Without another glance at Victoria or Maxwell, she turned and left.

Maxwell exhaled sharply. "Ms. Sinclair can be quite dismissive."

Isabella had every reason to be confident, but even Alexander, the true head of InnovaTech, treated employees with respect.

Nathaniel shrugged. "I noticed."

Isabella carried herself like she already owned the company. Even without Alexander’s backing, her arrogance was palpable.

Not long after, Alexander—likely informed by Isabella—approached them.

He shook Nathaniel’s hand courteously. "We’re heading out now. Mr. Graves, I hope you’ll join us next time."

Nathaniel hesitated briefly. "Of course."

Alexander smiled, gave Victoria a fleeting glance, then left with Isabella and her team waiting at the entrance.

After lunch, Victoria and Nathaniel returned to InnovaTech.

Isabella’s team didn’t return until much later.

By 6:00 PM, Victoria and Nathaniel wrapped up their work. There was still plenty to handle, but they had time over the next few days. No rush.

Isabella’s team, however, showed no signs of stopping.

Maxwell remarked, "I heard they’re planning to work overtime tonight."

Nathaniel replied, "Hmm."

Victoria said, "Let’s go."

Nathaniel chuckled. "Let me treat you to dinner."

She shook her head. "No need. I have other plans."

Eleanor had asked her to return to Whitmore Manor for dinner.

When she arrived, Alexander and Sophia were already home.

She hadn’t expected Alexander to be back—she’d assumed he’d stay at the office with Isabella.

Alexander barely glanced up from his laptop when she entered.

During dinner, he sat beside her, absorbed in his phone.

Victoria suddenly spoke. "Do you have a moment? There’s something I need to discuss with you."
###Chapter 162

Alexander didn't glance up from his phone as he muttered, "Fine."

Hearing his agreement, Isabella felt a weight lift from her shoulders.

Eleanor was chatting with the housekeeper and missed their exchange, but seeing them engaged in conversation, she beamed with satisfaction.

After dinner, Eleanor had someone bring Isabella's herbal medicine.

Alexander excused himself to take a call in the dining room.

Isabella had just finished her medicine and stepped out when she heard the roar of an engine outside.

She froze. Was he leaving?

"Where's he off to?"

Eleanor huffed in irritation. "Who knows? He rushed out like the house was on fire."

Isabella's brow furrowed. Was he running to Innovatech to rescue Victoria again? But he'd promised to talk tonight.

She hoped he'd return. He didn't.

Innovatech had been chaotic lately.

After breakfast at Whitmore Manor, Isabella met Nathaniel at Innovatech's entrance. Victoria's team was already there.

"You're here early," Nathaniel remarked. "Didn't you pull an all-nighter?"

Henry chuckled. "Deadlines wait for no one. They came straight from the lab."

Nathaniel didn't press further. Isabella focused on her work.

An hour later, as she headed to the restroom, Alexander arrived—but not for Victoria.

After a distant nod to Victoria, he strode toward them.

"Mr. Whitmore," Nathaniel said coolly. "What can we do for you?"

Alexander folded his arms. "I reviewed your system. Impressive work. I have some enhancements to discuss."

Nathaniel glanced at Isabella before responding, "We're listening."

Isabella hesitated. "Excuse me, I need the restroom. You two go ahead."

Both men nodded.

On her way back, she was steps away when a shriek pierced the air from the conference room.

"Ms. Kensington!"

Chaos erupted.

Isabella turned just as Alexander's face went pale.

He barreled past her, his shoulder slamming into hers with enough force to send her stumbling. Pain radiated through her collarbone.

Nathaniel caught her. "You okay?"

Clutching her shoulder, she whispered, "Fine."

Across the room, Alexander swept Victoria into his arms and vanished.

Henry blinked. "What happened to Ms. Kensington?"

"Fainted," Victor muttered. "Probably exhaustion."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. Watching Alexander prioritize Victoria over noticing he'd nearly knocked Isabella over made his blood boil. "She's not dying!"

Henry winced. "Mr. Whitmore was just concerned—"

"Shut it," Nathaniel snapped.

Henry clamped his mouth shut.

Isabella touched Nathaniel's arm. "Really, I'm fine. It barely hurts now."

Nathaniel studied her. "Want to go home?"

She shook her head. "I'm not made of glass. Let's work."

"Alright." He hesitated. "It's been months. Why hasn't Alexander signed the divorce papers?"

Isabella sighed. "I wish I knew."

Last night, she'd planned to ask him—when they'd finally end this farce.

He'd left. Forgotten. Again.

Nathaniel gritted his teeth. "Get it done."

"I will."

At lunch, Victor informed them Victoria was resting at home—with Alexander.

Isabella still hadn't finished her herbs. That evening, she returned to Whitmore Manor.

Alexander didn't come home.

She called. No answer.

The next morning, after handling YodaVision business, they returned to Innovatech. By afternoon, their work there would be done.

"Never coming back," Nathaniel declared in the car. "I refuse to be treated like this."

Isabella laughed. "Deal."

Victoria was back at work, busy as ever. Neither cared. They just wanted out.

By 5 PM, they were done.

In the lobby, the elevator doors opened to reveal Alexander and Victoria.

Alexander approached. "The system's flawless. Excellent work, Mr. Graves."

Nathaniel's smile didn't reach his eyes. "Just doing my job."

"I hope we collaborate again."

"Flattered," Nathaniel lied. Innovatech was already blacklisted.

As they walked to the parking garage, Alexander started to speak—

A figure lunged from the shadows, blade glinting—
###Chapter 163.

The blade came at him without warning.

Isabella and Nathaniel were about to depart when it happened.

Isabella's breath caught in her throat as realization struck. "Alexander, move!"

She was too far to intervene, but Victoria acted with lightning reflexes. She pushed him aside just as the knife found its mark - burying deep in her chest instead.

The coppery tang of blood filled the air instantly.

Security subdued the attacker within seconds.

Alexander's face drained of color as he gathered the bleeding Victoria into his arms. Tires screeched as the car vanished down the driveway before Isabella could blink.

Nathaniel pulled at her sleeve. "We should go."

Isabella nodded numbly. "Right."

Two nights passed at Whitmore Manor without Alexander's return. Sophia had clearly heard about Victoria's injury too - the girl had slipped out unnoticed.

Isabella's herbal medicine supply dwindled to its final batch.

On Friday, she planned to take her dose and leave immediately after.

But fate had other plans. Alexander was home.

She hesitated briefly, then remembered their pending divorce and headed upstairs.

Alexander waited in the second-floor lounge with Oliver Westbrook present.

"You're back," Alexander spoke first.

Isabella acknowledged with a hum. She had no interest in Victoria's condition.

"I was saying the other day-" she began.

Alexander cut her off, sliding a document across the table. "Review this. Sign if you agree."
###Chapter 164

Isabella picked up the document. The words "Divorce Agreement" stared back at her in bold letters.

The first clause granted Alexander full custody of Sophia. Pages of asset divisions followed, detailing everything he was offering her.

She'd been meaning to ask about their divorce proceedings.

Now, skimming through the papers without reading thoroughly, she slid them back across the table. "I have no objections."

Her hand reached into her purse for a pen.

When Isabella had married Alexander, her methods hadn't been entirely ethical.

Though neither Alexander nor Oliver thought highly of her, they'd witnessed her devotion to him over the years.

Given her deep love, Oliver expected tears, protests - anything but this calm acceptance.

Yet here she was, not even contesting custody of their daughter.

Oliver turned to Alexander, stunned.

Alexander's dark eyes studied Isabella, his expression inscrutable. Clearly, he hadn't anticipated this either.

Just as her pen touched paper, Isabella hesitated. She withdrew it.

Oliver smirked. Here it comes-

"I'll have my lawyer review this tomorrow," she said. "If everything checks out, I'll sign within two days and have them contact you."

The agreement listed generous assets, including shares from Alexander's company.

Her initial divorce proposal had asked for nothing.

But now that he offered, she wouldn't refuse. Their marriage might have been loveless, but he'd never sabotaged her.

Still, she hesitated.

Potential loopholes worried her.

If his company faced trouble later, those shares could make her a scapegoat.

Alexander might not intend harm now, but she couldn't trust Victoria not to exploit any vulnerabilities.

Alexander seemed taken aback by her caution. After a pause, he nodded. "Fine."

Isabella tucked the papers into her bag, zipped it shut, and left without another word.

Oliver stared after her. "Is she sick?"

Alexander watched until she disappeared down the hall. "I don't know."

"She didn't even blink about Sophia. That's not normal."

A muscle twitched in Alexander's jaw. "Hmm."

"Does she not want custody? Impossible! Sophia's her entire world!"

Suddenly, Oliver's eyes narrowed. "Wait - did you two already discuss this privately?"

Alexander's expression darkened. "No. We never spoke about it."

"Then what the hell just happened?"
###Chapter 165

Oliver was beginning to question everything he knew.

Just then, Eleanor stepped out of the elevator. "Dinner's ready," she announced. "Isabella has already gone down with Sophia. Why are you two still up here? Come join us."

The words snapped Oliver back to reality. "Right. Coming."

Alexander rose beside him.

Downstairs, Sophia was curled up on the sofa, chatting animatedly with Isabella, who listened with quiet attention. The scene radiated maternal warmth.

Yet knowing Isabella had surrendered custody without protest made the moment feel disturbingly artificial.

Unaware of the divorce, Eleanor smiled at them. "Isabella, Sophia, come eat."

"Okay," they responded in unison.

Sophia grabbed Isabella's hand, leading her toward the dining room with childish enthusiasm.

Oliver watched silently before taking his seat beside Alexander. Isabella settled next to Sophia.

Eleanor beamed at Oliver. "It's been too long since your last visit. I had the kitchen prepare your favorites—you'd better eat well tonight."

Oliver flashed a grin. "Don't worry, Grandma. I plan to devour everything."

Eleanor chuckled while Isabella meticulously removed fish bones for Sophia.

Superficially, nothing seemed amiss.

But—

Oliver couldn't shake his unease.

Noticing his stare, Isabella shot him an icy glare that froze him mid-thought.

Before, despite Alexander, Julian and himself forming an impenetrable trio, Isabella had persistently tried to ingratiate herself—awkward but determined, always greeting them with forced smiles.

Now her eyes held nothing but detached indifference. The realization hit him—her demeanor toward Sophia had shifted too.

Outwardly attentive, but the deep maternal warmth was gone. Only clinical precision remained.

He understood her coldness toward him—no one keeps courting rejection. But her own daughter? Impossible.

This had to be another scheme. Some reverse psychology play to recapture Alexander's attention.

Glancing at Alexander confirmed his theory—the man was watching Isabella with unprecedented focus. The old Alexander would never.

Oliver smirked. Just as he suspected.

Eleanor cleared her throat sharply. "Oliver, what exactly are you staring at?" Her frown indicated she'd noticed his lingering gaze.

Quickly, Oliver fed her the explanation she wanted to hear: "Isabella's unusually quiet tonight. Not even speaking to Alexander like before. I found it strange."
###Chapter 166

Eleanor Whitmore had also observed Isabella Sinclair's growing distance toward Alexander Whitmore.

She sighed deeply, shooting Alexander a reproachful look. This is entirely your fault!

Isabella had pursued him relentlessly for so long. How could he remain unresponsive? Was it any wonder she'd eventually withdraw?

Alexander merely offered a faint smile, remaining silent.

Isabella kept her own silence, continuing her meal without reaction even after hearing this conversation.

Before dinner concluded, Alexander's phone rang. He glanced at the screen, excused himself, and stepped away to answer.

His return came swiftly.

After the meal, he informed Eleanor, "I have urgent matters to attend to. I'll take my leave now."

Sophia Whitmore, sharp as ever, guessed the call likely came from Victoria Kensington. Eager to visit the hospital herself, she chimed in, "Daddy, I want to come too."

"Very well."

Eleanor added, "Take Isabella along. Tomorrow's Saturday - perfect for some family time."

Only then did Isabella speak. "Grandmother, I have prior arrangements with a friend tomorrow."

Eleanor hesitated. "I see."

Sophia had been anxious about Isabella joining them. Hearing this refusal, relief washed over her. As they entered the car, she called out, "Goodbye, Mother."

Isabella replied evenly, "Goodbye."

The car door shut. Moments later, Alexander's vehicle disappeared down the driveway.

Isabella entered her own car. Once clear of Whitmore Manor, she placed a call to Nathaniel Graves while driving.

She wasted no words when he answered. "I'm divorcing Alexander. He's presented me with an agreement including asset division. I need a lawyer to scrutinize it for loopholes."

Nathaniel, mid-bite during dinner, nearly choked.

Ecstatic, he responded immediately, "I'll secure you the best legal counsel at once!"

Isabella chuckled. "Excellent." Ending the call, she continued homeward.

Meanwhile at the hospital, Sophia and Alexander remained in Victoria's room, engaged in conversation.

Oliver Westbrook had excused himself to the hallway. He dialed Julian Montgomery. "Alexander's proceeding with the divorce."

Julian, currently traveling, froze mid-step. "What?"

After a beat, he demanded, "You're certain?"

"Absolutely. I witnessed it myself. No room for doubt." Oliver added, "And Alexander isn't granting her custody of Sophia either."

Julian's grip on his phone turned white-knuckled.

Oliver continued, "But—" Before he could finish, Julian interrupted.

"I have urgent matters. Need to make a call." He disconnected without waiting for response.

"What's so pressing?" Oliver muttered to himself.

Julian had already located Isabella's contact. He hesitated briefly before placing the call.

Isabella had just arrived home when his call came through. Answering casually, she inquired, "Mr. Montgomery, what can I do for you?"

"You—" He wanted to ask about her and Alexander, but recognized his position made such inquiries inappropriate.

Even a simple "Are you alright?" felt beyond his right to ask.

Assuming he called regarding Lily Montgomery, Isabella preempted him. "If this concerns meeting Lily, I'm unavailable tomorrow. Perhaps the following day or next week would work?"
###Chapter 167

Nathaniel had just called to inform her about the lawyer he arranged. Their meeting was scheduled for tomorrow morning.

Isabella needed this divorce finalized immediately.

Julian knew she misunderstood his intentions, but he didn't correct her. "Understood," was all he said.

When the silence stretched, Isabella assumed he'd hang up. "Mr. Montgomery," she asked, perplexed, "was there something else?"

Her voice held no trace of the anguish Julian expected - no sorrow, no turmoil. Just calm detachment.

Could she truly be this unaffected? Or was she masking her pain?

"Mr. Montgomery?" she prompted after three seconds of silence. "Are you still there?"

Julian snapped back to reality. "Yes."

"If there's nothing else," Isabella continued briskly, "I have work to attend to." Without waiting for response, she added, "Goodbye."

Left with no choice, Julian muttered, "Very well."

The line went dead before he finished speaking.

Frederick had expressed interest in her latest research proposal days ago. He'd asked her to compile her findings for journal submission.

Between InnovaTech and YodaVision commitments, she'd made little progress. Now with unexpected free time, she opened her laptop determinedly.

Julian immediately called Oliver back. "Alexander wants full custody of Sophia in the divorce. She must be contesting it?"

Oliver had called precisely about this development. "That's the thing - she's not! Signed everything without argument. Completely calm about it - unnaturally so."

This wasn't the Isabella they knew. Julian struggled to reconcile this behavior with the woman who'd loved Alexander since adolescence.

"Maybe it's a ploy?" Oliver speculated. "Playing on his guilt?"

Julian couldn't dismiss the possibility. Not with Isabella's history.

"How did Alexander react?" Julian asked after a pause.

"Shocked. At dinner, he kept watching her more than usual." Oliver chuckled darkly. "If I'm right, she's playing chess while we're playing checkers."

"Or," Julian countered, "she genuinely wants out."

Oliver snorted. "After fifteen years? Impossible."

"People change," Julian murmured.

"Not that much," Oliver insisted. "Anyway, this works in Alexander's favor. When you return and Victoria recovers, we should celebrate."

Only then did he notice Julian's unusual silence.
###Chapter 168

Julian's voice came through the phone. "Oliver? Are you busy?"

"Not at all."

There was a brief pause before Julian continued. "Right—you're coming back on Tuesday?"

A noncommittal hum was all Julian received in response. Before he could say more, Julian took charge of the conversation. "Let's leave it at that for now. Just let me know when you land. I'll pick you up so you can see Victoria."

"Fine," Julian agreed.

The next morning, Isabella rose early for her usual routine. A brisk thirty-minute run through the quiet streets of Salzburg cleared her mind before she returned for breakfast.

By the time she arrived at the law firm, Nathaniel was already waiting.

He lifted a hand in greeting when she walked in.

Jonathan Blackwood, the attorney Nathaniel had recommended, sat across from her. As she settled into her seat, his assistant poured her a cup of steaming tea.

Without preamble, Isabella slid the divorce agreement across the polished mahogany table.

Jonathan accepted it, and Nathaniel—who had known him for years—leaned in to skim the contents.

His eyebrows shot up at the first clause regarding Sophia's custody. His gaze flicked to Isabella, searching.

He remembered Sophia from years ago. Back then, Isabella had spoken of her daughter with nothing but adoration. Every conversation had revolved around the little girl.

But since her decision to leave Alexander and return to YodaVision, Sophia's name had never crossed Isabella's lips again.

Nathaniel had already pieced it together. During Sophia's time abroad with Alexander, she must have grown attached to Victoria—or worse, done something unforgivable.

The fact that Isabella hadn't even mentioned custody in her demands told him everything.

He didn't press. Isabella was gentle, but her emotions ran deep.

For her to willingly let go of her own child meant she had been pushed beyond her limits.

With that realization, he turned his attention back to the document.

A low whistle escaped him moments later. "This much real estate? Damn, Alexander isn't holding back."

Isabella sipped her tea, silent.

Nathaniel flipped through a few more pages before leaving Jonathan to his work. Instead, he shifted closer to Isabella, engaging her in a hushed discussion about her latest research paper.

Their conversation was a rapid exchange of technical terms and theories, leaving Jonathan's assistant utterly lost.

Jonathan, however, remained focused, meticulously reviewing every line of the agreement.

An hour later, he finally looked up. "I've gone through everything. There are no issues here—in fact, it's overwhelmingly in your favor."

Isabella stilled. "Explain."

"The cash settlement is straightforward. The properties listed have no ownership disputes," Jonathan clarified.

"As for the company shares Alexander is transferring to you, the agreement explicitly states you're only entitled to annual dividends. Any legal liabilities, compensations, or obligations fall solely on him. You're completely protected."

Isabella blinked, momentarily stunned.

Nathaniel, however, nearly choked on his coffee. "You're sure you read that right? Alexander Whitmore being this generous?"

Jonathan smirked. "Are you questioning my expertise, Nathaniel?"

"Not at all," Nathaniel muttered. "It's just... hard to believe."

Isabella recovered quickly.

Throughout their marriage, Alexander had been distant, offering her neither warmth nor support.

But she knew him well enough to understand one thing—if he decided to give something, he ensured it came without strings attached.

That was why she'd wanted the agreement reviewed. Not because she distrusted him, but because she needed to be certain there were no hidden pitfalls.
###Chapter 169

Isabella's voice remained steady. "As long as everything's in order, that's all that matters."

Without hesitation, she picked up the pen and signed her name with a swift stroke.

She turned to Jonathan. "I'll leave the rest of the divorce proceedings in your hands, Mr. Blackwood."

Jonathan gave a brief nod. "I have a meeting shortly, but this afternoon, I'll reach out to Mr. Whitmore to finalize the next steps."

"Alright."

It was nearly lunchtime. After sharing a meal with Jonathan, Isabella and Nathaniel returned to her apartment to continue working on her research paper.

Meanwhile, at Whitmore Group, Alexander had just settled into his office when his phone rang.

He answered distractedly. "Who is this?"

"Good afternoon, Mr. Whitmore. This is Jonathan Blackwood, Ms. Sinclair's attorney. She's signed the divorce agreement and has authorized me to handle the remaining formalities. Would now be a convenient time to discuss?"

Alexander paused, then lowered his gaze. "I have back-to-back meetings this afternoon. Come to Whitmore Group tomorrow morning at ten."

"Understood. Thank you for your cooperation, Mr. Whitmore. Goodbye."

The call ended, and Alexander returned to his documents.

That evening, Nathaniel left Isabella's apartment to attend to other matters.

Isabella had plans to dine at the Sinclair residence, so she grabbed her bag and headed out.

Just as she slid into her car, her phone buzzed—Sophia. She didn’t need to guess why Sophia was calling.

Not in the mood, Isabella ignored it.

Sophia tried twice more before giving up.

By the time Isabella reached the gated community, it was peak traffic hours.

She stopped her car, waiting behind other residents for the automated system to scan their vehicles.

Then, a knock on her window.

She turned.

Julian.

Her breath hitched. She hadn’t expected to see him here. Slowly, she rolled down the window. "Mr. Montgomery."

His gaze lingered on her face, searching for signs of exhaustion or distress—but found none.

A beat of silence.

Isabella broke it first. "Did you need something?"

He shrugged. "I had business in the area. Saw your car and thought I'd say hello."

They weren’t close enough for that.

But he had helped her before. And she’d be seeing him again soon with Lily.

No need to make it awkward. She nodded. "Well, then—"

Before she could finish, Julian cut in. "I heard there’s a famous bakery nearby. I’m not familiar with this area—couldn’t find it. Do you know where it is?"

No reason to doubt him. "There is, but it's not here. About a mile down on the next street."

She pointed the way.

Julian smiled. "Got it. Thanks."

"No problem." The gate lifted for her car. As she pulled forward, she said, "Goodbye."

"Goodbye."
###Chapter 170

Julian actually knew where the bakery was.

After Isabella left, he didn't go there immediately.

He got into his car, hesitated, then dialed a number. "Oliver, I'm back. Got another flight later, but I want to see Victoria at the hospital before I leave. Check if Alexander's free. If not, come with me."

Oliver sounded shocked. "You're back? When did you arrive?"

Julian ignored the question. "Call Victoria first. See if she's available."

Oliver almost asked why Julian wasn't calling Alexander or Victoria himself, but stopped. Julian must be in a hurry.

Since he hadn't visited Victoria either, he agreed without further questions. Alexander wasn't available. After hanging up, Julian bought flowers and a fruit basket before heading to the hospital to meet Oliver.

Inside the hospital room, Victoria smiled when she saw Julian. "What brings you back so suddenly?"

"Had some business to handle," Julian replied coolly.

Victoria looked down, fingers brushing the petals of the flowers he'd brought. "I see..."

Was it really just business? Or had he come specifically to see her?

He hadn't rushed back immediately after her injury, but the fact that he came as soon as he could still meant something.

That night, Isabella stayed at the Sinclair residence.

She woke early the next morning. The healthy plants on her windowsill caught her eye as she stretched lazily, feeling unusually cheerful.

Downstairs, Caroline was already preparing breakfast for her, William, and Edward.

"You're in good spirits today," Caroline observed with a smile when Isabella entered the kitchen.

Isabella helped knead the dough. "Yeah, feeling great."

Freshly steamed buns were soon ready. Just as she sat down to eat, her phone rang.

Sophia again.

She ignored it. The phone rang once more.

Isabella turned it off completely and focused on her meal.

When her calls stopped going through, Sophia pouted and went to find Alexander in the master bedroom.

Alexander had just finished his morning run and was about to shower when he saw her sulking. "What's wrong?"

"I called Mom yesterday wanting her to come home and cook for me, but she didn't answer. Just tried twice more and still nothing. Then it said her number was unavailable."

"Probably turned her phone off," Alexander said.

Sophia frowned. "Battery dead?"

Alexander neither confirmed nor denied. "Maybe."

"What do I do? I wanted to go skiing today. Mom promised she'd take me if she had time."

Originally, she hadn't felt like going because Victoria was injured and she wanted to stay at the hospital.

But hospitals were full of germs, and everyone discouraged frequent visits. Now that Victoria was improving, she wasn't as worried.

With free time and no one to go with, she naturally thought of her mother. But her mother wasn't answering.

"Try again later. She'll probably turn it back on."

Sophia sighed. "Okay..."

Isabella didn't plan to keep her phone off all day. She still needed to discuss things with Nathaniel.

And Jonathan might contact her later too.

About thirty minutes later, she turned her phone back on.

Almost immediately, Sophia called again.

Isabella opened her laptop, ignored the call, and continued working on her research paper.

Seeing her mother still wasn't answering and Alexander was about to leave, Sophia said, "Dad, Mom still isn't picking up. Will you call her for me?"
###Chapter 171

Alexander didn't speak. He simply dialed Isabella's number on his phone.

Isabella saw the call and rejected it immediately.

Alexander paused. "Your mother isn't answering my calls either."

"She must be busy." Sophia frowned. There was no way Isabella would ignore Alexander's call otherwise.

"Perhaps." Alexander shrugged on his suit jacket and grabbed a cashmere coat. "I'm leaving. If you want to go out, take the bodyguards."

"But I want Mom to come with me..." Even though she hated when Isabella scolded her, Sophia still craved her company sometimes.

She pouted. "Dad, are you going to the hospital to see Victoria? Or straight to the office?"

"Hospital first, then office." Alexander tapped her forehead lightly. "Behave yourself."

She tried calling Isabella twice more with no success. Reluctantly, she went out with Margaret and the bodyguards.

Without Isabella's company, even skiing felt dull. Sophia quickly grew bored and returned home.

After leaving the hospital, Alexander headed to Whitmore Corporation.

Oliver arrived shortly after. Alexander gave him a look. Oliver grinned. "I came to watch the show."

Before Alexander could respond, Daniel approached. "Mr. Blackwood is here."

"Send him up," Alexander ordered.

Jonathan Blackwood entered the conference room, guided by Daniel.

Alexander shook his hand. "Have a seat."

Jonathan wasted no time. He produced the signed divorce papers from yesterday and slid them across the table.

Alexander took them.

Since it was Saturday, Oliver had come specifically to see if Isabella would actually sign. Spotting her signature, he whistled. "She really signed?"

Alexander glanced at the signature without reaction and continued discussing matters with Jonathan.

As their conversation concluded, Alexander said, "There are substantial assets involved—properties, shares, and more. I'll need time to arrange the transfers. I'll contact you when everything's settled."

Jonathan nodded. "Understood."

Alexander turned to Daniel. "See Mr. Blackwood out."

After leaving Whitmore Corporation, Jonathan updated Isabella.

She frowned. "How long will this take?"

"That depends on Mr. Whitmore's progress."

"I see." Isabella said, "Thank you, Mr. Blackwood."

The next day, she went to work at YodaVision as usual.

That afternoon, while discussing a project with Nathaniel, his phone rang. Nathaniel frowned at the caller ID.

Isabella asked, "What's wrong?"

He showed her the screen. "Dominic Fairchild."

Everyone in the industry knew each other. Though they rarely interacted, they at least exchanged contacts.

After their initial encounter at InnovaTech, Nathaniel hadn't expected further dealings with Dominic.

So why was he calling now? Puzzled, Nathaniel answered.

After hanging up, he turned to Isabella. "He wants to collaborate on a new project."

The two projects Isabella led had gained significant attention, with confirmed government cooperation forthcoming.

Given this promising trajectory, it was inevitable that partners would come knocking at YodaVision's door.

The news hadn't even broken yet, and Dominic had already made his move.

Nathaniel smirked. "Richard Fairchild's son is just as cunning as his father."
###Chapter 172

Nathaniel understood Richard Fairchild's position perfectly.

Giving his own people first-hand information was just how the elite operated. He'd seen it all before.

His jaw tightened. "We do need partners for expansion, but I can't stand Dominic Fairchild."

Isabella knew why. Dominic had always favored Victoria Kensington. But she didn't care.

Her voice remained steady. "The project comes first. Maximizing our benefits is the priority. Personal feelings are irrelevant."

She'd met Richard once. Ambitious, yes—but Frederick Aldridge trusted him, and that was enough.

Nathaniel exhaled sharply. "I know. Just venting."

A smirk tugged at his lips. "Still, we've got time before officially seeking investors. Let him sweat a little longer."

Isabella chuckled. "Fine. Whatever makes you happy."

After Dominic's call, they returned to work. But thirty minutes later, Nathaniel's phone buzzed again.

His expression shifted—disdain mixed with satisfaction.

Isabella raised a brow. "Who is it?"

"Julian Montgomery."

"Another collaboration offer?"

"Most likely."

Like Dominic, Nathaniel rarely interacted with Julian, Oliver Westbrook, and their circle. A sudden call meant only one thing.

The Montgomery family, like the Fairchilds, had deep political and military ties.

They always knew things before anyone else.

Nathaniel glanced at Isabella. "Should I answer?"

As Alexander Whitmore's wife, Isabella had never been accepted by Julian. He'd embraced Victoria, the mistress, instead.

To Nathaniel, Julian was worse than Dominic.

"Answer it," Isabella said. She wouldn't let pettiness interfere with business.

He picked up.

As predicted, Julian proposed a partnership.

After hearing him out, Nathaniel replied coolly, "I appreciate the offer, Mr. Montgomery, but we're still in early development. My schedule is packed. Perhaps another time."

"What about Thursday?"

"Unlikely. If that changes, I'll contact you."

Julian knew YodaVision's projects were in high demand. Nathaniel had no shortage of suitors.

"Very well. I'll await your call."

The moment the call ended, Nathaniel slammed his palm on the desk, laughing. "That felt good."

Isabella smiled.

But his laughter faded abruptly. He studied her. "Do you think Alexander might reach out too?"

YodaVision and InnovaTech were competitors—but collaboration wasn't impossible. These new projects had overlapping interests.

Isabella's tone was calm. "I don't know. Focus on the project. Personal issues don't matter."

"Right." A little attitude was fine, but business came first.

Secretly, Nathaniel hoped Alexander would call. But the phone remained silent.

Instead, more collaboration offers poured in—none from Alexander.

Then, just before leaving, an unknown number flashed on his screen. He answered.

"Mr. Graves? This is Reginald Kensington. Victoria's father."

Nathaniel froze. He pulled the phone away. "It's Reginald."

Isabella met his gaze silently.

He understood.

With others, they could set grudges aside. But the Kensingtons? Never.

He forced a smile, voice icy. "Mr. Kensington. What can I do for you?"

Predictably, Reginald wanted in. Nathaniel gave a diplomatic refusal and hung up.

He scoffed. "Dominic and Julian hearing about this first makes sense—they're connected. But the Kensingtons? How?"

The Kensingtons were outsiders in Salzburg. If they knew this soon, someone had tipped them off.

Likely Alexander or Julian—both close to Victoria.

Nathaniel's mood soured.

But he knew Isabella felt worse.

"Come on," he said, forcing cheer. "Your senior's treating you to dinner. My treat!"

Truthfully, Isabella wasn't as upset as he thought. She'd made peace with these people long ago.

This time, she held the power.

But free food? Never a refusal.

She smiled. "Thanks."

They walked out together.
###Chapter 173

The moment Isabella Sinclair spotted the Kensington and Fairchild families entering the restaurant, her face remained an unreadable mask.

Nathaniel Graves muttered under his breath, "Fate has a twisted sense of humor."

The Kensington clan visibly brightened at the sight of Nathaniel.

Reginald Kensington approached with an ingratiating smile. "Mr. Graves, what an unexpected pleasure."

Nathaniel responded with minimal courtesy. "Indeed."

Reginald pressed on, "Since we've crossed paths, perhaps we could share a meal together?"

Earlier phone conversations had already revealed Reginald's eagerness to court Nathaniel's favor. This chance encounter seemed like divine intervention to him.

Nathaniel's refusal was polite but firm. "Another time. This is a private engagement."

Disappointment flashed across Reginald's face before he recovered. "Of course. Another time then."

With a curt nod to Isabella, Nathaniel signaled their departure. "Shall we?"

Isabella fell into step beside him, deliberately avoiding eye contact with the Kensington entourage.

As they ascended the staircase, Beatrice Kensington frowned. "Victoria mentioned Nathaniel's been keeping her at arm's length because of Isabella. Do you think he'll block our bid for the VisionTech project?"

Given Nathaniel's frosty demeanor, the concern seemed valid.

Eleanor Kensington offered measured optimism. "The VisionTech tender hasn't closed yet. Nothing's decided."

Lawrence Kensington chuckled. "Exactly. Look at Alexander and Victoria - everyone thought Eleanor Whitmore would prevent their relationship, but now the divorce is happening regardless. Miracles do occur."

He referred, of course, to Alexander Whitmore's impending separation from Isabella.

Diana Kensington's face lit up at the reminder. "Alexander's wanted this divorce for ages. Now that Victoria nearly died saving him, he's finally standing up to his grandmother. His devotion is touching."

"Victoria's patience is finally being rewarded," Eleanor agreed. "Her happiness is assured."

The group shared satisfied smiles.

Then Diana's expression darkened as she glanced toward the departed couple. "But what if Isabella refuses to sign? She clearly doesn't want this divorce."

Beatrice waved away the concern. "Alexander makes his own decisions. He was only waiting for the right moment to avoid upsetting Eleanor Whitmore."

"His mind's made up," Lawrence added. "Especially after Victoria's sacrifice. He won't let her suffer any longer."

Diana remained uneasy. "I still worry Isabella might create complications. Perhaps someone should... speak with her."

This suggestion hung in the air as the group exchanged meaningful glances.

Upstairs, Nathaniel and Isabella stepped off the elevator only to encounter three imposing figures approaching.

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "What cosmic joke is this today?" he muttered under his breath.

Isabella studied the trio - Dominic Fairchild accompanied by two others, one of whom looked vaguely familiar yet unplaceable.

The men greeted Nathaniel with forced cheer. "Nathaniel! Small world."

Nathaniel manufactured a smile. "Remarkably so."

Dominic had actually called earlier hoping to arrange a business dinner. Seizing this unexpected opportunity, he gestured expansively. "Since we're all here-"

Simon Fairchild chimed in, "It's been ages since we shared a meal."

Nathaniel's refusal was immediate. "Not tonight. Prior engagements."

His gaze shifted to the third man. "Sebastian. Didn't expect to see you here."

Sebastian Ashford's chiseled features remained impassive. "Taking personal days."

Nathaniel nodded curtly before steering Isabella away. "We'll reschedule."

Sebastian acknowledged this with a silent nod.

Once inside their private dining room, Simon sipped his whiskey thoughtfully. "Nathaniel's star keeps rising. Those two projects could make him unstoppable."

Sebastian's response was characteristically blunt. "He was Zachary Aldridge's protégé. His research aligned perfectly with market needs. Success was inevitable."

Then he turned to Dominic. "Simon mentioned you once pursued the woman with Nathaniel. Yet now you won't even look at her. What changed?"

Dominic's jaw tightened at the reminder of his past infatuation with Isabella. The memory clearly rankled. "Drop it," he snapped. "Let's order."

With a shrug, Sebastian let the matter rest.
###Chapter 174

The Grandeur was buzzing with activity that evening.

After their dinner, Isabella and Nathaniel returned to the headquarters to continue their work.

On Wednesday morning, during an important strategy meeting, Nathaniel's assistant interrupted to announce Julian Montgomery's unexpected arrival.

Nathaniel didn't need to guess the purpose of this unannounced visit.

Given Julian's influential position in the business world, ignoring him wasn't an option.

Nathaniel turned to Isabella. "You handle the rest of this meeting. I'll go see what he wants."

"Of course."

When Nathaniel entered the reception area, Julian was already seated comfortably.

Noticing Nathaniel's solitary entrance, Julian's piercing gaze flickered briefly. He stood gracefully and extended his hand. "My apologies for dropping by unannounced, Mr. Graves."

Nathaniel forced a polite smile. "No need for apologies, Mr. Montgomery."

Once seated, Julian wasted no time, producing a sleek document folder. "I've prepared a proposal for our potential collaboration. Would you care to review it?"

Nathaniel accepted the folder. His expression grew increasingly serious as he scanned the contents.

Finally closing the document, he said, "Your offer is certainly generous, Mr. Montgomery. However, I'll need time to consider all aspects before giving you a definitive answer."

Julian remained perfectly composed. "Naturally. Due diligence is expected in business matters. Should you have any concerns about my proposal, my door is always open for discussion and adjustments."

Their meeting concluded swiftly, with Julian departing after brief pleasantries.

His impeccable manners and professional demeanor left Nathaniel no choice but to personally escort him out.

When Nathaniel returned, Isabella had already concluded the meeting.

"That man operates with frightening efficiency," Nathaniel remarked.

Just forty-eight hours after their phone conversation where Nathaniel had declined his initial offer, Julian had appeared with a fully developed proposal - no small talk, just straight business.

"Honestly," Nathaniel admitted, "his terms are extremely tempting."

Isabella considered this. "Take your time evaluating it. If the partnership truly benefits us, there's no reason not to proceed."

Nathaniel agreed, though it frustrated him that this development would make it harder to maintain his adversarial stance toward Julian.

The realization left him feeling oddly unsettled, as if robbed of an outlet for his lingering resentment.

Around five that evening, Isabella's phone vibrated insistently during her work.

A glance revealed Sophia's name - again.

Her daughter hadn't called for two days, but Isabella still let it go to voicemail, focusing instead on her reports.

Two mornings later, shortly after Isabella finished dressing, her phone rang once more.

She placed the buzzing device face-down on the dresser and moved toward the kitchen to prepare breakfast.

Across town, Sophia stared at her silent phone, frustration bubbling up until her eyes grew misty.

Pushing her breakfast around her plate, she addressed Alexander across the table in a small voice. "That was the fourth time. Mom hasn't answered any of my calls since Saturday..."

Alexander sipped his coffee calmly. "Give it more time."

Sophia's fork clattered against her plate. "What if she never answers?"

"Then wait longer," he said simply. "She will eventually."

Sophia brightened slightly. "How long is eventually?"

Alexander considered this. "Two weeks, maximum."

Sophia's face fell. "Two weeks? That's forever!"

Alexander nodded. "It does feel that way sometimes."

Changing tactics, Sophia asked, "I want to go shopping this weekend. Victoria can't go with her injuries. Dad, will you take me?"

Alexander set down his newspaper. "I'm booked Saturday, but free Sunday. If you want to go Saturday, Julian and Lily would be happy to accompany you."
###Chapter 175

Sophia nodded. Alright. As long as she wasn't left alone, she could manage.

Alexander made a quick call to Julian, requesting him to look after Sophia on Saturday.

Julian agreed without hesitation. Of course.

Come Saturday, Julian took Sophia and Lily to Sunshine Park.

The amusement park boasted thrilling rides and colorful attractions. Yet none seemed to capture Sophia's interest today. Her usual spark was missing.

She seemed distant. Lost in thought.

Julian handed them both ice cream cones - strawberry for Lily, vanilla for Sophia.

Studying her features that bore traces of Isabella's elegance, he asked gently, "Sophia, what's troubling you today?"

Perched on a swing, Sophia took small licks of her melting ice cream. "I miss Mom," she whispered.

Back in Salzburg, there were months when she wouldn't see her mother. But daily calls kept them connected.

Recently, even with Isabella's hectic schedule, she always answered Sophia's calls. Sometimes even rushing home to cook her favorite meals.

Now? Nothing. Not a single returned call. This silence was new. Terrifying.

Julian knew about the finalized divorce. Knew custody had been granted to Alexander.

But he didn't know the current dynamics between them.

"Did something happen?" Julian probed carefully.

Sophia confessed about the unanswered calls.

Julian realized she still didn't know about the divorce.

He hesitated. Chose his words carefully. "Your mom would never ignore you intentionally. She's probably swamped with work. It'll pass."

Sophia nodded. "That's what Dad said too."

Julian fell silent. What more could he say?

Noticing Sophia's sadness, Lily chimed in. "I miss Aunt Isabella too! But Uncle Julian says important people get super busy. She'll call soon!"

Sophia managed a small smile. "Okay."

Truth was, Julian hadn't reached out to Isabella either. Not because she was busy - but because he understood the divorce, especially losing custody, must be devastating.

Asking her to babysit now felt cruel.

At 5 PM sharp, Alexander called. "Where are you?"

Julian shared their location. Within twenty minutes, Alexander arrived.

"Dad!" Sophia's entire demeanor brightened. No comparison to how she'd been with Julian.

Alexander, dressed in a tailored navy suit (his overcoat left in the car), scooped her up effortlessly. "Did you have fun with Julian and Lily?"

Sophia, now cheerful, nodded vigorously. "So much fun!"

She clung to Alexander like a koala, refusing to let go.

Alexander carried her into The Grandeur, only setting her down in their private dining room. He turned to Julian. "Thanks for today."

"No trouble," Julian replied. "They mostly entertained themselves. Honestly, it was easier than expected."

With the girls distracted, Julian lowered his voice. "I know you have custody, but what about visitation?"

Alexander's lips curved knowingly. "You think I'm keeping Isabella away?"

The unspoken tension hung heavy between them.
###Chapter 176

Julian Montgomery had indeed considered that possibility.

Alexander Whitmore took a sip of his tea. Though I have full custody, the agreement explicitly states she can see Sophia whenever she wishes—no restrictions apply.

That surprised Julian.

Just then, both children glanced their way, so they dropped the subject.

Alexander abruptly changed topics. I heard you’ve been in talks with YodaVision recently?

Julian hesitated. Yes. Then he countered, What about you? Not interested?

Alexander shrugged. Haven’t decided yet. There’s still time—no need to rush.

Julian gave a noncommittal hum.

Isabella Sinclair still hadn’t finished her thesis.

After working on it relentlessly for a day and a half, she met Emily Donovan for dinner Sunday evening. They wandered aimlessly for over two hours before heading home.

A quiet, productive, and entirely uninterrupted weekend slipped by just like that.

Monday arrived, and Isabella returned to YodaVision as usual.

From that day onward, those who had previously called Nathaniel Graves to discuss potential collaborations began showing up in person, proposals in hand.

Dominic Fairchild arrived on Thursday.

Coincidentally, Nathaniel was away on a business trip that day.

When Isabella got the news, she set aside her work and headed straight to the meeting room.

As the door opened, Dominic rose to his feet. But when he saw only Isabella enter, his expression faltered slightly.

Isabella extended her hand politely. Mr. Fairchild, I’m Isabella Sinclair. Nathaniel is currently away on business.

I’m handling all company matters in his absence. Anything you’d like to discuss can be directed to me—it’s the same.

Handling everything in his stead? In what capacity? As Nathaniel’s girlfriend?

Dominic wasn’t sure if she was telling the truth or simply asserting her influence over Nathaniel.

Even if she was being honest, their proposal contained highly technical content and specialized jargon. Would she even understand it?

More absurdly, despite knowing this was a business discussion, she hadn’t even brought a technical expert with her—she’d come alone.

That said, Nathaniel did seem to hold her in high regard.

With that in mind, Dominic decided not to make a scene, even if he doubted her comprehension.

He shook her hand briefly. Then I’ll have to trouble you, Ms. Sinclair.

He sat back down and slid a document across the table. This is our company’s proposal. Please take a look.

Isabella accepted it. Of course. I’ll review it now.

Just as she opened the file, one of Nathaniel’s secretaries knocked and entered, whispering in her ear, Ms. Sinclair, there are visitors downstairs—Reginald and Victoria Kensington. Should I have them wait in your office?

No need, Isabella cut in softly. Send them away.

Understood.

Once the secretary left, Isabella apologized to Dominic before turning her full attention to the proposal.

As she read, she noted that while Dominic had arrived later than others, his confidence was justified. His proposal was thorough, aligning almost perfectly with her requirements.

She appeared entirely focused, as if she genuinely grasped every detail.

If this was an act, Dominic wouldn’t call her out. He wasn’t in a hurry, after all.

Over half an hour later, Isabella set the document down. Mr. Fairchild, your proposal is highly compatible with our company’s needs. We’ll give it serious consideration.

Dominic had no intention of discussing this further with Isabella—he’d wait for Nathaniel’s return.

But outwardly, he remained courteous. Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to potential collaboration.
###Chapter 177

Dominic Fairchild finished his statement with a curt nod. "I have other matters to attend to, Ms. Sinclair. Until next time."

Isabella Sinclair had already picked up on Dominic's subtle disdain. Though he maintained perfect professionalism in the meeting room, his indifference was palpable.

Business was business. She wasn't here to make friends—only to secure a profitable partnership.

She flashed a practiced smile. "Of course. Until next time."

Turning to Nathaniel Graves' secretary, she said, "Ms. Chambers, please escort Mr. Fairchild out."

Dominic left without another word.

Downstairs, he spotted a familiar face. "Ms. Kensington?"

Victoria Kensington and her father, Reginald Kensington, hadn't left.

Victoria Chambers had informed them Nathaniel was away on business, but they'd chosen to wait, suspecting it was just an excuse to avoid them.

Instead of Nathaniel, they saw Dominic.

It had been two weeks since Victoria's injury. Though not fully healed, she could function normally again.

Last week, Dominic had visited InnovaTech but hadn't seen her. Upon inquiring, he learned she'd been hospitalized.

The injury had been severe. Even now, her complexion was still pale, her energy visibly drained.

Dominic felt a pang of concern—until he remembered she'd gotten hurt saving Alexander Whitmore. The thought made his jaw tighten.

Reginald studied Dominic's refined demeanor and asked, "Victoria, who is this?"

Victoria didn't miss the flicker of worry in Dominic's eyes. Her tone was cool. "Dominic Fairchild."

She introduced him. "Mr. Fairchild, this is my father, Reginald Kensington."

Dominic offered a polite nod. "A pleasure, Mr. Kensington."

After brief pleasantries, Victoria asked, "Did you come to YodaVision to discuss a partnership with Mr. Graves as well?"

Dominic nodded. "And you?"

"Yes." She tilted her head. "Did you meet with him?"

"No. He's away."

Reginald chuckled dryly. "So he really is gone. I thought he was just avoiding us."

Dominic frowned. "You weren't invited upstairs?"

Victoria shook her head. "His secretary told us to leave."

Dominic's expression darkened.

Victoria noticed. "What's wrong?"

"Mr. Graves is indeed away," Dominic said coldly. "But I was received by Ms. Sinclair—the woman we met at InnovaTech. She claimed to be handling all matters for YodaVision in his absence."

Whether Isabella truly had that authority didn't matter. What did matter was that she'd met with Dominic—but refused Victoria. That was deliberate.

Reginald stiffened.

Victoria merely shrugged. "I see." She turned to her father. "Let's go, then."

Reginald's lips thinned, clearly displeased, but he nodded.

Dominic opened his mouth to speak—just as Isabella descended the stairs.

She froze at the sight of them.

Before she could speak, Victoria's phone rang. She answered, her voice softening. "Alexander? You're here? I'll be right out."
###Chapter 178

"Mr. Whitmore is here?" Dominic asked.

"Yes." At the mention of Alexander, Victoria's tone softened immediately. "My injury hasn't fully recovered yet, and Alexander was concerned, so he came to pick me up."

She spoke without sparing Isabella a single glance. Then she added, "Mr. Fairchild, we'll be leaving now. Until next time."

Dominic had originally planned to confront Isabella and defend Victoria.

But seeing how Victoria didn't even acknowledge Isabella's presence, he realized she completely despised her - so much that she wouldn't waste energy on fake politeness.

Watching Victoria's proud, direct demeanor, Dominic found her even more captivating.

At that moment, he decided words were wasted on someone like Isabella. She wasn't worth it. His dislike for Isabella intensified.

"I'm leaving too," he told Victoria. "Let's go together."

Victoria nodded, walking away with Reginald without looking back.

While Victoria ignored Isabella completely, Dominic turned to give her one last icy glare before leaving.

Isabella didn't need to guess what that look meant. Dominic wasn't the first man to dislike her simply because of Victoria.

Meeting his gaze coldly, she turned away indifferently and strode toward the exit as if they didn't exist.

Dominic was stunned.

She showed no shame at being called out - if anything, she seemed arrogantly unbothered.

He scoffed mockingly. "Unbelievable."

The world truly contained all types.

Seeing Isabella walk out alongside them without hesitation, Reginald frowned in displeasure.

Victoria's steps faltered slightly before continuing, pretending not to notice Isabella at all.

In the parking lot, Alexander waited by his car, leaning against the door.

Noticing Isabella with the group, he hesitated briefly before regaining composure.

Isabella saw Alexander too. Without acknowledging anyone, she went straight to her car.

After setting her navigation, she drove off.

As she pulled away, she caught Alexander opening the car door for Victoria with his usual gentle care.

There was a banquet Saturday evening. Nathaniel returned Friday afternoon.

When he heard about Dominic's behavior, he scoffed. "In that case, we won't collaborate with him. No point dealing with such unpleasant people."

Isabella agreed.

Dominic wasn't the only good business partner available. She wouldn't lower herself for him.

Saturday afternoon, as Isabella prepared her evening gown, her phone rang.

Sophia.

She'd been ignoring the calls, hoping Sophia would call less frequently. Yet the girl still called two or three times weekly.

Isabella didn't answer this time either.

But unlike before, Sophia no longer felt crushed.

Initially heartbroken when her mother repeatedly ignored calls, her father had advised: "If you want to call, call. One day she'll answer."

Now whenever she wanted to talk to Isabella, she called immediately - even knowing she might not answer.

After hanging up, Sophia kicked her legs on the master bed. "Dad, leaving so early to get Victoria?"

Alexander hummed in response.

"Come back early tomorrow and take me out."

"Okay."

Ten minutes after dressing, Alexander left.

By 8 PM, Alexander and Victoria arrived at the banquet entrance.

Victoria wore another stunning designer gown, impossible to overlook.

They immediately became the center of attention upon entering.

Julian and Oliver had arrived earlier. Seeing them, they approached.

Dominic, Sebastian, and Simon had just arrived too, turning at the commotion.

When Dominic saw Victoria, admiration flashed in his eyes again.

Simon gestured toward Alexander and Victoria. "That's Victoria Kensington?"

Sebastian nodded. "Beautiful and captivating, isn't she? But no matter how captivating, she's taken."

Sebastian only glanced twice before looking away without comment.

Alexander's mere presence commanded respect. Many immediately approached to greet him.

Soon a crowd surrounded him and Victoria.

At that moment, Nathaniel and Isabella arrived.

YodaVision was currently the industry's hottest company, making Nathaniel's presence expected - and eagerly watched.

Many were equally captivated by Isabella.

Tonight she wore an off-white, hand-embroidered gown that accentuated her graceful figure while exuding serene elegance.

Someone murmured, "Both Mr. Whitmore and Mr. Graves are lucky men."

"Absolutely."

Though Victoria and Isabella had different styles, both were stunning beauties.

When Nathaniel and Isabella entered, Julian, Oliver, Sebastian and Dominic all noticed immediately.

As YodaVision's CEO, Nathaniel's invitation was expected.

But Julian hadn't been sure Isabella would attend. Seeing her arm-in-arm with Nathaniel, his gaze darkened.

Oliver had suspected she might come but hadn't expected her to look so breathtaking. Even disliking her, he had to admit - Isabella's unique, serene charm was undeniable.
###Chapter 179

What a shame. Isabella was stunning on the surface but hollow inside. The realization made Oliver lose interest instantly, his gaze shifting away.

Dominic had also been momentarily captivated by Isabella's beauty. But his thoughts mirrored Oliver's.

That explained why he immediately turned his head in disgust.

Simon, however, was quite drawn to Isabella's type. He wasn't in a hurry to look away, but noticing Dominic's reaction, he asked, "What's your problem? That face... Did she offend you again?"

Sebastian also averted his eyes.

Dominic then recounted in vivid detail what had happened at YodaVision a few days prior.

Simon muttered, "Huh... Never would've guessed Ms. Sinclair was like that."

Sebastian paused mid-sip of his drink. "Maybe there's some unresolved history between her and Ms. Kensington we don't know about."

Dominic scoffed. "Even if there is, does that justify abusing her position for revenge?"

Without full context, Sebastian chose not to push further.

Meanwhile, Isabella and Nathaniel, who had just entered the banquet hall, were immediately swarmed by guests.

Everyone clamored to flatter Nathaniel.

Nathaniel replied, "You give me too much credit. YodaVision's success is the result of our entire team's hard work."

Then he glanced at Isabella and added, "Especially her contributions. They've been invaluable."

From the CUAP project to the latest initiatives, the core technology had all been in her hands.

Of course, her true identity remained confidential. Even key personnel involved had signed government-mandated NDAs.

While he couldn't reveal her secret, he could ensure people recognized her importance.

With YodaVision in the spotlight lately, many knew Isabella wasn't just an employee but also shared a close relationship with Nathaniel.

Some even knew Nathaniel entrusted her with company affairs in his absence.

Hearing his praise now, most assumed Isabella must be highly competent.

But his implication that YodaVision wouldn't exist without her? Nobody took that seriously. After all, rumors said she'd only joined three months ago.

Nathaniel was clearly smitten, unwilling to let anyone underestimate her.

Given Isabella's undeniable beauty and Nathaniel's soaring career, his infatuation wasn't surprising.

Though privately skeptical, the crowd maintained polite smiles, complimenting, "Ms. Sinclair truly embodies both brilliance and beauty."

On the other side, Victoria overheard and let out a derisive chuckle.

She glanced at Alexander, who, after a brief look toward Isabella, lost interest and turned away.

Noticing this, Victoria also averted her gaze indifferently—until she caught Julian staring intently in that direction.

No doubt he was looking at Nathaniel, not Isabella.

Victoria knew Julian wanted to collaborate with YodaVision.

As for Isabella? Julian had always despised her. No chance he'd be watching her. No matter how gorgeous Isabella was, Julian would never care.

Catching Victoria's stare, Julian turned. "What?"

Victoria smiled. "Nothing."

Julian didn't press. Seeing the crowd around Nathaniel and Isabella thinning, he said, "I'm going to greet Nathaniel. Alexander, have you decided about collaborating with YodaVision? If yes, let's go together."
###Chapter 180

Nathaniel's voice was calm. "I'm not in a hurry. You go ahead."

Julian nodded. "Alright."

He walked forward until he stood directly in front of Isabella. "Mr. Graves, Ms. Sinclair."

Nathaniel's smile cooled slightly at his approach. "Mr. Montgomery."

Isabella offered a polite nod. "Mr. Montgomery."

Just then, Dominic Fairchild joined them.

Unlike Julian, he only acknowledged Nathaniel. "Mr. Graves."

Nathaniel's expression grew even more distant. "Mr. Fairchild is here too? My apologies—I was occupied earlier and didn't notice."

Dominic immediately caught the chill in Nathaniel's tone, sharper than during their first meeting. But he wasn't surprised.

His gaze flicked to Isabella, cold and dismissive. He knew she must have poisoned Nathaniel's mind against him.

Unfazed by the hostility, he said, "I visited YodaVision recently. I assume you're aware, Mr. Graves?"

"Of course. Isabella told me." Nathaniel's tone was smooth. "I reviewed your proposal. It's well-structured, but..." He paused. "Personally, it doesn't align with my vision. So I regret to inform you, Mr. Fairchild, that our collaboration won't proceed."

Dominic hadn't expected Nathaniel to be so blatantly biased because of Isabella.

His brow furrowed. "I thought you were a man who kept business separate from personal matters, Mr. Graves."

"Usually, I do." Nathaniel didn't bother masking his disdain now. He smirked. "But exceptions exist."

The implication was clear—when it came to Isabella, impartiality was off the table.

Theodore Fairchild had emphasized securing a partnership with YodaVision for the next two years, signaling the company's untapped potential.

Despite Nathaniel's hostility, Dominic wasn't about to walk away so easily.

"If you have concerns about my proposal, I'll revise it and resubmit," he said coolly.

He glanced at Julian, then added, "Since you're occupied, I won't take more of your time. Goodbye."

With that, he turned and left.

Throughout the exchange, Dominic never once acknowledged Isabella.

But Julian, standing nearby, noticed the deliberate snub. Nathaniel's rejection was clearly tied to her.

He chose not to comment, pretending not to notice. "I've also prepared a revised proposal. Would you both be available for dinner on Monday?"

Given Julian's close ties to Alexander and Victoria Kensington, Nathaniel had never been particularly fond of him, even if his proposals were solid.

But now, seeing Julian set aside personal grievances and even include Isabella in the invitation, Nathaniel's opinion of him shifted slightly.

Still, he remained professional. "Monday? I'll have to check my schedule. If I'm free, I'll let you know."

Julian wasn't fazed. "Understood."

Just then, the banquet host stepped onto the stage, making an announcement.

Moments later, applause and music filled the air as the host and his wife took the floor for the first dance.

Guests soon joined in.

The ballroom glittered with society's most dazzling heiresses and elites.

Then, a strikingly beautiful woman approached Julian, her smile radiant.

"Mr. Montgomery," she said, extending her hand. "May I have this dance?"
###Chapter 181

A subtle change flickered across Julian's face.

His gaze lingered on Isabella.

Alexander remained oblivious to Julian's intense stare.

Nathaniel was thoroughly enjoying himself. With theatrical flair, he executed a perfect bow and extended his hand like a nobleman from a period drama. "Might I have the pleasure of dancing with the exquisite Ms. Sinclair?"

Isabella was no stranger to ballroom dancing.

She laughed at Nathaniel's dramatic display. "The pleasure would be mine," she replied, placing her hand in his.

Nathaniel led her onto the polished dance floor with practiced ease.

Not to be outdone, Julian extended his own invitation to the woman beside him.

As Isabella and Nathaniel moved across the floor, their attention was drawn to Alexander and Victoria.

The couple was preparing to dance themselves, their eyes accidentally meeting Isabella's direction.

Just as Isabella started to look away, she thought she saw Alexander smile at her.

Her brow furrowed momentarily before realizing her mistake.

That smile was meant for Victoria.

His attention never strayed from his partner.

Isabella refocused on Nathaniel, surrendering to the rhythm of the music.

Dominic, Sebastian, and Oliver were the kind of eligible bachelors who commanded attention in high society.

Naturally, numerous women vied for their attention.

After greeting Nathaniel, Dominic only had eyes for one person - Victoria.

Like Sebastian, he had no intention of dancing tonight.

However, certain well-connected young ladies had family ties that couldn't be ignored.

At their elders' insistence, both men reluctantly accepted partners and joined the dancing.

Oliver, true to his reputation as a ladies' man, was already circulating with enthusiasm.

Isabella moved with effortless grace in her cocktail dress, her every motion exuding timeless elegance. Her radiant smile made her unquestionably the evening's most captivating presence.

This didn't go unnoticed, and soon multiple gentlemen were angling to cut in.

Simon was particularly persistent.

Approaching with his current partner, he asked, "Mr. Graves, care to switch partners for a song?"

His gaze remained fixed on Isabella.

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "I think not."

Simon was momentarily speechless.

Then Isabella heard another voice. "Ms. Sinclair? Would you mind switching partners for this dance?"

She turned to find Sebastian's partner addressing her.

The woman had striking features and was clearly more interested in Nathaniel than in her current partner.

Isabella smiled politely. "I don't mind, but Mr. Ashford—"

Sebastian interjected smoothly, "I'm amenable either way."

Nathaniel looked mildly affronted.

Apparently his opinion wasn't required.

Still, Sebastian was an impressive match by any standard, and certainly no poor choice for Isabella.

With that thought, Nathaniel relented.

The exchange happened seamlessly.

Isabella found herself momentarily uncomfortable placing her hand in a stranger's and resting the other on his shoulder.

True to his reputation, Sebastian maintained a respectful distance.

Noticing her tension, Sebastian found himself wondering if she lacked experience with romantic partners.

Though they'd met before, they were hardly acquainted.

"Sebastian Ashford," he introduced himself.

Isabella took a moment to compose herself before meeting his gaze. "Isabella Sinclair."
###Chapter 182

Sebastian Ashford paused mid-step. "Isabella? As in... divine?"

"Exactly."

The name fit her perfectly, though Sebastian kept that thought to himself.

Dominic Fairchild, Oliver Westbrook, Julian Montgomery, Victoria Kensington, and Alexander Whitmore all took notice.

Partner swapping during dances wasn't uncommon.

But Isabella Sinclair with Sebastian Ashford?

Visually, they were breathtaking together.

Dominic's brow furrowed.

Julian froze momentarily.

His dance partner tilted her head. "Mr. Montgomery?"

Julian quickly looked away. "My apologies."

"It's fine."

Really, changing partners during a waltz meant nothing.

Julian wouldn't have minded even switching with Alexander.

But Isabella—

This was Victoria's first encounter with Sebastian tonight.

Dominic had greeted him earlier, but Sebastian hadn't stayed long.

Victoria knew nothing about his background.

Yet judging by how Dominic and Simon Fairchild treated him, his status clearly matched Dominic's.

Victoria's lips pursed as she watched Isabella blush while dancing with Sebastian, who seemed unusually attentive.

Oliver suddenly grinned. "Let's switch, Alexander."

Victoria snapped back to reality.

Alexander met her gaze. "Shall we?"

Smiling tightly, Victoria nodded. "Of course."

Alexander smoothly transferred his partner to Oliver.

Oliver's dance partner hadn't expected Victoria to agree so readily.

When Alexander took her hand and rested his other hand lightly on her waist, she stared up at his striking features, her pulse racing uncontrollably—she missed a step.

Flushing crimson, she glanced at Alexander in mortified hesitation.

Alexander paused briefly before speaking gently, "Relax."

His calm demeanor steadied her. After murmuring an apology, she gradually matched his rhythm.

Initially, Victoria hadn't cared about the switch.

One dance couldn't threaten her relationship with Alexander.

But seeing the girl's starry-eyed admiration for Alexander made Victoria's fingers tighten involuntarily.

Oliver had never viewed Victoria romantically—she was his best friend's girlfriend.

The switch had been impulsive.

Yet now, holding Victoria's hand felt strangely uncomfortable.

His free hand hovered awkwardly near her waist.

Victoria glared. "It's just a dance. Alexander won't mind."

Oliver forced a laugh. "Right."

Meanwhile, Isabella and Alexander were gradually drifting closer.

Isabella remained oblivious.

Suddenly, Alexander's voice cut through the music. "Sebastian, care to switch?"

Isabella turned sharply, meeting Alexander's intense gaze.

Sebastian hesitated. "Ms. Sinclair, would you—"

Before he finished, Alexander had already made the exchange, passing his partner to Sebastian.

Had Sebastian not caught her, she might have stumbled.

Seeing Alexander secure Isabella, Sebastian had no choice but to release her and steady the other woman at her waist.

It happened too fast—Isabella barely registered the shift before finding herself securely in Alexander's arms.
###Chapter 183

Isabella's first instinct was to shove Alexander away the moment she realized what had happened.

"Relax," Alexander murmured casually.

His grip around her waist tightened slightly, as if he'd anticipated her reaction.

"You!"

She couldn't break free without causing a scene.

People always had motives.

He must have something important to say, she reasoned, which explained this sudden switch.

She stopped resisting. "What do you want?" she asked coldly.

Alexander studied her frosty expression but remained unfazed. "When are you planning to answer Sophia's calls?"

"Soon."

His lips curved. "Which means about ten days?"

Isabella hesitated briefly. "Yes."

Even though their divorce was final and she didn't have custody of Sophia, she still had maternal responsibilities.

She'd decided to dedicate one day each month exclusively for her daughter.

Ten days would mark a full month.

"Alright," Alexander acknowledged.

There was nothing left to discuss between them.

Isabella shot him a pointed look, demanding he release her.

Instead, Alexander held firm. "How have you been lately?"

Her lips pressed together. What game was he playing now?

"None of your concern."

Her wellbeing wasn't his business anymore.

When she didn't elaborate, Alexander didn't press. Before she realized it, he'd steered her off the dance floor and disappeared.

The sudden dance partnership between Alexander and Isabella left everyone stunned.

Victoria bit her lip hard.

But she quickly composed herself.

If Alexander had ever been interested in Isabella, it would've happened years ago.

Not now.

When she saw Alexander returning, she intercepted him. "What did you say to her?"

"Just about Sophia."

Victoria relaxed. Of course - Alexander wouldn't approach Isabella without reason.

Smiling, she extended her hand. "Dance with me again?"

Alexander led her back onto the floor.

Meanwhile...

Nathaniel was still processing Isabella's dance with Alexander.

Hearing it was just about Sophia eased his tension. "Try to avoid him when possible."

Isabella nodded. "I will."

Just then, Sebastian approached. "Ms. Sinclair, my apologies for the unplanned partner switch."

He'd noticed Isabella's dark expression during the exchange. She clearly hadn't wanted anything to do with Alexander.

The realization hit him - Alexander was Victoria's boyfriend.

Given Victoria and Isabella's history, Sebastian assumed Alexander had approached to discuss - or defend - Victoria.

Isabella shook her head. "It's fine. Not your fault anyway. I'd have done the same in your position."

Her tone was calm and sincere.

Sebastian could tell she genuinely bore no ill will.

During their earlier dance, he'd noticed she wasn't particularly talkative or socially adept.

Quiet and reserved, she'd regarded him simply as a temporary dance partner without ulterior motives.

Sebastian extended his hand. "May I have this dance then?"
###Chapter 184

Isabella froze momentarily.

Even though Sebastian had asked her to dance again, she sensed no romantic undertones in his invitation.

It was purely an apologetic and friendly gesture.

Recognizing his sincerity, she placed her hand in his.

Julian had already exited the dance floor.

His expression darkened when he noticed Isabella and Sebastian returning to dance together.

Victoria too raised an eyebrow at Sebastian's persistent attention toward Isabella.

Alexander observed them as well.

He smirked slightly before resuming his dance with Victoria as if nothing had occurred.

Moments later, Alexander received a call. He and Victoria stepped away from the dancers.

Coincidentally, Nathaniel also wished to stop dancing.

Thus Nathaniel and Victoria joined Julian, whose gaze remained fixed on Isabella.

Isabella and Sebastian continued swaying to the music.

Nathaniel sipped his drink, watching them. "Sebastian seems quite taken with her. But you know how those elite families are - they'd never approve, no matter how much he likes her."

After all, Isabella was a divorced single mother. Given the Sinclair family's precarious financial situation, the Ashfords accepting her was unthinkable.

Nathaniel didn't voice these thoughts, but Victoria understood perfectly.

Having lived in Salzburg for years, she knew the Whitmores, Montgomerys, Westbrooks, Ashfords, and Fairchilds were among the city's most powerful families.

She'd suspected Sebastian came from privilege - likely the Ashfords.

Her guess proved correct.

Perhaps Sebastian did enjoy Isabella's company, but that didn't imply romantic interest.

As for Isabella marrying into the Ashford family? Impossible.

Just as Victoria pondered this, Sebastian and Isabella left the dance floor.

After a polite nod, Sebastian walked away without hesitation.

Victoria smiled.

Her assumptions had been right.

She knew someone like Sebastian would never fall for a woman like Isabella at first sight.

Nathaniel looked away. "All that dancing made me hungry. Shall we grab something to eat?"

Noticing Isabella and Nathaniel heading toward the buffet, Julian agreed.

Victoria informed Alexander - still on his phone - of their plans before joining Nathaniel and Julian.

As they arrived, several guests approached to greet them.

Some even seized the opportunity to discuss potential business ventures with Julian and Nathaniel.

Victoria stood aside, listening to their conversations.

Then Sebastian and Dominic appeared.

Spotting her, Dominic approached. "Good evening, Ms. Kensington."

Victoria offered a faint smile. "Mr. Fairchild."

"Where's Mr. Whitmore? Isn't he with you?"

"He's currently occupied with phone calls."

Realizing Victoria and Sebastian hadn't been introduced, Dominic took initiative. "Ms. Kensington, may I present my good friend, Sebastian Ashford."

Turning to Sebastian, he added, "Sebastian, this is Ms. Kensington."

Sebastian extended his hand. "A pleasure."

Victoria shook it briefly. "Likewise."

Isabella and Nathaniel were approaching their group.

Nathaniel clicked his tongue in annoyance when he saw them.

The desserts he wanted were just beyond the gathering.

As they moved toward the treats, business associates intercepted them.

Meanwhile, after greeting Victoria, Sebastian turned to Julian and Nathaniel. "Mr. Montgomery, Mr. Westbrook."

Julian gave a curt nod.

Just then, Alexander finished his calls and joined them.

Nathaniel recalled Sebastian and Isabella's extended dance. He cleared his throat meaningfully.

Regardless of circumstances, Isabella remained Alexander's wife.

Julian's expression darkened further.

Alexander, however, appeared completely unbothered.

He initiated conversation with Sebastian. "Mr. Ashford."

Sebastian nodded. "Mr. Whitmore."

Alexander tapped his glass against Sebastian's before sipping. "It's been some time."

Sebastian gripped his glass lightly. "Indeed it has."

Nathaniel nearly rolled his eyes.

His concern had been unnecessary.

The group fell into casual conversation.

Isabella and Nathaniel became engrossed in discussions that lasted quite awhile.

They didn't cross paths with Alexander's group again that evening.

As midnight approached, they bid their host farewell and departed discreetly.

Monday morning found Nathaniel arriving at work to learn Ethan Blackwell from Whitmore Group waited downstairs to discuss collaboration.

Victoria had accompanied Ethan.

Nathaniel sighed internally.

Had Alexander come personally, he'd have refused the meeting.

But he respected Ethan.

With Alexander sending him, refusal wasn't an option.

He had to admit Alexander knew precisely which strings to pull.

Moreover, Ethan had brought Victoria.

A headache began pounding at Nathaniel's temples.

Suppressing his irritation, he went to brief Isabella on the situation.
###Chapter 185

Isabella shrugged. "Meeting Victoria isn't that important."

After all, just seeing her didn't guarantee any business agreement.

"You're right," Nathaniel agreed. Turning to her, he asked, "Want to join me?"

"Absolutely."

They kept Victoria and Ethan waiting in the conference room for a while before finally making their entrance.

The moment Nathaniel stepped inside, both Ethan and Victoria immediately stood to greet him.

Victoria's expression faltered briefly when she noticed Isabella walking in beside him, but she quickly masked it. After Ethan exchanged pleasantries with Nathaniel, she followed suit. "Good afternoon, Mr. Graves."

Nathaniel gave a curt nod. "Take a seat, Ms. Kensington."

Isabella's striking looks and her years at Whitmore Corp had left a lasting impression on Ethan.

Before sitting down, he blurted, "Ms. Sinclair! It's you!"

Ethan grinned. "I wondered where you'd disappeared to. So you left and joined YodaVision."

Back when Isabella worked at Whitmore Corp, they'd occasionally crossed paths professionally.

She returned his smile. "Yes, I've been here for a while now."

"That's great to hear."

Once the small talk ended, they got down to business.

Ethan handed his proposal to Nathaniel, and Victoria did the same.

Nathaniel took both documents and passed one to Isabella. "Bella, review Ms. Kensington's proposal. What do you think?"

"Sure."

Victoria stiffened slightly but remained silent.

Isabella flipped through the pages.

Though she wasn't a speed-reader, she processed information quickly.

Within minutes, she finished evaluating Victoria's proposal.

Handing it back, she met Victoria's gaze directly. "You've clearly put in effort, Ms. Kensington. However, there are several flaws. Compared to other companies vying for YodaVision's partnership, yours falls short."
###Chapter 186

Victoria Kensington's sharp gaze locked onto Isabella Sinclair as she responded, "I understand."

She leaned forward slightly, her tone dripping with challenge. "In that case, Ms. Sinclair, would you care to enlighten me on the flaws in my proposal so I can make the necessary adjustments?"

Isabella saw through the trap immediately. This wasn't a genuine request—it was a test.

A slow, knowing smile curved her lips. "Ms. Kensington, identifying the weaknesses in your proposal is your responsibility, not mine. Do you honestly expect us to do your work for you?" She tilted her head, voice smooth as silk. "Let me remind you—we're under no obligation to partner with you. If you can't even pinpoint your own shortcomings, how can we trust you to meet our standards?"

Victoria stiffened. She had been certain Isabella would falter, either admitting ignorance or listing vague criticisms she could dismantle. Instead, Isabella had turned the tables, framing her as incompetent.

Keeping her composure, Victoria countered, "Ms. Sinclair, I believe you're misinterpreting my intentions. A successful partnership requires mutual effort. If there are issues, shouldn't we address them together?"

Isabella paused mid-sip of her tea, arching a brow. "Tell me, Ms. Kensington—is this your first business negotiation?"

Victoria frowned, caught off guard.

Isabella didn’t wait for an answer. "What you're suggesting—collaborative revisions—works in classrooms, not boardrooms. Business is about profit. If your proposal doesn’t serve our interests, why would we waste time fixing it when better options exist?"

Her tone was light, almost amused, but Victoria felt the sting beneath the words.

Isabella nudged the teacup toward her. "Try the tea, Ms. Kensington."

Victoria hesitated, but refusing would be a loss. She lifted the cup, murmuring, "Thank you."

"You're welcome."

Across the room, Nathaniel Graves had been watching the exchange closely. He'd worried Victoria might outmaneuver Isabella, but to his surprise, Isabella had dismantled her effortlessly.

Once the meeting concluded and Victoria was escorted out, Nathaniel shot Isabella an impressed look. "That was masterful."

Isabella smirked. "I didn’t work at Whitmore Corporation for nothing."

Though she hadn’t handled major clients directly, years of navigating corporate politics had honed her instincts.

Nathaniel had forgotten that.

"So," he asked, "were there actually flaws in the Kensington proposal?"

"Yes."

The proposal was meticulous, the technical aspects flawless—likely Alexander Whitmore’s influence.

But in execution, something was just... off.
###Chapter 187

After finalizing the discussion about Victoria's proposal, Isabella turned to Nathaniel. "What about Whitmore Group's offer?"

Nathaniel adjusted his glasses with a faint smile. "Alexander operates in our industry. His technical expertise is unparalleled."

The financial strength of Whitmore Group was undeniable.

Their tech team consisted of the most brilliant minds in the field.

Alexander himself was a recognized authority in the industry.

The proposal he submitted wasn't just impressive—it redefined excellence.

Perhaps that explained his calm demeanor in waiting until now to propose this partnership.

Isabella wasn't surprised by this revelation.

"Make the decision based purely on merit," she advised.

Partnering with an elite team eliminated countless potential headaches.

Whatever history existed between her and Alexander paled in comparison to the project's importance.

Dominic Fairchild arrived at YodaVision that afternoon.

This time, Nathaniel didn't bother meeting him personally.

When Dominic failed to secure an audience, he departed without ceremony.

Then Julian Montgomery arrived.

Both Nathaniel and Isabella went to greet him together.

As they reviewed Julian's revised proposal, their eyes met in silent agreement.

Recognizing their aligned thoughts, Isabella extended her hand. "Let's make this a successful partnership, Mr. Montgomery."

Julian noticed Isabella held final authority at YodaVision. His gaze flickered between her and Nathaniel before shaking both their hands. "Looking forward to it. This collaboration shows great promise."

They immediately delved into contract negotiations.

As twilight approached, they'd nearly finalized initial terms when Isabella's phone rang.

Sophia's name flashed twice consecutively on the screen.

Isabella dismissed both calls, and Sophia didn't attempt a third.

Alexander, however, answered when Sophia called him.

He returned home within thirty minutes.

Sophia lay in bed receiving IV treatment, her complexion pale. Seeing Alexander, she mustered just enough strength to whisper, "Daddy..."

Alexander took a seat beside her. Noticing the sheen of sweat on her forehead, he carefully wiped it with his handkerchief. "Still feeling sick?"

"A little..."

Though the pain remained considerable.

Instead of scolding her for poor dietary choices, Alexander recognized her melancholy. "Should I ask Victoria to visit?" he offered.

Normally she would have agreed instantly.

But this time, Sophia clutched his fingers, shaking her head weakly. "I want Mommy."

Despite her affection for Victoria, when unwell, she instinctively sought her mother's presence.

More than anything, she wanted Isabella by her side now.

"Alright," Alexander agreed.

Letting Sophia hold his hand, he called Isabella with his free one.

Isabella had just concluded contract discussions with Julian and was preparing for dinner.

Seeing Alexander's call after ignoring Sophia's earlier attempts gave her pause before answering. "Yes?"

"Sophia has mild food poisoning," Alexander explained. "She's on IV at home and asking for you."

Isabella's grip tightened on her phone. "Understood. I'm leaving now."

Hanging up, she turned to Julian. "Apologies, an urgent matter requires my attention. We'll reschedule dinner."

Noticing her sudden tension, Julian inquired, "Is Sophia unwell?"

Isabella nodded.

"Serious condition?"

Alexander hadn't elaborated, leaving Isabella uncertain. "She should be stable now."
###Chapter 188

That's better.

Isabella let out a quiet sigh of relief.

After exchanging a few words with Nathaniel, she left the office.

When she arrived at the villa, she went straight to Sophia's room where Alexander was working at the desk.

He looked up the moment she entered. "You're back," he said simply.

Isabella gave a soft hum in response.

She set her bag down and moved to Sophia's bedside.

The little girl was still hooked to an IV, fast asleep with a faint frown between her brows. She must have been exhausted.

Rather than wake her, Isabella turned to Alexander. "How is she now?"

"She was in quite a bit of pain when I got home, but the medication's helped."

"I see."

Isabella sank into the nearby armchair with a book, intending to read while waiting for Sophia to wake.

Then Alexander asked, "Have you eaten?"

"Not yet."

Before he could respond, Sophia stirred awake.

Her eyes widened when she saw Isabella. "Mommy! You're home!"

"Mmm."

Isabella barely had time to close her book before Sophia sat up and threw her arms around her neck. "You finally came back!"

The warmth of her small body made Isabella pause before carefully returning the hug, mindful of the IV.

After half an hour on the drip, Sophia was clearly feeling better. She pulled back with a pout. "Mommy, I'm hungry."

Alexander remained seated but glanced over. "Should I have dinner brought up?"

Sophia shook her head, still clinging to Isabella. "I want Mommy to cook for me."

Isabella smoothed her hair. "Not tonight, sweetheart. It's too late to start cooking. I'll make your favorite tomorrow."

Sophia's lower lip trembled. "Promise you'll eat with me then?"

"Promise."

The little girl's face lit up instantly.

When the IV finished, Alexander carefully removed the needle. Sophia immediately demanded to be carried downstairs.

Isabella lifted her, surprised by how much heavier she felt. Had she grown taller in just twenty days?

"Mommy?"

Sophia touched her cheek when she didn't respond.

Wordlessly, Isabella adjusted her grip and headed for the door.

Alexander closed his laptop and followed. Seeing Sophia nuzzle against Isabella's shoulder, he reached out to pinch her cheek.

Too happy to protest, Sophia just giggled.

At dinner, she chattered nonstop between bites, already listing what she wanted Isabella to cook for breakfast.

"I have plans later," Isabella said, noting how much better Sophia looked. "I'll make those for you another time."

Alexander's gaze flicked to her but he remained silent.

Sophia's smile vanished. "But Mommy, you're always working! I don't want you to leave! You just got home!"

Seeing her pout, Isabella realized these brief monthly visits weren't enough.

"Alright," she conceded. "I'll stay tonight."

Sophia beamed. "And take me to school tomorrow!"

Isabella nodded as she took another bite.

After dinner, Sophia dragged Isabella upstairs to share everything about her classmates, teachers, and recent adventures.

Midway through a story about art class, Isabella noticed Alexander leaning against the doorframe, watching them.

She had no idea how long he'd been standing there.
###Chapter 189

Isabella had just finished helping Sophia with her bath and was about to wash up herself.

Her toiletries weren't in Sophia's room, so she headed toward the master bedroom.

The master bedroom stood dark and silent. Alexander wasn't there.

She flicked on the lights and froze instantly, her breath catching in her throat. For a disorienting moment, she thought she'd entered the wrong room.

Seven years of living here had made her intimately familiar with every inch of this space.

Yet now, everything looked foreign.

Every single element had changed. Almost everything - except the floor remained the same.

Only the floor was untouched. The chandelier, curtains, bed, nightstands, window-side table, sofa, coffee table, rug - all replaced. Even the water dispenser and mugs were new.

Her vanity table was gone. All her skincare products had vanished.

It was clear - every trace of her existence had been systematically erased.

Not that it surprised her. Their divorce was practically finalized anyway.

When Victoria got injured saving Alexander, he'd rushed back immediately with new divorce papers. His eagerness to end their marriage and legitimize Victoria's position couldn't have been more obvious.

The ink wasn't even dry on their divorce papers, and he'd already purged all reminders of her?

Isabella took an involuntary step back. As she reached to turn off the lights, Margaret's voice stopped her.

She turned to see the housekeeper standing with a tray bearing a steaming cup of milk. "Good evening, Margaret."

Margaret smiled. "Mrs. Whitmore Senior left this milk during her visit earlier. She asked me to prepare it for you when possible."

"Thank you," Isabella replied.

"You're most welcome."

After a brief hesitation, Margaret added, "Mr. Whitmore had me pack all your belongings at the start of the month, Mrs. Whitmore. They've been moved to the third floor. If you need anything, I can fetch it for you, or—"

Early this month - when she and Alexander had signed the divorce papers.

Isabella cut in, "No need. I'll get them myself later."

"Very well."

Margaret then asked, "Shall I bring this milk to Sophia's room?"

The unspoken message was clear - she no longer had access to the master bedroom.

Isabella took the tray. "I'll handle it."

Margaret nodded.

Isabella switched off the master bedroom lights and carried the tray back to Sophia's room.

After finishing the warm milk, she headed to the third floor.

Her belongings had been neatly arranged in a corner room there.

The space was immaculate.

Margaret had clearly been maintaining it for her.

She collected fresh clothes and toiletries before returning to Sophia's room for her bath.

After bathing and reading with Sophia, they prepared for bed.

"Mom," Sophia said sleepily, "I'm going to say goodnight to Dad. Want to come?"

Isabella shook her head. "You go ahead."

"Okay."

Three minutes later, Sophia returned. "Mom, Dad says goodnight too."

Isabella set aside the book with a murmured response.

Yawning, Sophia curled into Isabella's arms. "We can sleep now, Mom. Goodnight!"

"Goodnight."

Isabella turned off the lights.

The next morning dawned early.

Isabella woke at first light.

Sophia still slept soundly.

After washing up, Isabella headed to the kitchen.
###Chapter 190

Isabella headed upstairs at 7:00 sharp.

Sophia was already awake.

When she noticed Isabella returning, Sophia quickly minimized her WhatsApp chat window.

Isabella pretended not to see it. "Go freshen up and change," she said casually.

"Okay!"

As Isabella packed her belongings, she saw Margaret gathering last night's pajamas to wash.

"Don't bother washing those, Margaret," Isabella said. "Just throw them away."

"Actually, dispose of everything here. I won't be needing any of it anymore."

The divorce from Alexander would be finalized soon.

Even if she met Sophia in the future, she wouldn't step foot in this house again, much less stay overnight.

These items held no meaning for her now.

There had always been tension between Isabella and Alexander.

Her rare visits over the past few months had already signaled their deteriorating relationship.

When Alexander had cleared her things from the master bedroom earlier that month, it was the final confirmation.

Now, with Isabella's words, Margaret had no remaining doubts.

Margaret hesitated before murmuring, "Understood."

Carrying her bag downstairs, Isabella nearly collided with Alexander returning from his morning run.

"Good morning," he offered first.

Isabella gave a curt nod. "Morning."

She placed her bag on the sofa and headed to the kitchen while Alexander went upstairs.

With breakfast still being prepared, Margaret handled the final touches. Isabella settled in the living room with a book, waiting for Sophia.

Time was running short. When Sophia still hadn't appeared, Isabella remained seated and asked Margaret to hurry her along.

In the past, Isabella would have gone upstairs herself.

Now she behaved more like a guest, showing less concern for Sophia's routines.

Margaret noticed the change but simply nodded and went upstairs.

"New book?"

Isabella was so absorbed she didn't realize Alexander had come downstairs.

She nodded.

"Mind if I take a look?" He extended his hand.

Isabella hesitated. "Don't you have your own copy?"

It was the latest AI research journal.

Early in their marriage, when Isabella was still unfamiliar with AI, she'd noticed numerous AI-related books in Alexander's study.

Naturally, he subscribed to all the leading journals in the field.

"Been too busy lately to check the latest issue."

He reached for the journal just as Sophia's footsteps approached.

Since breakfast was ready, Isabella handed it over.

Sophia bounded downstairs, spotted them, and grabbed Isabella's hand. "Breakfast ready, Mom?"

"Yes."

Isabella headed to the dining room. Sophia followed but turned back to Alexander, still holding the journal. "Aren't you joining us, Dad?"

"In a minute," he replied.

Once Isabella and Sophia were seated, Alexander arrived.

He'd barely started eating when his phone buzzed.

Setting down his utensils, he checked the notification.

Isabella ate quietly. Finishing first, she returned to the living room and retrieved the journal Alexander had left on the coffee table, tucking it into her bag. When Sophia finished, they left without another word to Alexander.
###Chapter 191

At Sophia's school, Isabella heard a sweet voice calling her name. "Ms. Sinclair!"

Turning slightly, she saw Charlotte running toward her. "Ms. Sinclair, my mom asked me to bring you some pastries last night, but you weren't home, so I took them back."

Just as Isabella opened her mouth to respond, Sophia—unaware her mother had moved out—huffed. "That's not true. My mom was home last night."

Charlotte scratched her head. "Huh? Really? Then why—"

Before Isabella could explain, Sophia's teacher called out. "Ms. Sinclair."

Isabella turned. "Ms. Moore."

Elizabeth gestured for the girls to go inside, saying she needed to speak with Isabella privately.

Once the children disappeared into the building, Elizabeth said, "Ms. Sinclair, are you aware of next week's parent-child activity?"

Isabella shook her head. Sophia hadn't mentioned it.

Elizabeth hesitated, having suspected as much but wanting confirmation. "I see."

"As long as someone accompanies her, it's fine," Isabella said evenly.

Recognizing her firm stance, Elizabeth sighed. "Understood."

After thanking the teacher, Isabella left.

Back at the office, she learned Victoria and Reginald Kensington had come by again.

Their initial encounter with Victoria had been coincidental. Neither Isabella nor Nathaniel had any intention of working with the Kensingtons.

Upon hearing this, Nathaniel immediately instructed his staff to turn them away.

Moments later, his phone rang. Seeing the caller ID, he glanced at Isabella. "Alexander?"

She barely looked up from her work. "Let me guess—he's calling about the Kensingtons?"

Nathaniel answered. "Mr. Whitmore."

Alexander's voice came through. "Mr. Graves, how about dinner tonight?"

Nathaniel cut to the chase. "This call concerns the Kensingtons, doesn't it?"

"It does."

Nathaniel's laugh held no humor. "Mr. Whitmore, InnovaTech will never collaborate with the Kensingtons. I trust I don't need to explain why."

Before Alexander could respond, he continued, "Furthermore, while Whitmore Global's last proposal was impressive, any future collaboration would require one condition—absolute assurance that no Kensington or Pembroke has any involvement in our project."

"If that's unacceptable, this conversation is over. Are we clear, Mr. Whitmore?"

"Crystal," Alexander replied.

"Good. Then we're done here." Nathaniel ended the call.

Alexander didn't call back.

In the following days, even Whitmore Global went silent. It seemed Alexander was willing to sacrifice this business opportunity for Victoria's sake.

And indeed, that proved true.

Three days later, Nathaniel learned Whitmore Global had launched a new development team—with both Kensingtons and Pembrokes on board.

While losing Whitmore Global as a partner was regrettable, other firms of similar caliber existed.

InnovaTech didn't need them.

On Friday evening, Frederick returned.
###Chapter 192

Isabella grabbed her laptop and headed to Frederick's house with Nathaniel for dinner.

After the meal, Frederick helped her go through her thesis revisions.

It was late when she finally got into the car to drive home. That's when Caroline called.

She had originally booked cruise tickets for tomorrow to take William and Edward on a day trip, but a family emergency came up, forcing her to cancel. She couldn't take the boys anymore.

"I've got it," Isabella said immediately. "I'm free tomorrow. I'll take them."

She'd barely hung up when her phone rang again. This time, it was Julian.

Before he could speak, Isabella cut in, "If this is about Lily, I already have plans tomorrow-"

Julian didn't hang up. Instead, he asked, "Would you mind sharing what those plans are?" Then added, "Lily really wants to see you."

Seeing no reason to hide it, Isabella explained the situation.

"A cruise?" Julian sounded intrigued. "Lily would love that. Mind if we join you?"

Isabella paused, then said, "Let me check with my cousins first."

"Of course," Julian replied.

Five minutes later, Isabella called back with confirmation.

The next morning at 8:15, Isabella arrived at Maplewood Docks with William and Edward.

Julian and Lily were already waiting.

"Ms. Isabella!" Lily came running the moment she spotted her.

Isabella crouched to hug the excited girl. "Hello, Lily. It's been too long."

Seeing William and Edward's confused looks, Isabella made introductions.

Julian greeted them warmly. "Hello, gentlemen." He produced two gift bags. "Wasn't sure what you'd like, so I brought small tokens. Hope you'll enjoy them."

The gesture caught everyone off guard - even Isabella.

After brief pleasantries, they boarded the vessel.

William and Edward already knew about Isabella's impending divorce from Alexander.

Watching her hold Lily's hand while chatting with Julian, William shot Edward a look that clearly asked: Future brother-in-law?

Edward shrugged subtly in response: Maybe?

Seeing the adults distracted, William leaned in. "He's handsome," she whispered.

And far more approachable than their soon-to-be ex-brother-in-law.

But seeing Isabella interact so warmly with Lily gave them mixed feelings.

They knew not only about the divorce, but also that Isabella likely wouldn't get custody of Sophia.

Alexander refused to budge, and Sophia herself rarely visited the Sinclair family despite being back in the country.

The girl clearly preferred her father.

They couldn't imagine how much that must hurt Isabella.

Now, seeing her potentially moving on, they wanted to support her. So they joined in playing with Lily.

If Isabella did marry Julian someday, being kind to his family now might ensure the Montgomerys treated their cousin well in return.
###Chapter 193

William and Edward approached Isabella, inviting her to join them on the water slide.

Isabella's eyes lit up as she spotted the vibrant slide nearby, nodding enthusiastically.

The yacht's indoor water slide was designed like a thermal spring, ensuring warmth even during winter months.

Though primarily meant for children, the slide accommodated adults too.

After a few rounds, Sophia and Julian grew bored, but Isabella, William, and Edward couldn't get enough.

Sophia settled into the hot spring nearby.

Julian handed her a chilled drink.

"Thanks," she said, accepting it.

He took a seat a few feet away. "You're welcome." Then asked, "How old are they?"

"William's sixteen, Edward's fourteen."

"Do you take them out often?"

Isabella shook her head. "I used to, but work's been consuming lately."

Julian's phone buzzed. His expression remained neutral as he stood. "Need to take this."

"Of course," she replied.

He walked several paces before answering. "Alexander."

"Where are you?" Alexander's voice came through.

"On a yacht."

"At sea?"

"Yes." Julian's gaze drifted to Isabella. "Something wrong?"

"Sophia wants to play with Lily. Asked me to call you."

"We're already offshore. Maybe next time."

"Alright." Alexander ended the call without further comment.

At lunch, the group enjoyed an extravagant seafood spread.

The afternoon found them lounging on deck - sunbathing, fishing.

Exhausted from play, William, Edward, and Lily dozed off on their chairs.

Julian excused himself for business calls. Returning, he found Isabella engrossed in a book.

Though his finance degree didn't cover her current reading material, the title looked familiar.

Then it clicked - he'd seen Alexander reading the same book.

Watching her concentrated expression, Julian paused. She hadn't even noticed his return.

Only when wind displaced Lily's blanket did Isabella look up as Julian adjusted it.

He reclaimed his seat. "That book...you read it often too?"

His emphasis on "too" clearly referenced Alexander.

Isabella nodded. "Yes."

Her focused demeanor - not in features but intensity - mirrored Alexander's exactly.

In that moment, Julian realized how much they shared: the same professional passions.

By that logic, they should have been perfectly compatible.

Yet...

Their troubled marriage contradicted this.

Everyone claimed she'd trapped Alexander through manipulation. Julian had believed it too.

But knowing her now, she seemed incapable of such scheming.

As evening fell, the yacht prepared to dock.

William, Edward and Lily had grown close through the day.

The boys even addressed Julian casually now. "See you next time, Julian," they called while disembarking.

Julian nodded, his gaze lingering on Isabella. "Next time."
###Chapter 194

Isabella waved casually. "See you around." Without another word, she drove off, tires crunching on the gravel.

Back at the Sinclair estate, Isabella headed upstairs while Thomas excitedly recounted the day's events to Margaret.

When the elderly woman learned Julian Montgomery had been Isabella's companion all day, her eyebrows shot up in surprise.

Julian and Alexander had been childhood friends, yet Isabella had never shown particular interest in him before. What changed so suddenly?

Charles stroked his chin thoughtfully. "Now I understand why the Montgomery Group suddenly proposed that joint venture last week. Julian's been unusually courteous too."

Caroline gasped. "You think it's serious then?"

But Margaret knew her granddaughter better. "Isabella isn't officially divorced yet. She wouldn't cross that line. Let's not meddle."

"Understood."

The next morning, Isabella woke in her childhood bedroom. She'd just finished breakfast when her phone buzzed.

Alexander.

She stared at the screen, letting it ring out.

A text appeared moments later: Sophia's school has a parent event tomorrow. Be there.

Isabella typed back: Can't make it.

The phone rang again.

She powered it off completely.

After finishing her work, she turned the phone back on to find another message: Are you at the Sinclair residence?

Four simple words laced with threat - if she didn't respond, he'd come find her.

Her fingers tightened around the device as she replied: What time?

Thirty agonizing minutes passed before his response: 9 AM.

She didn't acknowledge it.

That evening, Sophia called.

"Mommy, why aren't you home yet?" The little girl's voice trembled.

Alexander had promised Sophia her mother would return for tomorrow's event, but it was already past nine and no sign of Isabella.

"I'm staying here tonight. I'll meet you at school tomorrow."

"Oh." Sophia's disappointment cut deep.

"Go to sleep now, sweetheart."

"Okay."

After hanging up, Isabella texted Nathaniel she'd be late to the office.

Monday morning found her pulling into the school parking lot right on time.

"Mommy!" Sophia jumped up and down beside Alexander, waving frantically.

Isabella approached. Alexander nodded. "You came."

Remembering his veiled threat, she ignored him, instead opening Sophia's tablet to review the event schedule.

Soon, they took their seats.

Elizabeth Moore spotted Isabella and brightened noticeably. "Ms. Sinclair! You made it."

Isabella offered a warm smile. "Wouldn't miss it."

Sophia returned with the floral wreath meant for mothers, handing it to Alexander with expectant eyes.

Isabella intercepted it. "I've got this."

Alexander relinquished the flowers without argument.

Their striking looks made them stand out among the other parents, drawing curious glances.

Abigail Winslow had heard from Charlotte about Isabella's marriage and daughter. Now seeing them in person, she approached. "Is this... your husband?"
###Chapter 195

Isabella stood alone as Sophia had wandered off. She offered Abigail a small smile. "We're getting divorced."

Abigail had suspected as much. After all, Isabella had a daughter but had been living alone across from her all this time.

Not to mention, Isabella hadn't attended the last parent-teacher meeting. Instead, some stunning woman had shown up in her place.

Alexander surprised them both by initiating conversation. "Hello."

"Hello," Abigail replied cautiously.

"You two know each other?" His question was directed at Abigail, but his eyes never left Isabella.

Isabella remained silent, refusing to engage.

Abigail answered, "Isabella and I are neighbors."

Sensing the tension and noticing Isabella's disinterest in speaking with Alexander, Abigail quickly excused herself.

"You seem close with your new neighbor," Alexander remarked.

Isabella kept her eyes on her phone, scrolling absently.

Alexander didn't press further, but neither did he walk away.

Just then, Sophia came bounding back, and the parent-child activities were about to begin.

Isabella had participated in similar events during Sophia's first year of kindergarten. But after Alexander took Sophia abroad last year, she hadn't attended any since.

The first game was Musical Chairs.

The rules were simple: chairs arranged in a circle, two fewer than participating families. Parents had to carry their child while circling the chairs to music.

When the music stopped, they had to scramble for a seat. Each round eliminated families without chairs, until only one remained victorious.

Alexander turned to Isabella. "Do you want to do it, or should I?"

Before Isabella could respond, Sophia tugged at Alexander's sleeve excitedly. "Daddy should do it!"

Alexander looked to Isabella for confirmation.

"You do it," she agreed.

"Alright." He handed her his phone. "Then you can record it."

Isabella hesitated. "I'll use mine. I'll send you the video later."

Alexander took his phone back without argument. He scooped Sophia up effortlessly and joined the other parents by the chairs.

Isabella stood, opening her camera app and focusing on Alexander and Sophia.

Suddenly, Alexander glanced directly at the camera. He smiled - that devastating smile she knew too well.

Isabella's fingers tightened around her phone for just a second.

The music started. Alexander turned away, holding Sophia securely as he moved with the other parents.

After a couple rounds, the music cut off abruptly.

Alexander secured a chair with ease, Sophia giggling in his arms.

"We got one, Mommy!" Sophia waved excitedly.

"That's great," Isabella responded.

Truthfully, when she'd first seen the schedule, she'd assumed both Alexander and Sophia would find these school games tedious.

But Sophia had been thrilled from the moment Alexander lifted her. Now, with their success, she was practically vibrating with excitement.

Alexander chuckled at her reaction, then caught Isabella's eye.

At first, it had been obvious Alexander wasn't particularly invested. But the lively atmosphere, cheerful music, and competitive nature seemed to have drawn him in.

Now, he appeared fully engaged, actually enjoying himself.

His quick reflexes served him well. Round after round, he dominated effortlessly, ultimately claiming victory.
###Chapter 196

Sophia sprinted toward Isabella, her tiny hand raised for a celebratory slap. "Mommy, we did it!"

Isabella met her palm with a gentle high-five. "Mm-hmm."

Alexander approached them casually. "Did you get the footage?"

"Right here." Isabella tapped her screen, sending the video file his way.

The next challenge was called the Unstoppable Hoop Relay. Four family teams would compete, each maneuvering a giant circular tape loop beneath their feet while advancing toward the finish line.

Alexander's gaze flicked to Isabella. "Your turn for this one?"

Sophia bounced on her toes. "Mommy's playing with me this round!"

Isabella adjusted her sunglasses. "Fine by me."

As participants gathered at the starting line, Isabella hesitated, fingers tightening around her purse strap.

Alexander extended his hand without comment.

"Thanks." She relinquished the bag.

For ordinary couples, this would be mundane. For them? Monumental. Isabella couldn't recall Alexander ever holding her belongings before. She wondered absently if he'd performed this small service for Victoria.

Dressed in a tailored black trench coat instead of his usual business attire, he looked incongruously at ease holding her designer handbag. To any observer, he might appear to be any devoted partner waiting for his significant other.

Isabella averted her eyes.

The game demanded precise coordination. Isabella positioned herself at the team's center, arms raised to guide the rotating hoop. Sophia clutched the back of her mother's coat, giggling as she struggled to match the rhythm.

When Sophia spotted Alexander filming, her excitement doubled. "Daddy!"

He stood slightly off-center, phone steady in his grip.

Isaware of his presence but kept her focus forward. Then Alexander's voice cut through the chatter. "Eyes on the hoop, princess. Match Mommy's timing."

"Okay!" Sophia chirped.

Unlike Isabella's stationary filming earlier, Alexander moved with them, walking backward while maintaining perfect framing.

The game concluded with their team victorious.

Sophia barreled into Alexander's legs. "Can we play again sometime? Please?"

His lips quirked. "We'll see."

Isabella reclaimed her bag just as a notification chimed. She glimpsed the video Alexander had sent but didn't open it.

Sophia was already clamoring to see the footage. Alexander surrendered his phone, then uncapped a water bottle and offered it to Isabella.

"Thanks." She drank, throat parched from shouting instructions.

As she recapped the bottle, Alexander asked, "What's next?"

Isabella arched a brow. The man had photographic memory. Yet...

Her fingers tightened around the plastic container. One didn't refuse basic courtesy after accepting it. "Ball Relay," she answered.

X
###Chapter 197

Alexander's deep voice cut through the air. "You or me?"

Isabella turned to Sophia. "Sweetheart, you choose."

"Daddy." Sophia beamed. "Mommy doesn't know basketball, but Daddy's amazing at it."

The truth was, Isabella could play decently. But she didn't contradict her daughter.

With Sophia's decision made, Isabella simply nodded. "You do it."

Alexander gave a quick nod. "Alright."

The midday sun grew intense, baking the schoolyard.

He shrugged off his tailored jacket and handed it to her. "Hold this."

Isabella eyed the expensive fabric before draping it carelessly over a nearby bench.

His eyebrow arched slightly, but he remained silent.

Just as the whistle was about to blow, he turned back. "Keep the camera moving with us. Don't just stand there."

"Understood," she replied.

The rules were simple: parent pulls a rope loop while the child dribbles inside it. At the halfway point, they'd switch roles, with the ball staying within the loop at all times.

Isabella remembered taking Sophia to basketball clinics before. Back then, her daughter had shown little interest - probably too young to remember.

But now, whether from school lessons or Alexander's coaching, Sophia handled the ball with surprising skill.

Alexander moved backward effortlessly, matching her rhythm perfectly.

They completed the first leg with ease. The return trip was even smoother.

Sophia hadn't exaggerated - Alexander was exceptional.

The ball spun effortlessly between his hands. With his sleeves rolled up, his movements were both graceful and precise as he adjusted to Sophia's pace.

Murmurs rippled through the watching crowd. "So gorgeous..."

Isabella kept the camera steady.

Yet as she filmed, an unexpected memory surfaced - Alexander playing basketball on their college courts years ago.

Just months earlier, whenever she'd recalled their past, his younger self had appeared vividly in her mind.

But now, seeing the present-day Alexander - taller, more composed, even more striking - those old images seemed to fade.

Unsurprisingly, they took first place.

Sophia jumped with unrestrained joy, her smile radiant.

Alexander grinned and scooped her up effortlessly.

Isabella captured the moment, thinking her daughter must be the happiest child here.

Yet part of her wondered - if Victoria stood in her place today, would Sophia be even happier?

Other parents began approaching Alexander. He shook hands with one, engaging in polite conversation.

Nearby, Abigail sidled up to Isabella.

Seeing the game had ended and Isabella had stopped filming, she remarked, "Your daughter and her father share such a special bond."

"They do," Isabella agreed.

It was true - their connection was strong, and likely to grow stronger.

What Abigail didn't say was how unusual it was for a child to favor their father over their mother to this degree.

But she had to admit - Isabella's husband clearly adored their daughter.
###Chapter 198

Sophia naturally gravitated toward her father.

Abigail observed the other parents watching their spouses participate in games with their children.

When things went well, they laughed and clapped enthusiastically. When things didn’t, they grew anxious, cheering louder.

It was obvious—these families were united.

But with Isabella, something felt off.

Even as she smiled while playing with Sophia, there was a distance between her, Alexander, and their daughter. As if she didn’t truly belong.

Then Abigail remembered the last parent-teacher meeting. Sophia had been noticeably closer to that woman.

No wonder Isabella didn’t fit in now.

What child wouldn’t pull away from a mother who had allowed their family to fracture?

Abigail’s heart ached for her, but she didn’t know how to offer comfort.

Isabella caught the sympathy in her gaze.

She knew Abigail had pieced it together. So she just smiled.

The worst was already behind her.

She was only here today because Victoria wasn’t available. That was why Alexander and Sophia had asked her to come instead.

Yes, she was the outsider.

Just then, Alexander and Sophia returned.

Sophia rushed over, eager to see the video Isabella had recorded.

Isabella sent it to both of them. "Check your tablet."

Sophia beamed. "Okay!"

After three rounds of games, the event finally ended.

Sophia had won two trophies. Clutching them, she begged Alexander to take photos.

He obliged, snapping several shots.

Then Sophia turned to Isabella. "Mom, take pictures of me and Dad!"

Isabella nodded. "Of course."

At her daughter’s request, she took a few photos of them together.

After sending them to Sophia, Alexander surprised her. "Let me take some of you two."

"Yes! Mom, come here!"

"Alright."

Alexander took her phone and captured a few shots of her and Sophia.

When he handed it back, her phone rang.

Nathaniel.

"I need to take this," she said.

Sophia chirped, "Okay, Mom!"

Alexander simply nodded.

The call lasted ten minutes—work matters.

When she turned back, she noticed Alexander and Sophia were on a video call with someone. She didn’t interrupt.

Instead, she focused on the files Nathaniel had sent.

A moment later, Sophia waved her over. "Mom! Group photo time! Then lunch!"

Isabella joined them, posing with the other families. Elizabeth, their teacher, took individual family photos too.

With that, the event officially concluded.

As Isabella prepared to leave, Alexander retrieved his coat. Then he turned to her. "Where do you want to eat?"

Before she could answer, Sophia shot her hand up. "Barbecue! The place we went to last time!"

Alexander pinched her cheek. "Too far. You have class this afternoon—we won’t make it."

Sophia pouted, then brightened. "Seafood?"

Alexander didn’t answer immediately. Instead, he looked at Isabella. "Your choice?"
###Chapter 199

Isabella shook her head. "You two go ahead. I won't be joining."

Sophia's eyes widened in surprise. "What? Mom, you're not coming?"

"Mmm." Isabella gently ruffled Sophia's hair. "I need to leave first. Enjoy your meal."

"Oh..."

Isabella offered a small smile before turning away without another word.

Alexander watched her retreating figure but made no move to stop her. Instead, he simply said, "Let's go."

"Okay."

No sooner had they settled in the car than Alexander's phone rang. Eleanor's name flashed on the screen.

The moment he answered, her furious voice came through gritted teeth. "Did you approve that joint venture with the Kensingtons and the Pembroke family through Whitmore Enterprises?"

Alexander hummed in confirmation, then chuckled darkly. "You're just finding out now?"

"How dare you!" Eleanor's voice trembled with rage. "What game are you playing? Are you—" She cut herself off, realizing the implication. If he was making moves like this, divorce papers couldn't be far behind.

By openly bringing the Kensingtons into Whitmore business, he wasn't even trying to hide his intentions anymore.

Before he could respond, she snapped, "I won't allow it! If you insist on proceeding, you'll reduce their shares immediately. Otherwise, I'll—"

"Grandmother." Alexander's voice remained calm but firm. "I upheld my end of our agreement before marriage. Now I expect you to honor yours—stay out of my business decisions."

In other words: hands off the Kensingtons.

"You—"

Since Alexander took the helm at Whitmore Enterprises, the company had flourished under his leadership. The board had long since learned that his decisions brought profit and stability.

If Eleanor tried to oppose him now, the shareholders would revolt before he even needed to lift a finger.

The truth was simple: Whitmore needed Alexander far more than he needed them.

Using the company as leverage was pointless. What about emotional blackmail?

As he'd just reminded her, marrying Isabella had already been his concession to family obligations.

Eleanor knew her grandson well—he wasn't one for repeated compromises. Once he set his mind to something, nothing could sway him.

And if pushed too far...

The line went silent. That silence was her surrender.

Alexander casually changed the subject. "Have you eaten lunch?"

The dial tone answered him.

Looking at his phone, Alexander smirked.

Sophia peeked over curiously. "What happened?"

"Your grandmother is upset," he said, setting his phone aside.

"Did you make her mad?"

"Mmm."

"Aren't you going to apologize?" Sophia asked.

"Later." He started the engine. "I'll handle it when the time is right."

"Oh... okay."

Back at the office, Nathaniel noticed Isabella's return but didn't mention the school event. "You're back early. Hungry?"

"Starving."

"Let's grab lunch then."

Isabella smiled. "Sounds perfect."

At the restaurant, they unexpectedly crossed paths with Ethan Blackwell, a senior Whitmore executive dining with his family.

After ushering his family into a private room, Ethan turned to Nathaniel. "I'd hoped we might collaborate again. But now..." He trailed off meaningfully.

Nathaniel arched an eyebrow. "I hear Whitmore's new venture is thriving."

"Indeed." Ethan's smile didn't reach his eyes. "With Mr. Whitmore personally overseeing it, failure isn't an option."

"How fortunate." Nathaniel's tone was ice. "I also heard the Kensingtons and Pembrokes secured significant stakes. No objections from your board?"
###Chapter 200

"There might be some minor objections, but nothing substantial," Alexander remarked.

Whenever the company landed a major project, other shareholders inevitably wanted their people involved. But Mr. Whitmore rarely assigned personnel himself—people couldn't start complaining the moment he finally did, could they?

Besides, the Kensingtons and Sinclairs were competent professionals who followed protocol, so overall, it caused minimal disruption.

Nathaniel had heard enough. "Alright, I won't keep you from your family. Let's schedule dinner soon."

Alexander nodded. "Absolutely, next time."

After he left, Nathaniel turned to Isabella. "Shall we go inside?"

Isabella gave a quiet affirmation. "Mm."

Post-lunch, when they returned to the office, they were informed Dominic Fairchild was waiting to see them.

Neither Isabella nor Nathaniel had any intention of meeting him. Yet Dominic remained stubbornly planted in the lobby.

That evening, as Isabella left work and approached her car in the parking garage, his voice cut through the dim lighting. "Ms. Sinclair."

She turned, her expression cool. "Mr. Fairchild. What do you want?"

Dominic met her gaze. "We need to talk."

Isabella arched an eyebrow. "Do you actually want to discuss business, or are you here to lecture me?"

He hesitated before replying, "I'm serious. I hope you can set aside personal issues and focus on what matters. Don't let emotions cloud your judgment and damage your company's interests."

The audacity almost made her laugh.

"I believe that's exactly what I should be saying to you, Mr. Fairchild," she countered.

After all, it was Dominic who'd let his feelings for Victoria Kensington sabotage their negotiations. Now he had the nerve to paint her as the unreasonable one abusing her authority?

The hypocrisy killed any remaining interest in conversation. Without another word, she slid into her car and drove off.

Dominic's face darkened.

His phone chose that moment to ring.

After a terse conversation, he too departed.

Thirty minutes later, when Dominic entered the private dining room, Simon Fairchild and Sebastian Ashford were already seated.

Simon took one look at his stormy expression. "That bad? The negotiations aren't going well?"

Dominic had visited YodaVision three times this week. Each time, Nathaniel had refused to see him.

As the saying goes, only the person who tied the knot could untie it.

So Dominic had tried approaching Isabella instead. Remembering her stonewalling, he shook his head.

"If Nathaniel won't budge and Ms. Sinclair remains inflexible, securing the YodaVision project seems unlikely," Simon observed.

"But honestly, if you can't get this one, there are plenty of other lucrative opportunities."

Dominic shook his head. "I've studied the YodaVision project extensively. I'm genuinely invested."

Even without Theodore Fairchild pushing him, after reviewing the project specs, Dominic personally wanted in.

Simon tapped his chin. "Perhaps we need a different approach?"

He glanced meaningfully at Sebastian. "Speaking of which, Sebastian—didn't you two hit it off at the gala? She seemed quite taken with you during your dance."

"If Dominic can't get through to her, maybe you could mediate? Smooth things over?"

Sebastian had been sipping his whiskey. He set the glass down with deliberate care. "We're not that close. It would be inappropriate."
###Chapter 201

Simon continued, "Why don't you talk to Nathaniel? You two have some history, don't you?"

Sebastian shook his head. "I could try, but I doubt Nathaniel would listen."

From the way Isabella had agreed to switch dance partners that evening, Sebastian had sensed there was nothing romantic between her and Nathaniel.

Yet it was equally clear Nathaniel held Isabella in high regard.

Sebastian didn't believe that even if he helped Dominic reconcile with Nathaniel, the tech CEO would suddenly agree to collaborate.

"So we're back to focusing on Ms. Sinclair?" Simon tapped his fingers on the table. "But we know so little about her. How should we approach this? Should we investigate her background?"

Dominic waved his hand dismissively. "Forget it. I'm done wasting time on her. I'll just call in an old favor."

Sebastian's eyes sharpened. "You mean reaching out to Mr. Aldridge?"

"Exactly."

Since Nathaniel was Frederick's protégé, Dominic believed the mentor's word would carry weight.

Without hesitation, he pulled out his phone to call Richard.

As Dominic left the restaurant, his finger hovered over Richard's contact. Before he could dial, his phone rang with an incoming call from his father.

Richard got straight to business. "How did the negotiations with VisionTech go?"

Dominic decided honesty was best. "They fell through. I was actually about to ask for your help."

"What happened?"

"I offended one of VisionTech's engineers, and because of her, Nathaniel—"

Richard interrupted sharply. "What's her name?"

Dominic blinked at the unexpected question but answered automatically, "Isabella Sinclair."

A long exhale came through the line, followed by a dry chuckle. "Remarkable. You managed to alienate one of their key technical staff before negotiations even began."

Dominic opened his mouth to argue that Isabella wasn't truly essential—just someone with an unclear relationship to Nathaniel.

But Richard didn't let him speak. "I'll handle this," he said abruptly.

"Thanks, Dad!" Dominic responded immediately.

"Shameless."

"When's your next break?" Dominic saw nothing wrong with asking for family assistance this time.

In his mind, he could have secured the VisionTech deal through merit alone. Personal grudges shouldn't interfere with business.

Richard's voice turned sardonic. "I was planning time off next week. Now I think I'll cancel. Seeing you might give me a heart attack."

The line went dead.

As for Isabella? Richard didn't even mention her. Sometimes life needed obstacles to keep things interesting.

Hanging up, Richard immediately dialed another number.

Isabella's gaze shifted from her computer screen. Seeing Richard's name, her fingers paused before answering. "Mr. Fairchild."

Richard chuckled. "You're clever enough to guess why I'm calling, aren't you?"

Isabella made a noncommittal sound.

Even though her silence confirmed she understood, Richard asked anyway, "Will you agree to work with Dominic? Consider it a personal favor to me. What do you say?"

Business was business. With enough mutual benefit, even rivals could become partners.
###Chapter 202

Isabella and Dominic weren't exactly sworn enemies. The situation simply required her to maintain boundaries - she wasn't about to make concessions too easily.

Now that Richard had personally intervened, she could extend this professional courtesy.

However...

Richard's voice remained gentle through the phone. "Bella, no pressure. Take your time to consider and get back to me when you've decided."

"Understood," Isabella replied.

He added, "Regarding Dominic, treat him as you see fit. Don't compromise your principles on my account."

"Noted," she responded briskly.

Richard chuckled at her directness. "Alright then, I won't keep you. Let's catch up properly soon."

"Goodbye."

After hanging up, Isabella immediately dialed Frederick.

It took Frederick thirty minutes to return her call. "What's the situation?"

Isabella briefed him concisely.

Frederick's response was characteristically measured. "Richard doesn't offer favors lightly. Consider this carefully." His words confirmed Richard's reputation.

"Thank you, Mr. Aldridge."

A simple acknowledgment before the line went dead.

By morning, Isabella had made her decision and called Richard back.

He'd anticipated she might consult Frederick first, so the delayed response didn't surprise him.

"Thank you, Bella," Richard said warmly when she gave her answer.

"You're too kind."

The call ended with Richard exhaling deeply.

A colleague noticed. "Trouble, Mr. Fairchild?"

Richard sank into his chair. "Sometimes I wish I had a daughter."

"At our age? Spare your wife the trouble," the colleague joked. "Your son should be settling down - hope for grandchildren instead."

Richard shook his head. "That boy makes nothing easy."

Meanwhile, Dominic had rushed to YodaVision the moment he received confirmation.

Isabella had already informed Nathaniel about Richard's involvement.

Nathaniel kept Dominic waiting for over an hour before granting an audience.

Dominic's revised proposal exceeded their initial terms in generosity.

Yet Nathaniel remained impassive. "Looking forward to collaborating."

Dominic shook his hand firmly. "The pleasure's mine." His quarrel was with Isabella, not Nathaniel.

"Join me for lunch?" Dominic suggested. "We can discuss next steps."

Nathaniel's smile didn't reach his eyes. "Certainly. Though Isabella will be joining us. That won't be a problem, Mr. Fairchild?"

Dominic assumed Nathaniel's cooperation resulted from Richard approaching Frederick, who then influenced Nathaniel. Isabella's presence seemed incidental.

While he disliked her, business came first. "Of course. If Ms. Sinclair has no objections."

Nathaniel summoned Isabella without another word.

She arrived promptly.

Dominic expected resentment or at least visible frustration toward Nathaniel.

Instead, she offered a professional handshake. "Looking forward to working together."
###Chapter 203

Isabella's composed expression suggested she'd anticipated this collaboration all along.

Dominic didn't dwell on it, assuming Nathaniel had briefed her beforehand. His response was detached. "Looking forward to our partnership."

As they stepped into The Grandeur, just before Isabella and Nathaniel could ascend to their private dining room, Dominic spotted Alexander and Victoria entering through the opposite entrance.

He halted mid-step. "Mr. Whitmore. Ms. Kensington."

The recognition was mutual.

Alexander inclined his head. "Mr. Fairchild. Mr. Graves."

Nathaniel offered a polished yet hollow smile. "Mr. Whitmore."

Before Alexander could respond, Nathaniel smoothly interjected, "You two catch up - we'll proceed upstairs."

With that, he guided Isabella into the waiting elevator.

During their previous encounter at InnovaTech, Dominic had already noted Nathaniel's evident distaste for Alexander.

This time, Nathaniel didn't even bother with pretense - a development that raised Dominic's eyebrows.

While unaware of their history's specifics, Dominic observed Alexander maintained his usual courteous demeanor.

As Alexander and Victoria watched the elevator doors close, Victoria murmured, "If Mr. Fairchild is dining with Mr. Graves, does that mean their contract negotiations concluded successfully?"

Dominic's lips curved. "Indeed they have."

Victoria knew Dominic's initial deal with YodaVision had collapsed after he offended Isabella, prompting Nathaniel's retaliation.

Nathaniel had been adamant about severing ties with Dominic.

She'd assumed Dominic would suffer the same fate as her - losing the YodaVision opportunity because of Isabella.

Yet here he stood, deal secured.

Did this imply that for Nathaniel, business ultimately trumped personal attachments?

Perhaps Isabella held less sway over Nathaniel than Victoria had presumed.

"Congratulations," Victoria offered with calculated warmth.

Dominic acknowledged with a chuckle. "Thank you."

Turning to Alexander, he added, "Incidentally, Mr. Whitmore, there's a project at your company that's piqued my interest. When might you be available for discussion?"

Alexander responded smoothly, "My schedule's clear this week. Feel free to contact my assistant."

With a nod, Dominic excused himself when the elevator arrived, heading toward his reserved suite.

Upon entering, he found Nathaniel and Isabella already perusing the menu.

Nathaniel glanced up. "Finished your chat, Mr. Fairchild?"

Dominic chose a seat deliberately distant from Isabella. Ignoring Nathaniel's tone, he inquired casually, "Some history between you and Mr. Whitmore?"

Nathaniel's mouth twisted. "Not history. An active war."

The glib response confirmed he wouldn't elaborate.

Recognizing the dismissal, Dominic changed tack. Observing their collaborative menu selection, he offered, "The wagyu is my treat. Order freely."

Without looking up, Nathaniel countered, "Naturally. We weren't planning to restrain ourselves."

Dominic's lips pressed together.

After they finalized their selections, Dominic added two modest dishes before steering conversation toward business matters.

When the first courses arrived, Dominic realized Nathaniel's earlier comment wasn't hyperbole.

The table soon overflowed with the restaurant's most extravagant offerings - servers kept replenishing dishes as though catering a banquet.

A dull throb began behind Dominic's temples.

Nathaniel, oblivious to his host's discomfort, piled delicacies onto Isabella's plate. "Take your time, darling. Savor each bite."
###Chapter 204

Isabella gave a slight nod. Hmm.

Dominic remained silent.

Nathaniel was clearly trying to make things difficult for Dominic.

Truth be told, neither of them cared about the money.

As business discussions grew serious during dinner, Isabella stayed quiet, only speaking when absolutely necessary.

Most of the time, she simply observed.

Dominic noticed this with some surprise - whenever Isabella did contribute, her insights were remarkably sharp and valuable.

She was far more capable than he'd assumed.

Previously, he'd imagined Isabella as the clingy, desperate one in her relationship with Nathaniel - the inferior party chasing after him.

But watching their dynamic tonight painted a different picture. Perhaps this was exactly how she'd managed to completely captivate Nathaniel.

After all, without genuine substance, how could someone like Nathaniel be so taken with her?

As dinner neared its end, Isabella excused herself to visit the ladies' room.

On her way out, she nearly collided with Alexander emerging from the adjacent restroom.

Alexander saw her but made no move to speak - perhaps uncertain what to say.

Isabella had no intention of conversation either and was about to pass by when she suddenly remembered something and stopped.

"When can we finalize the divorce?"

She knew he was eager to get it done. He'd undoubtedly expedite the process to be rid of her.

Knowing this, she'd never bothered asking before. But now, so much time had passed-

Alexander replied, "It'll take a while longer."

"No specific date?"

"I'll inform you once it's confirmed."

Isabella said nothing more and turned to leave when Alexander suddenly added, "Grandmother knows about the divorce now."

"That's good," Isabella responded.

At least the old woman would stop trying to push them together. And Isabella wouldn't have to keep pretending anymore.

Alexander gave a noncommittal hum.

They walked forward in silence.

Suddenly, someone came barreling around the corner.

Both instinctively stepped aside, but Isabella still got bumped, stumbling backward - right into Alexander.

His hand reflexively steadied her at the waist.

The stranger muttered an apology before disappearing into the restroom.

Before Isabella could even rub her sore shoulder, she tried to pull away from Alexander's hold.

At that exact moment, Dominic appeared around the corner.

Seeing Isabella leaning against Alexander, his hand still on her waist, Dominic froze mid-step. "You two-"

Alexander released her immediately.

Isabella quickly put distance between them, avoiding both men's gazes as she walked away without another word.

Dominic's eyes followed her retreating figure before shifting back to Alexander.

Alexander smiled politely. "Mr. Fairchild, here for the restroom too?"

Dominic answered stiffly, "Yes."

With a slight nod, Alexander turned and left without further comment.

Watching Alexander walk away so casually, Dominic pressed his lips into a thin line. He'd never considered any connection between Isabella and Alexander.

As far as he knew, they'd only crossed paths once at InnovaTech. And even then, they hadn't exchanged a single word.

Which made sense - Isabella was just an engineer at YodaVision, far too junior to interact with someone of Alexander's standing.

Then there was that charity gala.

But Alexander had only sought Isabella out that night because of-

Well, that was different.

Other than that, they shouldn't have had any connection.

Interesting, wasn't it?

So what exactly had he just witnessed?
###Chapter 205

Isabella returned to the private dining room. Moments later, Dominic arrived as well.

They had finished their meal by then, so they left the restaurant together.

Dominic went back to his company to prepare documents while Isabella and Nathaniel headed to The Grandeur.

Around 3:00 pm, Julian showed up at The Grandeur almost simultaneously with Dominic.

They'd shared meals before during the autonomous vehicle trials at DataWing Inc.

Recognizing Julian, Dominic greeted him first. "Mr. Montgomery, have you finalized your collaboration with The Grandeur?"

"Indeed. Does this mean Mr. Fairchild is also ready to sign?"

"Correct."

Julian raised an eyebrow in surprise. At the previous gala, Nathaniel had outright rejected Dominic without hesitation.

He never expected they'd end up working together after all. What changed? Just then, Isabella and Nathaniel entered the conference room.

Though Nathaniel wasn't particularly fond of either Julian or Dominic, his attitude toward Isabella was noticeably warmer compared to Dominic.

So during business discussions, Nathaniel let Isabella handle negotiations with Julian while he dealt with Dominic.

Dominic had no objections to this arrangement. But Julian...

He simply smiled and said, "I'll be in your capable hands, Ms. Sinclair."

Isabella responded professionally, "You flatter me, Mr. Montgomery. This way, please."

Their technical discussions with Julian's team lasted until dusk.

As they exited the meeting room, Julian asked casually, "Care to join me for dinner, Ms. Sinclair?"

"I have prior commitments," Isabella declined politely. "Perhaps Nathaniel—"

Nathaniel emerged from the adjacent room just then. "Dinner? Excellent idea." He turned to Isabella. "Go ahead with your plans. I'll handle this."

Isabella nodded, exchanged pleasantries with Julian, ignored Dominic's lingering gaze, and left.

Julian couldn't protest.

Nathaniel glanced at Dominic. "Mr. Montgomery's treating us. Care to join, Mr. Fairchild?"

"I'll come," Dominic agreed.

After leaving The Grandeur, Isabella returned to the Sinclair residence.

She needed to discuss business with Charles.

Currently, The Grandeur was preparing two major projects, each divided into multiple outsourced segments.

She'd specifically reserved one segment for her uncle.

Charles was clearly interested. "Will Nathaniel approve?"

"He won't object. We've already discussed it."

"Good." Charles hesitated before adding, "But my liquid assets are running low..."

"I have over 100 million," Isabella stated. "If that's insufficient, we can auction those birthday gifts Alexander gave Grandma Margaret."

During Margaret's birthday celebration, two major projects were nearing final confirmation.

Isabella had taken those extravagant gifts home, already planning their use.

Since she and Alexander were divorcing, selling his gifts wouldn't raise objections.

However...

"Alexander has extensive connections. If we auction those gifts and he finds out—"

"He won't care."

Reassured by her certainty, Charles nodded.

With her 100 million plus approximately 100 million from the auction, supplemented by his own funds, they could raise around 500 million—enough for the project.

If more was needed...

Isabella glanced meaningfully at the villa across the street.

The following afternoon, Charles discreetly delivered the items to the auction house.
###Chapter 206

The phone rang in Alexander Whitmore's study.

He glanced at the caller ID before answering. The auction house. His expression remained impassive as he listened. "Understood."

The voice on the other end hesitated. "Shall we reserve these two items for you, Mr. Whitmore?"

"No." His tone left no room for further questions. The line went dead.

At the breakfast table, Victoria Kensington noticed his brief distraction. "Trouble at the office?"

Alexander pocketed his phone. "Auction house."

Victoria smiled, about to comment, when Sophia Whitmore piped up. "What's an auction house?"

Alexander sliced into his steak. "A place where rare items are sold to the highest bidder."

"Rare items? Like what?" Sophia's eyes sparkled with curiosity. "Is it exciting?"

Victoria chuckled. "It can be quite thrilling. You've never attended one, Sophia?"

The girl shook her head. "Never. Are there lots of treasures there?"

"Yes."

"Then I want to go!" Sophia clapped her hands. "Can we, Daddy?"

Victoria started, "But—"

"The selection might not be—"

Sophia's face fell instantly.

Alexander set down his cutlery. "You could participate in the bidding."

"Bidding?"

He pulled up an educational video on her tablet, explaining auction mechanics in simple terms.

Sophia watched, enthralled. Within minutes, she was bouncing in her seat. "I want to try! Daddy, take me?"

"Next time I'm free. We'll bid on whatever catches your eye."

"Promise?"

Victoria sipped her coffee, observing the exchange silently.

Dawn barely broke when Dominic Fairchild arrived at InnovaTech.

Both Alexander and Victoria were already in the conference room.

Dominic paused at the threshold. "Ms. Kensington. I didn't expect you here."

"Projects under my leadership remain my responsibility."

"Of course." Dominic masked his surprise. Given her family's recent... complications, he'd assumed she'd withdrawn completely.

Alexander gestured. "Have a seat, Mr. Fairchild."

As Dominic sat, the memory flashed—Alexander holding Isabella Sinclair protectively at The Grandeur. He pushed the thought aside, focusing on the contract details.

Victoria stayed for the initial discussion but excused herself halfway through.

An hour later, she returned for coffee—a special blend Alexander's secretary kept stocked for her.

Alexander's phone buzzed. He stepped out to take the call.

Dominic's gaze flickered between the empty doorway and Victoria. That image of Alexander embracing Isabella resurfaced.

"Something on your mind, Mr. Fairchild?" Victoria noted his hesitation.

Dominic shook his head. "Merely observing how exceptionally Mr. Whitmore treats you."

The unspoken words hung heavy. Reviving stalled projects. Introducing high-profile contacts. Launching entire initiatives under Whitmore Group—all for her benefit.

Dominic knew his limits. He could never match such devotion.

Best to leave certain observations unvoiced.
###Chapter 207

Alexander's devotion to Isabella was unquestionable. That moment when he held Victoria must have been some misunderstanding.

Friday morning dawned with Isabella receiving an unexpected call from Margaret. Her grandmother invited her to accompany her to Walter Ashford's art exhibition this Sunday.

Margaret had been an ardent admirer of Walter's work for decades. His last exhibition had been over ten years ago. Not wanting to miss this rare opportunity, Isabella immediately agreed.

The phone rang again before she could set it down. Sophia's name flashed on the screen.

This was the first call from her daughter since Monday's parent-teacher event. Isabella let it go to voicemail.

Saturday evening found her back at the Sinclair estate for family dinner.

Sunday morning arrived with crisp autumn air as Isabella and Margaret headed to the exhibition venue.

Just as Isabella stepped out of the car, Nathaniel's sleek black sedan pulled into the adjacent parking spot.

"Nathaniel?" she called out in surprise.

The tech executive looked equally startled. "Isabella? Mrs. Sinclair? What brings you here?"

Margaret smiled warmly. "I didn't know you appreciated fine art, Nathaniel."

"Truthfully, I'm here on family business," he admitted. "Delivering a gift from the Graves family."

Walter Ashford wasn't just any artist. The Ashford name carried significant weight in elite circles.

Exhibition openings became social battlegrounds - insiders showing support, outsiders scrambling for connections.

Rumors said Walter's shows generated not just record sales, but gifts worth millions. Not that the Ashfords needed the money.

The overwhelming social obligations had driven Walter into artistic seclusion for over a decade.

The Graves family had no need to court Ashford favor either. Though relations had cooled since Nathaniel's father's generation, the patriarchs remained close.

With Walter breaking his long hiatus, Nathaniel's grandfather Alvin had sent him as the family representative.

Running into Isabella and Margaret was an unexpected pleasure.

The venue buzzed with anticipation. Walter's rare exhibitions always drew massive crowds.

Isabella had been too young to attend the last one. Over the years, she'd only heard stories about the legendary events.

Noticing Nathaniel's sudden tension, she touched his arm. "Something wrong?"

He forced a smile. "Nothing. Wait here - I'll park and we'll enter together."

The three-story gallery was already packed when they arrived.

Before they could properly admire the first painting or deliver Nathaniel's gift, they encountered the Kensington and Shaw contingents.

Eleanor and Diana stood chatting with other guests. Their glances toward Isabella's group held no surprise.

Everyone knew Margaret's passion for Walter's work. Of course she wouldn't miss this exhibition after all these years.
###Chapter 208

Isabella tightened her grip on Margaret's arm.

Margaret calmly patted her granddaughter's hand. "It's fine."

If they could predict her arrival, how could she not have anticipated their presence? Nathaniel said, "Mrs. Sinclair, I'll go find Mr. Ashford inside. Would you and Isabella like to join me?" He was offering to introduce them to Walter, giving Isabella a chance to meet her idol.

But Margaret shook her head. "Seeing so many of the artist's works in one place is honor enough. I wouldn't dream of disturbing him."

With her decision made, Nathaniel had no choice but to relent. Still, with the Kensingtons present, he felt uneasy leaving them alone.

Isabella reassured him, "Go ahead. We'll be fine."

The Kensingtons valued their reputation too much to cause trouble in such a public setting.

Nathaniel departed.

Isabella asked, "Grandmother, which painting would you like to see first?"

Margaret smiled. "Let's begin with the nearest one."

"Of course."

As Isabella turned to guide Margaret away, Dominic and Simon entered. They spotted her immediately.

Simon, still harboring feelings, moved to greet her.

Dominic instinctively frowned.

Isabella ignored them and turned away.

Margaret inquired, "Do you know those young men?"

"We've worked together before."

Satisfied with the professional explanation, Margaret asked no further.

Just then, Reginald and Eleanor arrived. Before they could greet Dominic, he spoke first. "Mr. Kensington, Mrs. Kensington, what a surprise to see you here."

"Indeed."

Reginald began to speak when Diana and Beatrice approached.

"Reginald, Eleanor," Beatrice asked, "do you know these gentlemen?" She'd noticed the brief exchange between Isabella and Dominic.

Reginald smiled. "This is Mr. Fairchild, a friend of Victoria and Calvin."

"I see."

After exchanging pleasantries with the Kensingtons, Dominic and Simon proceeded inside.

Upon entering, they spotted Nathaniel but weren't surprised. "Nathaniel's here too?"

Since they were all attending at their families' behest, they maintained proper decorum. Nathaniel smirked. "Obviously."

Sebastian emerged then, handing Nathaniel a teacup before noticing Dominic. "You made it."

Dominic nodded. "Of course. Where's your grandfather?"

"Inside with other guests. He'll be awhile. Why don't you gentlemen sit?"

Dominic took a seat. "Very well."

But Nathaniel kept checking his watch restlessly.

Sebastian noticed. "Nathaniel, are you expecting someone?"

Nathaniel hesitated. "No... I just have another engagement. Though leaving without seeing Walter would be rude."

His concern won over etiquette. "Forgive me, Sebastian. I need to step out briefly."

Sebastian waved him off. "By all means."

Nathaniel departed immediately.

Dominic watched him go, quickly dedising his destination was Isabella.

Sebastian remarked, "Grandfather will be occupied for some time. You two might enjoy the gallery while you wait."
###Chapter 209

Dominic remembered Nathaniel mentioning Victoria and Alexander would attend. He rose abruptly. "Alright, message me when your grandfather finishes."

"Sure."

Dominic and Simon exited together.

They barely stepped out when Julian and Oliver arrived.

The Kensingtons immediately swarmed to greet them.

Julian shook Reginald's hand firmly. Oliver scanned the room. "Where are Alexander and Victoria? Haven't they—"

His words died as his gaze landed on Isabella. Damn!

She was here too.

Unaware, Julian followed Oliver's stare and spotted Isabella. His expression darkened instantly.

At that moment, Nathaniel was approaching Isabella and Margaret.

Julian turned back to Oliver and Reginald. "I'll go say hello." He walked away without waiting for a response.

"Mr. Graves. Ms. Sinclair." Hearing his voice, Nathaniel and Isabella turned simultaneously.

Nathaniel nodded. "Ah, Mr. Montgomery."

Margaret, recalling Edward and Thomas' earlier comments, studied Julian intently.

Noticing the closeness between Isabella and Margaret, Julian quickly deduced her identity. "You must be Mrs. Sinclair. A pleasure."

"Hello, Mr. Montgomery." Margaret smiled politely.

The Kensingtons had assumed Julian was greeting some VIP. Seeing him approach Nathaniel was expected—but Isabella and Margaret?

Diana's eyes narrowed as she tugged Oliver's sleeve. "Mr. Westbrook, look—"

Oliver explained smoothly, "Julian has a major collaboration with Nathaniel currently. Isabella holds considerable sway at VisionTech."

He omitted how Nathaniel nearly terminated their deal over Isabella. For business, Julian had to bury personal grudges temporarily.

Erin and Diana nodded understandingly. Everyone knew VisionTech's influence.

After all, the Kensingtons had also...

Failed spectacularly.

To partner with VisionTech. Thanks to Isabella, they...

This explained their simmering resentment.

Penelope whispered to Diana, "I never expected Mr. Graves to dote on... her."

Seeing Nathaniel's obvious favoritism, she bristled with jealousy.

Diana remained composed. "Patience. Nothing's confirmed between them yet."

Once Alexander divorced her, Isabella would be a single mother. Would the Graves family ever accept such a woman?

Her good fortune wouldn't last.

Just then, Genevieve arrived. She'd initially skipped the exhibition—art bored her.

But hearing Julian would attend, she'd dressed meticulously and come.

After greeting her family and Oliver, she turned—and froze.

There he stood, mere feet away.
###Chapter 210

Genevieve's eyes widened in shock as she saw Julian Montgomery engaged in conversation with Isabella Sinclair. She couldn't resist tugging at Oliver Westbrook's sleeve. "Why is Julian talking to her?"

Before Oliver could respond, she started marching toward them.

Eleanor Kensington swiftly caught her arm. "They're discussing business matters."

"Business?"

"Yes."

Genevieve pressed her lips together in frustration, though her gaze remained locked on Isabella and Julian.

Isabella wore a simple winter dress today, yet even without elaborate styling, she radiated effortless elegance.

Standing beside Julian, they created an unexpectedly harmonious picture.

Though Genevieve knew nothing could possibly exist between them, unease twisted in her stomach. She pulled Oliver's sleeve again. "Oliver, what could they possibly be discussing for so long?"

Her feelings for Julian were painfully obvious.

Having known Julian for years, Oliver understood perfectly that Julian had no interest in spoiled, willful women like Genevieve.

Besides, Julian had already rejected her quite clearly.

Oliver chuckled lightly. "Just socializing. It happens."

"Couldn't business wait for office hours?"

Oliver wasn't interested in arguing. He wanted to go inside for tea, but Julian hadn't returned yet.

Just then, Alexander Whitmore and Victoria Kensington finally arrived.

Oliver immediately waved them over. "Here!"

Seeing them, Reginald Kensington and the others broke into smiles. "Alexander! Victoria! You're here!"

Alexander nodded, about to speak when his gaze landed on Isabella and Julian nearby.

The Kensingtons and Shaws watched him closely, anticipating his reaction. After only a brief glance, Alexander turned away and simply said, "I'll go greet them."

Diana Kensington and Eleanor exchanged subtle glances as Alexander walked away.

Victoria, however, smiled gracefully. "Mrs. Whitmore Senior maintains good relations with them. Even divorced, he wouldn't burn bridges unnecessarily."

So a polite greeting in public was expected. Anything beyond that? Impossible.

Hearing this, Diana and the others relaxed. For a moment they'd wondered...

Victoria glanced toward Isabella, then casually looked away.

Isabella faced Reginald's group, so she'd naturally noticed Alexander and Victoria's arrival.

What surprised her was Alexander approaching her.

Her brow furrowed slightly.

"Madam Sinclair." Alexander greeted Margaret first.

Margaret's warm expression turned frosty upon seeing him. "Mr. Whitmore."

Unfazed by her cold tone, Alexander gave Isabella a brief nod as well.

Isabella turned her face away, ignoring him completely.

As Victoria had said, he'd only come for pleasantries. Mission accomplished, he prepared to leave.

Before departing, he glanced at Julian, silently asking if he wanted to join him.

Julian turned to Margaret and Nathaniel. "I have matters to attend to. We'll continue another time." Nathaniel waved dismissively, clearly unimpressed.

Margaret remained polite. "Let's talk again when you're free."

With that, Julian and Alexander returned to the Kensingtons and Shaws.
###Chapter 211

"You're back, Julian," Genevieve called out sweetly when she saw Julian return.

Julian gave her a cold nod.

Eleanor noticed Alexander was looking for Victoria. "Victoria's outside. She's on the phone," she said.

Alexander replied, "Okay, thanks."

Just as he finished speaking, a commotion arose in the distance.

It was Walter making his way through the crowd.

Sebastian, Richard, and the rest of the Ashfords were there as well.

With a packed house, Walter patiently waited for the chatter to die down before thanking everyone for coming.

Isabella and Nathaniel stood further at the back, but Sebastian still saw them.

Nathaniel attended with a gift on behalf of his grandfather, Charles. Richard had already informed Sebastian and Walter about it.

Yet Sebastian didn't know Isabella came as well.

Seeing her, Sebastian greeted her with a warm nod and a smile.

Isabella had never known there was a connection between Sebastian and Walter.

She returned Sebastian's greeting with a polite smile.

The Kensingtons and Fairchilds noticed that Sebastian seemed to be greeting someone, but they weren't sure who exactly.

As Walter finished his speech, the audience burst into enthusiastic applause.

Soon, the guests began approaching him, eager to discuss his artwork.

Many were exchanging greetings with Sebastian as well.

After mingling for a while, Julian and Alexander finally had the chance to approach Walter.

Walter accepted their gifts and remarked, "That's very thoughtful of you."

He scanned the group—Alexander, Julian, and Dominic—before grinning. "What fine young men. Impressive."

"It's been years," Walter continued, "but you've all grown so much."

While Walter was engaged in conversation with Alexander and the others, Sebastian made his way toward Isabella's group as he continued greeting guests.

As he approached, Nathaniel was the first to offer him a greeting.

Sebastian exchanged pleasantries with Nathaniel, then turned to Isabella. "Fancy seeing you again, Isabella."

"Yes, it's always a pleasure, Mr. Ashford," Isabella replied.

Sebastian smiled and offered a polite handshake after learning who Margaret was.

When Sebastian was told that Margaret liked his father's painting, he grinned. "Madam Sinclair, if you wouldn't mind, I'd love for you to join us inside later. There may be many guests today, but true admirers of my father's paintings are rare. He would be thrilled to know he has a kindred spirit in you."

The real reason Sebastian came over was to talk to Isabella.

However, to the other guests, it seemed like he was just making his way through the crowd and naturally ended up near Nathaniel.

They thought Sebastian was engaging with Isabella out of courtesy to the Graves family.

After chatting with Walter for a while, Alexander's phone rang. He gave a polite apology before slipping away to answer the call.

A short while after he had gone, Victoria finally returned from her call.

Victoria's elegant demeanor drew attention. The moment she moved past the crowd and stood beside Dominic and Julian, Walter's eyes were on her.

Walter noted her poised presence and casually assumed she was dating either Dominic or Julian.

Just as he was about to speak, Dominic chimed in after seeing Julian didn't have the intention to introduce Victoria. "Mr. Ashford, this is Victoria Kensington, Alexander's girlfriend."

"Ah, so she's with Alexander," said Walter, smiling knowingly. "A fine match."
###Chapter 212

Isabella responded with polite grace. "That's very generous of you."

Alexander glanced at the group with a teasing smirk. "Seems like you all need to catch up."

Just then, Walter arrived with Nathaniel Graves and Margaret Sinclair in tow.

He turned to Alexander. "Father, allow me to introduce the youngest Graves. His company, VisionTech, has shown exceptional growth and is now on the government's priority list for future funding."

Walter continued, "This is Isabella Sinclair, the lead technical developer at VisionTech and a rare talent in the industry. The company's success owes much to her brilliance."

The older generation often prioritized the nation's future above all else.

Hearing Walter's words, Alexander's expression softened. "Impressive. With minds like these, the future looks promising."

Walter then took the opportunity to introduce Evelyn to Alexander.

Soon, Alexander and Evelyn were deep in conversation about art.

Raised in an aristocratic household, Evelyn had practiced calligraphy and painting for years. Though not on Alexander's level, she had a refined understanding of the craft and spoke with genuine insight.

Their discussion stretched on for quite some time.

Victoria noticed how Walter's praise for Isabella echoed Nathaniel's words from the previous banquet. She assumed Walter admired Nathaniel and was merely repeating his sentiments.

As Isabella and Evelyn basked in the Ashford family's favor, Diana and the Kensingtons struggled to hide their discomfort.

Having missed the last banquet, Diana and the others had no idea Nathaniel had already spoken highly of Isabella before.

Surprised by Walter's glowing remarks, Penelope pulled Victoria aside and whispered, "Is Isabella really that remarkable?"

Victoria shrugged. "Hardly."

She repeated Nathaniel's exact words about Isabella from the banquet.

"She only joined VisionTech recently. How could its current success have anything to do with her? But Nathaniel clearly favors her—enough to share credit."

Penelope blinked. "Oh. I actually thought she was brilliant."

Victoria smirked. "She's just an undergraduate."

"True. Whether it's her education, credentials, or anything else, she's nowhere near your caliber. The way Mr. Ashford praises her, you'd think she surpassed Nathaniel himself."

Eleanor's expression, which had briefly faltered, quickly returned to its usual icy composure after hearing Victoria's words.

Moments later, Alexander returned.

His gaze flickered toward Isabella and Evelyn, who had unexpectedly moved to the front, but after a brief glance, he looked away.

Victoria noticed him and smiled. "Business call?"

"Just some overseas matters."

"About the expansion?"

Alexander nodded.

Seeing them engrossed in conversation, Julian averted his eyes, settling instead on Isabella standing nearby.

He realized she wasn't even looking at Alexander or Victoria.

It was as if she no longer cared about Alexander at all.

The Sinclairs, however, were beaming.

After all, no matter how much favor Isabella and Evelyn gained from Alexander, it wouldn't elevate the Sinclair family's standing.

There was no way the Ashfords would consider pairing Isabella with Sebastian.

It simply wasn't plausible.
###Chapter 213

Alexander set aside the chess pieces with a respectful nod. "The honor is mine, Mr. Whitmore."

He took the seat opposite Gregory. "Please go easy on me, sir."

Victoria, Julian, and their group gathered around to watch the match.

Isabella and Nathaniel joined the spectators too.

They positioned themselves behind Gregory.

Victoria and Julian were skilled chess players.

Noticing Isabella's intense focus, Julian approached her. "You play?"

"A little," Isabella replied.

Nathaniel nearly choked on his drink.

A little? That was the understatement of the century.

But he kept that thought to himself.

The opening moves were cautious as both players tested each other's styles.

As the game progressed, Gregory adopted an aggressive strategy while Alexander countered skillfully, searching for openings.

To the untrained eye, Alexander appeared to be struggling.

But reality told a different story.

Isabella's gaze grew sharper with each move.

Nathaniel, no amateur himself, leaned closer. "Who's winning?"

"Too close to call."

Victoria and Oliver exchanged skeptical glances at the vague answer. Nathaniel understood - Isabella wasn't being evasive without reason.

The truth was more complicated.

Alexander kept appearing to fall behind, only to miraculously recover.

Was he setting traps? Controlling the game's tempo? The match remained deadlocked regardless.

Isabella hesitated because she couldn't tell if Alexander wanted to win at all.

As the younger player, would he deliberately let Gregory win?

Just then, Gregory chuckled. "I may not be the best, Alexander, but if you keep holding back, I won't be pleased."

Alexander smiled. "It's been a while since I last played. I'm rusty."

Gregory snorted, unconvinced.

The game continued for another intense fifteen minutes before Gregory lost by a single piece.

Instead of disappointment, curiosity lit Gregory's eyes. He wanted to see Alexander's true skill. "Again," he demanded.

Alexander obliged without hesitation.

This time, Alexander played more aggressively. Gregory narrowed his eyes but only received a cheerful "Well played" in response.

Truthfully, Gregory was delighted - it had been years since he'd enjoyed a loss so much.

They immediately began a third match.

"Give me your best this time," Gregory ordered. "Don't treat me like some fragile old man."

"You misunderstand me, Mr. Whitmore."

Gregory waved him off and focused on the game.

The result was inevitable - another loss.

Gregory set down his piece and stood. "I concede - fairly beaten."

Before Alexander could respond, Gregory turned to the spectators. "Anyone else? At least make him work for it this time."
###Chapter 214

The idea barely formed in her mind when Alexander let out a low chuckle. "I might not be the greatest player, Nathaniel," he said, his fingers hovering over the chessboard. "But if you keep holding back, I won't take it as kindness."

Nathaniel Graves flashed a knowing smile. "It's been months since my last proper game. Consider this my warm-up round."

Alexander snorted, deliberately ignoring the obvious lie.

Truth be told, he was formidable. The match stretched over fifteen intense minutes before he finally conceded defeat - by a single pawn's advantage.

Rather than frustration, Alexander felt exhilaration. This was the first time in years someone had genuinely challenged him. "Again," he demanded, already resetting the pieces.

Nathaniel obliged without hesitation.

This time, Nathaniel played with ruthless precision. Alexander's eyebrows shot up at the aggressive opening move. "That's more like it," he murmured appreciatively.

Nathaniel merely smiled. "Just keeping you on your toes, Mr. Whitmore."

The truth was, Alexander hadn't enjoyed losing this much in decades. Each defeat only fueled his competitive spirit.

By the third match, Alexander slammed his palm on the table. "No more kid gloves! I may be old, but I'm not senile yet."

Nathaniel held up both hands in mock surrender. "You misunderstand me completely, sir."

Alexander waved him off, laser-focused on the board.

Predictably, he lost again.

With deliberate calm, he placed his king on its side. "Well played," he conceded. Then, raising his voice to the gathered spectators, "Anyone else care to try? I'm not asking you to beat him - just make the bastard work for it."
###Chapter 215

Isabella studied the chess moves with sudden intrigue, her fingers pausing mid-air.

Then Victoria's voice cut through the air. "Mr. Whitmore, I'd love to challenge Alexander after watching your match. Though with my skills, defeating him might be—"

"Oh, just having fun!" Gregory chuckled. "Give it a try if you'd like."

Victoria opened her mouth to respond when someone interjected. "If Ms. Kensington joins, this could get interesting."

"Right? Mr. Whitmore may be brilliant, but if he actually beats his girlfriend, he'll have some explaining to do later."

Laughter rippled through the crowd.

Gregory hadn't known about Victoria and Alexander's relationship.

Now, observing Victoria's poised demeanor, he nodded approvingly. She seemed every bit Alexander's equal.

With a teasing grin, he turned to Alexander. "Well then, let's see if you can keep your composure playing against your better half."

Victoria met Alexander's gaze evenly. "I don't believe in going easy. Let's play fair."

A faint smirk touched Alexander's sharp features. "Agreed."

Someone in the crowd quipped, "The game hasn't even started and we're already getting romance drama."

"Flirting aside," another added, "Ms. Kensington holds a PhD from Oxford. If she's this confident, she clearly knows her strategy."

Gregory raised an eyebrow. "A scholar, hm?" He nudged Alexander. "Good catch."

Nathaniel rolled his eyes.

He'd been about to ask if Isabella wanted to play instead.

But Victoria had already inserted herself.

Watching this unfold gave Nathaniel a headache. He muttered under his breath, "What nonsense is this?"

Though he spoke softly, both Isabella and Julian heard him.

Isabella let out an amused huff.

Julian noted her expression remained unreadable—cool and detached. It reassured him somehow.

The chess match between Alexander and Victoria began.

Isabella could tell Victoria was skilled.

Far from an amateur.

But still—

After a few moves, Isabella looked away.

Nathaniel caught on faster. He rolled his eyes again, itching to leave.

Noticing Isabella's fading interest, he asked, "Want to grab food at the pavilion instead?"

Isabella shook her head. "Let's stay a while longer."

Julian had noticed before Nathaniel—Isabella's attention had wandered.

Earlier, during Gregory and Alexander's match, she'd been laser-focused.

Now, after briefly observing Alexander and Victoria's game, she'd clearly lost interest.

While their match had its moments, Victoria's skills paled compared to Gregory's—let alone Alexander's.

Still, she played well.

Isabella's verdict?

"Not bad."

Just then, Walter's voice rang out nearby.

He and Sebastian had materialized beside Gregory.

Nathaniel suppressed another eye roll. The urge to leave intensified.

As Isabella's attention drifted further, he tried again. "Sure you don't want that snack?"

Isabella waved him off. "I'm fine here."

Julian had pieced it together first—Isabella's disengagement.

During Gregory and Alexander's match, she'd been riveted.

Now? Barely glancing at the board between Alexander and Victoria.

Their game had its back-and-forth, but Victoria clearly wasn't on Alexander's level.

Yet she held her own.

Isabella's assessment stood.

"Not bad at all."

Walter's voice cut through again.

He and Sebastian now flanked Gregory like unexpected chess spectators.
###Chapter 216

Alexander smiled. Indeed. It's quite impressive.

After speaking, he glanced at her. "Shouldn't you be working on your exhibition pieces? What brings you here?"

"Well," she shrugged, "I didn't want you thinking I'm neglecting my hosting duties."

"Go focus on your art," he waved dismissively. "Don't distract me from the game."

Yet Nathaniel remained.

When the Kensingtons heard Alexander and Nathaniel praising Victoria, proud smiles spread across their faces.

Many guests recognized Victoria, their expressions a mix of admiration and envy.

Victoria possessed both beauty and intellect. Now her chess skills had captured the attention of Nathaniel and Alexander.

Moreover, her charm had won Alexander's affection, elevating the Kensingtons' social standing effortlessly.

What parent wouldn't desire such a daughter?

"Your daughter and granddaughter are truly remarkable," one guest remarked enviously to the Kensingtons.

"Absolutely!" others chimed in. "How did you raise such an accomplished young woman? Lady Kensington, Mrs. Kensington, we'd love to hear your secrets."

Soon, a circle of society ladies surrounded the Kensingtons.

The lavish praise for Victoria made Penelope beam with pride.

She shot a glance at Isabella, whispering smugly to Genevieve, "She's clearly no match for Victoria, is she?" Eleanor's expression darkened at the comparison between her daughter and Isabella.

Beatrice and Reginald overheard Penelope's remark.

Their gazes shifted to Isabella.

Victoria outshone Isabella in every conceivable way.

They turned back to Victoria, their eyes filled with adoration.

Just then, Victoria stood. Facing Alexander, she said gracefully, "My apologies, I lost."

Alexander smiled warmly. "The outcome matters little. You performed exceptionally. Not everyone can match that young man from the Whitmores. Besides," he added, "it's rare to find someone as scholarly and skilled at chess as you."

Flattered, Victoria smiled. "You're too kind, Mr. Whitmore."

"Care for another match?" Alexander offered.

Victoria shook her head. "One attempt suffices. Let others have their turn."

Alexander scanned the room. "Would anyone else like to try?"

Julian's gaze flicked to Alexander, catching him holding a chess piece while staring intently.

At that moment, Isabella stepped forward. Meeting Alexander's eyes directly, she asked, "Shall we play a game?"

Alexander froze momentarily, studying her.

Shocked, Julian turned to stare at Isabella.

He couldn't believe she'd openly challenge Alexander to chess in this setting.

Julian wasn't the only surprised one. The Kensingtons, especially Victoria, looked utterly astonished. She'd never expected such boldness from Isabella.

Given Isabella's usual reserved nature, Victoria assumed she'd never publicly request a chess match with Alexander.

Yet here she was.

The Kensingtons frowned collectively.

Beatrice muttered, "I should have warned her beforehand if I'd known she'd pull this stunt."
###Chapter 217

Alexander broke the silence first. "Alright."

Isabella sat opposite him, her posture composed.

After the initial shock faded, Victoria's expression smoothed into its usual mask of calm.

She greeted Walter before moving to stand beside Alexander.

It wasn't just Julian who was surprised—the entire Kensington and Montgomery families were stunned. Even Sebastian and Walter hadn't seen this coming.

Though Nathaniel had introduced Isabella earlier at the gallery, they still knew very little about her.

Given her quiet, reserved demeanor, they assumed she wasn’t the type to seek attention.

So even if she knew chess, they never expected her to openly challenge someone like this.

Gregory didn’t know Isabella well, but he had noticed her presence.

With her striking beauty and poised manners, she seemed the epitome of an elegant, well-bred young woman.

To him, she appeared to be the perfect match for his grandson.

He never imagined she could play chess—let alone like this.

Alexander studied her. "You want to go first?"

The first move often held a strategic advantage.

Without hesitation, Isabella made her opening play.

Alexander countered swiftly.

At first, their moves were cautious, neither revealing too much.

No words were exchanged.

Isabella’s focus remained entirely on the board, barely sparing Alexander a glance.

Soon, Walter and Gregory realized her playing style mirrored her personality—calm, deliberate, and methodical.

She wasn’t just thinking a few moves ahead—she was orchestrating the entire game.

The realization left them speechless.

Earlier, they had praised Victoria for her quick reflexes and solid strategy. But in truth, she had merely been following Alexander’s lead—while he let her win.

That match had dragged on because Alexander had been guiding her, making it feel more like a playful exchange than a serious game.

Still, Victoria’s adaptability was impressive for her age.

But now—

Alexander quickly noticed Isabella wasn’t following his lead. Instead, she was steering him into her trap.

When he eased his attack, she didn’t relent. She seized the moment, defending flawlessly before launching a counterattack that forced him to hesitate.

He looked up at her, a faint smile tugging at his lips.

Gregory couldn’t help but applaud. "Brilliant!"

Nathaniel smirked, clearly amused.

Julian and Sebastian, however, were completely floored.

They had lost track of Isabella’s strategy long ago.

Her composed, defensive play had lulled them into overlooking her subtle maneuvers.

By now, it was clear—Isabella wasn’t just familiar with chess. She was a formidable player.

Victoria stood beside Alexander, mostly watching from his side.

Like Julian and the others, she had already lost track of his moves.

She had assumed Isabella would lose quickly.

But as she watched Alexander’s growing intensity—his focus sharper than when he played with her—she realized the truth.

When Walter and the others leaned in, fully engrossed, it hit her.

Isabella wasn’t just good.

She might even be better.
###Chapter 218

From that moment on, Victoria Kensington began scrutinizing Isabella Sinclair's every move.

Watching Isabella effortlessly dismantle the trap Alexander Whitmore had set—in a way Victoria never anticipated—sent a chill down her spine.

When Gregory Whitmore praised Isabella's strategy, Victoria's stomach twisted into knots.

Isabella remained completely focused on the chessboard, oblivious to the tension around her.

She was holding her own for now. But victory seemed increasingly impossible.

Pausing mid-game, she locked eyes with Alexander.

He made his countermove.

Isabella froze.

Nathaniel Graves let out an impressed chuckle. "Remarkable. Never thought I'd witness such mastery from someone so young."

Gregory scowled at the interruption. "Quiet!"

Nathaniel raised his hands in surrender.

Minutes later, Isabella executed a brilliant maneuver, subtly reclaiming control of the board.

Alexander responded with equal precision two minutes later.

Then Isabella placed her piece down with finality. "I concede."

The outcome was inevitable now.

Continuing would be pointless.

As she stood to leave, Alexander's voice stopped her. "Best two out of three?"

After only a heartbeat's hesitation, Isabella resumed her seat.

Nathaniel smirked at Frederick Aldridge. "Look at her—cool as ice, yet she can't resist challenging Alexander. How often does she get to play against someone of his caliber?"

Frederick nodded in silent agreement.

Nathaniel goaded further. "Bet you couldn't beat her either."

Though considered second only to Alexander in their circle, Frederick didn't hesitate. "No, I couldn't."

Isabella had only ever played chess against Frederick before today.

While she'd never won against him, Frederick's reactions made it clear—she was already a formidable opponent.

And she was still so young.

Frederick hadn't lost a game since he was fifteen.

Few earned such respect from him, regardless of age or gender.

Isabella's skill was undeniable.

By now, the board had been reset.

Alexander gestured. "Your move first this time?"

"No, you go ahead."

She'd sacrificed several pieces earlier and wanted to test her limits.

Just as Nathaniel suspected, quality opponents were rare for her outside Frederick.

She wouldn't waste this opportunity.

To her, Alexander was simply a worthy challenger—nothing more.

She wouldn't hold back just because of who he was.

Alexander didn't argue and made the opening move.

Silence descended as they played, the only sound being pieces clicking against the board.

Strangely, both Nathaniel and Gregory sensed an unspoken understanding between the players—as if they'd known each other far longer than possible.
###Chapter 219

Nathaniel and Walter exchanged glances, first at Alexander, then at Isabella. Their eyes finally settled on Victoria, brows furrowing in unison.

After a tense silence, Alexander broke the ice. "It's been years since you last played chess, hasn't it?"

Isabella barely looked up from examining the board, offering only a distracted hum in response.

She hadn't touched chess since marrying him.

"Your skills have dulled," Alexander observed bluntly.

Isabella remained silent, laser-focused on the chess pieces before her.

The game wasn't favoring her at this moment.

What appeared to be an opening in Alexander's defense was actually a carefully laid trap, his hidden pieces poised to strike.

She hesitated only briefly before sidestepping his ambush with a calculated move.

Suddenly, the tables had turned.

Alexander's lips curled into a smirk as he deliberated before placing his next piece.

The tension between them crackled like static electricity.

After several intense exchanges, Isabella finally conceded defeat - though barely.

Elsewhere in the room...

"What a shame," Walter murmured. "This match was even more thrilling than the first. She didn't have the first-move advantage, yet managed to decode half his strategy mid-game. The way she countered his attacks while setting up her own traps... Remarkable tactical thinking for someone so young."

He turned to Gregory with conviction. "You wouldn't stand a chance against her either."

"I know," Gregory admitted quietly.

Had he been in Isabella's place, he wouldn't have lasted half as long.

As Isabella methodically cleared the board, Alexander leaned forward. "Another round?"

Victoria's lips pressed into a thin line.

Before Isabella could respond, someone interjected, "The margin was so narrow! One more game and you might win!"

But Isabella shook her head firmly. "No, thank you."

The close match might have suggested she'd nearly cracked Alexander's strategy.

But she knew better - those glimpses of understanding were likely deliberate misdirection on his part.

Without another word, she stepped aside, making room for the next player.

Christopher immediately took her seat.

Nathaniel approached Isabella. "Let's get some refreshments."

"Alright."

Walter observed their easy camaraderie with a wistful expression. "The Graves heir is a lucky man."

Gregory nodded in silent agreement.

They'd once considered Victoria impressive. But after witnessing Isabella play, the difference was stark.

When it came to chess, they weren't even in the same league.

Isabella's poise and strategic brilliance spoke of exceptional upbringing. They'd considered asking about her relationship status, but Nathaniel's timely intervention made that unnecessary.

"They suit each other," Walter remarked pointedly, glancing at Sebastian beside him.

Sebastian caught the implication immediately.

With a resigned smile, he watched Isabella and Nathaniel depart before finally looking away.

Later, as they rested in the pavilion, Beatrice and Reginald approached.

From their perspective, Isabella's chess match had been a calculated move to capture Alexander's attention and prevent their divorce.

Moreover, Alexander's demeanor toward her had noticeably softened during the game - a marked improvement from before.

The Novel will be updated first on this website. Come back and continue reading tomorrow, everyone!
###Chapter 220

That look on his face spelled trouble.

They clearly wanted to speak with Isabella about something.

Reginald started first. "Bella, I—"

Before Isabella could respond, Nathaniel cut in with a dry chuckle. "Mr. Kensington, here to make some grand announcement about your relationship with Bella?"

Reginald's smile stiffened before he forced an awkward laugh. "Mr. Graves, I just need a private word with Bella. Could you—"

Nathaniel didn't let him finish. "If you're so eager to broadcast your relationship status, feel free to say whatever you want."

Reginald knew better than to provoke Nathaniel further.

With no other choice, he left with Beatrice in tow.

But before exiting, he turned back to Isabella. "I'll call you tonight. Don't ignore it."

Isabella remained silent.

She couldn't care less about his threats.

As for that call? Not happening.

Nathaniel clenched his fists. "I swear, one of these days I'm going to punch that smug face of his."

Isabella understood the sentiment all too well.

The problem was, with Alexander's accusations still hanging over her, she'd never been able to clear her name.

If she confronted the Kensingtons directly, Alexander and his cronies would twist it to protect Victoria.

She knew exactly how the Whitmores operated—they'd turn this against her in a heartbeat.

Her mother remained confined in that nursing home, completely at their mercy.

While talking with Nathaniel, Isabella noticed Alexander's group had abandoned their chess game.

Night was falling, so they decided to join Margaret.

Margaret and Harry had just concluded their art discussion.

Spotting some acquaintances, Harry excused himself to greet them.

Not wanting to impose, Margaret prepared to leave just as Isabella approached.

Upon learning of their departure, Harry insisted on gifting Margaret the painting she'd admired earlier—Silent Peaks.

After exchanging pleasantries, they left.

Outside, Alexander and Victoria still occupied the pavilion, deep in conversation.

They noticed the departing group.

Alexander's gaze flickered to Isabella before returning to Julian, Oliver, and the others.

Victoria caught the glance and smirked, deliberately looking away.

Julian gave Isabella a polite nod.

Isabella and Nathaniel returned the gesture before leaving without hesitation.

The next morning brought another hectic day at YodaVision.

With new projects launching, their workload tripled overnight. They dove in without pause.

The following days blurred together in a haze of nonstop work.

Then one afternoon, colleagues started handing out gingerbread cookies.

Isabella blinked in surprise. "Christmas already? Where did the time go?"

Her coworker stretched with a grin. "The city's all decked out. My friends and I are hitting the holiday markets later. Any plans?"

Isabella shook her head with a smile. Tucking the cookies aside, she returned to her screen.

After work, remembering her dying houseplant, she detoured to the mall.

The moment she stepped inside, Christmas assaulted her senses—glittering trees, oversized Santas, exactly as described.

The festive atmosphere was undeniable.

Shoppers packed the corridors, everyone paired up or in groups.

Taking in the cheerful chaos, Isabella suddenly froze mid-step.
###Chapter 221

Isabella adored Christmas.

Every December, she and Sophia would decorate their towering evergreen together.

On Christmas morning, they'd bundle up and wander the snowy streets, soaking in the holiday cheer with strangers who felt like family.

But after moving overseas with Alexander, Sophia never celebrated Christmas with her again. Truthfully, Isabella had stopped celebrating altogether.

She told herself she'd moved on. Yet this was the child she'd carried for nine months and raised for twelve years.

Now, standing alone in the festive crowd, the joyful atmosphere only amplified her loneliness.

"Ms. Sinclair?"

She turned to see Sebastian Ashford.

She forced a polite smile. "Mr. Ashford."

"Here alone?"

Isabella smoothed her expression. "Just picking up some last-minute decorations."

Sebastian had noticed her from across the square - that solitary figure standing motionless amidst the revelry, her melancholy palpable even from a distance.

He barely knew her, but whatever haunted her clearly weighed heavy. "Care for some mulled wine?"

She shook her head. "I should finish my shopping." Then, out of courtesy: "And you? No company tonight?"

"Dinner plans fell through," he admitted.

Seeing her distracted gaze, he added, "There's a fireworks display starting soon. Worth staying for."

Not an invitation - just information.

Isabella nodded absently. "Ah, that explains the crowd."

Before she could excuse herself, three familiar figures emerged through the throng.

Alexander. Victoria. And Sophia. Heading toward the plaza's center, clearly here for the show.

Sebastian followed her frozen stare, spotting the trio. His breath caught.

The rumors about Alexander having a child had circulated for years, always dismissed as baseless gossip.

Yet here was the evidence - a young girl walking between them on Christmas Eve.

Victoria seemed too young to be the mother. She'd been pursuing advanced degrees abroad these past years. The timeline made no sense.

While Sebastian puzzled over this, the group vanished into the crowd.

When he turned back, Isabella had already looked away.

He recalled her strained relationship with Victoria. But her reaction just now... that was something else entirely.

"Feel like walking?" he offered.

Fireworks.

Isabella had wanted to see them. Now...

Yet avoiding them because of Alexander would mean letting him take yet another thing from her.
###Chapter 222

Isabella smiled at Sebastian's invitation. "Okay."

They moved forward with the crowd.

As they reached the railing, dazzling fireworks erupted across the river. The crowd gasped and laughed, their voices swallowed by the thunderous explosions.

People snapped photos while others closed their eyes to make wishes.

Sebastian noticed Isabella simply watching in silence. "Want me to record this for you?"

She shook her head. "Just watching is perfect."

He didn't press further.

At that moment, Victoria's gaze swept across the crowd.

Though separated by several meters, Sebastian's towering height and striking features made him instantly recognizable. Having met him before, they were at least acquaintances.

Victoria was about to point him out to Alexander, who held little Sophia, when she suddenly spotted the figure half-hidden behind Sebastian.

Isabella.

Victoria's smile froze.

Why were they here together? Fireworks shows were for families or couples.

Aside from one dance at a gala, Isabella and Sebastian had barely interacted. What brought them here now?

She looked again. Definitely just the two of them.

"Victoria, look! It's amazing!" Sophia tugged at her sleeve, not wanting her to miss the spectacle. She cupped her hands around Victoria's ear, bubbling with excitement.

Victoria forced a smile. "Yes, darling. I see it."

Alexander noticed her distraction. "Everything alright?"

"Perfect," she lied.

Sophia was too enthralled by the fireworks to notice Isabella nearby.

But when Alexander turned to speak, his gaze landed on Isabella.

Since Sebastian was talking to her, Isabella happened to be looking in their direction.

Their eyes locked.

Isabella stiffened, pressed her lips together, and looked away.

Just then, Sebastian turned toward the fireworks, his profile now visible to Alexander.

Even in silhouette, Alexander recognized him instantly.

Seeing Alexander notice the pair, Victoria remarked, "I didn't expect to see them here together."

Alexander merely hummed in response, his expression unreadable.

Victoria's smile faltered. The thought of Isabella and Sebastian together made her stomach twist. Her eyes drifted back to Isabella.

Sebastian chose that moment to glance their way.

Noticing Victoria's stare, he gave a polite nod.

She returned the gesture with practiced grace.

Normally, he would have gone over to greet her. But given the tension between Isabella and Victoria, he stayed put.

Victoria's brow furrowed slightly before she looked away.

After that one glance, Alexander never looked at Isabella again.

As for Sophia? She was too busy capturing the fireworks with Alexander's phone to notice Isabella standing nearby.
###Chapter 223

"Miss, would you like some chocolate-dipped fruit?"

Isabella turned at the vendor's call.

The glistening strawberries on wooden skewers caught the festival lights perfectly, making her mouth water instantly. She couldn't remember the last time she'd indulged in such a treat.

Her gaze automatically sought out Sophia in the crowd.

Just as expected, the little girl was happily devouring her own chocolate-covered treat nearby.

Victoria stood beside Alexander, clutching an extravagant bouquet of red roses while chatting animatedly. Sophia offered her half-eaten skewer to Victoria without hesitation.

Victoria took a delicate bite directly from Sophia's hand before offering it to Alexander.

He shook his head with an inaudible refusal that made Isabella's chest tighten.

"I'll take the strawberry one," Isabella told the vendor.

Before she could ask Sebastian if he wanted anything, he'd already stepped forward. "Allow me."

In one fluid motion, he scanned his phone, completed the payment, and accepted the treat from the vendor before presenting it to her.

"It's just ten dollars," Isabella protested even as she accepted it.

"My pleasure," Sebastian replied with a smile that didn't reach his eyes.

Neither noticed Alexander and Victoria watching the exchange from across the plaza.

Alexander's jaw tightened imperceptibly while Victoria's smile froze in place.

The fireworks display lasted twenty spectacular minutes.

As the grand finale lit up the sky, Sophia tugged at Alexander's sleeve. "Daddy, what are you and Victoria looking at?"

"Nothing important," Alexander said smoothly, while Victoria forced another smile.

When the show ended, Isabella turned to Sebastian. "Thank you for the company - and the strawberries."

"Heading home now?"

"Yes, just need to grab some snacks first."

Sebastian didn't press further. "Goodnight then."

"Goodnight."

Isabella disappeared into the dispersing crowd while Sebastian made his way toward the parking garage.

He'd only taken a few steps when a familiar voice called out. "Sebastian?"

Dominic Fairchild approached with narrowed eyes. "What brings you here?"

"Dinner with a friend," Sebastian answered evenly. "You?"

Dominic shifted uncomfortably. "Same."

"I was just leaving. You?"

Dominic's reply died on his lips as his attention snapped to something behind Sebastian.

Following his gaze, Sebastian spotted Alexander and Victoria entering a nearby café with Sophia.

Dominic's expression darkened. "That child... Could the rumors be true? Does Whitmore really have a daughter?"

Sebastian shrugged. "Possibly."

Dominic stood rooted to the spot, lips pressed into a thin line.

If that girl was Alexander's child, what did that mean for Victoria's position?

And those persistent whispers about Alexander still being legally married...

If Alexander reconciled with his estranged wife because of their child, where would that leave Victoria?
###Chapter 224

Sebastian Ashford's phone buzzed urgently. After a brief conversation, he slipped it back into his pocket. "Business calls. I need to head back - care to join?"

Dominic Fairchild snapped from his thoughts, his dark eyes flickering with unreadable emotions. "No. I'm expecting someone. Another time."

"Understood." Sebastian departed without another word.

The moment his silhouette vanished, Dominic turned sharply toward the café entrance.

As he pushed through the glass doors, he collided with Victoria Kensington leading Sophia Whitmore toward the restrooms.

Both parties froze mid-step.

Victoria's eyes widened in recognition. "Mr. Fairchild? What an unexpected encounter."

"Indeed." Dominic let the door swing shut behind him, his gaze sweeping across the bustling café. His attention snagged on Alexander Whitmore placing an order at the counter.

When his eyes returned to Sophia, recognition struck like lightning.

The resemblance was undeniable - this child shared at least half of Alexander's features. Still, he feigned ignorance. "And this is...?"

Victoria's lashes fluttered downward. "Alexander's daughter."

Confirmation.

Dominic's stomach twisted.

Sophia suddenly piped up, tugging Victoria's sleeve. "Who's this handsome stranger?"

Victoria bent gracefully, tapping the child's nose. "An acquaintance of mine."

"Oh." Sophia nodded sagely.

Victoria turned back to Dominic. "Mr. Fairchild, are you meeting someone—"

"Victoria, NOW!" Sophia's urgent whisper-cut her off, small hands clutching desperately at her companion's arm. The milkshake's consequences had become dire.

Dominic's brow furrowed at the child's imperious tone. Yet Victoria remained unruffled, her smile patient. "Of course, darling. Right away."

She offered Dominic an apologetic glance. "Excuse us."

Watching their interaction, something primal stirred in Dominic's chest. "Actually, I could use the facilities myself. Shall we?"

Victoria nodded. "By all means."

Sophia couldn't wait another second. She wrenched free and bolted toward the restroom.

"Sophia!" Victoria abandoned decorum and sprinted after the child. "Wait for me!"

Dominic's frown deepened. The girl's behavior bordered on disrespectful.

Sophia suddenly skidded to a halt, head swiveling toward the crowded mall.

"Sophia?" Victoria caught up, immediately recognizing that searching look. Had she spotted Isabella?

Noticing Dominic's approach, Victoria quickly grasped Sophia's hand. "Darling, didn't you need—"

"Hmm." Sophia scanned the throng once more before shaking her head. Must've imagined it. She dashed into the restroom.

Unbeknownst to them, Isabella Sinclair stood precisely where Sophia had looked - obscured by the midday crowd.

Two souls separated by mere feet, yet worlds apart.
###Chapter 225

Moments later, Victoria Kensington, Sophia Whitmore, and Dominic Fairchild emerged from the restroom.

Sophia was at that wonderfully curious age where everything fascinated her. She darted from one shop window to another, chattering excitedly to Victoria the entire time.

Victoria responded with patient smiles, indulging the little girl’s endless questions.

Dominic observed them quietly. He couldn’t help but notice how naturally Victoria cared for Alexander’s daughter. It made him realize just how much effort parenting required.

Back at the café, Dominic’s gaze immediately sought out Alexander.

The man sat comfortably at their table, sipping his coffee while flipping through a magazine. He looked completely at ease—like someone who had delegated all responsibilities without a second thought.

Dominic hesitated.

Earlier, on their way to the restroom, he had mentioned meeting a friend here.

Once inside, Victoria turned to him. "Has your friend arrived yet?"

Dominic shook his head. "Not yet."

"Why don’t you join us for a while?" she offered.

"You two are on a date. I wouldn’t want to intrude."

Victoria laughed lightly. "Alexander won’t mind."

So Dominic followed them to Alexander’s table.

The first thing he noticed was the extravagant bouquet of red roses placed beside Alexander’s seat.

No doubt they were for Victoria. Perhaps Alexander wasn’t as indifferent toward her as Dominic had assumed.

"Daddy, we’re back!" Sophia chirped, immediately reclaiming her seat.

Alexander acknowledged her with a hum before turning his attention to Victoria—only then noticing Dominic.

"Mr. Fairchild?"

Dominic nodded. "I ran into Ms. Kensington at the entrance. When I saw you were here too, I thought I’d say hello."

After exchanging pleasantries, Dominic observed their easy dynamic. He decided not to linger. "My friend should be here soon. I’ll leave you to your evening."

Alexander didn’t press. "Next time, then."

Dominic gave Victoria one last glance before finding a nearby table.

The trio spoke in hushed tones, their conversation too quiet for him to overhear.

About twenty minutes later, Alexander stood to leave. Before exiting, he approached Dominic.

"Heading out already?" Dominic asked.

"Yes," Alexander replied simply. "Until next time."

As Alexander walked away, Dominic noticed Victoria and Sophia remained. "You’re not leaving with him?"

Victoria smiled. "He’s bringing the car around from the underground parking."

The café was street-side, while the parking garage was a short distance away. Having Alexander retrieve the car was a thoughtful gesture.

Dominic chuckled.

Victoria tilted her head. "Did your friend ever arrive?"

"No," Dominic admitted.

A knowing glint flickered in Victoria’s eyes, but she didn’t call him out. "Will you keep waiting?"

"No."

After a brief pause, Victoria’s phone buzzed. "That’s our cue," she said.

Dominic nodded. "Safe travels."

As they said their goodbyes outside the café, Sophia suddenly released Victoria’s hand and turned sharply.

"Sophia?"

The little girl was certain she’d spotted Isabella Sinclair this time. But the crowd was too thick, and her small frame couldn’t see past the shifting bodies.

She tugged Victoria’s sleeve. "Victoria, I think I just saw—"

Victoria gently interrupted. "Your father’s waiting. Let’s go."
###Chapter 226

Isabella Sinclair scanned her surroundings once more. Confirming Victoria Kensington was nowhere in sight, she departed with Sophia Whitmore.

Dominic Fairchild watched their retreating figures, preparing to leave when he suddenly spotted Isabella standing nearby.

His steps faltered.

Recognizing her, he initially decided to ignore her completely. But then he noticed Isabella's piercing gaze fixed on Victoria and Sophia.

Her expression was glacial, her eyes even colder. The intensity of her stare made it seem like she was looking at an enemy rather than just another person.

That predatory glare made Dominic suspect Isabella might actually intend harm toward Victoria.

He observed her silently, convinced she still harbored resentment. So he approached.

Isabella was laden with purchases - two potted plants and several decorative pieces. The ornaments had been an impulse buy.

Since moving into her new apartment, she'd been too preoccupied to properly decorate, leaving her living space feeling stark and empty.

She'd only intended to buy plants today, but spotting a nearby store selling cabinet decor, she'd picked up a few items.

Just as she was leaving, she'd unexpectedly encountered Victoria and Sophia again.

After they left, she was about to continue her errands when Dominic intercepted her.

"What are you plotting?" he demanded.

Isabella stopped mid-step. "Excuse me?"

Dominic's voice turned icy. "She doesn't even acknowledge your existence. Yet you're still nursing this grudge? How pathetic."

"She doesn't acknowledge me?" Isabella's gaze turned arctic. "You really worship the ground she walks on, don't you?"

To Dominic, Victoria was perfection incarnate.

Before he could respond, Isabella continued, "So? What's your point? Came to warn me not to touch your precious Victoria?"

That was precisely his intention.

Isabella let out a derisive laugh. "Not even Alexander Whitmore has dared say that to me. Yet here you are, Mr. Fairchild, rushing to her defense. What gives you that right? Are you Victoria's secret admirer?"

Dominic made no effort to conceal his feelings for Victoria in Isabella's presence.

At her taunt, he retorted coldly, "So what you're saying is - I should go remind Mr. Whitmore to keep an eye on you?"

He recalled that gala where Alexander had asked Isabella to dance. Both he and Sebastian Ashford had assumed it was merely a warning to leave Victoria alone.

"Or," he added pointedly, "do you think Alexander's previous warning wasn't strong enough?"

Isabella didn't respond immediately. She simply studied him with faint mockery in her eyes.

Then she suddenly asked, "Are you really Richard Fairchild's son?"

Her limited interactions with Richard had shown her a man of warmth and wisdom, a true leader. Aside from superficial resemblance, she saw none of Richard's qualities in Dominic.

Then again, perhaps Dominic was simply too blinded by his obsession with Victoria to think clearly.

Dominic stiffened at the mention of his father. Her tone suggested familiarity - but how could she possibly know Richard?

His expression darkened. "What are you implying?"

Isabella ignored the question. "Weren't you going to have Alexander warn me? Fine. I'll be waiting."

With that, she turned and walked away without a backward glance.
###Chapter 227

Alexander's phone buzzed the moment he and Sophia stepped into the mansion.

He answered immediately.

After a brief conversation, he slipped his coat back on. "Grandmother Eleanor had a fall," he told Sophia, who was heading upstairs. "She's at Baumond Hospital. I'm going now. You should rest."

Sophia's face paled. "I want to come too—"

"School tomorrow," Alexander cut in gently. "Visit after class."

Sophia nodded reluctantly.

As Alexander turned to leave, Sophia's phone pinged. Her heart leaped as she checked it.

Just another spam message. She sighed.

Earlier, she'd tried calling Isabella about that mysterious woman at the mall. No answer.

For a split second, she'd hoped this message was from Isabella. No such luck.

Still... if Isabella had time for Christmas shopping, she would've invited Sophia along.

Must've been mistaken.

An hour later at Baumond Orthopedic, Alexander reviewed the scans with the doctors.

Eleanor had fractured her femur. Surgery was necessary, but not immediately.

They needed to stabilize her first.

Most Whitmores were traveling. Only Richard Thornton, Eleanor's caretaker Margaret, and Alexander were present.

Richard had already notified the family.

When Alexander entered the room, Eleanor turned her face away.

He pulled up a chair. "Still angry?"

This stemmed from his recent business decisions favoring the Graves over the Kensingtons. Eleanor hadn't taken his calls since.

Silence.

"What do you want me to do?" Alexander finally asked.

Eleanor opened her eyes. "You know."

He did. "Consider it handled tomorrow." Meaning cutting ties with the Kensingtons and reclaiming their projects.

"And?"

Alexander's jaw tightened. "Grandmother—"

Eleanor closed her eyes again.

He didn't press further.

"Go," Eleanor murmured later.

Instead of leaving, Alexander adjusted her blankets.

When the doctor returned, he confirmed surgery could proceed in two days. Low-risk procedure. With rehab, Eleanor should walk with assistance within a month.

In the hallway, Richard glanced back at Eleanor. "She wants to see Mrs. Whitmore but won't let me call her."

Eleanor felt too guilty to ask Isabella to visit after everything.

Alexander nodded. "Understood."

Richard returned to the room without another word.
###Chapter 228

Alexander didn't leave the hospital that night.

By morning, Catherine and Victoria Whitmore, along with other relatives, returned to visit Eleanor.

When they learned Alexander had stayed all night, they insisted he go home to rest.

Alexander told Eleanor, "I'll come back tonight."

Eleanor remained silent.

After leaving the hospital, Alexander made a phone call.

Within an hour, the Kensingtons and their allies received notice of their removal from the project team.

They immediately contacted Victoria Kensington.

Victoria said, "It was Madam Whitmore's decision. She had a difficult night."

The Kensingtons hadn't anticipated this development.

Lawrence asked, "Does this mean Madam Whitmore demanded you break up with Alexander and prevent his divorce from Isabella?"

Victoria pressed her lips together tightly.

After brief discussion, she ended the call.

A knock interrupted her thoughts. "Ms. Kensington, the meeting is starting."

"Understood."

Victoria set down her phone and headed toward the conference room. On her way, she spotted Isabella Sinclair discussing work with Maxwell Sterling.

She knew the collaboration between YodaVision and InnovaTech continued, requiring periodic system maintenance visits.

But she hadn't expected to encounter Isabella at InnovaTech today.

Isabella sensed someone watching her. Turning, she met Victoria's gaze briefly before looking away without hesitation.

Around 10:00 am, Isabella visited the restroom.

Emerging, she found Alexander waiting by the wall.

Without pausing, she moved to walk past when Alexander spoke. "Grandmother fell last night. She fractured her femur and needs bone cement."

Isabella froze, turning to face him.

Alexander provided the hospital name and room number. "She'd like to see you."

Isabella remained silent.

At that moment, Victoria exited the restroom.

Seeing Alexander, Victoria's surprise was evident. She hadn't expected him here - talking to Isabella.

She stopped, lips pressed together.

Isabella ignored them both, returning to the restroom.

When she emerged again, both had disappeared.

Isabella resumed work.

By 11:00 am, maintenance complete, Isabella and her YodaVision team departed.

At lunch, Isabella told Margaret about Eleanor's fall.

Margaret gasped. "We'll visit tonight."

Regardless of Isabella's situation with Alexander, Eleanor had helped the Sinclairs during their darkest days.

Without Eleanor's assistance, the Sinclairs wouldn't be where they were today.

Margaret would never forget that kindness.

Isabella nodded. "Alright."

That afternoon, Isabella left work early. After dinner at home, she accompanied Margaret to the orthopedic hospital.

"Mommy!"

Sophia spotted them immediately, running to hug Isabella's legs excitedly.
###Chapter 229

Isabella wasn't startled to find Sophia waiting at the hospital entrance. She reached out, ruffling the child's hair. "Came straight from school?"

"Mm-hmm!" Sophia beamed up at her before turning to greet Eleanor. "Grandma!"

Just as Eleanor responded, Alexander emerged from the hospital room.

His gaze swept over them before giving a curt nod in acknowledgment.

Margaret remained impassive, offering no verbal greeting.

Isabella barely glanced his way before focusing on Sophia again. The girl was practically vibrating with unspoken words.

"Grandma and I will visit your grandmother first," Isabella said gently.

Sophia's shoulders slumped slightly but she nodded.

Small fingers curled around Isabella's as they entered the hospital suite together.

Alexander silently collected the floral arrangement and fruit basket they'd brought, following behind.

Eleanor's face lit up when she saw them. "What a lovely surprise!"

As she tried sitting up despite obvious discomfort, Margaret intervened. "Nonsense. You should have told us immediately about something this serious."

Eleanor's smile dimmed. She glanced at Alexander, who was pouring tea for the visitors. "I couldn't face you..."

Isabella and Margaret accepted the cups he offered.

"This is between them," Margaret said firmly. "Why would we blame you?"

Eleanor hesitated, noticing Sophia listening intently. She changed tack. "I just..."

Margaret patted her hand. "We understand."

After exchanging pleasantries, attention shifted to Isabella.

Sophia hadn't seen her since the school parent-child event weeks ago. Now the child clung like ivy, even attempting to climb into Isabella's lap.

With a sigh, Isabella set down her tea and lifted the girl up.

Margaret raised an eyebrow at the display.

"Grandmother," Isabella murmured.

Margaret's stern expression softened instantly.

Conversation remained light with Sophia present, focusing mainly on Eleanor's upcoming procedure.

When Margaret learned the surgery was scheduled for morning, she declared, "I'll be here with you."

Eleanor squeezed her hand gratefully. "That would mean everything."

The promise of company clearly eased some tension.

Mid-conversation, Eleanor suddenly remembered. "You haven't eaten, have you? Alexander, arrange—"

"No need," Margaret cut in. "We dined before coming."

She turned coolly to Alexander. "If you and Sophia need supper, don't let us delay you."

Sophia hadn't shared a meal with Isabella in weeks. She wrapped arms around Isabella's neck pleadingly. "Mommy, please come? I've missed you so much."

Memories of last night's revelations flashed behind Isabella's eyes. Her smile didn't reach them as she gently detached small hands.

"I'm exhausted from work today, sweetheart. You two go ahead."

Sophia's lower lip trembled but she didn't argue. Snuggling closer, she inhaled Isabella's familiar perfume, unwilling to let go just yet.
###Chapter 230

Isabella turned to Alexander, who sat nearby observing them. "Daddy, I want to eat here. Can we get the food packed to go?"

Alexander nodded. "Of course."

Sophia immediately brightened and clung tighter to Isabella.

Margaret and Eleanor were deep in conversation. Isabella remained mostly silent, only occasionally adding a comment.

After a while, Sophia grew tired and asked, "Mommy, when will you finish work?"

Not wanting Margaret to hear, Isabella carried her to the couch near the hospital bed. "I'm not sure," she whispered. "If things go as planned, I might actually get busier."

"What?" Sophia's face fell with disappointment.

"Then when will you take me skiing?" She hadn't forgotten their promise.

Isabella considered for a moment. "Next month."

"Really?"

"Mmm." Isabella nodded. "I'll let you know when I'm free."

"Yay!" Sophia instantly perked up.

Remembering last night, she suddenly asked, "Mommy, did you go shopping yesterday?"

Isabella hesitated but answered, "Yes."

"Oh! So that really was you I saw?"

"Maybe." As Isabella spoke, she noticed Alexander glancing sideways at her.

Sophia hadn't gone shopping with Isabella in ages. She used to find aimless wandering boring, but now she missed it terribly.

"Next time you're free, can we go shopping together?" Sophia begged. "And we have to play bumper cars at the arcade!"

Isabella averted her gaze. "Alright."

While Sophia chattered away, Alexander picked up Isabella's cup. He poured out the cold water, refilled it with warm water, and placed it back on the coffee table before her.

Isabella met his eyes. "Thank you."

"You're welcome." He settled onto the couch beside them.

Eleanor and Margaret had been chatting amiably, but seeing the three of them together as a family, Eleanor paused mid-sentence.

Following her gaze, Margaret looked over but showed no reaction. She simply turned away.

Eleanor sighed. "You see—"

"If they've made their choice, we shouldn't interfere," Margaret interrupted.

Eleanor sighed again.

Soon, the food Alexander ordered arrived—an elaborate spread clearly meant for more than two people.

"Have some too," Alexander said to Isabella.

She noticed half the dishes were her favorites. Not only that, but Alexander had arranged them all within her reach.

"Sophia," he said, "go ask Granny to join us for dinner."

"Okay!"

Sophia finally slid off Isabella's lap and ran to pull Margaret's hand, inviting her to eat.

Eleanor added, "Go ahead. Otherwise I'll feel guilty asking you to keep me company tomorrow."

With no choice, Margaret came and sat at the table.

Noticing all of Isabella's favorite dishes placed before her, Margaret paused slightly and glanced at Alexander.
###Chapter 231

Isabella remained composed.

As she had anticipated—with Alexander's sharp memory, recalling these details wasn't surprising. His preparation of these dishes was likely just his way of expressing gratitude for their visit to Eleanor.

It held no deeper meaning.

After finishing their meal, Isabella and Margaret lingered another hour before preparing to leave.

Noticing the late hour, Eleanor didn't insist they stay. "You and Sophia should head home early too," she told Alexander.

"Understood," Alexander replied. "I'll see you tomorrow morning."

The four of them exited the hospital room together.

Once inside the elevator, Alexander asked, "Did you drive here?"

Isabella gave a brief nod.

Alexander remained silent, but Sophia suddenly piped up, "Mom, are you going home tonight?"

"No," Isabella answered. "I'm taking Grandma home and staying at her place."

"Then I want to stay at Grandma's house too!"

Though Sophia had grown closer to Alexander recently, in Margaret's eyes, she would always be Isabella's daughter.

Hearing Sophia's request, Margaret smiled warmly. "Of course, darling."

Since Margaret had agreed, Isabella didn't object.

However, she reminded Sophia, "You don't have any spare clothes at Grandma's."

Before Sophia started spending more time with Alexander, Isabella used to take her to the Sinclair residence frequently. Back then, she and Caroline had filled half a wardrobe with outfits for her.

But in recent years, Sophia's visits had decreased significantly. With children growing so quickly, neither Isabella nor Caroline had continued replenishing her wardrobe.

Now, there were no clothes at the Sinclair residence that would fit her.

Sophia's face fell. "Oh..."

Alexander spoke up then. "I'll have someone deliver some clothes."

Isabella hesitated briefly but remained silent.

Sophia brightened immediately. "Yay! I get to sleep with Mom tonight!"

Outside the hospital, Sophia happily followed Isabella to her car while Alexander retrieved Sophia's backpack from his vehicle and handed it to her.

"Thank you, Dad!" Sophia beamed.

Alexander ruffled her hair and glanced at Isabella, already seated in the driver's seat. She didn't look back, simply saying, "Sophia, say goodbye to your father."

"Bye, Dad!"

"Goodbye." As Alexander responded, Isabella rolled up the window, turned the steering wheel, and drove away.

By the time they reached the Sinclair residence, Sophia's clothes had already arrived.

As Sophia raced upstairs, Margaret said to Isabella, "At least he's not preventing you from being close to Sophia. That's something."

She'd been concerned that with custody granted to Alexander, he might restrict Isabella's access to their daughter. Over time, that could have eroded their mother-daughter bond.

For any mother, that would have been unbearable.

Isabella didn't explain anything to Margaret. She simply murmured in agreement, reminded her to rest early, and went upstairs.

The next morning, the Sinclair family had breakfast downstairs with Sophia.

Just then, the security booth notified them of a visitor.

Isabella glanced at the screen—Alexander's car had arrived.
###Chapter 232

Sophia leaned closer to the window. Spotting Alexander's car, she gasped. "Mom! It's Dad! Let him in!"

Isabella barely glanced up. "Hmm."

The Sinclair family exchanged surprised looks at this unexpected visit. Though curious, they remained silent out of respect for Sophia's presence.

Moments later, Alexander arrived at the door.

Isabella met him outside. "Here to take Grandma Margaret for her hospital check-up?"

"Yes."

She nodded curtly. "Wait here."

Alexander remained in his car without protest.

Nearly fifteen minutes passed before Margaret finally emerged.

Seeing her, Alexander immediately stepped out and opened the passenger door.

Sophia grabbed her schoolbag, calling out, "Bye, Dad!"

"Have a good day at school."

After exchanging polite nods with Isabella and the Sinclairs, Alexander drove off.

Isabella took Sophia to school in her own car.

At 11:30 AM, while buried in work documents, Isabella received a call from Margaret. "The procedure went perfectly."

Relief washed over Isabella. She'd barely set down her phone when Alexander called. She let it ring out.

Seconds later, a text appeared: "Taking Grandma for lunch. Join us?"

Isabella left it unanswered. Alexander always understood her silences.

True to form, no follow-up messages came.

But at noon, Emily called. "Bella! I just saw your almost-ex-husband helping your grandmother into La Belle Époque!"

Before Isabella could explain, Emily gasped. "Don't tell me you're getting back together?"

"Hardly."

Flipping through a contract, Isabella briefly explained Eleanor Whitmore's fall and hospitalization. "He's just repaying the kindness."

That explained this morning's personal chauffeur service.

Emily sounded disappointed. "So... just obligation?"

"Exactly."

His very politeness proved it. Every considerate act was another brick in the wall between them.

Only a fool would mistake this for reconciliation.

Isabella worked late. By the time she reached the hospital, dusk had fallen.

As she stepped from her car, she spotted Victoria Kensington leaning against a silver Mercedes.

Their eyes met. Victoria's lips curled in that familiar smirk as she raked Isabella with a disdainful glance.

Isabella slammed her car door without acknowledgment, cradling the bouquet of white lilies.

The VIP ward hummed with quiet efficiency.

Pushing open the door, she found Alexander, Julian, and Oliver inside. Victoria's presence downstairs suddenly made sense.

Had she already visited Eleanor? Isabella couldn't be sure.

Oliver smirked at her entrance.

Julian stood abruptly.

Alexander approached. "You made it."

Isabella ignored him, her gaze finding Eleanor. Only then did her face soften. "Grandmother."
###Chapter 233

Isabella had no choice but to hand the flowers to Alexander when he reached out.

She deliberately avoided looking at Oliver or Julian, walking straight to the hospital bed. "How are you feeling, Grandma Eleanor?" she asked.

"Still some pain, but manageable," Eleanor replied weakly.

The elderly woman looked exhausted after her recent surgery.

She grasped Isabella's hand gently. "You've been working all day. Have you eaten? Why don't you join Alexander and his friends for dinner?"

"I already ate at the office," Isabella answered curtly.

Noticing Isabella's continued distance from Alexander, Eleanor didn't press further.

Their conversation lasted only a few more minutes before Eleanor grew tired. As Isabella prepared to leave, Eleanor insisted Alexander walk her out since they were all heading to dinner anyway.

In the elevator, Oliver kept staring at Isabella with undisguised curiosity. She turned sharply. "See something interesting?"

"Almost," he smirked.

Isabella ignored him.

When the doors opened, she strode out first, maintaining several paces between herself and the men.

Oliver leaned toward Alexander, whispering, "Her attitude toward you has changed dramatically. Has she really moved on? I find that hard to believe."

Alexander watched Isabella's retreating back without responding.

Julian, who hadn't heard, asked, "What are you two discussing?"

Oliver repeated his question.

Julian reacted identically to Alexander - both men simply observed Isabella's departing figure in silence.

At the hospital entrance, Alexander suddenly called out, "Sophia is still at the Sinclair residence."

Isabella's step faltered momentarily, but she continued walking to her car without acknowledgment.

That's when she noticed Victoria still waiting outside.

While Isabella headed straight for her vehicle, the three men approached Victoria instead.

Isabella drove off without a backward glance, returning directly to the Sinclair estate.

"Mom! You're back!" Sophia exclaimed when Isabella entered, looking up from where she played with William and Edward.

Isabella closed the door against the winter chill, removing her coat. "Yes."

Sophia abandoned her tablet to hug Isabella's legs. "Dad said I can stay with you for days! After visiting Grandma tomorrow, can we go skiing?"

Before Isabella could answer, William and Edward chimed in, "Yes, Isabella! Let's all go!"

"Alright," Isabella agreed.

Sophia cheered, grabbing her phone. "I'm calling Dad to tell him!"

Isabella didn't listen to their conversation, heading upstairs instead.

The next morning at the hospital, Victoria was absent, though Alexander appeared to have relocated his office there temporarily.

When Isabella and Sophia arrived, he was reviewing documents.

"Dad!" Sophia called.

Before Alexander could respond, she noticed the side table laden with trendy snacks, fruits, and drinks popular with children.
###Chapter 234

Sophia dashed over with sparkling eyes. "Look at all this amazing food! And milkshakes too!"

Alexander gave a knowing smile. "I anticipated your arrival, so I made preparations."

His gaze lingered on Isabella, who deliberately avoided eye contact. Turning instead to William and Edward, he gave them a brief nod before standing. "Sit."

The commanding presence Alexander exuded was undeniable.

After greeting Eleanor, William and Edward instinctively obeyed, joining Sophia as she and Alexander distributed the snacks.

Once the children began eating, Alexander handed Isabella a drink. "Try this?"

Noticing Eleanor's watchful eyes, Isabella accepted with a polite, "Thank you."

The first sip revealed strawberry flavor—her absolute favorite.

When Eleanor heard about the skiing plans, she turned to Alexander. "You should join Isabella and the children."

She continued firmly, "Skiing can be dangerous. It's too much for Isabella to supervise three kids alone. Go with them. I have Richard and Margaret here—you don't need to hover over me constantly."

Isabella opened her mouth to protest, but Alexander cut in smoothly, "Understood."

Sophia clapped her hands in delight at the news of her father's participation.

After spending more time at the hospital, Isabella's group prepared to leave.

Alexander gathered his documents before following them out.

They took separate cars, with Sophia, William and Edward riding with Isabella.

At the ski resort, Alexander was adjusting Sophia's goggles when his phone rang. After a brief conversation, he said, "I'll join you later."

Sophia tilted her head. "Daddy, who was that?"

Instead of answering directly, Alexander asked, "Would you rather have lunch with me or your mother?"

Sophia blinked in confusion. "Aren't we all eating together?"

"No," Alexander replied. "I have business to attend to."

Isabella and the others overheard but remained silent.

Alexander ruffled Sophia's hair. "No need to decide now. Go enjoy the slopes first."

"Okay!"

While the children chattered nearby, Isabella adjusted her goggles and met Alexander's gaze. "The divorce still isn't finalized?"

"Not yet," he confirmed.

After a pause, he added, "If you need immediate funds, I can arrange an advance transfer—"

"That's not what I meant," Isabella began, but Sophia's voice interrupted. "Mommy, come see this!"

As Isabella turned to respond, her phone buzzed—a call from Charles.

"Someone from Whitmore Enterprises just reached out," he said excitedly. "They want to discuss a potential partnership!"

Whitmore Enterprises was currently under Alexander's control. With his business acumen, Charles knew such offers never came without strings attached.

He needed Isabella's insight—was this a genuine opportunity or a carefully laid trap?

Isabella remained silent for a long moment.

Ending the call, she turned slowly to face Alexander.
###Chapter 235

Isabella turned to Alexander with a composed expression. "My uncle mentioned someone from Whitmore Enterprises approached him about a potential collaboration."

Alexander opened his mouth to respond, but Isabella continued smoothly. "I understand you don't want to feel indebted to me or my grandmother. This is your way of showing gratitude."

She met his gaze steadily. "But when we visit your grandmother at the hospital, we do it for her sake - not yours. There's no need to offer us any business deals."

Her fingers tightened around her phone case. If her family accepted anything from Whitmore Enterprises, the Kensingtons and their allies would undoubtedly create problems.

Even if Alexander's intentions were genuine now, his heart belonged to Victoria Kensington. What if he changed his mind later? Today's favor could become tomorrow's liability. The Sinclairs couldn't afford that risk.

Her voice turned cool. "You can rest assured - once the divorce is finalized, we'll go our separate ways completely. I won't interfere in your life again."

To her, this business offer was just another way for Alexander to establish boundaries between them. Was he so eager to sever ties because he feared she'd cling to him?

That ship had sailed.

Alexander remained silent for several heartbeats before responding. "Understood."

Isabella didn't elaborate. She texted her decision to Charles before joining the others for skiing.

The outing proceeded without incident, though Isabella spent most of her time with William, Edward, and Sophia. Her interactions with Alexander remained strictly necessary, and he didn't initiate conversation either.

At noon, Alexander announced his early departure.

Isabella nodded indifferently. "Fine."

Alexander turned to Sophia. "Sophie, do you—"

"I'm watching a movie with Mom, William, and Edward!" The children had planned this outing together before inviting Isabella along.

Alexander gave a curt nod. "Enjoy."

With a brief glance at Isabella, he left.

Ten minutes later, Isabella's phone rang. Jonathan Blackwood, her divorce attorney, sounded slightly surprised. "Alexander just contacted me. He's preparing a revised divorce agreement by tonight. The main change involves property division—he's adding two or three high-value estates to your settlement."

Isabella's expression didn't flicker.

So this was how he interpreted her refusal? Did he think she'd been playing hard to get? That she still wanted something from him?

Her reply was measured. "I understand. I have no objections. Handle it as you see fit."

Meanwhile, Alexander had already collected Victoria Kensington en route to an upscale restaurant.

The private dining room buzzed with activity when they arrived. Besides the Kensingtons, several other influential guests filled the large table.

Reginald Kensington and Lawrence Kensington beamed when Alexander entered with Victoria.

Victoria took her seat beside Penelope Kensington while Alexander engaged Simon Fairchild and Ronan Sinclair in business discussion.

Penelope leaned toward Victoria, whispering urgently. "Your uncle and I just learned Alexander offered a Whitmore Enterprises project to the Sinclair family!"

Victoria's smile didn't waver. "I'm already aware."
###Chapter 236

Penelope's voice trembled with anxiety. "I heard Alexander has been in constant contact with Isabella and the Sinclairs since Eleanor's accident."

Her fingers twisted the napkin. "Yesterday, someone spotted Alexander dining with Margaret Sinclair. Are they... reconnecting?"

Victoria's lips thinned. "There was never any connection to begin with." The word choice irritated her.

Seeing Penelope's distress, Victoria explained patiently. "Mrs. Whitmore shares a close bond with the Sinclairs. Alexander must maintain good relations with Isabella and her grandmother to ensure they keep visiting Eleanor."

"That way, Eleanor can't use her surgery as leverage to force Alexander to end things with me."

The realization struck Penelope like lightning. She hadn't considered this angle.

Since Eleanor's fall, both families had been banned from Whitmore Enterprises. For days, they'd lived in fear that Eleanor would demand Alexander and Victoria separate as her condition for surgery.

They'd dreaded Alexander might comply.

Now that the couple remained together, they'd assumed Alexander had persuaded Eleanor. But instead, he'd cleverly navigated through the Sinclairs.

Penelope exhaled in relief. "So the project... was that Alexander's way of thanking them?"

Victoria nodded. "A token of gratitude and a clear boundary marker."

Penelope couldn't help but admire him. "Alexander leaves no loose ends. No wonder his businesses thrive."

Just as satisfaction began to bloom, a dark thought clouded her features. "But if the Sinclairs already secured a deal with YodaVision..."

Her nails dug into her palms. "Their company's showing signs of recovery. If they take this Whitmore project too, won't they fully revive?"

Victoria's expression turned glacial. "They declined it."

"They what?"

Before Victoria could elaborate, Penelope pieced it together. "They want Alexander indebted, giving Isabella continued access to him." Her lips curled. "How cunning."

With Alexander and Isabella's divorce nearly finalized, Penelope wouldn't tolerate complications.

"We can't let them manipulate—"

Victoria remained unshaken. "Relax. Alexander has it handled."

Penelope recalled past events. Alexander had never failed them.

If he'd offered the project, he'd surely anticipated the Sinclairs' maneuvering.

That shrewd man must have countermeasures prepared.

Finally reassured, Penelope changed subjects. "Have you visited Mrs. Whitmore recently?"

Victoria shook her head. "No."

At Penelope's disappointed look, she explained, "Her recovery appears smooth. No complications."

Now wasn't the time for her presence.

Though Alexander had managed the Sinclairs and convinced Eleanor to undergo surgery, the post-operative period remained critical.

They still needed Isabella and Margaret's cooperation.

Victoria could wait.
###Chapter 237

Isabella purchased movie tickets during lunch. After their meal, they enjoyed the film and spent some time shopping afterward.

While William tried on clothes and Edward browsed collectible figurines, Isabella turned to Sophia. "I'll take you home now."

"Home?" Sophia frowned, sitting beside her. "I don't want to leave yet. Can't I stay at Grandma's one more night? I'll return tomorrow evening."

Isabella sipped her water calmly. "William and Edward have entertained you all day. Tomorrow they need to focus on schoolwork. Your presence would distract them."

"I don't need them to entertain me. I can play games on my tablet alone."

Without further discussion, Isabella discreetly messaged Alexander, requesting someone to collect Sophia later.

Alexander must have been occupied - his reply took unusually long.

After William finished shopping, they strolled briefly before returning to the Sinclair residence.

Margaret and Charles were genuinely delighted to see Sophia. Their affection for the girl was unmistakable.

Sophia possessed remarkable charm.

She even accompanied Margaret on an evening walk after dinner, bringing the older woman visible joy.

Still no response from Alexander.

Sophia ended up spending the night at the Sinclairs'.

The next morning, William and Edward retreated to their rooms to study as planned. True to her word, Sophia remained quietly downstairs, sitting beside Isabella without causing disruption.

Finally, Alexander's message arrived: someone would collect Sophia shortly.

Isabella left it unanswered.

Moments later, Sophia's phone rang. She glanced at Isabella. "It's Dad."

Isabella merely nodded.

Whatever Alexander said made Sophia lower her phone and announce, "Mom, Dad wants to take me out to play..."

"Mm. He mentioned it. Go if you want."

"Okay!"

Thirty minutes later, Alexander's car arrived.

Margaret, as always, hated seeing Sophia leave. She packed an assortment of homemade treats for the girl's return trip.

Watching the departing vehicle, Margaret grumbled, "I used to think him generous. Now? Barely two days and he's rushing to take her back."

Without waiting for Isabella's response, the disappointed grandmother retreated inside.

Isabella's phone rang - Jonathan Blackwood calling.

"I just met with Alexander's lawyer," he reported. "The revised divorce agreement includes three additional properties worth approximately one billion total. Everything checks out."

"Understood."

Jonathan continued, "His lawyer mentioned they can advance a portion of the settlement if you need immediate funds. Your thoughts?"

Yesterday's misunderstanding with Alexander lingered.

The birthday gifts auctioned for Charles had already settled the financial concerns.

Yet Isabella responded, "Proceed with the advance."

Their divorce remained unsettled - circumstances could change. If Alexander offered funds now, why refuse?

Better secure the money than risk its disappearance later.

"Very well," Jonathan agreed. "I'll handle it."
###Chapter 238

After Sophia left, Isabella went upstairs, powered up her laptop, and began working.

An hour later, Jonathan sent over some documents for her review.

Isabella opened them immediately. The first thing that caught her attention were three newly listed properties, their locations clearly marked.

She froze when she saw the details.

All three were vacant units in the Whitmore family's residential compound, positioned remarkably close to Alexander's mansion.

Truth be told, though Alexander had previously purchased the house opposite his for her, that alone hadn't completely eased her worries.

Eleanor Kensington loved her daily walks. Even if the Sinclair family no longer lived across the street, being in the same neighborhood meant inevitable encounters.

This had been a constant concern. But now...

Studying the new agreement - was Alexander attempting to eliminate her worries once more?

While likely just expressing gratitude and ensuring she wouldn't overthink, these properties felt meticulously tailored to her needs.

She refused to dwell on any deeper implications. Moving on to the next document.

It stated Alexander would first transfer two billion dollars to her as liquid assets.

Having witnessed his wealth before - both at the auction and when learning he'd bought homes for the Sinclair family - seeing him casually move billions still stunned her.

After confirming everything was in order, Isabella contacted Jonathan.

The agreement was signed swiftly, and the funds appeared in her account moments later.

Regarding the properties, Alexander's lawyer mentioned the transfer was processing. The deeds would be delivered within days.

By the time everything was settled, morning had faded into afternoon.

With Eleanor Whitmore recently undergoing surgery, Margaret worried she might feel lonely and decided to visit the hospital.

Isabella joined her.

Starting Monday, she'd be buried in work with little time for hospital visits.

At the hospital, Isabella spotted Victoria again.

She wasn't particularly concerned about Victoria and Alexander's relationship. The first time she'd seen Victoria waiting outside the car, she'd barely noticed.

But today, with biting winds and frigid temperatures, Victoria's deliberate outdoor vigil was clearly meant for Isabella to see.

The message was obvious: their relationship remained unaffected. Nothing Isabella did could come between them.

Isabella smirked but said nothing.

She glanced at Margaret, uncertain how she felt about Victoria.

At that moment, Margaret happened to look down, missing Victoria entirely.

Isabella didn't mention it. Linking arms with Margaret, they entered the hospital.

Victoria's presence meant Alexander was inside.

Sure enough, he stood by Eleanor's bedside when they entered.

He greeted them politely.

Isabella remained impassive.

Eleanor, however, brightened immediately. She grasped Margaret's hand. "You shouldn't trouble yourself to visit me, dear friend."

"After all these years, don't speak such nonsense."

As they settled in, both women noticed Eleanor's improved condition - better color, brighter eyes, more energy.

Their relief was palpable.
###Chapter 239

Isabella and Margaret stayed with Eleanor for about thirty minutes before Alexander announced, "I need to step out briefly."

During their visit, Alexander had been mostly silent, observing without much input.

Eleanor scoffed at his words. "Fine, go ahead."

Alexander left the hospital room. But once he was gone, he didn’t return for over half an hour.

Earlier, Margaret Thornton had been present, ensuring the refreshments—fruit, pastries, and tea—were properly arranged.

After Margaret stepped away briefly, Isabella noticed Margaret Sinclair’s tea had gone cold. She picked up the small teapot and moved to the table to brew a fresh batch.

Seeing Isabella handle the tea herself, Eleanor suddenly thought of Alexander.

She frowned and muttered, "That boy... Who knows what he’s doing? He’s been gone forever."

When Alexander had excused himself earlier, Isabella hadn’t paid much attention. But now, hearing Eleanor’s remark, she remembered—Victoria Kensington was still downstairs.

Alexander had likely gone to keep her company so she wouldn’t get bored. Still, half an hour was excessive.

After preparing the tea, Isabella poured fresh cups for herself, Margaret, and Eleanor.

Just as she set the teapot down, the door opened, and Alexander walked in.

Eleanor shot him a look. "I thought you’d vanished."

Alexander merely smiled without responding.

Eleanor didn’t press further and instead turned to Isabella with a warm smile. "No one makes tea quite like you."

Alexander remained uninvolved in their conversation. But when the teapot ran empty again, he noticed Eleanor’s glance and refilled their cups without a word.

Another half hour passed, and the sky outside darkened.

Isabella and Margaret decided it was time to leave.

Eleanor insisted Alexander join them for dinner. He hesitated slightly.

Before he could respond, Isabella and Margaret declined politely. "No need—we have soup waiting at home."

It wasn’t an excuse. And truthfully, neither had any interest in dining with Alexander.

Eleanor seemed to sense this and didn’t push. Instead, she told Alexander, "At least walk them downstairs."

He agreed, then turned back to Eleanor. "I have some things to handle. I’ll visit again tomorrow."

"Go, then. Come if you want—I don’t care."

Despite her words, since her fall, Alexander had been visiting frequently. Deep down, she appreciated his attentiveness.

Her only dissatisfaction lay in his stubbornness regarding the divorce.

Alexander escorted Isabella and Margaret downstairs.

As they stepped out of the elevator, they nearly collided with Henry Whitmore, Alexander’s younger brother, who was waiting for the next lift with a backpack slung over his shoulder.

He brightened upon seeing them. "Alex, Isabella, Mrs. Sinclair."

Isabella and Margaret nodded in acknowledgment.

Henry grinned. "Heading to dinner?"

Before Isabella could reply, Alexander cut in. "Why aren’t you in class yet?"

"I’m just checking on Grandma first, then I’ll go."

"Then go."

"Right."

Henry stepped into the elevator, and Isabella and Margaret exited the hospital.

At the entrance, Isabella turned to Alexander. "No need to see us out."

He didn’t argue. "Alright."
###Chapter 240

Isabella and Margaret walked toward their parked car.

Just as Isabella reached for the door handle, Victoria stepped out from a nearby vehicle.

"So she's still here," Margaret remarked, giving Victoria a brief glance before looking away.

Isabella had assumed her grandmother hadn't noticed Victoria earlier, but clearly she had.

As they watched Alexander approach Victoria, Margaret seemed to recall how he'd left the hospital room for over thirty minutes earlier.

"They seem quite close," Margaret observed.

Isabella secured Margaret's seatbelt without comment.

As she started the engine, she spotted Henry rushing out of the hospital entrance.

He must have just noticed Victoria - his expression was a mix of shock and excitement as he hurried toward them. Isabella took one last look before driving away.

"Alex!" Henry called out, his eyes locked on Victoria. "You're... you're really VC! I thought I was imagining things!"

Victoria knew Alexander had a younger brother in high school, though they'd never met.

Henry's reaction confirmed his identity.

Before she could speak, Henry continued excitedly, "VC, hi! I'm your biggest fan! I even attended your last race in person!"

"That overtaking move you pulled at the three-minute-three-second mark? Absolute legend material! I've watched the replay at least fifty times - it never gets old!"

He stopped mid-sentence when he noticed Alexander's raised eyebrow.

Though Alexander didn't interrupt, Henry caught himself and suddenly realized something.

"Wait... Alex... you know my idol?"

Alexander ignored the question. "Is that a problem?"

"N-no problem."

Henry wasn't entirely surprised. His brother moved in influential circles - knowing VC wasn't completely unexpected.

"Why are you back down so soon?" Alexander asked.

Henry slapped his forehead. "Right! Almost forgot why I came down." He checked his watch. "Damn, is it that late already?"

He started backing toward another car. "Alex, VC, I gotta run-"

Halfway there, he suddenly turned back, cheeks flushing as he looked at Victoria hopefully.

"Um... VC, could I follow you on Instagram?"

Before she could answer, he quickly added, "I promise I won't spam you!"

Victoria smiled. "Sure."

Henry beamed, immediately pulling out his phone to send the request.

About to leave again, he suddenly spun back around. "Wait! Could I get an autograph?"

"Of course, but you-"

Alexander cut in. "Handle your business first. I'll bring your autograph later."

Henry grinned in relief. "Thanks, Alex!" With that, he finally dashed off.

Though Alexander rarely involved himself in Henry's affairs, Henry had always assumed his brother disapproved of his fandom. The quick agreement surprised him.

Maybe it was because VC was Alexander's friend, and therefore worthy of admiration?
###Chapter 241

Isabella had just pulled away from the hospital when Margaret suddenly remembered something. Alexander made it to see Eleanor, but what about Sophia? Where was she?

Before Isabella could respond, Margaret's face darkened immediately.

The disapproval was written all over her grandmother's expression - clearly unhappy that Alexander had left Sophia behind while bringing Victoria to visit Eleanor.

"Don't worry," Isabella reassured her. "He'll take care of her."

Margaret wasn't convinced. "If this continues, Bella, take him to court. No matter what, you must get custody of Sophia!"

Isabella hesitated briefly before responding softly, "Okay."

Margaret's displeasure lingered.

They arrived at the Sinclair residence and Margaret exited the car without another word.

Just then, Isabella's phone buzzed.

Sophia was calling, but she let it ring.

Perhaps because she hadn't spent much time with Sophia these past months and had been missing her calls, but recently she could clearly feel her daughter becoming more attached - just like when it had been just the two of them.

The phone rang again.

After a quick glance, she still didn't answer. She simply powered it off and joined her family for dinner.

But as soon as she sat down, the house phone rang.

Isabella knew exactly who it was.

"I'll get it."

She rose before anyone else could react and went to the living room.

As expected, Sophia's cheerful voice came through the line. "Mommy!"

Isabella hummed in response. "Have you eaten yet?"

"No." Sophia sounded dejected. "Are you at Grandma's house? I want to come too. Will you have dinner with me?"

Margaret looked over. "Is that Sophia?"

Isabella sighed inwardly. "Yes."

"Does she want to see you?" Margaret set down her fork and approached. "If she wants to come, call Alexander and have someone bring her. We'll save food for her."

"Alright." Then into the phone, "You can come now."

"Okay!"

Before hanging up, Isabella added, "Make sure you tell your father first."

"Okay."

They wanted to wait for Sophia before continuing dinner, but Isabella insisted they start without her.

About an hour later, Sophia arrived.

She ran straight to Isabella the moment she entered. "Mommy! I'm here!"

Isabella straightened Sophia's dress. "I'll warm up your food."

"Okay!"

Sophia put away her backpack and tablet, following Isabella into the kitchen.

Charles and Caroline had taken William to school while Margaret stayed home.

Watching Sophia shadow Isabella's every move, Margaret smiled warmly and left them to their bonding time.

Isabella told Sophia to wait at the table.

Sophia sat patiently while Isabella reheated the food.

Normally a picky eater who hated leftovers, today Sophia ate everything without complaint.

Between bites, she chatted excitedly. "Mommy, I went out with Mr. Montgomery and Lily today."
###Chapter 242

Isabella murmured a response.

Sophia paused, realizing Isabella might not recognize Lily, and quickly explained, "Lily is my friend. She calls Mr. Montgomery her uncle."

Isabella smiled softly, noticing the girl's eagerness to share. "What did you two do together?"

"We went through this amazing hedge maze!"

While Isabella listened with neutral interest, Margaret's expression darkened.

When Alexander had brought Sophia back earlier, she'd assumed he would be personally looking after his daughter.

Only now did she realize Alexander was too preoccupied with dating Victoria to care for his own child - he'd rather leave Sophia with strangers than let Isabella be involved.

Margaret's lips pressed into a thin line.

Sophia remained blissfully unaware of her grandmother's thoughts.

"Mr. Montgomery invited me for dinner," the girl continued cheerfully, "but I wanted to come home, so I called you."

Isabella nodded. "Did you thank him properly?"

"Of course I did!" Sophia beamed.

Isabella didn't press further.

With her homework completed, Sophia stayed in the living room with Isabella and Margaret after finishing her meal.

Margaret patted the space beside her. "Sophie, would you like to stay with Grandma for a while longer?"

Before Isabella could respond, Sophia immediately chirped, "Yes please!"

"No take-backs now," Margaret teased, squeezing the girl's hand. "You have to stay at least a week."

"Awesome!"

Isabella, however, frowned slightly.

Delighted, Margaret continued stroking Sophia's hair affectionately.

As Sophia became engrossed in a mobile game, Margaret murmured to Isabella, "You see? The bond between a mother and child is irreplaceable. She's still so attached to you."

Isabella merely offered a faint smile in response.

Sophia suddenly scooted closer, tugging at Isabella's sleeve. "Play with me?"

Isabella studied her daughter's face. "Are you absolutely certain you want to stay here?"

She suspected Sophia's current enthusiasm might wane after a few days, when she'd inevitably miss Alexander and Victoria.

The implication flew over Sophia's head at first.

After a brief pause, she declared, "Of course! I promised Grandma!"

Isabella fell silent.

Sophia's eyes suddenly widened. "Oh! I forgot to tell Daddy!" She scrambled for her phone.

Alexander answered on the first ring.

After hearing Sophia's request, he simply said, "Understood. Call if you need anything delivered."

"Okay!"

Sophia hung up seconds later.

Margaret had been holding her breath, half-expecting Alexander to refuse.

For a moment she'd considered stopping the call, but knew she couldn't.

Seeing Sophia's bright expression, she ventured, "He agreed?"

"Yep!" Sophia grinned before tilting her head curiously. "Why wouldn't he?"

Turning to Margaret, she added, "Daddy always says yes to whatever I want."

Margaret found herself speechless.

Isabella remained quiet throughout their exchange.

When bedtime approached, she quietly led Sophia upstairs for her bath.
###Chapter 243

The partnership between YodaVision and Dominic Fairchild was finalized, yet critical business components still required suitable collaborators.

To accelerate the search for ideal partners, boost company visibility, and drive expansion, YodaVision had arranged an investment symposium, which commenced Monday morning.

After dropping Sophia Whitmore at school, Isabella Sinclair headed straight to the hotel venue.

Nathaniel Graves and his team were already present when she arrived.

As the company's lead engineer, Isabella was scheduled to deliver a keynote speech and field media questions shortly.

Backstage, she reviewed the agenda with Nathaniel.

Julian Montgomery arrived moments later.

He had barely settled into his seat when Dominic made his entrance.

Twenty minutes later, Nathaniel and Isabella took the stage for their presentations.

Dominic appeared attentive during Nathaniel's segment, but when Isabella stepped forward, his expression darkened.

Was Nathaniel seriously entrusting the crucial product and technology introduction to Isabella?

Isabella didn't spare Dominic a glance. Whether presenting company products or addressing technical inquiries, her tone remained composed and confident. She answered every question flawlessly, displaying no trace of hesitation.

The moment Isabella began speaking, Dominic's attention wandered elsewhere, showing no interest in her presentation.

As she handled product-related queries, he assumed YodaVision had prepped her with scripted responses.

His mind drifted until he noticed Julian's intense focus on Isabella.

Unlike Dominic, Julian listened with rapt attention, fully engaged in her every word.

Dominic dismissed it as Julian's typical professional demeanor.

Post-conference, Isabella and Nathaniel's schedules grew even more demanding.

With an afternoon meeting at InnovaTech, Dominic departed quickly after exchanging brief pleasantries with Nathaniel.

He arrived at InnovaTech before Alexander Whitmore.

Heading straight to Victoria Kensington's department, he found the office buzzing with energy.

Victor Pembroke greeted him immediately. "Good to see you, Mr. Fairchild."

Dominic nodded in acknowledgment. Victoria glanced up and added, "Alexander should arrive in about ten minutes. Please wait momentarily."

Victoria's casual reference to Alexander's schedule revealed their close working relationship.

"I'm aware," Dominic replied. "His assistant already informed me."

Changing subjects, he observed, "The atmosphere here is quite lively today. Celebrating something?"

Victor responded eagerly, "We've been stuck on a major technical roadblock for over a week, but Ms. Kensington just cracked it. Now we can finally progress, so everyone's energized."

Another team member chimed in, "We owe this breakthrough entirely to Ms. Kensington. Her Ivy League PhD makes all the difference - her technical expertise far surpasses ours."

"Absolutely," others agreed.

Dominic had always recognized Victoria's talent, but now witnessed it firsthand.

Hearing the team's praise, he felt genuine admiration. "Congratulations."

Victoria smiled graciously. "Thank you."

Then she added modestly, "But I can't take full credit. Alexander has been mentoring me intensively lately. That's what enabled such rapid improvement."

Her statement carried undeniable truth.
###Chapter 244

The team mistook her modesty for genuine humility.

Celebrations ended quickly as everyone returned to their tasks.

Victoria knew about YodaVision's morning press conference.

Her workload had prevented her from checking the details earlier.

She grabbed her phone to search for conference updates. "Did you attend the event this morning, Mr. Fairchild?" she asked Dominic.

"Indeed."

The screen showed Isabella Sinclair presenting YodaVision's latest technological advancements.

Dominic studied Victoria's reaction carefully, noting her composed demeanor showed no resentment toward Isabella.

Comparing Isabella's Christmas hostility with Victoria's current poise, he became convinced of Victoria's superior professionalism.

Just as he prepared to speak, Victor Pembroke leaned in. "I caught part of YodaVision's conference. Their technology is remarkable."

"Absolutely," Victoria agreed.

Though not a tech expert, Dominic recognized YodaVision's industry-leading capabilities.

As Nathaniel Graves' speech played, Dominic remarked, "With you leading InnovaTech, we'll undoubtedly develop groundbreaking innovations."

Victoria smiled faintly. "You flatter me, Mr. Fairchild. I still have much to learn from Mr. Graves."

Dominic interpreted this as false modesty. "No need for humility, Ms. Kensington."

"But it's true," Victoria interrupted. "Learning from Mr. Aldridge has always been my dream. I recently met him, but wasn't qualified to become his student."

Her frank admission impressed Dominic further.

He now understood Victoria's interest in Nathaniel stemmed not just from his AI expertise, but also his mentorship under Frederick Aldridge.

"If you haven't reached that level yet, keep striving," Dominic encouraged. "With your talent, you'll achieve your goals."

Victoria's smile faded as Alexander Whitmore entered. "Apologies for the wait, Mr. Fairchild."

Dominic stood. "Not at all, Mr. Whitmore. I arrived early."

After brief pleasantries, Alexander exchanged a glance with Victoria before leading Dominic upstairs for their meeting.

Victoria watched them leave. As she turned to her work, her phone rang.

Reginald Kensington was calling.

Like everyone in the industry, Reginald had watched YodaVision's conference.

The potential financial impact of YodaVision's innovations weighed heavily on him.

The Kensington tech division lacked core technology, making their products uncompetitive and unprofitable for years.

Continuous losses without progress had become unacceptable.

Each day meant more financial drain - how could Reginald not feel pressured?

He reached out to Victoria, hoping she might have solutions under Alexander's guidance.

Most importantly, he wondered if Victoria had finally reached a level that might impress Frederick Aldridge.
###Chapter 245

The call ended with a sharp click.

Alexander placed his phone on the marble countertop, his gaze fixed on the massive screen broadcasting the Grandeur Technologies press conference. His fingers pressed against his temples, the weight of unspoken worries pressing down.

Across the room, Genevieve reclined on the velvet sofa, idly popping grapes into her mouth. But the sight of Isabella commanding the stage with effortless grace at such a high-profile event made her stomach churn. With a violent jab at the remote, she silenced the television. "Why does she get to stand there?" The words tasted like poison. "She's stealing the spotlight again."

"That's not what matters," Eleanor interjected smoothly.

To her, Isabella was merely riding on Nathaniel's coattails. A speech at a press conference? Meaningless. Just temporary glitter that would soon fade.

The real prize was Grandeur's groundbreaking technology.

That was the true measure of power.

Alexander caught Eleanor's implication immediately.

Yes, Isabella spoke eloquently today. But when it came to Grandeur's proprietary tech, he, Victoria, and Eleanor all knew Nathaniel must have spoon-fed her every word.

There was no way she genuinely understood the complexities.

Penelope disagreed. "Like it or not, she's secured her position with Nathaniel's backing."

Regardless of motives, Isabella had made waves today - and in doing so, brought unexpected benefits to the Sinclair family.

That alone, in Penelope's eyes, proved her capability.

Genevieve couldn't care less about business implications.

She'd noticed Julian's intense focus on Isabella throughout the event.

The way his eyes tracked her every movement - a look he'd never given Genevieve.

If she'd been the one on that stage, she knew his attention would have been hers.

By the time Isabella and Nathaniel exited the hotel, the clock neared 10 PM.

After a grueling day, Isabella's temples throbbed with exhaustion.

On autopilot, she drove toward her usual apartment complex. Only when she parked did she realize her mistake.

No point going back now. The Sinclair estate held nothing for her tonight.

As she stepped out, her phone screen illuminated with multiple missed calls - from family members and Sophia.

Among the notifications, a message from Sophia sent around 8 PM stood out: "When are you coming home?"

Isabella glanced at it briefly before silencing her phone.

Inside her apartment, she moved through her nighttime routine mechanically before collapsing into bed.

Morning came too soon.

She'd barely opened her eyes when Sophia's name flashed across her caller ID.

Isabella considered ignoring it.

The moment the ringing stopped, the Sinclair estate's landline number appeared.

She had no choice but to answer. "Grandmother."

"You didn't return last night, Isabella."

"I was occupied."

Margaret didn't press further, simply passing the phone to Sophia.

"Mommy!"

Isabella responded with a noncommittal hum.

Sophia hadn't anticipated her mother skipping nights at the family home now.

She'd called repeatedly last evening with no response. Waking to find Isabella still absent left her unsettled.

"When are you coming back, Mommy?" The question carried a child's uncomplicated longing.

"Tonight... probably."

A pause.

Then Isabella remembered. "Call your father to arrange your ride to school. I'm busy today."

"Okay." Sophia hesitated. "Mommy, where are you staying? Can I visit after school?"

"No." The refusal came instantly. "I'll be working late. Stay with Grandmother. If you're bored, ask your father to take you out."
###Chapter 246

"Alright then."

"I should go now. Work's waiting," Isabella added.

"Bye, Mom!"

The call ended abruptly.

After a quick breakfast, she headed straight to the office.

Yesterday's chaos seemed to carry over into today's relentless schedule.

But by some miracle, she managed to slip out early to have lunch with Margaret at the Sinclair residence.

Something felt off the moment she arrived. Margaret's usual cheerful demeanor was missing.

Her eyes scanned the living room. No sign of Sophia.

Probably out dining with Alexander again.

Isabella kept her expression neutral, but Margaret noticed how attached Sophia had become to Alexander.

With a concerned frown, Margaret said, "Bella, when things calm down at work, you really should spend more time with Sophia. Otherwise—"

Isabella nodded absently. "I know. I will. Let's eat first."

Margaret sighed, letting the subject drop.

After dinner, they exchanged some small talk before Isabella retreated upstairs.

At precisely 9:07 pm, the security intercom buzzed, announcing a visitor.

Isabella glanced at the monitor. Alexander's car.

Her phone rang before she could react.

Sophia's caller ID flashed on the screen.

Margaret emerged from her room just as the security guard granted Alexander access.

Isabella answered briefly before hanging up.

Moments later, Alexander's sleek black car pulled up to the Sinclair estate.

"Mom! I'm home!" Sophia burst out of the car excitedly.

Isabella forced a smile. Margaret's face lit up at the sight of her granddaughter.

The car door remained open. Alexander stepped out carrying Sophia's forgotten backpack and a pastry box.

Isabella remained silent.

"Oh! Thanks Dad!" Sophia beamed as she noticed her belongings.

Alexander simply nodded, his gaze shifting between Isabella and Margaret. "Good evening, Mrs. Sinclair."

Margaret gave a curt nod. Isabella reluctantly took the pastry box from Alexander's outstretched hand.

"Mom, you have to try this cake—" Sophia began enthusiastically.

"Sophia," Isabella interrupted, "say goodbye to your father."

Sophia blinked. "Dad's leaving already?"

Alexander smiled faintly. "Yes."

"Okay. Bye Dad!"

"Goodnight."

With a final nod to Margaret, he turned and disappeared into his car.

Isabella ushered Sophia inside without a backward glance, the pastry box in one hand, Sophia's small hand in the other.

The car's engine faded into the night.

"Mom! Grandma! Dad got your favorite strawberry cake!" Sophia announced proudly as they entered.

The faintest trace of Victoria's perfume lingered on Sophia's clothes.

Isabella set the cake aside. "We just ate. We'll have it later."

Margaret nodded in agreement.

Sophia's shoulders slumped slightly.
###Chapter 247

Isabella carefully placed the cake box inside the refrigerator.

Sophia had just stepped out of the shower when her phone buzzed.

Alexander's name flashed on the screen.

She swiped to answer. "Dad?"

"Your grandfather just messaged me. He's returning tomorrow afternoon." His voice was brisk. "I'll arrange for someone to pick you up after school. We're having dinner at the manor. Inform your mother."

Richard Whitmore, Alexander's father, held a high-ranking government position.

His demanding schedule left little room for family visits.

When Eleanor took her fall, Richard had rushed home at midnight but departed before dawn.

Now, with her still hospitalized, he'd carved out two days to spend New Year's with her.

Sophia nodded. "Understood."

Then she caught the phrasing - "pick you up" not "pick you both up."

That meant Isabella wasn't included.

Turning to her mother, Sophia asked, "Aren't you coming, Mom?"

Traditionally, Eleanor insisted both Isabella and Sophia attend whenever Richard visited - regardless of Alexander's presence.

The routine had become so ingrained that Sophia automatically associated her grandfather's return with family dinners at Whitmore Manor.

Before Isabella could respond, Alexander interjected, "Your mother has prior commitments tomorrow."

"Okay."

The call had been on speaker. Isabella heard everything.

This marked her first awareness of Richard's return.

With divorce proceedings underway, she had no business attending Whitmore family gatherings.

Alexander clearly agreed.

He'd preemptively fabricated an excuse before she could speak.

Without further discussion, he ended the call.

The following afternoon, Julian arrived at YodaVision with his core engineering team.

His recent cooperation had significantly eased Isabella's workload.

In return, she treated him with newfound courtesy.

She personally greeted him upon arrival, setting aside her tasks.

An hour later, Julian's phone vibrated.

Alexander's name appeared.

Julian excused himself to take the call outside.

After a brief silence, he simply said, "Understood."

As he moved to hang up, Alexander added, "My father's returning tonight. I'll need your assistance."

"Mr. Whitmore's back?"

After a beat, Julian asked, "How long is he staying?"

"A few days, likely."

Returning to the conference room, Julian studied Isabella thoughtfully.

Engrossed in technical discussions, she didn't notice his gaze.

As the meeting concluded and she rose to escort them out, Julian asked, "Working late again?"

"Yes, still some loose ends to tie up," she answered absently.

Julian's expression darkened.

So she wasn't joining Alexander at Whitmore Manor tonight.

Something stirred within him. "Free for dinner?"

Isabella shook her head. "Can't. Too much work."

He nearly offered to order takeout instead.
###Chapter 248

Legally, her marital status remained unchanged.

Given the current tension between them, such words would cross the line.

After seeing Julian off, Isabella hurried back upstairs.

He watched her retreating figure for a lingering moment before turning to Jonathan Sterling, his company's lead engineer. "I need a favor."

"Of course," Jonathan responded promptly.

"A friend wants to specialize in natural language processing but requires top-tier guidance—"

Jonathan listened attentively. Given their professional relationship, he agreed without hesitation.

Yet he paused before adding, "While I have expertise in this field, truthfully, I don't measure up to Mr. Graves from YodaVision or Ms. Sinclair, who handles our corporate negotiations. For premier mentorship, they'd be superior choices."

Julian blinked in surprise at Jonathan's assessment.

Finance was his domain, not artificial intelligence.

But Jonathan was an industry authority.

In NLP—natural language processing—he ranked among the nation's foremost experts. If not the absolute best, certainly in the upper echelon.

Otherwise, Alexander wouldn't have bypassed both InnovaTech and Fleming Tech's specialists to seek his assistance.

Jonathan had praised Isabella's capabilities before, but Julian hadn't grasped the full extent of her talents.

Nathaniel had never restrained his admiration for Isabella, constantly extolling her abilities to colleagues. Julian had assumed that while competent, Nathaniel's praise stemmed from personal bias with some exaggeration.

But now—

"Mr. Montgomery?"

Julian snapped back to attention. "Both Mr. Graves and Ms. Sinclair have prior conflicts with this friend. Not ideal."

"I understand."

Jonathan let the matter drop.

When Julian and Jonathan arrived at the private lounge that evening, Victoria was already waiting.

She greeted Jonathan with polished courtesy.

After exchanging pleasantries, she swiftly steered the conversation toward technical subjects.

Meanwhile, Julian remained largely silent, his attention drifting as he listened.

After extensive discussion with Jonathan, Victoria turned to Julian. "Boring you, aren't we?"

He shook off his distraction. "I'm fine. Continue your discussion."

Victoria smiled and took him at his word, resuming her dialogue with Jonathan.

Her genuine thirst for knowledge shone through her focused demeanor.

This earnest approach, combined with her humility, made Jonathan eager to assist.

After assessing her comprehension level, he outlined a structured learning path and summarized current advancements in the field.

Their exchange continued pleasantly through dinner.

Naturally, they only covered fundamentals tonight.

Victoria sought far deeper immersion.

With tomorrow being New Year's Day, she formally requested Jonathan's mentorship.

Out of respect for Julian, Jonathan agreed to dedicate half his schedule to meet with her.

Victoria expressed profuse gratitude.

After dinner, they bid Jonathan farewell. Victoria then glanced at Julian, who'd been unusually quiet all evening. "Thank you for arranging this, Julian."

He responded tersely, "Alexander and I go way back—this was nothing."

Before she could reply, he added, "It's late. You should rest."

"Alright. See you tomorrow."

At this, Julian muttered, "I've got meetings tomorrow. Count me out."
###Chapter 249

Isabella Sinclair froze momentarily. Processing his words, she responded gently, "Don't worry about it. Your family comes first."

Julian Montgomery gave a brief nod.

Once Isabella drove away, he slid into his own car.

Instead of starting the engine immediately, he pulled out his phone. His thumb hovered over Lily Montgomery's contact before he finally dialed.

Isabella was still at the office when the call came through.

Seeing Julian's name flash on her screen, she answered casually, "Mr. Montgomery?"

Julian had words ready, but the background noise made him pause. Instead, he asked, "Working this late?"

"Yeah."

Given the hour, Isabella assumed this wasn't work-related. "I'm free tomorrow. What does Lily want to do?"

Silence.

When he didn't respond, she prompted, "Mr. Montgomery?"

Julian knew how packed her schedule had been this week.

It was past nine, and she was still at her desk.

He didn't need to ask—she had to be exhausted.

Her own daughter had returned to the Whitmore estate, and she wouldn't see her tomorrow. Yet here he was, asking her to entertain someone else's child.

It felt unfair.

"Let's reschedule if you're tired," he said.

But Isabella wasn't particularly drained.

"Tomorrow works."

After a brief hesitation, Julian relented. "Alright then."

Meanwhile—

As the Whitmores exited the restaurant after dinner, they ran into the Fairchilds.

Richard Whitmore, familiar with Dominic Fairchild, greeted him warmly.

Alexander and Simon exchanged pleasantries.

Sophia Whitmore, holding Alexander's hand, looked up with a bright smile. "Mr. Fairchild, hello!"

Dominic nodded. "Hello there."

His gaze swept over the Whitmore family as they stood together.

He recognized everyone present.

But there was no unfamiliar woman who could be Sophia's mother.

Had Alexander truly ended his marriage?

After some small talk, the Whitmores headed to the hospital to visit Eleanor Whitmore.

That night, Richard stayed behind to keep Eleanor company.

Alexander and the others returned to the Whitmore estate.

As soon as they arrived, Henry Whitmore turned to Alexander. "Alex, you didn't forget my idol's autograph, did you?"

Alexander tossed him the car keys. "It's in the glove compartment. Get it yourself."

"Thanks, Alex!"

Henry caught the keys eagerly.

Catherine Whitmore raised an eyebrow. "What's that about?"

Henry froze.

"Nothing important," Alexander said smoothly.

Relieved, Henry dashed outside to retrieve Victoria Kensington's autograph.

Catherine shrugged and didn't press further.

Moments later, Henry returned with a stack of notebooks.

Though they bore Victoria's initials, they weren't the signed poster he'd hoped for.

"Alex, I wanted something I could frame—something to admire every day," he complained.

Alexander smirked. "Not happening."

"Why not?"

It wasn't like he'd do anything weird—just hang it on his wall and glance at it occasionally.

Alexander's amused look said everything.

Henry knew better than to argue.

Still, having his idol's autograph at all was enough to thrill him.

Grinning, he quickly texted Victoria to thank her.

Later, Sophia approached Alexander with her tablet. "Dad, there's a new animated movie tomorrow! The trailer looks amazing. Can we go?"

"Busy tomorrow," Alexander said.

With Richard back, the estate would likely be swamped with guests.

Sophia pouted. "Then can I ask—"

"You can ask your mother."

Lately, she'd been seeing Isabella more often, so she wasn't as clingy as before.

"What about Victoria? Can I—"

"She has a prior engagement. Don't disturb her," Alexander cut in.

Sophia sighed. "Fine. I'll call Mom."

She pulled out her phone and dialed Isabella.

Isabella had just gotten home.

She saw the caller ID but didn't answer.

Setting her phone aside, she headed for the shower.

When Isabella didn't pick up, Sophia assumed she was busy. "Mom's working too..."

Alexander glanced at Henry, who was lounging nearby. "Take your niece tomorrow."

Henry blinked.

He had plans with friends!

But remembering how Alexander had just gotten him Victoria's autograph—and how incredibly kind she'd been—he couldn't refuse.

"Fine," he agreed, though his tone was more amused than annoyed.
###Chapter 250

Isabella stepped out just before noon the next day.

It had been ages since she'd seen Lily, and the little girl had been missing her terribly.

The aroma of gourmet food greeted Isabella as she entered The Grandeur. She headed straight for the VIP lounge where Lily immediately spotted her. "Miss Isabella!"

With a warm smile, Isabella embraced the excited child. "It's been too long, sweetheart."

This marked Isabella's first visit to the upscale restaurant.

Every dish surprised her with its exquisite flavors - each one perfectly suited to her palate.

After lunch, they proceeded directly to the cinema where Julian had reserved tickets for the afternoon showing.

Lily insisted on popcorn before entering the theater. Julian started toward the concession stand. "Large or small?"

"Extra large! I'll share with you and Miss Isabella."

Julian chuckled. "As you wish."

Inside the darkened theater, Lily claimed the middle seat.

She balanced the oversized popcorn bucket on her lap, nibbled a piece, then nudged Isabella to join her.

Isabella obliged, selecting a buttery kernel.

Lily then turned to Julian, insisting he partake as well.

Julian had chosen a newly released animated feature specifically for Lily's enjoyment.

Though targeted at children, the film captivated all three with its clever humor and touching moments. Even Isabella found herself engrossed.

At one point, Isabella reached for popcorn just as Julian did the same. His fingers brushed against hers, then lingered a moment too long.

Isabella froze.

Julian stiffened slightly.

To Isabella, it meant nothing - just an accidental contact not worth dwelling on.

As if reading her thoughts, Julian withdrew his hand with a quiet, "My apologies."

"No harm done."

Lily, completely absorbed in the movie, missed the entire exchange.

Noticing only a few kernels remained in Lily's bucket, Isabella stopped eating.

Julian noticed her restraint but misinterpreted it as deliberate distancing.

He lowered his gaze and abstained as well.

Later, Lily needed a restroom break after drinking too much soda. Isabella naturally accompanied her.

There were certain things Julian couldn't assist with, after all.

"Thank you," he murmured.

"Of course."

As they exited the restroom, a boy emerged from the men's side.

He spotted Isabella and Lily but quickly vanished into the crowd as they returned to their movie.

"Mother."

The boy approached Victoria Whitmore. "I'm finished. Let's go."

Victoria acknowledged him absently.

The child was Benjamin Whitmore, Victoria's son.

Having no fondness for Isabella, he'd deliberately ignored their passing.

Victoria, occupied with a phone call, hadn't noticed Isabella either.

Bored during their departure, Benjamin finally mentioned it. "Mother, I saw Aunt Isabella earlier."

Victoria barely reacted. "Did you?"

"Yes. She had some child with her - not Sophia."

Victoria showed no interest. "Is that so?"

Her indifference made clear how little she cared about Isabella's affairs.

Assuming it was just some Sinclair family child, she dismissed it entirely.

They left for Whitmore Manor where Richard Whitmore was already entertaining guests with Alexander.

Still intimidated by Alexander, Benjamin offered polite greetings.

Sophia sat nearby, engrossed in a puzzle.

After acknowledging the adults, Victoria instructed Benjamin to join his cousin.
###Chapter 251

Benjamin walked over to Sophia.

"Hey."

Sophia nodded. "You're here?"

Benjamin sat beside her and began helping with the puzzle. "Just came from the cinema with Mom. Saw your mom there too."

Sophia had been focused on the puzzle pieces, but her head snapped up at this. "My mom? Where?"

"At the Grand Theater."

Sophia pressed her lips together. "That's impossible! Mom's swamped with work. No way she'd have time for movies. You must've mistaken someone else for her."

Benjamin frowned, offended. "I didn't. It was definitely her."

"You're lying." Sophia refused to believe him.

Just last night and this morning, she'd called her mom repeatedly with no answer. How could she possibly be at the movies?

"I'm not lying," Benjamin insisted. Annoyed at being doubted, he added details, "And she wasn't alone. There was another kid with her - about your height, really adorable!"

Until now, Sophia hadn't taken Benjamin seriously. But those words made her explode.

She grabbed a fistful of puzzle pieces, jumped up, and hurled them at him. "Liar! Take that back right now!"

Benjamin had told the truth. He couldn't understand why Sophia wouldn't believe him and was now attacking him.

As a spoiled child himself, he wasn't about to back down. Enraged, he grabbed his own handful of pieces and threw them back. "I'm not lying!"

"You—"

"What's going on here?"

Their shouting match reached the living room guests.

Catherine rushed over.

Tears welled in Benjamin's eyes as he pointed at Sophia. "I was just saying—"

"Hmph!"

Sophia's eyes were red too, her lips trembling. Without letting Benjamin explain, she turned and ran toward the living room.

"Daddy!"

Seeing her charge, Alexander had no choice but to catch her as she flung herself into his arms.

After quick apologies to their guests, he carried Sophia out. When they were farther away, he asked, "What happened?"

Sophia opened her mouth to repeat her cousin's words, but the thought of her mother spending time with someone else - someone cuter than her - made fresh tears spill over.

Meanwhile, Catherine and Victoria had gotten the full story from Benjamin.

Catherine asked Victoria if she'd noticed Isabella at the cinema, but Victoria admitted she hadn't been paying attention and couldn't confirm Benjamin's claim.

After consideration, Catherine said, "I believe Benjamin wasn't lying. It's possible he really saw your aunt."

"But it's equally possible he saw someone who resembled her - maybe not actually Isabella."

Yesterday, after Richard returned, he'd noticed Alexander brought Sophia to visit Eleanor at the hospital without Isabella. Curious, he'd asked about her.

With Sophia present, Alexander had simply said Isabella was too busy to come.

Apart from Eleanor, no one in the Whitmore family knew about the impending divorce. Over the years, they'd all witnessed Isabella's devotion to Alexander.

So when Alexander said she was busy, everyone assumed something urgent with the Sinclair family kept her away.

Hearing Benjamin's account now, both Catherine and Victoria thought he might be mistaken.

As far as they knew, there were no young children in the Sinclair family close to Sophia's age.

And if Isabella had free time, why would she choose movies over visiting family?

It made no sense.
###Chapter 252

Benjamin couldn't tolerate being accused of dishonesty.

The moment Catherine reassured him, his mood lifted considerably.

Hearing this, Sophia stopped crying as well.

Of course. Benjamin must have confused someone else with mom. That woman couldn't possibly be her.

This realization brought immediate relief.

Then she remembered how Isabella had complimented Charlotte before. They'd seemed unusually close.

Without bothering to dry her tears, Sophia reached into Alexander's pocket. "Dad, I need your phone."

Alexander had already pieced together the situation from Catherine's words. He wiped Sophia's face gently before handing over his device.

Sophia quickly dialed Isabella's number.

At that exact moment, Isabella was leaving the movie theater, heading toward the adjacent arcade.

Seeing Alexander's caller ID flash, she declined without hesitation.

Sophia's eyes remained puffy. "Mom didn't answer."

"She's likely occupied," Alexander said smoothly. "Let's not interrupt. How about dinner tonight? Just us."

His casual dismissal made Sophia more certain Benjamin had mistaken someone else.

She brightened. "Can Julian come too?"

Alexander chuckled. "Of course."

Feeling lighter, Sophia moved to return to her puzzle. But lingering unease made her call Elizabeth to speak with Charlotte.

Elizabeth was startled.

From her observations, Sophia hadn't particularly warmed to Charlotte. While not unkind...

Unable to resist Sophia's pleading tone, Elizabeth contacted Abigail first. After confirming both Charlotte and her mother consented, she shared Abigail's contact details.

Sophia initiated a video call immediately.

Charlotte answered with visible delight. "Sophia! Ms. Moore said you wanted to talk? Want to play together?"

Despite Sophia's previous coolness, Charlotte had always admired her bold, confident demeanor.

"Mm." Sophia pressed her lips. "Where are you?"

"Home!" Charlotte cheerfully panned the camera. "Grandma and Grandpa are here. We're making my favorite dumplings. Want to—"

The sight of piled dumpling wrappers confirmed they were truly home. Sophia exhaled. "You didn't go to the movies with my mom today, right?"

Charlotte shook her head. "With Ms. Sinclair? No, haven't seen her in weeks."

Relief flooded Sophia. "Okay. Enjoy your dumplings."

She nearly hung up, then awkwardly added, "Bye."

Charlotte blinked. "Oh—bye!"

When Alexander returned to the living room, Richard inquired, "Everything settled?"

"Yes."

Their recently arrived guests—first-time viewers of Sophia—exchanged glances.

One remarked, "Can't believe Alexander's daughter is this grown. So he married young?"

Recent whispers about Alexander's child had been dismissed as rumors.

Seeing proof stunned them.

Alexander sipped his tea. "Indeed."

Awkward smiles circulated. These guests had strategically brought daughters, hoping for introductions.

Potential matches, ideally. But a wife changed everything.

Their elegant, well-mannered daughters had garnered zero attention from Alexander in thirty minutes.

Clearly, even unmarried, they'd have stood no chance.

Meanwhile, after an hour at the arcade, Julian and Lily departed for prior commitments.

Isabella, having nearly completed her thesis earlier, planned final edits at home before Frederick's review.

Then submission.

Engrossed in VR gaming, she didn't notice Genevieve exiting the cinema. Spotting Isabella alone at the arcade, Genevieve sneered before strutting away.

Thirty minutes later, Genevieve arrived at the Kensington estate.

Rushing upstairs, she found Penelope there. "Aunt? Weren't you shopping? Why are you in Aunt Diana's suite?"

"Just returned."

Though the Kensington home was lavish, it paled beside the estate Alexander purchased for Eleanor.

Penelope visited constantly under various pretexts.

Even now, she still marveled at the opulent decor.

Genevieve mirrored this habit. Close family ties meant frequent visits.

She flopped onto a sofa dramatically. "Mom, Victoria, Aunt Diana—guess who I saw at the arcade?"

Victoria sat reading by the panoramic windows.

She'd already guessed but didn't engage.

Penelope, however, perked up. "Isabella?"

"Exactly!" Genevieve popped a chocolate into her mouth. "Has Alexander banned her from Whitmore Manor? There she was—all alone playing arcade games. Pathetic silhouette, really."
###Chapter 253

They'd been aware of this situation for ages. Yet when Genevieve brought it up again, Penelope still broke into a delighted smile. Victoria, however, kept her nose buried in her textbook, showing zero reaction.

Eleanor mirrored her daughter's indifference.

It was as if Isabella Sinclair had become utterly insignificant to them.

Noticing Genevieve was about to continue chattering, Eleanor said coolly, "Genevieve, Victoria's studying. Don't distract her."

"Oh—"

Genevieve shot a glance at Victoria, who was absorbed in her reading. "Didn't the tutor come this morning? It's past five already, and she's still hitting the books. Just watching her exhausts me. Aren't you tired, Victoria?"

Penelope chimed in, "Of course she is. But she's ambitious. I've always told you to learn from her, but you never listen."

Then, with a sugary smile, she added, "But Victoria, as crucial as hard work is, you should take proper breaks. Why don't you come have a snack first?"

Without lifting her eyes, Victoria replied, "No need. Alexander invited me to dinner. I'll leave after this."

After wrapping up her gaming session, Isabella returned to the Sinclair residence and spent three solid hours polishing her thesis. Once satisfied, she emailed it to Frederick.

Stretching her stiff muscles, she headed downstairs—only to find her grandmother standing at the front door in the dead of winter, seemingly waiting for someone.

Isabella frowned and hurried over. "Granny, you—"

Before she could finish, the sound of tires crunching on gravel cut her off.

Just as she reached the doorway, a car pulled into the driveway. Moments later, Sophia burst out of the vehicle. "Mom! Granny!"

"Oh, my darling!" Margaret's eyes crinkled with joy as she bent down, arms wide open.

Sophia had initially been running toward Isabella, but upon seeing her great-grandmother's gesture, she pivoted and hugged Margaret first.

"Have you eaten? Are you hungry?" Margaret asked.

"Dad and I had dinner out, so I'm full." After answering, Sophia wriggled free and tiptoed toward Isabella. "Mom, hug me!"

Isabella scooped her up. Though she caught a faint whiff of perfume clinging to her daughter's clothes, her expression didn't flicker.

This time, Alexander hadn't bothered to drop Sophia off personally.

The car door had been left ajar, so the driver stepped out to close it before nodding respectfully to Isabella and Margaret. Then he drove away.

With school the next day, Sophia didn't stay up late. After her bath, she went straight to bed.

Isabella tucked her in, then grabbed her phone and fired off a text to Alexander:

"Have the driver pick Sophia up tomorrow afternoon. And stop dropping her at my place without notice."

Alexander didn't respond.

The next morning, after seeing Sophia off to school, Isabella headed to work. Only then did Alexander finally reply:

"Okay."

Isabella read the message, set her phone aside, and dove into her tasks.

Two days flew by, and the weekend arrived.

On Saturday morning, Isabella received Frederick's reply: "No issues. Ready for submission."

It had been weeks since she'd last seen Nathaniel or Frederick.
###Chapter 254

Isabella Sinclair handed in her thesis with a satisfied sigh. That evening, she and Nathaniel Graves invited Frederick Aldridge to dinner.

For once, Julian Montgomery didn't decline the invitation.

The trio arrived at The Grandeur, stepping out of the car together. None of them noticed Julian's sleek black sedan parked just twenty feet away.

But Julian saw them. His hand froze on the door handle as he watched Isabella standing between Nathaniel and Frederick, laughing at something the older man said.

Two minutes passed before he finally exited the vehicle, carrying a sleepy Lily Montgomery in his arms.

Oliver Westbrook had already arrived. "You're late," he remarked, raising an eyebrow at Julian's uncharacteristic hesitation.

Julian merely nodded in response.

Just as Lily began stirring awake, Alexander Whitmore arrived with Sophia Whitmore, Victoria Kensington, and Genevieve Kensington in tow.

Julian's gaze darkened when he spotted Genevieve.

"Julian!" Genevieve squealed, rushing forward with outstretched arms. "I didn't know you'd be here!"

He stared right through her, leaving an uncomfortable silence hanging in the air.

Sophia broke the tension by approaching Lily. "You look exhausted," she observed with concern.

Lily shook her head. "Just sleepy..."

Julian's expression softened when he addressed Sophia. "She's fine. Just needs to wake up properly."

Now fully alert, Lily slid from Julian's arms and joined Sophia on the plush sofa, their heads bent together in quiet conversation.

Victoria took a seat beside Alexander. Accepting the glass of water he offered, she pulled a thick textbook from her designer bag. "Don't mind me," she announced. "I've got some studying to do."

Oliver knew about Victoria's apprenticeship under Jonathan Sterling. "Bringing work to dinner?" he teased. "That's dedication."

Genevieve, now seated uncomfortably close to Julian, added, "She's been like this for weeks. Obsessed, really."

Julian knew exactly why Victoria was working so hard - she wanted Frederick Aldridge as her mentor. The irony wasn't lost on him, considering Frederick was currently dining just three doors down.

He kept this information to himself.

His mind kept returning to the sight of Isabella earlier - standing confidently between Nathaniel and Frederick, engaging the renowned professor in animated conversation. If this were just a social dinner through Nathaniel, wouldn't she have positioned herself differently?

Isabella had never been one for small talk, yet she'd appeared completely at ease with Frederick.

The timing struck him suddenly. YodaVision's two major projects had launched in recent months. Isabella had left Whitmore Enterprises to join YodaVision around the same time.

Then there was Jonathan Sterling's recent comment about Isabella's skills surpassing his own.

And when Victoria had applied to YodaVision, Nathaniel had rejected her outright - because of Isabella.

At the time, both Oliver and Julian had assumed personal reasons motivated Nathaniel's decision. That his preference for Isabella over Victoria stemmed from something other than professional merit.

Now...

Julian's gaze shifted to Victoria, who was flipping through her textbook, pestering Alexander with questions.

The realization hit him like a physical blow, freezing him in place.

Then, as if electrocuted, Julian suddenly stood up, knocking over his chair in the process.
###Chapter 255

Julian?

Alexander, Oliver, and the others froze when Julian suddenly stood up.

Noticing his odd expression, Alexander asked, "Is everything alright?"

Julian blinked, his gaze lingering on Alexander and Victoria for a moment before shaking his head. "No, it's nothing."

He sat back down.

Genevieve hesitated, then said, "Julian, I—"

But Julian didn’t seem to hear her. Instead, he turned to Lily and asked warmly, "Lily, are you thirsty? Would you like some water?"

Lily nodded eagerly. "Yes!"

She dashed over, took a few sips from Julian’s glass, then hurried back to continue chatting with Sophia. Earlier, they had been discussing the small toy Sophia had brought for her.

After drinking, Lily handed Sophia a figurine. "I got this when I went to the movies during New Year’s. It’s for you!"

Sophia’s eyes lit up as she accepted it. "You went to the movies too?"

"Yeah! My uncle and aunt took me," Lily said happily. "After the movie, we played arcade games. My aunt is really good at them! But Uncle Henry and I had to leave early."

"Uncle Henry took me to a movie that morning too," Sophia admitted wistfully. "But he was in a hurry to meet his friends, so we went straight home. I didn’t even know they sold figurines there."

Hearing that, Sophia felt a pang of disappointment.

Then, inspired by Lily’s praise for her aunt, she added softly, "My mom is amazing at games too."

"Next time, I’ll bring my aunt, and you can bring your mom! We can all play together!" Lily suggested excitedly.

As she spoke, she noticed Alexander watching them.

Sophia followed her gaze. "Dad, what’s wrong?"

Alexander smiled faintly. "Nothing. Keep talking."

"Okay!"

After ordering, Oliver suddenly asked, "By the way, Julian, how’s the collaboration between your company and YodaVision going? Still smooth?"

Julian replied, "It’s going well."

Oliver raised an eyebrow. "No unexpected issues?"

??

Victoria had been engrossed in her book, but at that, her fingers stilled mid-page-turn.

Having known each other for years, Julian understood Oliver was subtly asking if Isabella had caused any problems.

He noticed Alexander was also listening with interest.

Lowering his gaze, Julian answered, "None."

Oliver looked surprised. "Really? Not even one?"

"Mm."

Victoria pressed her lips together before flipping the page.

Alexander sipped his tea in silence.

Finding the topic dull, Oliver quickly changed the subject.

About two hours later, after finishing their meal, they left the restaurant. Just as they stepped outside, Isabella and Frederick’s group descended the stairs to leave as well.

Back home, Isabella immediately dove into the materials Frederick had given her.

The documents covered cutting-edge AI developments from around the world—most still in the conceptual stage, with no guarantee of becoming actual products.

She read for hours, so absorbed that she didn’t notice the night fading into dawn.

It wasn’t until the sun was high that her aunt, Caroline, gently knocked on her door. "Isabella, breakfast is ready."

Isabella replied, "I’ll be down soon."

After freshening up, she picked up her phone and dialed Nathaniel.

###Chapter 256

Nathaniel massaged his throbbing temples, his eyelids heavy with exhaustion. I knew you hadn't slept either!

I'm going down for breakfast now. We'll talk soon?

Despite his fatigue, Nathaniel sat slumped in his chair like a ragdoll, yet his voice crackled with energy. Talk? Absolutely, we must discuss this immediately!

Inspiration was a fickle mistress—it demanded to be captured in the moment.

Fine.

Just as Isabella finished her breakfast and reached for her phone to video call Nathaniel, Jonathan's call interrupted.

I just heard from Alexander's lawyer. The property deeds for the three villas transferred to you are ready. I'll collect them later today.

When would be convenient for you? If you're occupied, I can deliver them at your preferred time.

Isabella had nearly forgotten about this matter. Her mind was preoccupied elsewhere.

Hearing Jonathan's words, she responded, Thank you, Mr. Blackwood. I appreciate your help.

After hanging up, she and Nathaniel dove straight into work. They labored relentlessly until noon, their minds nearly fried from overexertion, before finally pausing for respite.

Isabella's last visit to Eleanor had been the previous Sunday. She and Margaret had planned another afternoon visit.

However, after pulling an all-nighter without sleep, Isabella suggested over lunch they postpone until evening.

Seeing her exhaustion, Margaret agreed. Very well, we'll go after dinner.

Isabella took a nap and didn't stir until nearly 6:00 pm.

After their evening meal, she and Margaret set off for the hospital.

Upon arrival, Alexander was absent.

They spent nearly two hours with Eleanor. As they prepared to leave, Alexander returned.

He showed no surprise at their presence, as if anticipating their visit.

Noticing their departure preparations, he said courteously, Thank you for visiting Grandmother.

Neither Isabella nor Margaret acknowledged him.

Alexander pressed the elevator button for them, then asked Isabella, Have you received the property deeds?

Not yet.

Stepping into the elevator, Isabella turned to him. No need to escort us. Go back inside.

Alexander hesitated but didn't insist. Nor did he press about the deeds, as if mentioning them had merely been an excuse for conversation.

When the elevator doors closed, Margaret finally asked, What property deeds?

He transferred some properties to me as part of the divorce settlement.

Margaret nodded. Since he gave them to you, keep them.

I intend to.

+26 MONILIS

By their return home, Jonathan had already arrived. His visit was brief, departing shortly after.

Isabella took the property deeds to her room, carelessly tucking them into a cabinet before showering. After an exhausting day and severe sleep deprivation, she fell asleep almost immediately after bathing.

The next morning, Isabella went for her usual run, ate breakfast, then left for work.

As she approached the YodaVision office building's underground parking entrance, she noticed a car with its window down.

Julian sat inside.

She frowned. Why was he here so early?

To her recollection, no meetings between YodaVision and Julian were scheduled today.
###Chapter 257

Isabella was lost in thought when Julian noticed her car approaching. He strode toward her with purposeful steps.

She lowered the window slowly. "Mr. Montgomery."

"Good morning."

Isabella gave a brief nod. "Morning." Her fingers tapped the steering wheel. "Did you need something, Mr. Montgomery?"

Truthfully, Julian had no particular reason for being here. The unanswered questions from last night still gnawed at him.

"Last Saturday," he began, "I saw you with Mr. Graves and Mr. Aldridge outside The Grandeur."

Isabella listened, her expression unreadable, until he dropped the bombshell. "You're also Mr. Aldridge's protégé, aren't you?"

Her body went rigid. "How did you—"

But Julian had already seen the truth in her startled reaction.

"Those two YodaVision projects," he pressed on. "They were your brainchild too, weren't they?"

Isabella's lips pressed into a thin line. "What exactly are you—"

"One more thing." Julian's voice grew intense. "The CUAP programming language YodaVision uses—that was your creation too, wasn't it?"

Though no coding expert himself, Julian came from a tech-savvy family. He understood CUAP's revolutionary potential. The language had been YodaVision's foundation since day one.

If his suspicions proved correct, it meant Isabella had developed this groundbreaking technology at just seventeen.

Even now, Victoria Kensington couldn't grasp CUAP's basic principles.

The realization hit Julian like a thunderbolt—the true genius behind YodaVision wasn't Nathaniel Graves.

It had been Isabella all along.

Silence stretched between them.

But Julian already had his answer.

Despite his earlier suspicions, the confirmation left him reeling. Memories flashed through his mind—every interaction, every conversation. He'd never truly known her at all.

"Did you come here just to interrogate me?" Isabella finally broke the silence.

"I needed to know." Julian ran a hand through his hair. "I didn't plan to ask these questions today."

Their current relationship made this none of his business. Yet the words had tumbled out the moment he saw her.

Even he was surprised by his own actions.

Before Isabella could respond, Julian met her gaze squarely. "Don't worry—your secret's safe with me." His voice carried quiet conviction. Isabella studied him but remained silent.

Julian stepped back, creating distance. "You should go. I won't keep you." With that, he turned and walked away.

Isabella watched his retreating figure before driving into the underground garage.

For the next ten days, Isabella and Nathaniel worked around the clock. Every spare moment was spent poring over Frederick Aldridge's research materials.

Dawn found them at the office; midnight often saw them still there.

Then one morning, Isabella found herself at the airport, waiting for an important business associate.

Twenty minutes passed before her guest finally appeared.
###Chapter 258

Isabella Sinclair was just about to greet her business partner when a familiar silhouette appeared behind him.

Her expression remained perfectly composed upon spotting Reginald Kensington.

Reginald didn't notice her at first. But the teenage boy beside him - around 17 with bright eyes - enthusiastically waved toward the arrivals gate.

"Mom! Victoria! Over here!"

The cheerful shout made Isabella freeze mid-step. Suddenly, she recognized him.

Turning her head confirmed her suspicion - Eleanor Kensington and Victoria Kensington stood there, smiling as Julian Kensington ran toward them.

Just then, The Grandeur's business partner Gregory Pembroke approached with a warm smile. "Ms. Sinclair."

Isabella unclenched her fist, tore her gaze away, and shook his hand with practiced ease. "Mr. Pembroke."

At that moment, the Kensington family finally noticed Isabella.

Reginald's brow furrowed slightly.

Eleanor's smile dimmed.

Victoria remained utterly indifferent.

Julian, oblivious to his family's reactions, followed their gaze. His jaw dropped when he saw Isabella. "Wow! She's stunning!"

Victoria elbowed him sharply.

Reginald placed a hand on Julian's shoulder, steering him away. "Let's get to the car."

But Julian suddenly remembered something. "Where's Alexander? He should be here to greet us! If he wants to marry my perfect sister, he'd better show proper respect!"

Victoria laughed, ruffling his hair. "Alexander had an important meeting. But he canceled his evening plans to reserve a private dining room for your welcome dinner. Happy now?"

"Barely." Julian lifted his chin. "You deserve nothing less, Vic. Any man would be lucky to have you!"

The family shared a laugh at his dramatic declaration.

Meanwhile, Isabella concluded her conversation with Gregory. They entered their waiting car just as she overheard bystanders whispering:

"What a gorgeous family! Are they famous?"

"So enviable - they look so close."

The car door shut, cutting off the voices.

During the forty-minute ride, Isabella maintained polite conversation with Gregory. At noon, their car pulled up to an upscale restaurant.

As they exited their vehicle, the Kensingtons arrived simultaneously.

Reginald frowned upon seeing Isabella again.

Victoria gave him a reassuring look. There was nothing to worry about.

Before Alexander had officially filed for divorce, he'd accompanied Victoria to meet her family. Back then, Isabella had been too intimidated to even speak up.

Now with the divorce nearly finalized, she wouldn't dare cause trouble.

Reginald understood, but remained cautious. He wouldn't let anything ruin this special day.

Isabella didn't spare them a glance.

Then Nathaniel Graves arrived.

The moment he stepped out of his car, he spotted the Kensingtons - and his gaze lingered on Julian.
###Chapter 259

Nathaniel and his group had already disappeared upstairs when Alexander stepped out of his car.

Alexander's sharp eyes scanned the area before landing on Gregory Pembroke.

After exchanging brief pleasantries, their group moved toward the elevator—only to be intercepted by Julian Kensington's arrival.

Gregory's face lit up. "Mr. Whitmore!"

Alexander's expression remained unreadable as his gaze flickered between Isabella and Nathaniel.

He offered Gregory a polite handshake. "Mr. Pembroke. Just arrived?"

"Moments ago," Gregory chuckled. "You mentioned dinner last time. How about tonight?"

"Not tonight," Alexander replied smoothly. "Perhaps in a few days."

"Of course, whenever suits you."

Nathaniel muttered under his breath, "Two weeks of peace, and now this."

Isabella stayed silent.

It had been two weeks since she last saw Alexander.

Even during her visit to Eleanor Whitmore at the hospital last weekend, he hadn’t been there.

Sophia had called her multiple times—especially in the last few days.

Winter break had started, and with Alexander and Victoria too busy to entertain her, Sophia had grown restless.

Isabella never answered.

To his credit, Alexander had kept his word. Whatever he’d told Sophia worked—because despite the ignored calls, the girl never showed up at the Sinclair residence.

A small mercy.

As she mused, Alexander and Gregory wrapped up their conversation. The group entered the elevator together.

Gregory, sensing the tension, shifted uncomfortably.

Isabella felt Alexander’s gaze on her. She lifted her chin, meeting his dark eyes.

Then he spoke. "When are you free?"

She looked away. "Never."

She didn’t need to guess—this was about Sophia.

Two weeks wasn’t a month.

Her schedule had been packed lately. No time for distractions.

Alexander’s lips curved slightly. "The Ember Festival is coming."

Isabella stiffened.

She’d been so busy she’d forgotten.

Still, she shrugged. "I don’t mind skipping a month."

Last month had been enough. What difference did one missed visit make?

Alexander arched a brow but said nothing.

Gregory, lost, glanced between them. "Ms. Sinclair, were you and Mr. Whitmore... involved?"

"No."

Gregory didn’t buy it. They looked like exes mid-argument.

Before he could pry further, his phone rang. The topic died.

After dinner, Isabella and Nathaniel descended to the parking lot—only to collide with Alexander and the Kensingtons again.

Julian’s voice carried. "You’d better treat my sister right! Hurt her, and you’ll regret it!"

This was Julian’s first meeting with Alexander.

Earlier, in the private dining room, he’d been too intimidated to speak up.

Alexander’s presence was overwhelming—clearly not a man to trifle with.

But over dinner, Alexander had been nothing but courteous.

Flattered by his family’s praise, Julian’s bravado had returned.

Now, he delivered his "warning" with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer.

In truth, Julian approved. Alexander was everything his sister could want—generous, powerful, and devoted to Victoria.

His words were tough, but everyone knew the truth.

Alexander smiled. "Understood."

Victoria beamed.

A picture-perfect moment.

Nathaniel scoffed.

Isabella remained impassive.

Gregory finally connected the dots. "So you weren’t with Mr. Whitmore?"

That stunning woman was Alexander’s girlfriend?

Isabella’s reply was ice. "Correct."

Alexander and Victoria turned at the sound of her voice.

Nathaniel had no interest in lingering. "Mr. Pembroke, the car’s ready."

Gregory, sensing the hostility, simply nodded at Alexander before climbing in.

Isabella and Nathaniel followed.

Within moments, their car vanished into the night.
###Chapter 260

The collaboration with Gregory Pembroke went off without a hitch.

Two days later, contracts were signed. With other commitments demanding his attention, Gregory left The Grandeur headquarters.

Exhausted after a grueling half-day session, Isabella Sinclair and Nathaniel Graves retreated to the conference room. They'd just settled with steaming cups of coffee when Victoria Chambers entered, dropping a towering stack of embossed invitations onto the table.

"Every year-end banquet invite we've received this week," she announced.

Thirty invitations at minimum. Dominic Fairchild's stood out immediately, alongside Julian Montgomery's, Whitmore Enterprises', and InnovaTech's.

Flipping through, Isabella's fingers paused. The Kensington family had sent one too.

Not just Nathaniel's name graced the Kensington invitation—hers was printed right beside it. Nathaniel lounged against the conference table, twirling the card between his fingers with a smirk. "Our little startup's making waves."

Truthfully, it wasn't The Grandeur's charm drawing them—it was their two flagship projects and the CUAP system the Kensingtons desperately wanted.

Desperate enough to include the woman they'd once dismissed.

What they didn't know? The tech they coveted hadn't come from Nathaniel at all.

Amusement glinted in his eyes as he watched Isabella sort through the pile.

Whitmore Enterprises, InnovaTech—all had shrewdly included her name.

Only Julian Montgomery had broken pattern, sending separate invitations.

Nathaniel chuckled. "Julian's got manners."

Isabella said nothing. She'd met Julian briefly when he'd asked if she studied under Frederick Aldridge.

"Skip Whitmore, InnovaTech, and the Kensingtons," Nathaniel decided, fanning the cards. "We'll attend Harper Corporation's—they've been decent partners. The others? A polite gift will suffice."

Some, like the Kensingtons, didn't even warrant that.

Clean breaks worked best.

"Agreed." Isabella's thoughts mirrored his. Between core operations and studying Frederick's materials, they had no time for pointless socializing.

The Grandeur was hosting its own banquet, but invitations wouldn't go out for days—their schedules were packed.

With fiscal year-end approaching, InnovaTech demanded follow-up. Next morning, Isabella arrived there with Dominic Vega's team.

Victoria Kensington passed them in the lobby. Neither woman acknowledged the other.

Mid-meeting, Isabella felt eyes on her. She turned—and immediately looked away.

Julian Kensington had been watching.

He'd grown bored after two days in Salzburg. Curiosity about his sister's workplace brought him to InnovaTech.

Spotting Isabella, he assumed she worked there. Her dismissive glance intrigued him.

"What's their team handling?" he asked his guide.

"Different department. Likely language system maintenance."

Julian considered observing, but their focus deterred him. "Where's my sister?"

"Ms. Kensington's in Conference Room B."

He followed, finding Victoria commanding a room of rapt executives.
###Chapter 261

Julian Montgomery remarked, "Everyone here seems to hold Victoria in high regard."

His guide smiled warmly. "Naturally. Ms. Kensington is exceptionally talented. The entire team admires her work."

He didn't mention the unspoken truth - that Victoria's connection to Alexander Whitmore brought substantial benefits to their department.

Hearing praise for his sister, Julian's chest swelled with pride. Yet he had no intention of interrupting her during work hours.

"Show me around the rest of the company," he requested instead.

"Of course."

As they exited, they nearly collided with Julian Montgomery arriving at the same moment.

The guide immediately straightened. "Mr. Montgomery."

Julian gave a curt nod, his sharp gaze assessing the younger man's student-like appearance. Recognition flickered but he remained silent.

"This is Ms. Kensington's brother, Julian Kensington," the guide supplied.

Though they'd never met, Julian recognized the name instantly. "You must be Julian," he ventured.

A single nod. "Hello."

Julian returned the greeting with equal brevity.

Before he could continue, Julian's attention snapped toward Isabella Sinclair working nearby. "I'll be over there," he announced abruptly.

Without awaiting response, he strode toward Isabella with purposeful steps.

Julian Kensington blinked in surprise.

Weren't Alexander's closest friends supposed to be on good terms with Victoria? Julian's indifference seemed... unexpected.

Not that Julian Montgomery cared about first impressions.

"Ms. Sinclair," he greeted when reaching her workstation.

Isabella turned, her expression freezing momentarily before smoothing into professionalism. "Mr. Montgomery."

Nearly half a month had passed since their last encounter - both consumed by year-end deadlines. Two days after their initial conversation, Julian had been abruptly summoned for confidential government meetings.

Not that he'd mention that now.

"Will you be attending our company banquet this weekend?" he inquired.

Isabella nodded. "Yes."

Ever since Julian's unexpected intervention regarding her uncle's situation, she'd noticed his markedly improved demeanor toward her.

Regardless of motives, he'd extended help when needed.

Their recent professional collaborations had proceeded seamlessly. When the personal invitation arrived, refusing would have been both unprofessional and ungrateful.

His lips curved slightly at her confirmation. "I appreciate that."

"You're too kind," she deflected politely.

Sensing her reluctance for extended conversation, Julian didn't press. "Don't let me interrupt your work."

Isabella returned to her discussion with Maxwell Sterling and the development team without further comment.

Yet Julian remained, observing their technical exchange with quiet intensity, occasionally interjecting pointed questions.

Though neither Julian nor Oliver Westbrook held operational roles at InnovaTech, as shareholders they'd be present for the impending annual meeting.

That very purpose had brought Julian here today.

Meanwhile, Victoria concluded her meeting and spotted her brother. "Finished touring?"

Julian nodded. "Saw everything worth seeing."

At that moment, Oliver Westbrook arrived.

"Victoria!" He greeted cheerfully before noticing her companion. "And this must be the famous younger brother? Impressive - the Kensington genes don't disappoint."

Victoria chuckled, about to make introductions when Julian interjected. "You're Oliver, right?"

Oliver's eyebrows shot up. "Spot on. Sharp eye."

Victoria opened her mouth again, but Julian scratched his head sheepishly. "Actually, I just met Julian earlier."

"Julian's here?" Victoria's gaze sharpened.

Julian gestured toward Isabella's workstation. "Over there."

Both Victoria and Oliver turned to observe Julian Montgomery engaged in what appeared to be an unusually amicable discussion with Isabella Sinclair.
###Chapter 262

Isabella noticed but remained indifferent.

Julian's sudden warmth toward her was purely business-related - a direct result of their YodaVision collaboration.

Oliver shared the same assessment.

This marked Julian's third encounter with Isabella.

"That woman," he asked casually, "is she Julian's lover?"

Oliver nearly spat out his drink. "Lover? Absolutely not. Don't invent rumors."

Being new to Salzburg, Calvin lacked context.

Both Oliver and Victoria assumed his assumption stemmed from Isabella's striking beauty and her undeniable chemistry with Julian.

"I see."

Yet Julian hadn't taken his eyes off Isabella since spotting her. That intensity suggested deeper feelings.

Even if they weren't involved now, Julian clearly had feelings for her.

Julian had noticed Victoria and Oliver's lingering stares.

As his meeting time approached, he bid Isabella a brief farewell.

Then he paused. "You're not attending The Grandeur's gala this weekend, are you?"

"No," Isabella confirmed.

Her definitive answer stirred something in Julian's chest. With a curt nod, he turned to leave.

Approaching Oliver, he nearly collided with Alexander's arrival.

Alexander's gaze flickered toward Isabella momentarily before dismissing her entirely. "Shall we begin the meeting?"

Julian noted Alexander's complete disinterest in his soon-to-be ex-wife.

His eyes darkened imperceptibly.

Before ascending, Alexander addressed Calvin. "Have you seen my office yet?"

"Not yet."

"I've prepared refreshments. Feel free to visit if you grow bored."

In just days, Alexander and Calvin had developed an easy rapport.

Post-meeting, The Grandeur's executives gathered for lunch.

Though neither high-ranking, Victoria and Calvin joined Alexander's car due to their personal connections.

Departing, Julian glanced back at The Grandeur's towering structure, thoughts lingering on Isabella. "When will Alexander's divorce finalize?" he asked Oliver.

Assuming professional concern, Oliver answered, "Delayed by share transfers in one of Alexander's companies. Soon, though."

"Understood."

At noon, Isabella dined with colleagues in The Grandeur's cafeteria.

After a brief rest, she resumed work.

By three, her tasks complete, she returned to YodaVision.

Come evening, Isabella arrived at Harper Corporation's gala with Nathaniel.

Hearing of their arrival, Julian went to greet them - then froze at the sight of Isabella.

Tonight she wore a breathtaking ombré gown, shifting from sapphire to amethyst, the off-shoulder design showcasing her luminous skin.

The flowing silhouette accentuated her natural grace.

Julian had never seen her so radiant.

Composing himself, he stepped forward. "Mr. Graves. Ms. Sinclair."

Nathaniel and Isabella returned the greeting in unison. "Mr. Montgomery."

Their pleasantries were interrupted by Alexander and Victoria's arrival.

Victoria's couture white gown and dazzling jewels made a striking impression.

Yet spotting Isabella, she faltered momentarily.

Isabella outshone every previous appearance.

But Victoria's confidence never wavered. Beauty meant nothing without substance - and she had both.

With that assurance, she turned to Alexander.

Noting his dispassionate glance toward Isabella, Victoria allowed herself a small, satisfied smile.
###Chapter 263

Julian Montgomery's gaze lingered on Isabella Sinclair when he spotted Alexander Whitmore and Victoria Kensington approaching.

Noticing Isabella's unchanged expression at their arrival, he lowered his head with a faint smile. "I'll be right back."

Isabella and Nathaniel Graves both nodded in acknowledgment.

Julian walked over and had barely exchanged greetings with Alexander and Victoria when Dominic Fairchild made his entrance.

The moment Dominic saw Victoria, his steps instinctively carried him toward her.

Victoria glanced at him and offered a polite smile. "Mr. Fairchild."

"Ms. Kensington." Dominic had been swamped with work lately and hadn’t seen her in weeks.

Now, standing before her, admiration flickered in his eyes. He stole another discreet glance before turning to greet Julian and Alexander.

YodaVision had become a critical partner for the Fairchild Group. After a brief exchange with Julian, Dominic made his way to Nathaniel and initiated the conversation.

After the usual pleasantries, he addressed Isabella with a cool, "Ms. Sinclair."

Isabella merely smiled, offering no verbal response.

YodaVision had already sent out invitations for its exclusive banquet, but the Fairchild Group hadn’t received one.

Dominic had only learned of this tonight.

If YodaVision couldn’t even extend an invitation to him, it was unlikely Isabella and Nathaniel would attend the Fairchild Group’s banquet tomorrow.

The realization made his frown deepen.

Neither Isabella nor Nathaniel showed any interest in engaging with him. Nathaniel cut straight to the point. "Mr. Fairchild, we have some old friends to greet. Excuse us."

Without waiting for a reply, they turned and walked away.

Dominic knew full well they simply didn’t want to speak to him. Truthfully, he had hoped to establish a better rapport with Nathaniel.

But despite their long-standing business ties, Nathaniel had never given him an opening. His disdain was so blatant he didn’t even bother masking it.

Dominic pressed his lips together, irritation simmering beneath the surface as he watched them leave.

For the past few months, YodaVision had been the center of attention. Spotting Isabella and Nathaniel, many guests eagerly approached them.

Among them were several recent business partners of YodaVision.

Since their investment conference, Isabella had taken the lead on numerous deals, showcasing her formidable skills in the field.

Some executives had even attempted to poach her, though she’d declined every offer.

Still, they remained cordial, treating her with respect.

Now, seeing her again, one couldn’t resist making another recruitment attempt right in front of Nathaniel.

"Ms. Sinclair, our company ranks among the nation’s top firms. The benefits are unmatched, and we’re open to negotiation on any terms."

These people had nerve.

Isabella smiled politely. "I have no plans to leave YodaVision at this time, but I appreciate the offer, Mr. Holloway."

Vincent Holloway sighed heavily at her refusal.

Moments later, someone noticed his frustration and teased, "Vincent, you look like you just lost a billion-dollar deal."

"Close enough."

Since the man wasn’t a competitor, Vincent confided, "I found an exceptional talent, but she won’t budge no matter what I offer."

"Oh? Who?"

"Ms. Sinclair from YodaVision."

"Her? She seems quite young. Is she really that capable?"

"Absolutely."

His company’s top technical experts—handpicked by Vincent himself—had praised her extensively after their discussions.

For them to speak so highly of her spoke volumes.

Victoria remained oblivious to the praise Isabella was receiving. She was deep in conversation with Jonathan Sterling.

After mingling with a few guests, Dominic stepped aside. Noticing Victoria wasn’t with Alexander, he approached her.

Spotting him, Victoria offered a faint smile. "Mr. Fairchild."

Dominic nodded, then glanced at Jonathan. "And this is...?"

Victoria introduced Jonathan’s background before adding, "He’s my mentor now. I’ve been learning from him and have gained invaluable knowledge."

She had previously expressed her desire to study under Frederick Aldridge and had been working tirelessly toward that goal.

Hearing her now, Dominic realized her determination ran deeper than he’d imagined. His admiration for her dedication grew.

Stepping back, he said, "I’ll leave you to it."

Victoria nodded and resumed her discussion with Jonathan.

Dominic found it hard to look away from her focused expression.

Just then, someone approached him for a conversation, pulling him away.

Later, as Dominic excused himself to head to the restroom, he spotted Isabella and Alexander in a secluded corner.

He froze.

The memory of Alexander embracing Isabella months ago resurfaced abruptly.

Before he could process it, he saw Alexander pick up a slice of cake and offer it to her.

Dominic’s expression darkened. Lips pressed tight, he strode toward them.

Isabella didn’t reach for the cake.

As Dominic neared, Alexander noticed him and turned. "Mr. Fairchild."
###Chapter 264

Dominic Fairchild's voice cut through the air like ice. "What were you two discussing?"

Alexander Whitmore flashed a charming smile. "We hadn't even started our conversation yet."

Before Dominic could respond, Isabella Sinclair walked right past him without acknowledgment, her heels clicking decisively against the marble floor.

Dominic's eyes followed her retreating figure before snapping back to Alexander. That's when he noticed the two cocktails in Alexander's hands. "Those are...?"

"Custom blends," Alexander replied smoothly. "Care to try one, Mr. Fairchild?"

Dominic hesitated. "Is the other one for Ms. Kensington?"

"Yes."

Just as Dominic opened his mouth to speak, Alexander suddenly said, "Excuse me for a moment. Make yourself comfortable, Mr. Fairchild."

Dominic's brow furrowed as he tracked Alexander's movement across the room. His gaze landed on Victoria Kensington standing near Nathaniel Graves, with Isabella approaching them.

Dominic froze.

Was Alexander rushing over because he feared Victoria might face hostility from Isabella and Nathaniel?

The thought made Dominic's frown deepen as he followed.

Victoria had just arrived and barely exchanged greetings with Nathaniel when Isabella returned.

Victoria barely glanced at Isabella. Treating her like air, she addressed Nathaniel directly. "Mr. Graves—"

"You're back?" Nathaniel completely ignored Victoria, his attention fixed on Isabella. "Everything alright?"

He'd seen Alexander heading their way earlier. He would have intercepted too, but Victoria had blocked his path.

Isabella shook her head. "I'm fine."

As Alexander had said, their conversation hadn't even begun before Dominic appeared. Nothing had transpired.

At that moment, both Alexander and Dominic arrived.

Alexander handed the second cocktail to Victoria. "What were you discussing?"

Victoria's expression softened at his approach. Accepting the drink, she smiled. "I wanted to consult Mr. Graves about something, but we haven't had the chance yet."

Alexander nodded, then turned to Nathaniel. "Mr. Graves, when might you be available for dinner?"

The unspoken offer to arrange a private meeting between Victoria and Nathaniel hung in the air.

Isabella's expression turned glacial.

Nathaniel merely scoffed, his tone dripping with sarcasm. "Sorry. I'm booked—indefinitely."

Without waiting for a response, he turned to Isabella. "Bella, let's go."

Isabella nodded, not sparing them another glance as she left with Nathaniel.

Dominic had initially suspected something between Alexander and Victoria.

But seeing Alexander's obvious concern for Victoria—even attempting to broker a meeting with Nathaniel—made Dominic realize he'd overthought things.

There was no real enmity between Nathaniel and Victoria. Nathaniel simply stood as Isabella's staunchest ally.

If Alexander succeeded in mending relations between Victoria and Nathaniel, Isabella would lose her greatest advantage.

For Victoria, this could only be beneficial.

Further away, Nathaniel clicked his tongue. "You sure you're okay?"

Isabella nodded. "Perfectly fine."

Compared to past events, this was nothing.

Nathaniel asked, "Leaving now?"

They'd planned to depart earlier. This little scene had been an unexpected delay.

Isabella nodded. "Yes."

Before leaving, they went to bid farewell to Julian Montgomery.

Julian seemed surprised by their early departure but recognized Isabella's distaste for socializing. Rather than press her, he simply said, "Let me walk you out."
###Chapter 265

The Grandeur banquet was held three nights after the Montgomery Corporation's event.

Julian arrived unusually early that evening.

With Alexander, Dominic, and Simon absent, the Grandeur banquet proceeded without major incidents. The guest list was impressive that night.

Isabella and Nathaniel were swamped with hosting duties, barely finding time to acknowledge Julian's presence.

It wasn't until midway through the event when they spotted Julian conversing with Charles that they realized he hadn't left yet.

After all, the Kensington family was hosting their own gala that same evening.

They'd assumed Julian's early arrival meant he'd leave halfway to attend the Kensington affair. But surprisingly...

Nathaniel nodded approvingly. "Now this is how you show commitment to a business partnership. Textbook professionalism. Unlike that Dominic Fairchild - I don't even want to discuss him."

Isabella raised an eyebrow in surprise.

Since Julian was demonstrating such respect, it would be rude for them not to reciprocate.

They approached him politely. "Mr. Montgomery, please forgive any oversight in our hospitality tonight with so many guests to attend to."

Throughout the evening, Julian's gaze had kept drifting toward Isabella - though no one seemed to notice.

He raised his champagne flute, clinking it lightly against theirs. "No formalities between friends," he said after taking a sip.

Though their business collaboration had been smooth, Nathaniel never considered them actual friends. He dismissed Julian's words as mere social niceties.

Still, he appreciated Julian's ability to prioritize business over personal grievances.

While Julian appeared to be speaking to Nathaniel, his attention remained fixed on Isabella.

Tonight's banquet primarily honored Nathaniel and Isabella.

Despite Nathaniel's protective presence, Isabella had still consumed considerable alcohol.

Her cheeks glowed pink, eyes slightly glassy - softening her usual sharp demeanor into something almost... adorable.

Julian's grip tightened momentarily on his glass before he deliberately looked away.

Though she'd been drinking, Isabella remained far from intoxicated.

As the event wound down, she escorted Julian to the exit.

He paused at the threshold.

A winter breeze swept through the doorway as his gaze dropped to the sliver of bare leg visible beneath her flowing gown.

"No need to see me out further."

Isabella nodded. "Safe travels."

Julian studied her, seeming to wrestle with unspoken words before finally turning away without another word.

After the key guests departed, Isabella finally entered Charles' car and left the venue. Julian, however, remained.

He'd been concerned about her safety after drinking.

Only after watching Charles' car disappear down the street did he tell his driver, "We can go now."

The next morning, Isabella ate breakfast while Caroline and Margaret discussed Ember Festival preparations.

Tomorrow was Ember Festival Eve. Starting today, the company officially closed for holidays.

"I'll join you both," Isabella announced.

Margaret beamed. "Perfect! We'll make a day of it."

Then, hesitating slightly, she asked, "Is Sophia spending the holidays with the Whitmores this year?"

At the mention of Sophia, Isabella's smile dimmed. "I believe so."

That day when she'd received Gregory, she'd encountered Alexander in the elevator. He'd subtly hinted about hoping she'd look after Sophia.

But since then, neither Alexander nor Sophia had reached out.

The Novel will be updated first on this website. Come back and continue reading tomorrow, everyone!
###Chapter 266

Given the circumstances, Sophia would most likely be celebrating the Ember Festival at Whitmore Manor this year.

Margaret felt a pang of sadness at the thought of being separated from Sophia, and her heart ached for Isabella. But Isabella remained composed, gently reassuring her grandmother, "Don't worry about me, Grandma. Sophia's happiness is all that matters."

Margaret suspected Isabella was merely putting on a brave face to avoid causing concern. With a quiet sigh, she let the matter drop.

After breakfast, Isabella and Caroline headed out to complete their festival shopping.

The streets were alive with vibrant decorations. Traditional holiday melodies filled the air, creating an infectious celebratory atmosphere.

Truth be told, Caroline and the others had already done most of their shopping.

The essentials were all prepared at home. Today's outing was simply to pick up any remaining items they might have overlooked.

Groups of children dressed in festive attire skipped down the sidewalks, waving glowing wands that sparkled in the sunlight.

Isabella froze when she spotted a little girl bouncing past in a red velvet dress.

Every year before Sophia left with Alexander, Isabella would buy her several sets of these special holiday outfits.

Sophia had adored them. The light wands had been her particular favorite.

During previous festivals, those glowing toys had kept her entertained for hours. She'd spend evenings carefully placing candles inside, then dancing around the garden with her illuminated treasure.

But that was two years ago.

The first year after Sophia left, she'd celebrated abroad with Alexander.

Last year when she returned, she'd suddenly declared these traditions childish and refused to participate.

Isabella never forced the issue.

She tried selecting alternative gifts, but Sophia rejected those too.

At first, Isabella blamed herself for losing touch with her daughter's tastes. Eventually, she realized Sophia simply didn't want anything from her.

Shaking off the memory, Isabella hurried to catch up with Margaret and Caroline.

Meanwhile, Edward and William secretly texted Isabella, begging her to buy extra fireworks for a garden display that evening.

Isabella smiled at their message and typed a quick reply: "Consider it done."

In all her years married to Alexander, he'd rarely been in Salzburg for holidays. Even during festival seasons, he was usually jetting off somewhere for business.

Yet despite his absence, Isabella had always brought Sophia back to Whitmore Manor for the Ember Festival celebrations.

Come to think of it, seven years had passed since she'd last celebrated with the Sinclair family. Tucking her phone away, she was about to head to the fireworks stall when her device buzzed again.

Nathaniel was calling.

He informed her he'd purchased an extravagant amount of premium fireworks and wanted to send some over.

Isabella didn't hesitate. "Thank you, Nathaniel."

From his tone, it sounded like a substantial shipment. Probably enough that she wouldn't need to buy any herself.

No sooner had she ended that call than her phone rang again.

Julian Montgomery this time.

Isabella hesitated briefly before answering. "Mr. Montgomery."

"I ordered a selection of fireworks earlier. Lily insisted I send some to you. Just give me your address, and I'll arrange delivery."

Isabella blinked in surprise. "That's very kind, but—"

"Then perhaps you should tell Lily that yourself?"

A brief pause. Then quietly: "Please thank Lily for me."
###Chapter 267

Nathaniel had visited the Sinclair residence previously, so he delivered the fireworks without delay.

As for Julian, to prevent any complications, Isabella provided him with an address close to the Sinclair home instead.

At approximately 2:00 pm, Isabella drove to the designated meeting location.

During their phone conversation, Julian mentioned he'd send someone to deliver the fireworks. But when she parked and stepped out, Isabella was taken aback to find Julian waiting in person.

"You made it," Julian said.

"Mm-hmm."

"Pop the trunk."

After Isabella complied, Julian loaded not just the fireworks but several gift boxes as well.

Seeing the additional packages, Isabella protested, "These really aren't necessary—"

"Lily insisted I bring them," Julian explained.

She then placed a handmade friendship bracelet and some afternoon purchases into Julian's vehicle. "These are for Lily."

Julian's lips curved. "Much appreciated."

Among her gifts, his attention caught on a plush rabbit. He lifted it questioningly. "And this?"

"It's a light-up toy wand," Isabella clarified. "I bought two—a bear and a rabbit. Children usually love them."

Julian inspected them. Both plush wands boasted festive, adorable designs.

He nodded approvingly. "Lily will adore them. Thanks."

"Just a simple gift exchange—no thanks needed."

After replacing the wand, Julian gestured toward a nearby café. "Care to grab a coffee?"

Isabella shook her head. "Can't stay. I've got errands to run."

Margaret was being discharged from the hospital that evening. She needed to accompany her grandmother there.

Julian paused. "Understood."

With minimal further conversation, Isabella entered her car and departed.

Shortly after arriving home, she and Margaret collected their prepared gifts for Eleanor and headed to the hospital. They'd already notified Eleanor in advance.

Upon arrival, only Eleanor and her caretaker, Margaret Thornton, occupied the hospital room.

Whether to avoid awkwardness or for other reasons, Sophia was conspicuously absent.

Margaret Sinclair's face fell momentarily before schooling her expression.

Eleanor noticed immediately.

She was also aware of Isabella and Alexander's impending divorce.

Since New Year's Day—when Richard returned without Isabella—Eleanor had realized that even before the official divorce, Isabella was already severing ties with the Whitmore family. She'd guessed Isabella wouldn't be celebrating Ember Festival at Whitmore Manor this year.

Regarding Sophia's custody, she'd broached the subject with Alexander days prior. But he remained unmovable.

When she'd asked where Sophia would spend Ember Festival, he'd said it was her choice.

However, Sophia had been traveling abroad and was only returning tonight, leaving Eleanor no opportunity to ask.

Seeing her old friend's disappointment, Eleanor's guilt intensified.

The truth was, Sophia had grown increasingly attached to Alexander. Without Sophia's explicit consent, Eleanor couldn't promise Margaret or Isabella anything.

Though silent, both Margaret and Isabella understood her position.

So they avoided mentioning Sophia, sticking to lighter topics and inquiring about Eleanor's recovery. Within half an hour, discharge time arrived.

Not wanting to overstay, Isabella and Margaret prepared to leave.

Eleanor had gifts prepared as well, which her staff brought down to the lobby.

Shortly after their departure, Alexander arrived.

Eleanor knew he'd timed his visit to avoid crossing paths with Isabella.

The divorce was inevitable—she couldn't stop it.

Watching Alexander skillfully peel an apple at her bedside, Eleanor pressed her lips together. "Alexander, Sophia is Isabella's biological daughter. Can't you at least grant her custody?"

Alexander continued peeling with practiced ease. "Sophia is my daughter too."

Eleanor's temper flared. "You barely acknowledged her these past years, and now you fight for custody?"

He arranged the sliced apple neatly on a plate. "I've changed."

Eleanor turned away, refusing the offering.

Alexander set the plate down. "Grandmother, this is between us. Please don't interfere."

After completing discharge formalities, he first escorted Eleanor back to Whitmore Manor. Later, he'd collect Sophia from the airport himself.
###Chapter 268

"Dad! Victoria!"

The moment Sophia Whitmore stepped out of the airport and spotted Alexander and Victoria Kensington, she let go of Margaret Dawson's hand and sprinted toward them, throwing herself into their arms.

Inside the car, Sophia dug through her small backpack and proudly presented the souvenirs she'd picked up during her trip.

"Dad, Victoria, I got you gifts!"

Victoria accepted them with a warm smile, gently ruffling Sophia's hair. "Thank you, sweetheart."

That evening, since Eleanor Whitmore was being discharged from the hospital, Alexander and Sophia were heading back to the Whitmore Manor for dinner.

After dropping Victoria off at her place, Alexander instructed the driver to turn toward the Whitmore estate.

During the ride, Alexander was occupied with work, so Sophia entertained herself quietly, not wanting to disturb him.

When they arrived, Sophia leaped out of the car, slinging her backpack over her shoulder as she dashed toward the house, calling out, "Mom! Mom!"

Alexander tucked away his laptop and stepped out. Hearing her, he said calmly, "Your mom isn't here."

Sophia froze mid-step and turned to look at him. "Huh? Mom's not home?"

"No."

"Is she still busy?"

Alexander ruffled her hair with his large hand. "Maybe you should call and ask her."

"Okay."

Lately, every time she called, her mom never answered.

It hadn’t been so bad when she was at home, but being abroad—without Alexander or Victoria around—had made her feel lonely. Even though they video-chatted daily, it wasn’t the same as having them physically there.

In those first few days overseas, she had missed her mom the most. She’d called every day, but Isabella never picked up.

Eventually, Sophia stopped trying, assuming her mom was just too busy.

Before returning, she’d secretly hoped Isabella would come to the airport.

But since Alexander and Victoria had promised to be there, Sophia hadn’t called. She’d assumed her mom would be waiting at the manor.

Now, standing there, she suddenly didn’t feel like calling anymore. Even if she did, her mom probably wouldn’t answer.

The excitement of coming home dimmed.

Alexander crouched slightly, pinching her cheek lightly. "Are you crying?"

Sophia pursed her lips and turned away. "No, I'm not!"

He smirked. "So you're giving up? Don’t want to call your mom anymore?"

Sophia hesitated before whispering, "N-no..."

She still wanted to call.

Alexander chuckled but didn’t press further. Instead, he scooped her up. "Let’s go inside."

Sophia wrapped her arms around his neck, nestling into his warmth. Finally, she felt a little better.

Inside, the Whitmore family was waiting for them to start dinner. As they entered, all eyes turned their way—especially Eleanor’s, who lit up at the sight of Sophia.

"Sophia, you're back! Come here, let me see you."

Sophia slid down from Alexander’s arms and ran over. "Grandma!"

She greeted the others cheerfully. "Grandmother, Aunt Victoria, Uncle Henry."

Victoria and Catherine Whitmore responded politely, though their tones were indifferent. Henry, however, was delighted. He stood, hugged her, and immediately started teasing her.

Sophia giggled as he playfully messed with her hair.

Then, out of nowhere, Henry tilted his head and asked, "By the way, Alex—where’s Isabella?"
###Chapter 269

When Catherine and the others arrived at Whitmore Manor and didn't see Isabella, they assumed she'd gone to the airport with Alexander to pick up Sophia.

Now that Alexander and Sophia had returned home, but Isabella was still missing, they found it strange.

Not that they particularly cared about Isabella's whereabouts. They couldn't be bothered to ask.

Alexander simply stated, "She's occupied."

Henry didn't question it and continued playing with Sophia.

Eleanor, however, understood the situation perfectly but chose to remain silent.

After dinner, Sophia entertained herself for a while before growing bored and deciding to call Isabella.

Even during holidays, Isabella refused to remain idle.

When Sophia's call came through, Isabella was reviewing documents sent by Frederick.

Seeing the caller ID and realizing nearly a month had passed since their last meeting, she answered casually.

"Hello?"

Isabella hadn't answered her calls for so long that Sophia had nearly given up hope.

Hearing her mother's voice unexpectedly, she squealed with delight. "Mommy!"

Isabella kept her eyes on the computer screen as she responded indifferently. "Hmm."

Sophia, oblivious to her mother's detached tone, excitedly announced, "Mommy, I'm back from Salzburg!"

Isabella hadn't even known her daughter left the country. She responded with a noncommittal hum.

From the moment Isabella answered, Sophia had been floating on cloud nine. She bounced excitedly on her bed.

"Mommy, when will you finish work? Are you coming home tonight? I want you to tuck me in! I have so many stories to tell you!"

"And I really want your pancakes tomorrow morning. When are you coming back?"

Isabella didn't mention she wouldn't be returning to Whitmore Manor. Instead, she said, "I'm swamped right now. Next month, I'll take you out."

It had been ages since their last outing. The thought made Sophia giddy with excitement.

"Next month?" Though only days away, it felt like an eternity to Sophia.

She pressed further. "Which day next month?"

Even through the phone, Isabella could feel Sophia's desperate need for connection.

Her grip on the mouse tightened before she finally said, "We'll see. I'll let you know when I decide, alright?"

"Okay."

"Have you bathed yet?" Isabella asked.

"Not yet. But soon."

"Then go take your bath. I have work to finish. I need to go now."

"But we just started talking!" Sophia protested, glancing at the call duration. "Mommy, it's only been two minutes! Can't we talk longer?"

"Next time when I'm free, we'll talk properly," Isabella replied.

Reluctantly, Sophia conceded. "Okay. But Mommy, you have to promise."

"I will."

Only then did Sophia whisper, "Goodbye, Mommy."

"Bye." Isabella ended the call immediately.

Sophia suddenly remembered the gift she'd bought for her mother. She opened her mouth to mention it, but the line had already gone dead.

Her small heart sank with disappointment.

Setting down her phone, she climbed off the bed and went to find Alexander in his study.

Alexander was in the middle of a video conference.

Seeing her enter, he adjusted his camera angle and muted the microphone. "What's wrong? Couldn't get through?"
###Chapter 270

Sophia shook her head. She picked up the phone.

Alexander cradled her in his arms, his thumb gently massaging her temple as he studied her delicate features - the same arched brows and piercing eyes that mirrored his own. "You spoke with her," he murmured, "yet you're still upset?"

The little girl's forehead creased. "I am happy...but..."

It had been months since she'd heard her mother's voice. Now that the call finally came, joy should have flooded her heart. Yet...

"But what?" Alexander pressed.

Sophia's lower lip trembled. "But I also feel sad."

Alexander chuckled, resting his chin on his palm. "That's quite profound for a six-year-old. You're just missing your mother after so long apart. Once her project wraps up, she'll make time for you."

Sophia nodded, but her pout remained. "Mom said she won't be free until next month."

"Then we'll count down the days together, alright?"

"Alright."

Fatigue began weighing on Sophia's eyelids. After a few more minutes of conversation, she yawned, slid from Alexander's embrace, and shuffled off to her bedroom.

The eve of the Ember Festival arrived.

By midmorning, Catherine and Henry still hadn't caught sight of Isabella.

On New Year's Day, Richard had visited Eleanor at the hospital, but Isabella never appeared. Catherine assumed some crisis had struck the Sinclair family.

Yesterday, when Eleanor was discharged, Isabella's absence continued. Alexander simply claimed she was occupied.

Given Isabella's devotion to Sophia, Catherine never imagined the divorce would actually proceed. She'd dismissed the possibility entirely.

But today felt different.

Isabella didn't share Alexander's demanding career. No matter how dire the Sinclair family situation, she should have carved out time for a brief visit.

When Alexander descended the stairs at eleven, Catherine could no longer contain her curiosity. "Have you and Isabella finalized the divorce?"

Henry, present in the room, froze. He hadn't questioned Isabella's absence these past days. But Catherine's words struck him like lightning.

Alexander sipped his tea calmly. "Not yet. The process is underway."

Henry's eyes widened. They were actually going through with it?

He'd always known Alexander didn't love Isabella, but after all these years, he assumed their marriage would continue indefinitely.

The reality stunned him.

Catherine studied Alexander...

If love had never existed between them, perhaps divorce was for the best.

But Victoria...

She opened her mouth to speak when Alexander, as if anticipating her thoughts, stood abruptly. "I have a meeting."

With that, he departed.

Catherine frowned. "You—"

Meanwhile at the Sinclair residence, dinner concluded beneath a starless night sky.

Isabella, Edward and William were preparing fireworks when Julian's video call notification flashed across her screen.

Isabella hesitated.

Julian never called without reason.

She answered to find Lily's beaming face filling the display.

"Ms. Isabella!"

Isabella smiled. "Happy Ember's Day, Lily."

"Happy Ember's Day!" Lily appeared to be in a garden. She passed the phone to Julian and raised a glowing rabbit-shaped lantern. "Look, Ms. Isabella! My lantern's so pretty! I love it! Thank you!"

"As long as you're happy, that's what matters."

Lily grinned. "Ms. Isabella, Uncle Julian and I are lighting fireworks later. Want to join us?"

Assuming Lily meant visiting the Montgomery estate, Isabella replied, "Not tonight, sweetheart. I have plans. Next time, okay?"

"Oh...okay."

Their conversation continued briefly before something distracted Lily, sending her skipping away.

Julian reclaimed the phone. "Happy Ember's Day."

"Happy Ember's Day."

Without Lily's chatter, silence stretched uncomfortably between them.

Julian cleared his throat. "Any plans? Fireworks? Midnight countdown?"

Isabella shook her head. "Probably."

Edward and William wanted to go out. She'd likely accompany them.

Isabella thought Julian was merely exchanging pleasantries and didn't dwell on it. The conversation still felt stilted between them.

"I should get going," she said abruptly. "Let's talk another time?"

Julian gave a curt nod. "Of course."

With a polite smile, Isabella met his gaze one last time through the screen before disconnecting.

She placed her phone on the wrought-iron garden table with deliberate care. The distant laughter of Edward and William reached her ears as they prepared the fireworks display.

Stepping onto the dew-kissed grass, Isabella quickened her pace toward the commotion. The night air carried the scent of gunpowder and childhood nostalgia.

"Save some sparklers for me!" she called out, her earlier tension dissolving like sugar in tea.

William waved a bundle of Roman candles triumphantly. Edward stood ready with a lighter, his grin visible even in the twilight.

Isabella's heart lightened as she joined her cousins in their impromptu pyrotechnics show. The brilliant colors exploding against the velvet sky momentarily erased all thoughts of awkward video calls and unfinished conversations.

"Watch this one!" Edward shouted as he lit the fuse of a spinning wheel firework.

The sudden burst of golden sparks reflected in Isabella's wide eyes as she laughed freely for the first time that evening. Tomorrow's problems could wait - tonight belonged to family and fireworks.
###Chapter 271

Julian had just hung up when Lily came sprinting toward him, waving a glowing wand excitedly. "Uncle Julian! Can I video call Sophia?"

After a brief hesitation, he nodded. "Go ahead."

The call connected almost immediately, with Sophia answering on the first ring.

Lily's face lit up the moment the screen cleared. "Sophia! Look what I have!" She brandished the wand with pride.

Concerned Sophia couldn't see it properly, Lily handed the phone to Julian and backed up several paces, twirling to display the entire wand.

The garden's dim lighting made the wand's glow even more striking against the evening shadows.

Sophia was still processing the sight when Lily rushed back, grinning. "It's my Ember Festival present! Isn't it amazing?"

Many childhood memories from two years ago had faded for Sophia.

But seeing Lily with that wand sparked sudden, vivid recollections.

"Yeah, it's beautiful," she admitted. "I think I had one like that too."

"Really? You don't have one now?" Lily's nose scrunched in confusion.

Sophia shook her head. Watching Lily dance with the glowing wand looked incredibly fun.

An idea struck her. "I'm asking Dad to get me one right now! Don't hang up - I'll be back!"

Before Lily could respond, Sophia bolted upstairs with the phone still connected.

The night before Ember Festival always brought part of the Whitmore extended family to the manor for celebrations.

Alexander was currently circulating among guests when his daughter came barreling toward him.

Excusing himself, he scooped Sophia up and stepped aside. "What's wrong, sweetheart?"

"Lily got a glowing wand for the festival. I want one too."

"A glowing wand?"

"Not like the ones in my room." Sophia thrust the phone forward. "Lily, show Daddy your wand!"

Understanding dawned as Lily demonstrated the sparkling toy from several feet away.

After examining it, Alexander smiled. "Got it. Thank you, Lily."

"You're welcome!"

Alexander then addressed Julian, who still held the phone. "Any plans tonight?" Julian hesitated. "Probably the countdown. You?"

"I'll be heading out," Alexander replied.

Julian wasn't surprised.

On this significant night, of course Alexander would go to Isabella.

Julian didn't pry, changing the subject instead. "Were you tied up earlier?"

"Still hosting," Alexander confirmed.

Julian understood completely.

As head of the Whitmore family, Ember Festival was never simple for Alexander.

"I'll let you get back to it then."

"Appreciate it."

Before returning the phone, Alexander smiled at his daughter. "Enjoy the festival."

"You too!"

Handing the phone back, he promised, "You two chat. I'll have someone get you that wand."

"Yay!" Sophia cheered as her father walked away.

Julian likewise passed the phone to Lily for the girls to continue their conversation.

When discussing plans earlier, Julian hadn't asked Alexander's destination, just as Alexander hadn't extended an invitation.

That unspoken understanding said everything - tonight, Alexander wanted no company.
###Chapter 272

The fireworks display ended with a spectacular finale.

Isabella Sinclair and William Sinclair said their goodbyes to the family elders and stepped out into the night.

Their destination was the Salzburg Sky Tower—the perfect vantage point to admire the city's dazzling Ember Festival lights.

On the eve of the holiday, the tower hosted a breathtaking light show along with other festive performances.

By the time they arrived, the plaza was already packed with excited spectators.

Laughter and cheerful chatter filled the crisp night air.

The main event hadn't begun yet.

Edward Sinclair and his university friends had planned to celebrate the festival here together.

Spotting his group near the fountain, Edward excused himself to join them.

When they noticed Isabella and William, Edward's friends greeted them politely—though their gazes kept drifting toward Isabella with poorly concealed admiration.

"Your cousin is stunning," one of them whispered to Edward.

Edward smirked. "Obviously."

The group immersed themselves in the festive atmosphere, snapping photos and recording videos of the pre-show entertainment.

Isabella and William hung back, content to let the younger crowd enjoy themselves.

Then Isabella's phone buzzed.

A text from Julian Montgomery: Are you watching the light show at the Sky Tower tonight?

Frowning slightly, she typed back: Already here. Why?

Julian responded instantly: Lily and I are on our way too.

Isabella stared at the screen. What a coincidence.

Julian didn't elaborate further.

Soon, the light show began—a mesmerizing symphony of colors dancing across the cityscape.

Isabella was completely absorbed until a familiar voice called out: "Ms. Sinclair!"

Turning, she saw Julian approaching with little Lily Montgomery in his arms.

The moment Lily spotted Isabella, she squealed with delight and reached out.

Isabella took William's hand as they navigated through the crowd. When they reached Julian, she gathered the beaming child into her arms.

Lily clung to Isabella's neck, her wide eyes reflecting the kaleidoscope of lights above. "Ms. Sinclair, look! So pretty!"

Isabella chuckled. "I see it, sweetheart."

The joyous atmosphere was infectious, and Isabella found herself smiling genuinely for the first time that evening.

Julian watched them for a moment before gently retrieving Lily, concerned about Isabella's arms tiring. "Where's Edward? Didn't he come with you?"

"He's over there with his friends." Isabella gestured toward the boisterous group nearby.

As she turned back, her smile froze.

Three familiar figures stood just twenty feet away.

Reginald Kensington. Eleanor Kensington. Julian Kensington.

She couldn't hear their conversation, but the affectionate way Reginald ruffled young Julian's hair spoke volumes. They stood close together—a picture-perfect family enjoying the festival.

Isabella's expression darkened instantly.

Julian Montgomery noticed the change immediately. Following her gaze, he spotted the Kensingtons.

Before he could react, young Julian noticed them too.

"Julian!" The boy waved excitedly, drawing his parents' attention.

Reginald and Eleanor's faces lit up when they saw Julian Montgomery—until their eyes landed on Isabella. The warmth vanished, replaced by thinly veiled hostility.

Eleanor's brows furrowed the moment she saw Isabella standing beside Julian.

Since they'd been spotted, ignoring them would be rude.

Julian hesitated before turning to Isabella. "I should go say hello."

Her reply was clipped. "Of course."

After one last searching look, Julian carried Lily toward the Kensingtons.

William had noticed Isabella's sudden shift in demeanor.

She didn't know all the details of Isabella's past, but Reginald Kensington was more than just a vague memory. The way Isabella's entire body tensed at the sight of them told William everything she needed to know.

Her chest tightened. "Maybe we should leave?" she suggested softly, squeezing Isabella's hand.

Isabella shook her head. "I'm fine."

Her reaction wasn't about lingering feelings for Reginald.

It was about seeing him with Eleanor—and remembering her mother.

Especially tonight.

Why did they get to celebrate happily as a family when her mother—

No, not just the three of them. A family of four.

Victoria Kensington was probably out somewhere with Alexander Whitmore.

They'd destroyed her mother's life, yet their perfect little family continued to thrive. The injustice burned.

William squeezed her hand again but remained silent.

She understood their family wasn't like others.

For them, holidays weren't about celebration—they were about survival.

Visiting Evelyn Sinclair at the care home was painful. Not visiting was worse.

Every trip forced them to relive the past in brutal detail, leaving them emotionally drained for days.

Moving forward hurt. Staying stuck hurt more.

They'd been existing in that limbo—not thriving, not quite drowning—until Victoria Kensington reappeared and stole Alexander from Isabella. Now the entire Kensington clan had relocated to Salzburg, twisting the knife deeper.

Noticing their tense expressions, Edward broke away from his friends. "Everything okay?" he asked, approaching cautiously.

Before Isabella could respond, William nodded toward the Kensingtons. "They're talking to Julian Montgomery."

Edward's jaw tightened immediately.

Meanwhile...

Julian Montgomery had just finished exchanging pleasantries with the Kensingtons.

When he turned back, Isabella and the others were gone.
###Chapter 273

The Sinclair family never stayed up late for the Ember Festival celebrations. By the time Isabella and the others returned home, Margaret had already gone to bed.

As Isabella climbed the stairs, the grandfather clock chimed midnight.

Her phone had been buzzing incessantly.

Nathaniel, Julian, and several colleagues from YodaVision had sent Ember Festival wishes, including Theodore and Walter.

She responded to each message, even Julian's, before sending her own greetings to Frederick and Emily.

Just then, Theodore texted again, asking if she was free in the coming days. He mentioned being swamped with work previously and wanting to properly thank her over dinner now that he had time.

After finishing her conversation with Theodore, Isabella placed her phone aside and headed for the shower.

Visiting Evelyn always brought pain to the Sinclair family.

Yet how could they not go on such an important day?

Every year on the first morning of Ember Festival, Isabella and Margaret would prepare an elaborate meal, pack it carefully, and deliver it to the nursing home.

This tradition remained unchanged.

So on the first Ember Festival morning, Isabella rose early.

Margaret, Charles, and Caroline were already downstairs when she descended.

Seeing her, both Margaret and Caroline handed her gift boxes.

Margaret gently cupped Isabella's face with warm hands. "May this year bring you nothing but happiness, my dear."

"Thank you, Grandma."

After breakfast, Isabella and Caroline began preparing ingredients in the kitchen.

Though both Margaret and Charles were excellent cooks, only Caroline could prepare Evelyn's meals. Evelyn could always detect who had cooked the food, which often triggered emotional distress.

For years, this responsibility had fallen solely to Caroline.

When Isabella learned to cook, they began sharing the task.

Truthfully, Isabella had wanted to learn cooking since childhood - for Evelyn's sake.

But Margaret wouldn't allow it.

Margaret believed Isabella was too young. Learning to cook for Evelyn would mean shouldering that burden prematurely.

Isabella's childhood had been difficult enough. Margaret wanted her to experience as much joy as possible without being constantly anchored to the past.

Two hours later, the dining table overflowed with dishes.

William and Edward helped pack everything.

Armed with Ember Festival gifts, the six of them set out for the nursing home.

They'd also prepared small presents for Evelyn's caretakers.

Evelyn remained as fragile as ever, her gaze vacant.

Isabella, Margaret and the others stood where Evelyn couldn't see them, watching as she showed no reaction to the gifts the nurses presented on their behalf.

A nurse placed Margaret's carefully prepared gift box in Evelyn's hands, but she barely noticed. After a brief glance, she let it fall to the floor as if it meant nothing.

Her appetite remained minimal. Despite the feast spread before her, she showed no interest. Only when the nurse spooned bites into her bowl did she eat.

After tasting just a few dishes, she withdrew into her own world again.

The nurse sighed and began clearing the table.

Isabella's eyes burned, but she held back tears, not wanting to upset the others.

Though in truth, they all felt the same.

After thirty minutes, they left.
###Chapter 274

The clock had already struck noon when they departed.

Returning home to cook didn't feel appropriate. None of them were truly in the right state of mind.

Truth be told, lunch was the last thing on their minds.

Yet sustenance was necessary.

Isabella broke the silence first. "Let's dine out."

Margaret gave a quiet nod. "Whatever you prefer, dear."

No sooner had Isabella and Alexander stepped out of their vehicle than they spotted the Kensingtons and their entourage.

Fate had led them to the same establishment.

As they approached, someone recognized Reginald and Eleanor, extending a warm invitation to join their table.

The Kensingtons noticed the Sinclairs immediately.

Diana let out a derisive snort, her gaze dripping with contempt.

Eleanor barely spared them a glance before turning away.

Victoria didn't even acknowledge their presence - she behaved as though they were invisible.

Just then, the maître d' hurried over, addressing Victoria with practiced deference. "Ms. Kensington, Mr. Whitmore's private dining room is prepared. Right this way."

Victoria gave a curt nod, ignoring Isabella's family completely. She turned to Cassian with practiced diplomacy. "My apologies, Mr. Vale. This is a family affair. Perhaps another time?"

Cassian, recognizing the dismissal, bowed slightly. "Of course. I wouldn't dream of intruding."

Without another word, Victoria followed the maître d' inside.

Isabella hadn't anticipated this encounter.

She linked arms with Margaret, hesitating. Margaret patted her hand reassuringly. "It's alright. Let's proceed."

"Very well," Isabella replied.

Upon entering, an impeccably dressed host approached with an apologetic smile. "Terribly sorry, but we're completely booked for lunch. No tables available at present."

Isabella knew this restaurant well.

A full house? Highly improbable.

This had the Kensingtons' fingerprints all over it.

Her jaw tightened.

The realization wasn't lost on Alexander and Margaret either.

"Ms. Sinclair?"

She turned to find Sebastian Ashford.

"Mr. Ashford," she acknowledged.

Sebastian's sharp eyes flicked to the nervous host, then back to Isabella. "Trouble?"

Isabelle kept her tone even. "Apparently they're fully booked."

Sebastian arched an eyebrow at the host. "Is that so?"

The host clearly recognized Sebastian.

More importantly, he knew Sebastian's uncle Walter was currently dining inside.

Seeing potential intervention, the host backpedaled instantly. "Apologies! A private dining room just became available. Please, right this way."

Isabella didn't move. Her gaze remained fixed on Margaret.

"Let's go elsewhere," Margaret decided firmly.

"Agreed."

Isabella turned to Sebastian. "Thank you regardless."

"Think nothing of it," he replied smoothly, nodding politely to Margaret and the others.

The Sinclairs departed.

Sebastian entered the restaurant, his piercing stare making the host squirm.

The host offered no explanation - his silence spoke volumes about who held real power in this establishment.
###Chapter 275

Isabella had just taken her first bite at the new bistro when her phone vibrated twice.

Emily's name flashed on the screen.

She swiped open the message to find two photos attached.

Alexander and Victoria.

Her lips pressed into a thin line. Without lingering on the images, she exited the chat.

The moment she did, Emily's call came through.

Isabella hesitated briefly before excusing herself and stepping outside. "Emily, hi."

"Bella, did you see the photos I sent?"

She had only glanced at one—no interest in the second.

Still, she replied, "Yes, I saw them."

Emily launched into a tirade. "My friend sent the first one last night. They were spotted at a hotel. On Ember Festival, of all nights! Can you believe it? Booking a room together—disgusting."

Isabella's expression didn’t flicker. Not a single frown. Just a quiet hum of acknowledgment.

"The second one’s worse," Emily continued. "She posted a bragging shot of the roses and gifts he gave her—right in the hotel room. Acting like it was some grand romantic gesture. Makes me sick."

Isabella gave a noncommittal response before shifting the subject. "Have you eaten yet?"

"Not yet. Went out for the countdown last night, drank too much, and just woke up. Forgot to reply to your message."

"It’s fine."

She added, "Happy Ember Festival."

"You too, Bella."

Emily hesitated, torn between venting further or letting it go. She chose the latter. "What are you up to now?"

"Lunch with Grandma and the others."

"Oh."

Emily winced. "Sorry, Bella. Probably ruined your appetite. Shouldn’t have brought it up."

"Don’t worry about it," Isabella said gently. "Go freshen up and eat. Your stomach will protest otherwise."

"Yeah, yeah, I know."

They chatted a little longer before hanging up.

Since lunch ended early, Isabella took a stroll with Margaret, wandering through the city streets, window-shopping.

This time, no unwelcome encounters. By the time they returned home, their moods had lifted. The Sinclairs had few relatives in Salzburg, so Ember Festival was always quiet for them.

By the second evening, Isabella finally had time to herself.

She opened her laptop and resumed reviewing the research materials Frederick had sent.

Just past ten, as she prepared to shower, her phone rang.

Alexander’s name lit up the screen.

She stared at it for a beat before ignoring it and heading straight to the bathroom.

After her shower, she returned to her research. As she finished her notes, the sound of a car pulling up outside made her pause.

She thought of Alexander’s earlier call.

Frowning, she set her mouse aside and moved to the window—just in time to see Sophia hopping out of the car, calling, "Grandma!"

Isabella pressed her lips together, turned away, and picked up her phone. That’s when she noticed the message Alexander had sent after she ignored his call.

Leaving overseas tomorrow. Please look after Sophia for the next few days.

She stared at the text, then pocketed her phone without reply.

Moments later, Sophia burst into her room, beaming. The second she saw Isabella, she launched herself into her arms.

"Hi, Mommy!"
###Chapter 276

Isabella instinctively reached out, catching Sophia before she could stumble.

The moment Sophia collided with her, that familiar floral scent filled Isabella's nostrils again.

She took the child's backpack and placed it on the sofa. Just as Sophia tried darting toward the bed, Isabella gently held her back. "Did you bathe?"

"I did!"

Yet Victoria's perfume still clung to her. Only one explanation existed - either Victoria had been living with Alexander, or they'd just dropped Sophia off together.

They simply couldn't be bothered to come inside.

"You're all sweaty," Isabella observed quietly. "Change into something clean."

Sophia remembered running around after her shower, probably working up a sweat.

She nodded obediently and disappeared into the bathroom.

Isabella returned to organizing her research materials.

Sophia emerged moments later, freshly changed. She dug through her backpack excitedly. "Mommy, look!" She produced a glowing bunny-shaped wand. "It lights up!"

Isabella glanced at it, then froze momentarily. "This..."

"Daddy bought it for me! Isn't it adorable?"

Isabella nodded silently.

Sophia dashed to the light switch, plunging the room into darkness before activating the wand. Her face glowed with excitement. "See how much prettier it is in the dark?"

"Yes, sweetheart."

"Do you love it too?"

"Of course!" Sophia dug out another identical wand. "Daddy got two! This one's for you! Will you take a nighttime walk with me?"

"I've already showered, darling. Maybe tomorrow. And you're in clean clothes now - we shouldn't get them dirty."

Sophia's enthusiasm dimmed visibly. "Oh..."

It had been over a month since she'd seen Isabella.

Noticing her mother's lack of interest, Sophia quietly put the wand away. She rushed over for a hug instead. "Mommy..."

Isabella set aside her book. "What is it?"

Sophia didn't answer. She kicked off her shoes and burrowed into Isabella's lap.

"I missed you so much, Mommy."

She wrapped her small arms around Isabella's neck, planting several wet kisses on her cheeks.

"You smell so nice," Sophia giggled.

Isabella tightened her embrace. "My precious girl," she murmured, gently stroking Sophia's face.

She noticed subtle changes - Sophia's features were beginning to resemble Alexander's more each day.

Noticing Sophia's bare feet, Isabella tucked them under the blanket. "How long are you staying this time?"

Sophia shrugged. "Daddy didn't say. Just told me to wait here for him."

Isabella nodded silently.

Suddenly Sophia remembered something. She scrambled off the bed to rummage through her backpack again. "Mommy! I brought you a present from my trip!"

She produced a delicate crystal sphere, offering it eagerly.

It had been ages since Sophia brought Isabella gifts - not since growing closer to Victoria.

Isabella accepted it with practiced grace. "Thank you, darling. I love it."
###Chapter 277

The morning sunlight streamed through the curtains as Isabella finished breakfast. Heading upstairs, she spotted Sophia engrossed in a video call with Alexander.

"Mom!" Sophia waved excitedly from the bed.

Isabella smiled softly before settling at her desk with her laptop.

Alexander's voice came through the phone. "Any plans for today, sweetheart?"

"Mom's taking me to see the new animated movie!" Sophia bounced on the mattress, her pigtails swinging.

Isabella focused on refining yesterday's project notes, fingers flying across the keyboard.

Suddenly Sophia appeared beside her, extending the phone. "Dad wants to talk to you."

Taking the device, Isabella saw Alexander's expectant face. She flipped the camera to face the ceiling. "Yes?"

"Thank you for looking after Sophia these past days." His voice held that familiar warmth.

Isabella kept typing, barely glancing at the screen. "Was there something else?"

"No. Enjoy the Ember Festival."

She ended the call with a noncommittal hum, returning the phone to her beaming daughter.

As they prepared to leave, Isabella's phone buzzed. Nathaniel's name flashed on the screen.

Her lips curved as she answered. Immediately, his voice dropped to an urgent whisper. "Damn it, they're here again!"

She froze. There was only one "they" he could mean.

Before she could respond, Nathaniel hissed, "They spotted me. Gotta go."

The line went dead just as Alexander and Victoria approached Nathaniel in the airport lounge.

"Mr. Graves," Alexander greeted coolly. "Traveling somewhere?"

Nathaniel's smile didn't reach his eyes. "We're not acquaintances, Whitmore. Let's pretend we didn't see each other."

Victoria's laugh tinkled like broken glass. "Always so dramatic."

Nathaniel adjusted his suitcase handle, drawing Victoria's attention. "Business trip?"

"Not your concern." He strode past them without another word.

Once clear, Nathaniel redialed Isabella. "What's your plan for today?"

"Movie with Sophia," she answered, applying lipstick.

"Alone?"

"Obviously with my daughter."

His pause spoke volumes. "Thought she was with the Whitmores for the festival."

"They dropped her off last night." Isabella's tone remained even as she checked her reflection.

Nathaniel scoffed. "So Alexander wants alone time with Victoria, and your kid's in the way? Classy."

Isabella didn't rise to the bait.

"Mommy! I'm ready!" Sophia tugged her hand, eyes sparkling.

"Coming, sweetheart." To Nathaniel she said, "Don't waste energy on them. Enjoy your trip."

He sighed. "Fine. I'll be back before you miss me."

Isabella chuckled. "Keep telling yourself that."
###Chapter 278

The afternoon sun cast golden streaks across the pavement as Isabella Sinclair and her daughter Sophia strolled past a neon-lit arcade. Sophia's eyes sparkled with excitement—it had been forever since she'd played games with her mother. Without warning, she tugged Isabella inside.

Arcades weren't new to Sophia, but doing this with Isabella made it magical. Every laugh, every high score felt like a treasure.

Later that evening, Isabella had dinner plans with Richard Fairchild.

As they exited the arcade, she considered dropping Sophia off first.

But Sophia clung to her hand, lips pursed in protest. "Can't I come with you?"

Isabella hesitated.

It was just a casual meal—nothing formal.

Bringing Sophia shouldn’t be an issue.

She dialed Richard. "Mind if I bring my daughter along?"

Richard chuckled. "Of course not. The more, the merrier." A pause. "Yours?"

"Yes."

Surprise flickered in his voice.

Last time they met, she’d mentioned being married—but he hadn’t pictured someone so youthful already a mother.

Half an hour later, Isabella arrived at the private dining room, Sophia’s small hand in hers.

Richard stood as they entered. His gaze softened at the sight of the little girl. "Isabella, this must be your daughter. She has your smile."

Isabella nodded.

"What’s her name?"

"Sophia Whitmore."

"Whitmore?"

Richard froze.

Something about Sophia struck him as familiar, but he couldn’t place it.

Then it hit him—New Year’s Eve. The Flemings. The little girl holding Alexander Whitmore’s hand had been Sophia.

His eyes widened. "Your husband is Alexander?"

Isabella confirmed with a quiet nod.

Richard was speechless.

When she’d first mentioned marriage, he’d wondered why someone like her had settled so young.

Few could match her brilliance.

But if it was Alexander…

Well, in terms of status, intellect, and influence, he was perhaps the only equal in their world.

Richard smiled faintly—but then remembered the distant look in Isabella’s eyes when she spoke of her marriage.

And New Year’s Eve—she hadn’t been with the Whitmores.

This wasn’t just tension. The rift between her and Alexander ran deeper than he’d realized.

He gestured for them to sit and slid two gift boxes across the table.

Isabella instinctively declined, but Richard insisted. "Just a small tradition. Take it."

Reluctantly, she accepted. "Thank you, Mr. Fairchild."

She nudged Sophia. "Say thank you."

Sophia beamed. "Thank you, Mr. Fairchild!"

"You’re welcome."

Richard studied her features. "She favors Alexander more, doesn’t she?"

"She does."

He grinned. "With parents like you two, she’ll turn out extraordinary either way."

Isabella’s smile didn’t reach her eyes.

Richard leaned in. "Has my stubborn son made peace with you yet?"

She shook her head. "If anything, it’s worse."

Richard laughed outright. "Good."

"He’s had it too easy. A little humility will do him good. Frankly, I’m looking forward to it."

Their conversation drifted to lighter topics.

Dinner stretched into an hour of lingering chatter before they finally parted ways.

The next few days, Isabella buried herself in research materials Frederick Aldridge had sent.

Sophia, ever patient, entertained herself—occasionally joining Thomas and William for outings but mostly staying close.

She still video-called Alexander daily.

And more often than not, Victoria Kensington was beside him.

Isabella didn’t eavesdrop, but Sophia knew her feelings. Whenever Victoria appeared, she’d take the tablet outside.

After three days of relentless focus, Isabella finally had a breakthrough.

Her thoughts crystallized—the solution was clear.

She worked from dawn till dusk, barely registering when Caroline called her for lunch.

Seeing her untouched meal, Sophia frowned. "Mom, eat first."

Isabella mumbled a reply, eyes glued to the screen.

Sophia tried again. No response.

Only after multiple attempts did Isabella finally pause to eat.

Night fell, and the pattern repeated.

Isabella was so absorbed she skipped dinner entirely. Sophia, needing help with her bath, gave up and sought William instead.

By the time Sophia returned, freshly bathed, Isabella was still typing furiously.

She climbed into bed alone and drifted off.

Morning light filtered through the curtains when Sophia stirred. Rubbing her eyes, she found Isabella still at her desk.

"Mom… did you sleep at all?"

"Don’t worry about me," Isabella murmured absently.

Sophia bit her lip.

She’d slept and woken—yet her mother hadn’t moved.

"Aren’t you tired?"

A distracted hum was her only answer.

Not wanting to disturb her further, Sophia tiptoed away to wash up.
###Chapter 279

Isabella Sinclair collapsed onto her bed after working nonstop for thirty-six hours straight.

She had meticulously documented every crucial detail and emailed the files to Nathaniel Graves. Exhausted, she dragged herself downstairs for breakfast.

Nathaniel's hands shook as he reviewed the materials. "This is brilliant, Bella! Absolutely perfect!"

Rubbing her throbbing temples, Isabella replied, "I need sleep. We'll talk later."

"Of course."

She slept until mid-afternoon.

When she awoke, Sophia Whitmore was quietly assembling a puzzle in her room.

"Mom! You're awake!" Sophia jumped up immediately.

Isabella nodded groggily.

"Are you thirsty? Should I get you water?"

After a brief hesitation, Isabella said, "Yes, please."

Sophia fetched the water before returning to her puzzle.

Watching her daughter concentrate, guilt twisted in Isabella's chest. She'd neglected Sophia these past days while buried in work.

But today was the final day of vacation.

Tomorrow she'd return to Innovatech, leaving even less time for her daughter.

"Sophia?"

The girl turned. "Yes, Mom?"

"When is your father coming back?"

"He said not for a while." Sophia tilted her head. "Do you need him?"

Isabella shook her head. "Never mind. Keep playing."

After finishing her water, Isabella texted Alexander Whitmore:

"Return date? I start work tomorrow. Can't watch Sophia. Come get her."

Thirty minutes later, Alexander replied:

"Two more days."

She left the conversation there.

After dinner, Sophia went for a walk with Margaret Sinclair.

Upstairs, Isabella received Nathaniel's call.

They discussed project ideas on speakerphone when Sophia returned.

Hearing the unfamiliar male voice, Sophia interrupted, "Who are you talking to, Mom?"

"Just a colleague."

"Oh..."

Nathaniel recognized Sophia's voice but said nothing. He didn't mention knowing her as a baby or having held her.

Their call lasted until 10 PM.

The next morning, Isabella returned to Innovatech.

The company had been understaffed since launching her two projects last year. Hiring was postponed due to their workload.

Now expansion couldn't wait. On her first day back, Isabella restructured teams.

Alexander had promised to return in two days.

Four days passed with no sign of him.

On the fifth day, Sophia called Isabella at work. "Mom! Dad's back! Someone's coming to get me."

"Don't forget anything," Isabella reminded.

"Can you come see me off?"

Isabella's desk overflowed with work.

She nearly refused.

Then she remembered how little time they'd spent together.

And how soon Sophia might forget her.

"Alright, I'm coming."

Sophia cheered.

Nathaniel had returned from vacation.

Seeing Isabella exhausted, he encouraged her to leave early.

But he scoffed, "Alexander drops everything for his honeymoon with that woman, delaying his return without guilt. Yet you feel guilty as the non-custodial parent? He's exploiting your soft heart—dumping the kid on you while he plays."
###Chapter 280

The car Alexander had arranged arrived moments after Sophia finished calling Isabella.

She never got to see her mother before departure.

When Sophia entered the private lounge, she rushed straight into Alexander's embrace. "Daddy! Victoria!"

Alexander smiled warmly, tousling her hair. Victoria helped set Sophia's backpack aside.

Julian and Oliver were already waiting there with Genevieve.

Watching Sophia's obvious affection for Alexander and Victoria, Oliver chuckled. "Told you, Alex. Should've brought our girl along. Look how she missed you. Another week apart and we'd have seen tears."

His comment carried an unspoken judgment about Sophia's time with Isabella.

Before anyone could respond, Julian smoothly redirected. "Did you enjoy your stay, Sophia?"

Sophia settled into her seat. "We did! Mom took me to the cinema and VR arcade. We dined out too."

Oliver raised an eyebrow. "That's it?"

"Yeah." Sophia shrugged. "Mom was too busy for much else."

Oliver assumed she meant holiday family obligations.

He and Julian had been swamped themselves - endless relatives visiting since New Year's. Just as things calmed down, work demands exploded. Today marked their first free evening in weeks.

Victoria was engrossed in a book.

Sophia sipped her drink, idly glancing at the cover. Something about it looked familiar. She peered closer.

Julian noticed. "Interested?"

Sophia shook her head. "No, just... Mom has the same one."

Victoria's fingers stilled on the page. A faint smile touched her lips.

The book existed in beginner and advanced editions with identical covers.

Victoria held the advanced version - material beyond most doctoral programs, let alone undergraduate studies.

Having visited the Whitmores frequently, Genevieve knew about both editions.

At Sophia's remark, she nearly laughed aloud.

+25 BORBUN

She bit it back only because Alexander and Julian were present.

Julian understood instantly.

He lowered his gaze, smiling silently.

Then Oliver turned to Julian with a teasing grin. "Heard your mother's been setting up blind dates. Any luck?"

All attention shifted immediately.

Genevieve had heard the rumors too. She watched Julian anxiously.

But Julian ignored her completely. He shot Oliver a look. "Must you gossip daily?"

Oliver grinned unrepentantly. "Just curious."

Julian's silence spoke volumes.

Clearly, he had zero interest in arranged meetings.

Oliver pressed on. "What about that woman Lily keeps mentioning? If you're serious, why not tell your mother? Or..." He trailed off suggestively. "Is she... unsuitable?"

Julian didn't glance at Alexander. "With all this food, you're still talking?"

His evasion only fueled Oliver's curiosity. "I get it - worried about parental approval. But it's been months now. At least introduce her to us first. Bring her here."

Without waiting for response, Oliver turned to Alexander. "Don't you agree?"

Alexander chuckled. "When he's ready, Julian will introduce her himself. No need to push."

Oliver sighed dramatically.

Everyone knew that.

He just wanted details.

Genevieve tugged Victoria's sleeve. "Victoria..."

Oliver had mentioned Julian's interest in someone else before. She'd refused to believe it.

Now, it seemed undeniable.

Victoria smiled serenely, offering no comment.

They'd never met this mysterious woman Lily referenced.

But was Julian truly invested? Or was she merely a smokescreen? Perhaps this entire charade concealed deeper truths.
###Chapter 281

The dinner was in full swing when Oliver suddenly remembered something. He turned to Victoria with a knowing smile. "Speaking of opportunities, YodaVision is actively expanding their team. Have you considered reapplying?"

Though she'd been traveling abroad recently, Victoria had kept tabs on YodaVision's developments. The cutting-edge technology they offered was undeniably tempting—working there would undoubtedly elevate her career.

Yet hesitation lingered.

Oliver, perceptive as always, guessed her concern. "Ran into an old contact yesterday," he remarked casually. "Apparently, Nathaniel isn't just recruiting technical experts. He's also scouting for experienced management personnel."

The implication was clear.

With YodaVision restructuring, key positions were up for grabs—positions that should have naturally gone to Isabella. But Nathaniel hadn't reserved a single one for her.

That spoke volumes.

Either he was keeping his distance, or their relationship had soured. Either way, Isabella's influence within the company was waning.

Victoria had witnessed Nathaniel's unwavering support for Isabella firsthand—especially during last year's gala, where he'd publicly defended her. For things to shift so drastically now was... unexpected.

But not entirely surprising.

Victoria had always known Isabella couldn't control Nathaniel forever. This moment was inevitable.

A faint smirk curled her lips. "Noted. I'll submit my application soon."

Oliver chuckled, shooting Alexander an amused glance. The man had been unusually quiet. "Alexander spearheaded that InnovaTech project for you. Leaving now might complicate things."

Alexander simply placed a bite of food on Sophia's plate. "Doesn't matter."

Victoria wasn't surprised. He'd always supported her unconditionally, never making her choose. The realization warmed her.

Julian, who'd been occupied since New Year's, listened silently. His expression darkened slightly at the mention of Isabella.

Isabella and Nathaniel were both Frederick's protégés. She'd led YodaVision's research team, pioneering their flagship projects.

Her importance was undeniable—titles meant little to someone like her.

But if she wasn't vying for a position, it meant she had other plans.

At the end of last year, Isabella had expressed her intent to refocus on research. She and Nathaniel had agreed to hand managerial duties to someone else.

Post-New Year, Nathaniel began reaching out to potential candidates. The recruitment process would take time, but he already had a shortlist.

As for her latest research? Isabella had compiled everything and sent it to Frederick three days prior. All that remained was his feedback.

As if on cue, her phone buzzed.

A single message from Frederick:

Come by my office tonight.
###Chapter 282

The office lights dimmed as Isabella and Nathaniel left work, making a quick stop at Frederick's villa.

Frederick was deep in conversation on the phone, his brow furrowed. Spotting them, he ended the call and gestured for them to sit. "Your research has caught some attention. There are people who want to meet you. I'll arrange an introduction soon."

Isabella nodded. "Understood."

Her project had just been officially recognized as a national initiative. Frederick then briefed her on the expectations moving forward.

Later, Isabella and Nathaniel sought Frederick's advice on another matter. By the time they left, the clock had struck midnight.

The next morning, they returned to YodaVision Co. Isabella sifted through the pre-screened resumes for the technical department.

Halfway through, she froze. Nathaniel, sitting beside her, noticed her sudden tension. "What's wrong?"

She held up a sheet. "It's Victoria Kensington's resume."

Nathaniel smirked. "She actually applied? The woman never quits."

Isabella said nothing, setting the resume aside without another glance.

Nathaniel had an out-of-town trip that afternoon. "You'll handle the forum in two days?"

"Of course," Isabella replied.

The forum, hosted by the local government, was an exclusive event with only thirty companies invited.

Isabella arrived as YodaVision's representative. Stepping out of her car, she nearly collided with a familiar face. She averted her gaze and climbed the steps without a word.

Dominic Fairchild watched her retreat. As he moved to follow, a voice called out, "Mr. Fairchild."

He turned to see Alexander Whitmore approaching. "Mr. Whitmore."

They shook hands. "Long time no see."

"Indeed," Dominic replied.

They ascended the stairs together, chatting until they reached the conference room. Each seat bore a company nameplate.

Inside, Isabella was already seated. Dominic halted when he saw her. Alexander's place was beside hers, yet he showed no reaction.

The rectangular table placed Dominic directly across from them.

Alexander nodded at Dominic before taking his seat. Isabella remained engrossed in her phone, ignoring him entirely.

He leaned slightly toward her. "You've lost weight. Busy schedule?"

She didn’t acknowledge him, flipping through her documents instead.

Just then, someone approached Alexander, pulling him into conversation.

Soon, the room filled. Government officials, led by Walter Ashford, entered. Walter paused at the sight of Isabella and Alexander.

Like Theodore Sinclair, he hadn’t known Isabella’s husband until Theodore mentioned it after their dinner. Now, observing them, they seemed anything but married—more like strangers. Walter looked away.

The forum began. Neither Isabella nor Alexander spoke unless it was their turn to address the room.
###Chapter 283

The government staff had arranged lunch for Isabella and the other company representatives. As the forum concluded, she gathered her belongings and stood to leave. Alexander observed her departure and followed discreetly.

The Fairchild and Ashford families shared a longstanding connection. This meant Dominic and Walter were well acquainted. Outside the conference room, Dominic approached Walter with a greeting.

Isabella deliberately ignored Dominic standing beside Walter. She moved past him to address Walter directly. "Mr. Ashford."

He responded with a warm smile. "No need for formalities. Just be yourself."

Isabella nodded. "Of course, Mr. Ashford."

Dominic frowned at their exchange. To his knowledge, Isabella and Walter had only met for the first time during Harry's art exhibition last year.

Back then, Walter's politeness toward Isabella could be attributed to his respect for Nathaniel. But their current interaction suggested a much closer relationship.

Not only did Walter recognize Isabella immediately, but his warmth toward her seemed almost familial. As if she were the daughter of an old friend he'd watched grow up.

What surprised Dominic more was Isabella's composed demeanor when addressing the older gentleman.

Alexander approached them then. "Mr. Ashford."

Walter's smile dimmed slightly upon seeing Alexander. The Ashfords and Whitmores weren't particularly close, though they'd maintained professional interactions in recent years.

Walter had always considered Alexander exceptionally talented - a rare combination of brilliance and humility. However, he'd never paid attention to the younger man's personal life.

He distinctly remembered learning about Alexander having a girlfriend during Harry's exhibition. Strangely, no one seemed aware of his marriage to Isabella at that time.

Their complete lack of recognition toward each other at the event had been striking. Walter now suspected they might have already been divorced by then.

The group moved toward the dining area. Dominic's frown deepened as he observed them. Before the forum began, he'd noticed Alexander initiating conversation with Isabella.

Though he couldn't hear their exchange, he knew Isabella had been targeting Victoria relentlessly.

Yet Alexander treated Isabella with notable warmth, their proximity suggesting intimacy. He'd even deliberately taken the seat beside her.

Isabella ate quietly while listening to Walter's discussion with other officials. Though seated beside her, Alexander engaged primarily with others at the table.

Only as lunch neared its end did Alexander turn to Isabella. "Sophia returns to school soon. Would you like to accompany her on the first day?"

She kept her gaze lowered. "I'm occupied. I won't have time."

Alexander chuckled. "Understood."

He then resumed conversation with others.

Dominic had been monitoring their interaction. Seeing Alexander speak openly to Isabella in public made him reconsider his suspicions. Perhaps it was merely professional courtesy between collaborators from InnovaTech and YodaVision.

As lunch concluded, Dominic averted his gaze. Spotting Walter, a sudden thought struck him. He quickly texted Sebastian.

"Did your uncle know Isabella before your grandfather's exhibition?"

Sebastian's unusual profession meant he rarely responded promptly. But coincidentally, he was off-duty today. Seeing Dominic's message, he replied immediately.

"Uncle Walter doesn't know Isabella. Why do you ask?"
###Chapter 284

Dominic recounted to Sebastian what he had witnessed earlier.

Sebastian texted back: Isabella and her grandmother made quite an impression on my father and grandfather. Maybe that's why.

From Dominic's perspective, Walter had shown unusual interest in Isabella, treating her with distinct attention. No matter how favorable the impression, they had only met once. It seemed implausible.

Still, Dominic dismissed it after hearing Sebastian's explanation.

The forecast warned of afternoon rain turning to snow. Before Isabella finished lunch, heavy rain had already begun pelting the windows.

After the meal, Walter and other officials gathered with Isabella and corporate representatives for deeper discussions—reviewing last year's production and this year's expansion plans.

Later, Walter publicly thanked the companies for boosting the city's economy, concluding the business forum.

As the event ended, Alexander and Isabella prepared to leave after exchanging handshakes with the officials.

When Isabella shook Walter's hand, he said, "It's freezing today. The roads are already icing over. Drive carefully."

"I will. Thank you, Mr. Ashford," she replied.

She, Alexander, and the other executives walked together toward the parking lot.

Alexander stayed close, murmuring, "Those heels aren't safe on this terrain. Watch your step."

His words carried clearly, drawing glances from nearby businessmen. Isabella had no choice but to respond politely, "I appreciate the concern, Mr. Whitmore. I'll be careful."

The moment reminded her of last year's tech expo, where she had slipped at a dinner. Back then, he'd been so wary of rumors that he hadn't even offered a hand.

Now, his behavior was entirely different. He spoke openly, his tone almost intimate, and initiated conversation despite being mid-discussion with others.

Every executive nearby heard him—including Dominic.

Some remembered the expo incident, where they'd assumed Isabella had staged her fall to seduce Alexander.

YodaVision's sudden rise had thrust Isabella into the spotlight, and rumors about her and Nathaniel had spread.

But now, Alexander's demeanor contradicted past assumptions.

Was he simply being professional, given their companies' collaboration? Yet the casual use of her first name suggested otherwise.

Dominic hadn't attended the expo and knew nothing of the alleged seduction attempt.

All he saw was Alexander approaching Isabella earlier. He'd doubted his own eyes—until now.

The way Alexander spoke left no room for misinterpretation.

Dominic's expression darkened as he watched them.

Isabella had brought an umbrella, anticipating rain, but the wind sliced through the air like blades.

She'd expected slush, not black ice. The steps outside were treacherously slick, forcing her to tread carefully.

The others kept their distance, but Alexander lingered beside her, drawing knowing smirks from associates.

Dominic halted, about to speak—when Isabella's foot slipped.

She pitched forward, but Alexander's arm shot out, catching her waist just in time.

Before she could react, he pulled her flush against him.
###Chapter 285

Isabella's expression flickered. She pressed a hand against Alexander's chest to create distance. "Let me—"

"Hold this," he cut her off abruptly.

Before she could protest, he swept her off her feet and carried her down the steps. The businessmen nearby exchanged shocked glances as Alexander turned with her still in his arms. "We'll reconvene another time."

The executives who knew him well looked stunned. Everyone in their circle knew about Isabella's connection to Nathaniel Graves.

If Nathaniel had authorized her to represent YodaVision at this government forum, it signaled their relationship remained intact...

Alexander had his own partner. Even if he harbored feelings for Isabella, this public display with another man's girlfriend showed blatant disrespect toward Nathaniel.

And Nathaniel Graves wasn't someone to cross lightly.

The businessmen forced polite smiles. "Of course. Another time."

With so many witnesses, Isabella had no choice but to say through gritted teeth, "Thank you, Mr. Whitmore. You can put me down now—"

Alexander carried her straight to his waiting car. His driver's eyes widened upon recognizing Isabella in his arms. "Mrs. Whitmore?"

The door opened before Isabella could protest. "My car is right there," she said coldly.

Alexander took her umbrella and deposited her in the backseat. "With that ankle? You can't possibly drive."

"I'll call for a ride," she countered.

Dominic Fairchild appeared suddenly. "Mr. Whitmore."

Alexander shut the car door and accepted the umbrella from his driver. "Still here, Mr. Fairchild?"

Though Dominic knew Isabella was inside, the tinted windows hid her completely. "Is Ms. Sinclair in there?"

"She twisted her ankle," Alexander said smoothly. "I'm taking her to get it checked."

"I'm free," Dominic insisted. "And I have matters to discuss with Ms. Sinclair. I'd be happy to escort her."

Alexander's lips curved. "What a coincidence. We also have unfinished business. Perhaps next time."

Dominic's expression darkened.

"You're soaked through," Alexander observed. "Shouldn't you get out of this rain?"

Knowing he had no standing to interfere, Dominic cast one last look at the car before walking away.

Inside the soundproofed vehicle, Isabella missed their exchange but recognized Dominic's expression. She knew about his feelings for Victoria. The reason for his appearance required no explanation.

Ignoring them, she called for her own driver while examining her ankle. Finding it bearable, she opened the door abruptly.

Alexander turned at the sound. Isabella stepped out, snatched her umbrella back, and walked past him without a word.

"Can you walk?" he asked, eyeing her injury.

It ached, but she refused to acknowledge it—or why he'd carried her in the first place. "Call me when the divorce is finalized," she said flatly, making her position clear.

Without waiting for a response, she walked away.

Alexander watched her go, making no move to stop her. Only when her car pulled away did he leave. Dominic departed soon after.

Reporters had covered the forum extensively. Isabella went for a medical check before returning home at eight. She'd just finished dinner when the news broke.

Meanwhile, Victoria and Eleanor pored over the same reports, frowning at Isabella's high-profile representation of YodaVision.

"I thought they were having problems?" Victoria muttered.

Eleanor accepted a bowl of soup from their maid. "Patience. These things take time."

She understood the ebb and flow of relationships. Even if they'd reconciled temporarily, the cracks remained. Their reunion wouldn't last.

Victoria nodded. She still had opportunities at YodaVision—and with Nathaniel.

The photo of Isabella sitting beside Alexander at the forum didn't faze her. She trusted herself. She trusted him.

Julian descended the stairs. "You're back."

"How was school?" Victoria asked.

Her brother, now a senior at Baumond thanks to Alexander's connections, shrugged. "Fine."
###Chapter 286

The sound of a car door opening made Alexander turn his head.

Isabella stepped out and shut the door behind her. Without a word, she approached and took the umbrella from his hand.

His gaze dropped to her ankle. "Are you hurt?"

It ached slightly, but she could still walk. She didn’t bother explaining why he had swept her into his arms earlier.

"Call me when the divorce is finalized," she said flatly.

Her meaning was clear—no contact unless necessary.

She adjusted the umbrella and walked past him without another glance.

Alexander watched her go but didn’t stop her. Only when she was safely in her car did he finally leave. Moments later, his car pulled out of the lot, followed by Dominic’s.

Reporters had covered both the conference and the dinner. Isabella made a quick stop at the hospital before heading home around eight. She had just finished dinner when news about the forum broke.

Meanwhile, Victoria and Eleanor were reading the same reports. Their brows furrowed when they saw Isabella representing YodaVision at a high-profile government event.

"I thought she and Nathaniel were having issues," Victoria muttered. "Why would he send her?"

Eleanor handed her a bowl of soup, her expression calm. "Patience. Let’s see how this plays out."

Isabella was undeniably beautiful. It wasn’t surprising if Nathaniel was reluctant to let her go completely. Relationships like theirs often had ups and downs.

But cracks, once formed, rarely disappeared. Their reconciliation wouldn’t last.

That meant Victoria still had a chance to get into YodaVision—and closer to Nathaniel.

Victoria wasn’t bothered by the photos of Isabella sitting near Alexander at the forum. She trusted herself—and him.

Just then, Julian came downstairs. "You’re back."

"Yeah," Victoria replied. "How was school?"

Julian, now a senior, had transferred to Baumond this semester. Alexander’s team had handled the paperwork seamlessly.

The curriculum here was different, but Julian was a quick learner. "Everything’s fine. You know I don’t slack."

True. Both Victoria and Julian had always been top students. Their parents never had to worry about their grades.

Victoria and Eleanor exchanged amused glances.

The next morning, Julian Montgomery and Dominic Fairchild arrived at YodaVision at the same time.

"Mr. Montgomery," Dominic greeted. "Fancy seeing you here."

Julian nodded. "Mr. Fairchild."

Dominic was about to say more when Isabella and Nathaniel emerged, spotting them.

She had left Alexander’s car quickly yesterday. Dominic wondered what she’d said to him afterward.

But one thing was clear—Alexander had been the one initiating contact both times. At last year’s banquet and again yesterday. Isabella, meanwhile, had remained distant.

It puzzled him.

Isabella was stunning, sure. But Alexander wasn’t the type to be swayed by looks alone. In every other aspect, she paled in comparison to Victoria.

So why her?

Isabella caught the disdain in Dominic’s eyes. "Something on your mind, Mr. Fairchild?"

"You’re imagining things, Ms. Sinclair," he replied coolly. "We have nothing to discuss."

Nathaniel and Julian had seen the forum coverage. It wasn’t hard to guess there’d been tension between Isabella and Dominic.

Nathaniel smiled faintly. "Problem?"

Isabella cut in before Dominic could respond. "Nothing worth mentioning."

She turned to Julian. "Mr. Montgomery, this way."

Julian nodded, shooting Dominic a brief glance before following her to the conference room.

Nathaniel didn’t press further. If Isabella didn’t want to talk about it, he wouldn’t pry.

"Shall we, Mr. Fairchild?" he said coolly.

This was Julian’s first time seeing Isabella since New Year’s Eve. His gaze lingered on her longer than necessary, though no one noticed—they were too focused on the tension between her and Dominic.

Once inside the conference room, he finally looked away. "I meant to attend yesterday’s forum," he said, taking a seat. "But I was out of town. Had to send someone else."

Small talk before business was normal. Isabella didn’t think much of it. "I see."

Julian realized she hadn’t picked up on his interest. He lowered his gaze and switched topics.

"Let’s discuss the project."
###Chapter 287

Julian had a business dinner scheduled that evening. He planned to leave immediately after finishing his work discussion with Isabella.

She noticed his lingering gaze and tilted her head questioningly.

Valentine's Day was tomorrow, yet he hadn't mentioned it. With a faint smile, he shook his head. "Nothing important."

Isabella was completely absorbed in her work now. The holiday had slipped her mind entirely.

It wasn't until her assistant reminded her the next morning that realization struck.

As she turned toward her office, a voice called from the entrance.

"Excuse me, which of you is Ms. Sinclair? There's a floral delivery here."

Isabella spun around to see a courier holding an enormous bouquet of red roses. The spectacle immediately drew curious glances from her colleagues.

Though rumors swirled about her and Nathaniel, most company employees knew she was married.

However, Isabella rarely discussed her personal life, leaving many speculating about her marriage's true state.

"Someone sent you roses on Valentine's Day?" a coworker cooed enviously. "That must be from your husband. What a romantic gesture."

"Lucky you," another sighed dramatically.

Isabella knew Alexander would never send flowers. She checked the accompanying card - only her phone number confirmed the delivery was meant for her.

After signing, she carried the lavish bouquet to her office, examining the elegant card. The sender remained anonymous, with only "Happy Valentine's Day" handwritten inside.

Nathaniel entered moments later, eyebrows lifting at the floral display. "Secret admirer?"

"No idea," Isabella admitted, "but the handwriting seems familiar."

He chuckled. "Seems someone's harboring feelings for you. Any guesses?"

"None whatsoever."

Nathaniel rubbed his chin thoughtfully. They'd spent considerable time together recently, yet he'd noticed no particular attention toward her.

With a wry smile, he ventured, "Not Alexander, surely?"

"Definitely not," Isabella replied flatly.

After years of marriage without a single Valentine's celebration, why would he start now as they neared divorce? Besides, she'd recognize his handwriting anywhere.

"Whoever it was," Nathaniel observed, "they chose premium roses and took time for a handwritten note. Quite thoughtful."

Perhaps, but Isabella had no interest in pursuing the mystery. Without contact details, she wouldn't waste energy investigating.

"We should focus on work."

Her schedule included a crucial meeting at InnovaTech that afternoon - an appointment made days prior.

After organizing the necessary documents, she departed with her team right on schedule.
###Chapter 288

Isabella's phone buzzed as she approached InnovaTech's headquarters. Eleanor Whitmore's name flashed on the screen. "Hello, Grandmother," she answered.

"Darling," Eleanor's voice carried warmth through the receiver. "Sophia mentioned you've been working late nights again. I worry about your health."

A sigh escaped Isabella's lips. "It's just a busy period."

"I've sent over some vitamins from Switzerland. Make sure you take them daily."

Isabella knew refusal was pointless. Eleanor always found ways to care for her. "Thank you. I appreciate it."

Eleanor's chuckle was light. "Oh, I spoke with Alexander about being more considerate. He promised to try harder."

"You didn't need to do that."

"Nonsense. You're both Sophia's parents. Tension between you affects her." The unspoken command in Eleanor's tone was clear - play nice.

Ah. That explained Alexander's sudden concern at the conference. Isabella's grip tightened on her phone. "Understood."

After exchanging pleasantries, she ended the call. The elevator doors opened to an empty reception area - no sign of Victoria Kensington today.

Maxwell Sterling spotted her first. "Happy Valentine's Day, Ms. Sinclair! Did your secret admirer send flowers?"

Before she could respond, Rosalind Pembroke chimed in. "Oh, the roses were enormous! We're all green with envy over here."

Maxwell's laughter died when Genevieve Kensington materialized beside them. "Flowers? How... quaint." Her smirk was razor-sharp. "Is that all you received?"

Rosalind faltered. "Well, I--"

"Pathetic." Genevieve's nails tapped against her designer handbag. "Victoria's office is overflowing with bouquets. But the real gift? Alexander transferred controlling shares of InnovaTech to her name. Now that's worth celebrating."

Maxwell's mouth snapped shut. His gaze darted to Isabella, who maintained perfect composure despite the bombshell.

He leaned closer, voice dropping. "Rumor has it every eligible bachelor in the city sends Victoria gifts anonymously. But Alexander Whitmore outplayed them all." Awe colored his whisper. "No one's ever gifted company shares before. The entire finance department's buzzing."

Isabella's lips curved without warmth. None of this surprised her. Victoria already had unrestricted access to confidential files. Julian and Eleanor Kensington waltzed through security checkpoints unchallenged. At this rate, they might as well rename the building Kensington Tower.

Still, she had to admire Alexander's theatricality. Choosing Valentine's Day for the transfer wasn't coincidence - it was a calculated romantic gesture. Every detail meticulously planned to showcase his devotion.

"Discussing me?" Victoria's voice sliced through the tension as she emerged from the boardroom.

Maxwell recovered first. "Ms. Kensington! How was the shareholders' meeting?"

"Productive." Victoria's smile didn't reach her eyes. The quarterly executive briefing had run longer than expected.
###Chapter 289

Isabella Sinclair now officially held shares in InnovaTech. She had arrived early for a meeting with Alexander Whitmore.

"Hello, Isabella." Genevieve approached with a sly smile, casting a sideways glance at Olivia before whispering, "She was gloating about receiving flowers, but I shut her down by mentioning how many bouquets you've gotten—and that Alexander transferred company shares to you. She had nothing to say after that."

Isabella glanced at Olivia but remained silent.

Genevieve smirked. "You told me Nathaniel doted on her, but all he did was send flowers on Valentine’s Day."

Isabella arched a brow.

Was that truly all Nathaniel had done? If so, it was a pitiful effort. Olivia held significant influence at YodaVision, but without an official position or shares, it was meaningless.

Now that Isabella could compare herself to Olivia, she realized things weren’t as she’d imagined. If Nathaniel truly valued Olivia, he would’ve given her more than just hollow authority.

Victor Pembroke approached with a knowing smile. "Now that you hold shares, will you take charge of InnovaTech?"

She flicked a glance at Olivia. "No. I’ll leave it to the professionals. Power-hoarding isn’t my style."

Olivia was incompetent yet meddled in everything just to flaunt her so-called authority at YodaVision. The irony was laughable—she had no real position or stake in the company.

Meanwhile, Olivia remained focused on her work, undisturbed by the earlier exchange. Her phone buzzed—a message from Frederick Aldridge.

"Pick me up tomorrow night."

Last week, he’d mentioned someone wanting to meet her. This was likely the reason.

She typed back, "Understood, Mr. Aldridge," then tucked her phone away and resumed working.

The next evening, Olivia and Nathaniel arrived at the restaurant with Frederick. As they stepped out of the car, they spotted Richard Fairchild and Walter Ashford.

Olivia had expected strangers, not familiar faces.

"Mr. Fairchild, Mr. Ashford," she greeted politely.

They nodded warmly, exchanging pleasantries before turning toward the entrance—until a voice called out behind them.

"Leaving so soon? No one’s waiting for me?"

Olivia turned, stunned. The man approaching was a high-ranking official from the Department of Defense.

Frederick’s expression tightened. "This is Frederick Langley."

Though known for his intimidating presence in interviews, Frederick Langley now wore a warm smile. He extended a hand. "You must be Olivia. I’ve heard much about you."

She shook his hand. "It’s an honor."

Just as she spoke, another figure emerged from a nearby car—a face frequently seen on national broadcasts.

Frederick’s voice turned icy. "That’s Walter Ashford."

Olivia greeted him, but before she could say more, a familiar voice cut in.

"Father?"

Dominic Fairchild stepped out of his car, eyes widening at the gathering of powerful figures—and Olivia standing among them.
###Chapter 290

Dominic wasn't surprised to see Isabella at an event like this when he spotted Nathaniel and Frederick among the guests.

Richard hadn't expected to run into his own son either. "Business meeting?" he asked.

Dominic nodded.

Frederick Langley chuckled. "Richard, this is your son?"

Richard grinned. "Indeed."

"He's impressive. Sharp mind, strong presence. You've raised him well."

Dominic recognized Frederick and Walter Ashford immediately. Though his father was close to them, he'd never actually met them in person.

When Frederick extended a hand, Dominic shook it politely. "You're too kind."

Then, Victoria and Reginald stepped out of their car, and Dominic froze.

Victoria and Reginald were equally stunned when they saw Dominic, Frederick, Walter, and the others. Aside from Dominic, these were men rarely seen in public. Yet here they were, gathered in one place.

Of course, they also noticed Isabella and Nathaniel.

Nathaniel was Frederick’s protégé, the brilliant mind behind YodaVision’s success. It made sense Frederick would introduce him to influential connections.

Victoria and Reginald assumed Isabella was only here because of Nathaniel.

Not that it mattered. Meeting Walter and Frederick in person was an honor most people could only dream of.

They’d heard about Frederick’s vast network, but seeing it firsthand was something else entirely.

Victoria also recognized Walter Ashford and Richard Fairchild—Sebastian’s and Dominic’s fathers. When Dominic glanced their way, she offered a polite smile.

Richard noticed his son’s attention. "You know them?"

Dominic nodded.

Victoria and Reginald approached. Frederick barely suppressed an eye roll. Isabella remained expressionless.

Dominic cleared his throat. "This is Reginald Kensington and his daughter, Victoria."

His tone shifted noticeably when he said her name.

Richard raised a brow. Victoria carried herself with effortless elegance, clearly standing out in any crowd. His son had good taste.

Since Dominic had introduced them, Richard extended a hand. "Pleasure."

Walter had seen Victoria before—she was Alexander’s girlfriend. As she walked over, he glanced at Isabella.

Isabella’s expression didn’t change, but the air around her turned icy.

Walter knew she and Alexander were married, but he wasn’t privy to their issues.

The way Isabella’s gaze frosted over at the sight of Victoria told him everything.

After greeting Richard, Victoria turned to Frederick. "Mr. Aldridge."

Frederick gave a curt nod and said nothing.

Alexander had warned her Frederick was distant with everyone. This wasn’t personal.
###Chapter 291

Frederick's cold demeanor didn't faze Victoria in the slightest.

After acknowledging him with a polite nod, she turned her attention to Walter and his companions. "Good evening, gentlemen," she offered smoothly.

She deliberately addressed them as a group rather than individually - the more appropriate approach given the circumstances.

Walter and his associates were too preoccupied observing Isabella to pay Victoria much mind. Like Sebastian, they'd immediately noticed Isabella's visible discomfort around Reginald and Victoria.

Frederick Langley had done his homework on Isabella Sinclair. He'd recognized the Kensingtons the moment they appeared.

When Victoria greeted them, Frederick merely gave a curt nod before addressing Frederick and Isabella. "Shall we move this inside?" he suggested, already turning toward the restaurant entrance.

Frederick Aldridge agreed silently, leading the group inside.

Richard Fairchild turned to Dominic with a quiet warning. "Keep your wits about you tonight."

"Of course," Dominic replied.

Richard said nothing more, nodding briefly at Victoria and Reginald before following the others.

Dominic didn't join them - Richard's lack of invitation made it clear this was a private discussion. Which made Isabella's presence all the more puzzling.

That thought darkened Dominic's expression momentarily. Shaking it off, he turned to Victoria and Reginald. "Mr. and Mrs. Kensington - business dinner as well?"

Victoria confirmed with a nod. "Indeed. You too, Mr. Fairchild?"

"Likewise."

Reginald seized the opportunity. "I understand your company's launching a new initiative. The Kensington Group would be very interested in discussing potential collaboration when you have availability."

The Fairchild Enterprises project was still in its early stages, nothing concrete yet. But thanks to Alexander Whitmore's assistance and Reginald's recent efforts, the Kensington Group had stabilized. A strategic partnership wasn't out of the question.

Dominic considered this. "Let's arrange a meeting next week to explore possibilities."

Throughout their exchange, Dominic's gaze kept returning to Victoria. At the recent tech summit, he'd witnessed Alexander's conspicuous attention toward Isabella. The urge to warn Victoria had been strong, but he'd resisted - they weren't close enough for such interference.

Besides, Victoria and Alexander's relationship appeared solid. The InnovaTech shares transfer to Victoria spoke volumes.

What Dominic couldn't determine was whether this was planned compensation or damage control. His lingering, thoughtful glances at Victoria suggested unspoken concerns, but when he remained silent, Victoria pretended not to notice.

Her curiosity about Frederick Aldridge's gathering burned, but Isabella's presence suggested it wasn't particularly confidential.

"Our associates have arrived," Victoria announced smoothly. "We should be going up."

"My party's here as well," Dominic offered. "Shall we go together?"

"Certainly," Victoria agreed.
###Chapter 292

The private room was filled with an air of quiet sophistication. Frederick Langley smiled warmly. "We've encountered many prodigies over the years, but someone like you, Isabella - achieving so much at such a young age - remains extraordinary. That's why Walter and I wanted this meeting. I hope we're not imposing."

Despite his high position, Frederick's tone was so gracious that Isabella responded with equal respect. "Not at all. The honor is entirely mine."

Walter Ashford chuckled, nudging Frederick. "Easy now, don't intimidate our young genius."

Both men genuinely believed Isabella possessed rare talent with boundless potential. Their admiration for her capabilities had prompted this meeting.

The conversation flowed smoothly, with Walter Ashford and Theodore Sinclair contributing to the pleasant atmosphere.

Dinner extended into a two-hour discussion before they finally exchanged contact information and parted ways.

Monday marked the new semester at Salzburg's elite preparatory academy.

With William beginning boarding school this term, and Caroline handling family matters while Charles was occupied, Isabella took her cousin to campus on Sunday afternoon.

Upon arrival, she spotted the Kensington and Pembroke families. Three maids stood behind them, laden with oversized luxury luggage - an ostentatious display.

So Julian had transferred here too?

Admission to this institution required significant influence. Clearly, Alexander Whitmore had pulled strings for his brother-in-law.

The entire Kensington clan's presence underscored their spoiling of Julian. The boy himself radiated privileged contentment - carefree, cheerful, basking in familial adoration.

Watching Beatrice Kensington gaze at Julian with such devotion, Isabella recalled the woman once clutching her hand, swearing Isabella was her only granddaughter. The memory tasted like ashes now.

The Kensington contingent noticed her simultaneously. Their smiles evaporated instantly.

A passerby gaped at one maid's suitcase. "That's a 300k designer piece! I thought those were just for show. The ultra-rich really live differently."

The Kensingtons turned sharply. The bystander flushed and hurried away.

Not that Isabella needed the commentary. Every item in Julian's ensemble - from leather trunks to designer backpacks - carried five-figure price tags. His luggage alone represented a small fortune.

Eleanor Kensington's crossbody purse? A limited edition worth seven figures.

When others murmured admiration, Beatrice and Genevieve Kensington glanced pointedly at Isabella. William's modest luggage - a single mid-range suitcase and duffel - drew Beatrice's dismissive glance and Genevieve's derisive snort.

To the Kensingtons, Sinclair Corporation's recent recovery meant little. Would Charles' company even survive long-term?

As for Isabella? Rumors suggested Nathaniel Graves' interest was waning. Clearly, the Sinclairs no longer moved in their circles.
###Chapter 293

They still had Alexander.

Given how much Alexander valued Victoria, if they married, the Kensington and Sinclair families would rise to new heights. The Rodriguez family wouldn't even compare.

Penelope smirked, shooting Isabella a disdainful glance before leaving with the others to help Julian move into the boys' dorm.

After settling William's luggage, Isabella left campus and returned home.

The moment she stepped inside, there was a knock. Abigail and Charlotte stood at the door, freshly returned from their hometown. They'd brought local specialties.

Isabella accepted the gifts. "Thank you."

"You're welcome!" Charlotte beamed.

She pulled a small trinket from her pocket. "I saved this for Sophia. I'll give it to her tomorrow at school!"

Charlotte adored Sophia. Ever since New Year's when Sophia called her first, their bond had deepened. She chattered excitedly about the first day of school.

Listening, Isabella realized Sophia hadn't called her lately. Tomorrow marked the new term. No call meant Sophia didn't want her there.

Of course—Sophia had plenty of escorts.

Alexander would be there. Probably Victoria too.

Isabella smiled through the conversation before carrying the gifts inside.

Still short-staffed, she resumed hiring tech personnel the next day.

At lunch, Abigail sent photos of Sophia's school activities. One frame included Alexander and Victoria.

So Sophia hadn't asked her because Victoria was going.

Isabella studied the image of Alexander and Victoria, about to exit when it disappeared. Abigail must've sent it accidentally and deleted it.

She hadn't shared divorce details with Abigail. Typically, custodial parents restricted access. Abigail assumed Isabella rarely saw Sophia and missed her terribly. Hence the photos.

Explaining was exhausting.

Recognizing the kindness, Isabella simply replied, "Thank you."

On Wednesday, Isabella and Nathaniel handled business near Whitmore Manor. As they got in their car, another vehicle emerged from the private road—Alexander's regular car.

It pulled over.

Alexander and Victoria stepped out.

Isabella froze.

They'd come from Whitmore Manor.

Alexander had taken Victoria to meet Eleanor.
###Chapter 294

Nathaniel followed her gaze and spotted Alexander and Victoria.

The Graves family had minimal connections with the Whitmores, so Nathaniel had never visited Whitmore Manor before. He didn't even realize it was in this neighborhood. His lips twisted at the sight of them. What are they doing here?

Isabella pulled her eyes away. "That's the private road leading to Whitmore Manor."

Nathaniel froze for a heartbeat before understanding dawned. "So Alexander's taking Victoria to meet his family already?"

Before she could respond, Nathaniel let out a derisive snort. "Your divorce isn't even finalized yet, and he's already parading her around? What's his damn hurry?"

It did appear rushed. But Isabella knew better. Alexander had attempted this introduction long ago. Eleanor Whitmore had blocked it then, with Richard Whitmore's failing health and family opposition forcing Alexander to back down.

Now with their divorce proceedings underway, Alexander wasn't wasting another moment.

Nathaniel studied her. "Speaking of which, when exactly are those papers getting signed? It's been weeks."

"I don't know," Isabella admitted. "Last time I asked, Alexander said soon."

That conversation felt like ages ago now, with no updates since.

Nathaniel's mouth twisted. "Typical. The man's desperate to marry his mistress yet can't be bothered to finalize things properly." He shook his head. "Next time you see him, light a fire under his ass. Just looking at him irritates me."

Isabella offered a faint smile. "I will."

Back at her office, her phone buzzed. She paused at the caller ID before answering. "Mr. Montgomery."

Charles Montgomery was an old family friend who'd watched her grow up alongside her grandfather. After relocating abroad for health reasons years ago, this was his first return.

His warm chuckle filled the line. "I'm back in town, Isabella. Join me for lunch this weekend?"

"Of course!" she agreed instantly.

"Excellent," Charles continued. "Oh, and bring Alexander along."

Her smile faltered. Before she could respond, he excused himself for arriving guests.

Staring at her phone, Isabella hesitated before texting Alexander: Mr. Montgomery wants to see us this weekend.

Message sent, she returned to work.

The next morning at her desk, her phone vibrated - Alexander's reply: Understood.

She'd messaged him yesterday afternoon. This was his first response.

As she set the phone down, another message arrived: Saturday or Sunday? Morning or afternoon? Specific time?

Before she could react, a third followed: Can you confirm details with Mr. Montgomery?

Isabella didn't reply. But she did call Charles for specifics, then forwarded the confirmed schedule to Alexander.
###Chapter 295

Alexander responded immediately. "Understood."

Saturday morning arrived with crisp autumn air as Isabella drove to the Montgomery estate. Most of the Montgomery family resided abroad, leaving only Charles and a handful of servants present when she arrived.

Hearing of her arrival, Charles personally came to greet her. "Isabella, you're here?"

"Yes," she smiled. Though he appeared healthier than expected, she couldn't help noticing, "You've lost weight."

Charles chuckled. "A little, but my spirits are high—no need to worry."

They moved inside where Charles served tea. His failure to ask about Alexander's absence confirmed what Isabella suspected—he already knew about their impending divorce.

Not only did Charles avoid mentioning Alexander, but he also didn't bring up Sophia—another clear sign he knew about the custody arrangements.

Their conversation flowed easily over tea until interrupted twenty minutes later by a maid announcing another guest's arrival.

Charles showed no intention of greeting them, instead offering Isabella pastries. She accepted politely, sampling a delicate macaron.

Then came the butler's voice from the side entrance. "Mr. Whitmore, this way please."

Charles glanced toward the sound, his expression immediately darkening.

The clicking of designer heels confirmed Isabella's suspicion. She turned slightly to see Alexander entering with Victoria Kensington on his arm.

Both noticed her immediately. Alexander gave her the briefest nod before addressing Charles. "Mr. Montgomery."

Charles responded with a cold grunt. Undeterred, Alexander continued, "Mr. Montgomery, may I introduce Victoria Kensington."

Victoria acted as if Isabella were invisible, offering Charles a practiced smile. "A pleasure, Mr. Montgomery."

Though Charles clearly knew about the divorce and Alexander's relationship with Victoria, he hadn't expected such a brazen public appearance so soon.

"Did I invite you?" Charles asked icily. "Then don't address me so familiarly."

"Mr. Montgomery," Alexander pressed, clearly displeased by the reception.

Charles remained stone-faced.

Unfazed, Alexander guided Victoria to the opposite sofa, making himself at home. Just days after taking Victoria to meet his family, he was now parading her before Charles?

With divorce papers nearly signed, was he so eager to introduce his mistress to everyone important in his life?

Isabella kept her eyes lowered, sipping her tea in silence.

When Charles made no move to serve them, Alexander reached for the teapot himself.

Charles slapped his hand away sharply. "Don't touch what I've prepared!"

Alexander smirked. "Shall I brew my own then?"
###Chapter 296

Alexander was furious.

He completely ignored Victoria's presence, turning his attention solely to Isabella. "Let's go, Isabella. I'm taking you to dinner."

Isabella placed her teacup down and rose gracefully. "Alright."

Without another glance at Victoria, Alexander escorted Isabella out.

Victoria remained seated on the sofa, sipping her tea with practiced calm. She didn't attempt to follow them or protest their departure.

Margaret watched them leave, her expression troubled. "This—"

Victoria interrupted smoothly. "It's fine. Time will handle it."

In other words, given enough time, Alexander would eventually accept reality—and by extension, her?

Alexander had witnessed the state of Isabella and Victoria's marriage in its early years. He'd seen firsthand how little regard Victoria had for Isabella. Now, Victoria had someone else she cherished.

Though Victoria had always maintained good relations with elders like Eleanor and Charles, she wasn't one to be swayed by their opinions. Even if they disapproved of her relationship with Victoria, there was little they could do to change her mind.

As angry as Charles was, he could only seethe silently.

Sighing, Charles patted Isabella's hand gently. "These past few years... I'm sorry."

Isabella understood his unspoken sympathy. She offered a soft smile. "I've moved on. I have a new life now, and I'm doing well. You don't need to worry about me, Mr. Montgomery."

Charles nodded, relieved. "Good. That's good."

After lunch, when Isabella brought Charles back to his estate, Victoria and her companion were already gone.

Perhaps they hadn't even bothered to check on Sophia after leaving—because as Isabella was departing, her phone rang with Sophia's name flashing on the screen. She glanced at it but didn't answer.

That evening, when Isabella returned to the Sinclair residence for dinner, she spotted an elegant invitation envelope on the coffee table.

Opening it, she found it was for Eleanor Whitmore's 75th birthday celebration.

Technically, Eleanor's actual birthday was still some time away. But years ago, a fortune teller had warned her against holding any major celebrations for the next decade, lest she invite a life-threatening calamity.

Eleanor had taken the warning seriously. For the past ten years, she'd only marked her birthday with quiet family gatherings—never a proper banquet.

Now that the decade had passed, Richard, Victoria, and the others had decided to throw her a grand party this year.

That was likely why, despite the event still being weeks away, invitations were already being sent out.

Margaret emerged from her room and noticed the invitation in Isabella's hand. "It just arrived today."

Isabella nodded. "I see."

Margaret hesitated. "This is her first proper birthday celebration in ten years. Under normal circumstances, we'd attend without question, but..."

But given the current tension between Isabella and Victoria, it felt inappropriate.

And truthfully, neither of them wanted to go.

Isabella understood Margaret's unspoken thoughts perfectly—she felt the same.

Besides, Victoria had already brought her companion to the estate. Who was to say she wouldn't bring her to the party as well, especially if Eleanor pressured her?

Isabella set the invitation aside for now.

After dinner with the Sinclair family, she returned to her own apartment.

Monday morning found her back at work at YodaVision as usual.

When work consumed her, time flew. Before she knew it, Thursday had arrived again.
###Chapter 297

The afternoon meeting was in full swing when Isabella's phone buzzed with an incoming call from Sophia.

Her finger moved automatically to decline the call before she even processed the name.

The moment the screen went dark, it lit up again with the same caller ID. Isabella's brow furrowed, but she still didn't answer.

This time, Sophia didn't call back.

Isabella refocused on her presentation.

Five minutes later, her phone rang again - Alexander's name flashing across the screen.

She pressed her lips into a thin line and powered off the device completely.

Only after the meeting concluded an hour later did she turn her phone back on.

The first thing she saw was a text from Alexander: Sophia fell down the stairs at school. We're at St. Mary's Hospital.

Her blood ran cold.

Grabbing her purse, she sprinted from the conference room toward the parking garage.

En route, she called Alexander for the room number. He picked up on the first ring and directed her to the pediatric wing.

When the elevator doors opened on the VIP floor, she practically ran to the designated room.

Inside, she found Alexander seated beside the hospital bed where Sophia lay.

Her daughter's face was ghostly pale, a white bandage wrapped around her forehead. Sophia's eyes lit up weakly when she saw her. "Mommy-"

Isabella rushed to the bedside. "What happened? What did the doctors say?"

Alexander answered calmly, "Mild concussion. Nothing too serious."

She exhaled sharply in relief.

"Have you eaten?" Alexander asked suddenly.

She hadn't. The marathon meeting had run through dinner time. Isabella shook her head.

Without another word, Alexander pulled out his phone and placed a food delivery order.

Sophia, who hadn't seen her mother in weeks, immediately curled into Isabella's arms without speaking.

Isabella stroked her daughter's hair gently. "Try to sleep if you're tired, sweetheart."

"Okay," Sophia murmured.

She clung to Isabella's hand as her eyes fluttered closed, but her forehead remained creased with discomfort. It took nearly thirty minutes before her breathing finally evened out in sleep.

Just then, the food Alexander ordered arrived. "You should eat," he said, offering the takeout bag.

Isabella recoiled slightly. "I'll order my own."

Their eyes locked for a tense moment before Alexander set the food aside. Isabella pulled out her phone to place a separate order.

As Sophia slept, the room fell into heavy silence.

Alexander stepped out to take a business call that lasted nearly twenty minutes. When he returned, he took the chair opposite Isabella.

She could feel him wanting to talk, but deliberately focused on her phone screen instead.

The message was clear. Alexander acknowledged it with a faint, knowing smile before retreating into his own silence.

Night deepened around them as they maintained their separate vigils.

When Alexander finally broke the quiet, his voice was firm. "I'll stay tonight. You should go home and rest."

Isabella's gaze remained fixed on Sophia's sleeping form. She didn't move.

Alexander studied her for a long moment before adding, "Be angry with me all you want. But from now on, answer Sophia's calls - even if you won't answer mine."

The unspoken warning hung between them: Their daughter needed her mother, regardless of whatever stood between them.

Isabella froze - so he knew she'd been deliberately ignoring their daughter's calls?
###Chapter 298

Isabella was just opening her mouth to speak when Alexander's phone buzzed again.

Probably Victoria. He moved toward the door, answering with surprising gentleness. "It's nothing serious, don't worry—"

Eleven.

By the time Alexander finished the call and returned, Sophia had woken. Blinking sleepily at them both, she murmured, "Daddy? Mommy?"

Isabella and Alexander responded simultaneously. "Yes."

Still disoriented, Sophia's gaze drifted between them before her face scrunched in discomfort. Within moments, she'd slipped back into sleep.

The room fell into respectful silence. Only when Sophia's breathing steadied did Alexander turn to Isabella. "Staying?"

She didn't answer. But her unmoving posture spoke volumes.

Alexander simply nodded and settled onto the opposite couch.

Isabella remained in the bedside chair until exhaustion claimed her.

Morning light startled her awake. She found herself curled on Sophia's hospital bed.

Confusion flickered across her face. She distinctly remembered—her gaze snapped to the couch.

Alexander slept upright, head propped on one hand. As if sensing her stare, his eyes flew open, locking onto hers.

Isabella looked away immediately. Neither mentioned how she'd gotten to the bed.

"Breakfast at home or here?" Alexander stretched his legs.

Silence.

When Sophia stirred awake, Richard and Margaret entered with breakfast trays.

"Mrs. Whitmore," they chorused.

The title made Isabella's jaw tighten, but she held her tongue.

Richard set down the food. "Mr. Whitmore thought you might be hungry."

Isabella shook her head. To Sophia, she said, "Mommy's going home to shower. I'll be back soon."

"Promise?" Sophia's voice was small.

"Promise."

Grabbing her purse, Isabella spared Sophia one last glance before leaving.

Home. Shower. Breakfast. Then back to the hospital.

En route, she called Nathaniel. "Sophia's sick. I'll be in this afternoon."

No further explanation needed. Nathaniel simply said, "Understood."

Returning to the hospital room, she found Julian and Oliver there.

Oliver smirked but stayed silent. Julian looked torn—but with Alexander present, he deferred.

Alexander broke the tension. "You're back."

"Mommy!" Sophia beamed.

Isabella smiled. "Yes, sweetheart."

The men soon excused themselves. Isabella expected Alexander to leave too.

He didn't. He stayed, working from his laptop while monitoring Sophia.

Isabella said nothing.

That afternoon, as Sophia napped, Isabella dozed off in her chair.

She awoke to Richard's presence.

"Mrs. Whitmore," Alexander said without looking up from typing, "the soup."

Richard brightened. "Mr. Whitmore had this prepared specially for you."

Isabella blinked sleep away. Her frown deepened when she processed Alexander's use of "Mrs. Whitmore."

Then Sophia stirred, cutting off her thoughts.

By morning, Sophia had improved dramatically. After the doctor's clearance, Alexander arranged her discharge.

"Mommy," Sophia clung to Isabella's hand, "can't you stay home with me?"

"Next time," Isabella said gently.

Her duty as a mother was fulfilled. As for returning to Alexander's home? Never.

Sophia pouted but nodded.

Alexander stepped forward. "Say goodbye to Mommy, Sophia."

"Bye, Mommy."

"Bye, darling."

Isabella turned on her heel, her car peeling away from the hospital without a backward glance.
###Chapter 299

The Salzburg International Science Symposium, co-hosted by the prestigious Aldridge Foundation and several leading institutions, had commenced two days prior.

This month-long event featured nearly 200 specialized sessions, attracting top minds from academia and industry. InnovaTech had received a coveted invitation.

That afternoon's keynote focused on Nanomaterials - a field of particular interest to both Isabella and Nathaniel.

After leaving the medical center, Isabella accompanied Nathaniel and a team of InnovaTech researchers to the convention hall.

As InnovaTech's official representative, Nathaniel was seated in the VIP section near the stage.

Isabella and the research team were directed to general seating toward the rear. They arrived early. Moments after settling in, Isabella noticed Alexander, Victoria, and Oliver entering. Their eyes met. Neither Victoria nor Oliver seemed surprised to see her - though their reactions differed markedly.

Oliver assumed she was merely attending as Nathaniel's plus-one.

Victoria barely glanced her way before dismissing her presence entirely.

Alexander's gaze lingered briefly before he took his reserved seat in the front row.

Nathaniel, spotting Alexander, smirked and deliberately turned away.

Ever the politician, Alexander greeted him with practiced charm. "Mr. Graves."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. Hadn't he made his boundaries clear? They weren't acquaintances, let alone friends. Why did some people insist on forced pleasantries?

The symposium began precisely at 2:00 PM.

Professor Charles Montgomery from the Royal Academy of Sciences took the podium, delivering an insightful overview of cutting-edge nanomaterials, seamlessly blending theory with practical applications.

Frederick Aldridge's protégé commanded significant respect in this field.

Both Isabella and Nathaniel had hands-on experience with most materials mentioned.

They could instantly recall molecular structures, manufacturing processes, and practical applications just hearing the compound names.

Their expertise surpassed most attendees, but the scientific frontier constantly expanded. Fresh perspectives often sparked innovation - hence their attentive presence.

Victoria listened intently, taking copious notes. The nanomaterials field had exploded in complexity.

Half the terminology sounded like alien concepts to her. She resolved to research these unfamiliar terms later.

Alexander appeared contemplative, though his focus seemed genuine.

When Professor Montgomery concluded, dozens of researchers rushed forward with questions.

The professor fielded each inquiry with patience.

Nathaniel crossed the auditorium to exchange observations with Isabella.

Among 200+ attendees, their technical discussion drew curious onlookers. Soon a crowd gathered.

"Mr. Graves studied under Frederick Aldridge," someone whispered. "No wonder he's so knowledgeable!"

The growing crowd overwhelmed Nathaniel. Since this was an academic forum, he answered non-proprietary questions generously.

Eventually delegating, he suggested, "Ms. Sinclair's expertise rivals mine. She can address your inquiries."

Isabella soon fielded equally complex questions. Within twenty minutes, their impromptu session drew nearly fifty attendees.

Meanwhile, Alexander escorted Victoria to meet Professor Montgomery.

Victoria seized the opportunity to ask several technical questions.

"Ms. Kensington demonstrates remarkable breadth for her age," Montgomery remarked to Alexander. "You've chosen well."

Simon Fairchild joined them. "Victoria graduated top of her class at Cambridge. Excellence comes naturally to her."

Victoria had attended multiple sessions over two days. Yesterday, Theodore Sinclair had introduced her to several influential figures, including Simon.

Simon smiled knowingly at the pair. "So you're Mr. Whitmore's fiancée? You modestly omitted that detail yesterday. Rare humility in someone so accomplished."

Victoria demurred, "You flatter me."

Their group attracted considerable attention, engaging in lively debate.

Suddenly, nearby exclamations cut through:

"Mr. Graves truly lives up to his mentor's legacy! His technical depth is astounding!"

"And Ms. Sinclair! I couldn't follow half her explanations - she's on another level entirely!"

Victoria's smile stiffened imperceptibly.

Intrigued, Professor Montgomery excused himself. "I should greet Mr. Graves."

Simon expressed similar interest. After a calculated pause, Victoria turned to Alexander. "Shall we join them?"

Alexander nodded. "Of course."

Oliver, disinterested but obligated, trailed behind.
###Chapter 300

A small crowd had formed around Isabella Sinclair and Nathaniel Graves.

When Alexander Whitmore and Simon Fairchild approached, several attendees recognized them immediately. Alexander raised a finger to his lips with a charming smile, signaling them to remain silent.

The two men positioned themselves at the periphery, listening intently as Isabella and Nathaniel fielded questions.

The conference hall buzzed with intellectual energy. Many attendees held degrees from Ivy League institutions - brilliant minds all.

Isabella and Nathaniel didn't just answer questions. They engaged in spirited debates with those who could match their technical expertise.

The depth of these exchanges left some listeners struggling to follow. Those without specialized knowledge in materials science and manufacturing felt completely lost.

Alexander and Simon clearly belonged to the first group.

Victoria Kensington could mostly keep up as well.

Isabella and Nathaniel had quickly recognized the knowledge gap early on. They'd instinctively simplified their explanations without condescension.

Simon listened with keen interest.

Just as the discussion reached its peak, someone spotted the newcomers. "Professor Fairchild! And Mr. Whitmore!"

The room's attention shifted. Isabella and Nathaniel followed the collective gaze to where Alexander, Simon - along with Oliver Westbrook and Victoria - stood watching.

Their eyes slid past Victoria without acknowledgment.

With Arthur Langford present, Nathaniel had no choice but to pause the discussion. "Professor Langford. Professor Fairchild."

Arthur clapped his hands together. "Just what I'd expect from Frederick Aldridge's protégé. Remarkable."

Nathaniel smiled modestly, but Arthur continued, "Though I must say, the young lady beside you is equally impressive." His eyes twinkled. "Aren't you going to introduce us?"

Nathaniel hesitated. "Isabella Sinclair. A key member of our R&D team at YodaVision."

"Ah, a YodaVision technician," Arthur mused. "So your company boasts not one, but two exceptional talents. No wonder you're leading the industry."

"You flatter us," Nathaniel replied.

Simon stepped forward to join the conversation.

Victoria watched in quiet surprise as Isabella held her own against these intellectual giants.

Clearly, she'd underestimated the other woman.

Nathaniel was Frederick Aldridge's student - a recognized genius in his field. If Isabella had been working closely with him all this time...

Victoria recalled hearing years ago about Isabella skipping three grades before entering Aurelia University. At the time, she'd assumed Isabella was brilliant.

But subsequent rumors suggested Isabella's university performance had been mediocre at best. No major awards. No international competitions.

Meanwhile, Victoria - though not a prodigy - had steadily climbed the academic ladder, collecting prestigious awards until she'd earned her PhD without a single misstep.

Watching Arthur shower Isabella with praise, Victoria maintained her perfect smile.

She glanced sideways at Alexander.

His expression revealed nothing. He might as well have been watching paint dry for all the reaction he showed to Isabella's accomplishments.

That silent observation made Victoria's smile deepen slightly.

Oliver, however, looked completely lost. "Is she actually that good?" he whispered.

Before Alexander could respond, Victoria arched an eyebrow. "What do you think?"

Oliver blinked. How should he know? If he understood any of this, he wouldn't be asking.

But judging by Alexander and Victoria's reactions, perhaps Isabella wasn't quite the genius she appeared.

Seeing Arthur showed no signs of wrapping up his conversation, Victoria touched Alexander's arm. "Don't you have that meeting? We should go."

Alexander nodded. "Right."

He stepped forward to address Arthur. "Professor Langford, we have prior commitments. We'll take our leave."

Arthur waved them off without looking up from his discussion. "Of course."

He did offer Victoria a polite nod.

Alexander's gaze lingered on Isabella for a heartbeat before he turned away, Victoria and Oliver falling into step behind him.
###Chapter 301

The conference dragged on for several more days. Isabella managed to attend a couple more sessions despite her busy schedule.

She crossed paths with Victoria twice during this time. Both times, Alexander was conspicuously absent.

March brought relentless rain showers that seemed never-ending.

After one particularly long seminar, another downpour began just as she was leaving.

Isabella had an umbrella in her car, but hadn't thought to bring it inside. She moved toward the main exit, hoping to wait out the worst of the storm.

Before she could reach the doors, Victoria appeared.

Victoria was deep in conversation with someone, but her smile vanished the moment she spotted Isabella.

Then Alexander materialized beside her, umbrella in hand. He'd clearly come to collect Victoria.

Without hesitation, he removed his coat and draped it over Victoria's shoulders.

The small crowd waiting out the rain watched with obvious envy. Several women sighed audibly at the romantic gesture. Only then did Alexander notice Isabella standing nearby. Their eyes met briefly before he looked away.

He raised the umbrella again and escorted Victoria out into the storm.

The wind howled around them, but with Alexander's coat as extra protection, Victoria remained perfectly dry despite the driving rain. It was the kind of thoughtful attention that spoke volumes about their relationship.

Soon they disappeared into the gray curtain of rain.

Not long after, Alexander's driver approached with another umbrella. "Mrs. Whitmore," he said, offering it to her. "Mr. Whitmore asked me to bring this to you."

Isabella shook her head. "That won't be necessary. You can take it back."

Eleanor had mentioned that Alexander was making an effort to be civil for Sophia's sake.

First the concern at the seminar. Now sending an umbrella when he was with Victoria.

If Victoria could so easily allow Alexander to send her an umbrella, she must be supremely confident in their relationship. This was nothing more than polite courtesy for their daughter's benefit.

The driver hesitated. "But—"

"He won't mind," Isabella said firmly. "You may go."

After another moment's pause, the driver retreated with the umbrella.

The rain showed no signs of letting up. Isabella checked her watch, debating whether to wait or make a run for it.

Then a familiar voice spoke beside her. "Let me give you a ride."

Julian stood there, car keys in hand.

Dusk was falling fast. If she didn't leave soon, she might be stuck here for hours.

"Thank you," Isabella said, accepting his offer.

Julian started to remove his coat, but Isabella stopped him. "Don't bother. I keep spare clothes in my car."

He didn't insist, but positioned himself to shield her from the wind as they walked. "Were you here for the conference?" she asked as they descended the steps.

He hadn't been. Oliver had mentioned her attendance, and with work keeping them apart lately, Julian had found himself missing their conversations. So he'd come.

Noticing her reddened ears from the cold, he smiled slightly. "Have time for dinner?"

He'd done her a favor, and they did have business to discuss. It seemed harmless enough.

"Sure," Isabella agreed.
###Chapter 302

The moment they stepped into the private dining room at The Grandeur, Julian poured Isabella a glass of sparkling water. "Did the conference give you any breakthroughs?"

"A few."

She'd attended hoping to find fresh perspectives on the research materials Nathaniel Graves and Frederick Aldridge had shared months ago. After several sessions, new possibilities had begun to take shape.

As she sipped her water, Isabella glanced up. "How's Lily these days?"

"Much better since last autumn." Julian's expression softened. "She started school again this term, made new friends. Happy at home, happy in class." He hesitated, then added, "Still asks about you often. Maybe we could all have lunch together soon?"

Isabella nodded. "I'd like that."

Their conversation shifted from personal matters to work—collaborations, upcoming projects. By dessert, they were discussing Julian's recent partnership with Charles Sinclair. The ease between them was new; in the past, their interactions had been strained, with Isabella's attention reserved solely for Lily.

Now, without the little girl as a buffer, they spoke freely. Julian recognized the shift—not friendship, not yet, but something warmer than the icy tolerance she'd shown him before.

They parted ways after the meal.

Since moving into her own apartment, Isabella had neglected shopping. With seasons changing, her wardrobe needed updating. On Saturday, she spent an hour trying on outfits at an upscale boutique, selecting pieces for herself and the Sinclair family before collapsing onto a plush sofa to wait for her purchases.

"Isabella?"

The voice came from the store entrance. She turned to see Josephine Winslow standing there, eyes wide with recognition.

Josephine—daughter of Beatrice Kensington, just months younger than Isabella. They'd been inseparable as children, but after Evelyn Sinclair's divorce from Reginald Kensington, their contact dwindled. The last time they'd met was years ago, before Alexander Whitmore had entered Victoria Kensington's life.

Josephine had once quietly handed Isabella her entire savings—nearly a hundred thousand dollars—when rumors swirled about Reginald's failing business.

Isabella smiled. "It's been a while."

"Too long." Josephine's gaze flickered with emotion. Then concern tightened her features. "Are you... okay?"

She knew. Of course she knew—about Isabella's years of unrequited love for Alexander, about how he'd fallen instantly for Victoria.

Josephine understood Victoria's allure all too well. She'd watched countless men become entranced, including her own high school sweetheart, who'd only dated her to get closer to Victoria.

The cruel truth? Victoria was extraordinary. Magnetic.

To lose the man you loved to someone that brilliant, to stand helpless as their bond deepened—especially with the tangled history between Eleanor Kensington and Evelyn Sinclair—Josephine couldn't imagine the pain.
###Chapter 303

Isabella Sinclair could practically read Sophia Whitmore's thoughts.

She opened her mouth to say she was fine when Beatrice Kensington stormed in.

The older woman took one look at Sophia and snapped, "There you are! Do you know how long I've been searching? You're not answering your phone—"

Her tirade cut off abruptly when she spotted Isabella's back. Beatrice's expression instantly frosted over.

A sales associate approached Isabella just then. "Ms. Sinclair, all your selections have been packaged. Here's your receipt totaling 5,897,640 dors."

Isabella nodded and accepted the slip. They stood in The Grandeur's private shopping suite where her purchases were meticulously arranged—over thirty designer bags lined up like soldiers.

After verifying the amount, Isabella handed over her black card without hesitation.

Both Beatrice and Sophia gaped. Nearly six million on clothing? In one afternoon?

Beatrice recovered first, her lips curling. Clearly this was just an act—a desperate attempt to appear wealthy when everyone knew the Sinclair family was struggling. Without Alexander Whitmore's support, even Victoria Kensington couldn't spend that recklessly.

But Sophia worried her lip. Rumors said the Sinclair enterprises were floundering. How could Isabella drop six million so casually?

Beatrice scoffed but held her tongue. Turning to Sophia, she said, "Uncle Reginald's finished cooking. Are you planning to keep everyone waiting? Move it."

Sophia threw Isabella an apologetic glance before scurrying after Beatrice.

She'd heard the Kensington mansion—a 600 million dor estate—was Alexander's gift to Eleanor Kensington. That didn't include the priceless furnishings.

Beatrice had bragged the living room vase alone cost tens of millions, another of Alexander's lavish gifts to Victoria.

The entire home dripped with obscene luxury. Though raised in privilege, Sophia found herself tiptoeing, terrified of brushing against some irreplaceable artifact.

Genevieve Kensington lounged on a silk sofa, cracking nuts. She laughed at Sophia's wide-eyed caution.

Victoria descended the staircase like royalty. "Relax," she drawled. "They're just decorations. If something breaks, we'll replace it." Her tone implied such expenses were mere pocket change.

Sophia was speechless. When had Victoria become this extravagant?

Genevieve smirked. "Alexander has more money than sense when it comes to spoiling Victoria. She could smash this place daily and he'd happily fund the destruction if it amused her."

The words settled like lead in Sophia's stomach. She'd heard rumors of Alexander's generosity toward Victoria—funding her family's rise, gifting shares, opening doors. But witnessing it firsthand was different.

What stung most was knowing how differently he treated Isabella. When the Sinclair businesses faltered, Alexander refused to lift a finger.

Yet for Victoria? No expense was too great.
###Chapter 304

Josephine was deep in thought when Alexander arrived. After greeting the Kensington and Holloway families, Victoria introduced her cousin. "This is my Aunt Beatrice's daughter, Josephine Winslow."

Alexander glanced at Josephine, offering a polite smile. "Pleasure to meet you."

Josephine had only seen Alexander in Victoria's social media posts before.

Seeing him in person now, she finally understood Victoria's choice.

Victoria's past suitors had been extraordinary—accomplished, renowned, and impressive. But compared to Alexander? None of them came close in achievements, education, family background, or even looks and demeanor.

She'd thought those men were the pinnacle, but now realized there was always someone better.

And she couldn't deny—Alexander and Victoria made a striking couple.

Yet remembering everything between Alexander and Isabella, Josephine lowered her gaze. "Hello," she murmured quietly.

After the greetings, Alexander took a seat on the sofa.

News of Victoria dating a Salzburg elite—and how his influence helped the Kensingtons enter high society—had spread through their circles in Maplewood since last year.

Coincidentally, some old acquaintances of the Kensingtons from Maplewood visited Beatrice today.

When they first heard about the Kensingtons' sudden social climb, they'd been skeptical.

Though Victoria was exceptional, with many elite suitors over the years, the Kensingtons were only mid-tier wealthy in Maplewood.

For Victoria to marry into Salzburg's upper echelon seemed impossible, let alone reaching its pinnacle.

But seeing their lavish new residence—and meeting Alexander himself—they finally believed it. Staring at Alexander in awe, Victoria said calmly, "They're old family friends."

Alexander nodded, shaking hands with each guest courteously. Once he arrived, everyone moved to the dining room.

Josephine was finishing her master's degree. Beatrice brought her to Salzburg hoping she'd find work here—with Victoria's help in securing a good match.

Alexander had always treated the Kensington and Holloway families well. After dinner, noticing his good mood, Beatrice seized the opportunity.

Josephine didn't actually want to work here or burden anyone. "Really, there's no need—" she began.

Before she could finish, Alexander smiled at her. "It's no trouble." He paused. "Josephine, right? What kind of position are you looking for?"

Josephine hadn't expected such consideration from Alexander. Was it because he loved Victoria enough to care about her relatives too?

During dinner, she'd heard Genevieve mention how Alexander had transferred substantial shares to Victoria after growing jealous of her admirers.

That alone showed his devotion. But she hadn't expected him to extend that courtesy to her—a distant cousin he'd just met.

She'd also heard Alexander and Isabella weren't officially divorced yet. Hearing Genevieve casually call him "brother-in-law" had felt odd. Yet here he was, treating her with such respect.

Flustered—always shy and overshadowed by Victoria—she stammered, struggling for words.

Victoria gently touched Alexander's arm. "Don't intimidate her."

Alexander chuckled. "Alright." To Josephine, he said, "Just let me know when you decide. Consider it done."

Josephine nodded quickly. "Okay."
###Chapter 305

Victoria suddenly remembered something. "Isn't Montgomery Industries hiring right now? They should have a suitable position for Sophia. Let me call Julian."

Alexander smiled approvingly. "That would be perfect."

Sophia knew about Julian Montgomery. She'd heard he grew up with Alexander and had always admired Victoria. Whenever Victoria needed anything, Julian would move mountains to help her.

She wanted to protest about not needing favors, but Beatrice Kensington cut in first. "Thank you, Victoria! We truly appreciate your help with this."

Victoria waved it off. "It's nothing."

The conversation shifted away from Sophia. Victoria and Alexander sat close together, speaking in hushed tones that excluded everyone else. Their effortless intimacy made Sophia think of Isabella Sinclair, who was out shopping alone today.

Sophia leaned toward Genevieve. "When is the divorce happening?"

It took Genevieve a moment to realize Sophia meant Alexander and Isabella. She smirked. "Soon. There's just some asset division complications. Alexander doesn't want Isabella using money as an excuse to interfere with him and Victoria, so he's settling all financial matters first."

Hearing Isabella would receive assets, Sophia felt some relief. She'd assumed Alexander would leave his wife with nothing, given how much he seemed to despise her.

The mention of assets clearly irritated Genevieve. Without prompting, she added bitterly, "If Alexander wasn't worried that bitch would run crying to Eleanor Whitmore and block the divorce, he wouldn't give her a single cent."

Sophia murmured, "I see." After a pause, she asked, "So it's a small portion then?"

"Not exactly small." Genevieve's lips twisted. "More than she deserves. Everything Alexander's giving her was approved by Victoria first. Just for appearances. It's not much."

Sophia understood. Given Alexander's wealth, if Genevieve was this upset, the amount must be substantial. That knowledge comforted her.

To Genevieve, Isabella's share might seem insignificant compared to Alexander's total fortune. But Sophia knew even that "small" amount equaled what Alexander had spent on Victoria over the years. No wonder Genevieve was sour - money she considered rightfully theirs was going to Isabella.

Genevieve suddenly remembered Victoria's suggestion about Montgomery Industries. She shot Sophia a sharp look. "Once you're there, keep an eye on Julian for me. Don't let other women near him, understand?"

Sophia had heard from Beatrice about Genevieve's unrequited crush on Julian, one of Salzburg's most eligible bachelors. Unsure how to respond, Sophia hesitated. "That...it's not confirmed yet. I might not even get the position."

Genevieve scoffed. "You don't know Julian. If Victoria asks, he'll say yes immediately."

Sophia could only murmur, "Oh..."

Alexander had business to attend to and prepared to leave. The Kensington and Whitmore families held him in such high regard that everyone escorted him out.

Beatrice wanted Sophia established in Salzburg quickly. After Alexander left, she reminded Victoria about the job request.

Seeing an opportunity, Victoria took out her phone to call Julian.

But the line rang endlessly with no answer.
###Chapter 306

Victoria set her phone down and turned to Beatrice. "He might be busy. I'll try again later."

Nearly forty minutes passed before she dialed Julian's number once more. This time, he answered. "I hope I'm not interrupting?" she asked.

"Not at all," Julian replied smoothly.

Truthfully, he had seen her first call. He simply hadn’t picked up.

"What do you need?" he asked.

Victoria explained the situation. After listening, Julian questioned, "Why not have her apply at Alexander’s company?"

A faint smile curved Victoria’s lips. "They aren’t hiring at the moment."

A brief silence followed. Then Julian asked, "Her name?"

"Josephine Winslow."

"How do you spell that?"

"J-O-S-E-P-H-I-N-E W-I-N-S-L-O-W."

"Got it. Have her submit a resume through the standard process in the next few days."

"Thank you, Julian," Victoria said warmly.

Before he could respond, she added casually, "What have you been up to lately? Keeping busy?"

Julian never got the chance to answer.

A soft, melodic female voice drifted through the line. "Julian, who are you talking to?"

"Nothing important," Julian replied, his tone instantly cooling. Then, to Victoria, he said, "I have to go."

The call ended before she could say another word.

The moment that woman’s voice had appeared, Julian’s demeanor had shifted. His abruptness suggested he didn’t want Victoria overhearing too much—perhaps worried she might misunderstand his relationship with the woman.

Victoria arched a brow at the thought. She set her phone aside and turned to Beatrice. "Julian agreed."

Beatrice nodded gratefully. "Thank you, Victoria."

Genevieve smirked at Josephine. "See? I told you. If Victoria speaks, Julian won’t refuse." Josephine hesitated, then glanced at Victoria again, curiosity flickering in her gaze.

That evening, after dinner, Isabella returned to her apartment from the Sinclair estate. She had just powered on her laptop to resume work when Alexander’s call lit up her screen. She ignored it. Instead, she turned her phone off completely.

It wasn’t until the next morning that she switched it back on. Several messages from Alexander awaited her.

[We need to talk.]

[It’s about Grandma’s birthday.]

[I’d like you to attend.]

When she didn’t respond, the messages stopped.

Isabella still didn’t reply. As she prepared breakfast, Alexander called again.

She frowned and let it ring out. He tried two more times before finally giving up.

Isabella headed to YodaVision as usual.

That same day, Dominic Fairchild happened to visit the company for business. Nathaniel Graves was the one who received him.

Around noon, Dominic—persistent as ever—tried to invite Nathaniel to lunch. As usual, Nathaniel declined. Left with no choice, Dominic left with his colleagues.

In the parking lot, he spotted Alexander leaning against his car, clearly waiting for someone.

Dominic paused, then approached. "Mr. Whitmore."

Alexander glanced over with a faint smile. "Mr. Fairchild. Here on business?"

"Yes."

Recalling Alexander’s recent overtures toward Isabella, Dominic kept his expression neutral. "And you? Here to…?"

"I’m here for Isabella," Alexander said, his gaze lifting to the office building. "She’s inside, I assume?"

Dominic pressed his lips together but didn’t respond before Alexander sighed. "She won’t answer my calls or texts. I had no choice but to come directly."

Just as Dominic was about to speak, Isabella and Nathaniel emerged from the building. Spotting both men in the parking lot, they halted.

Nathaniel briefly considered turning right back inside. But of course, that wasn’t an option. They continued forward, walking past Alexander and Dominic without acknowledgment, heading straight for Nathaniel’s car.

Alexander stepped forward. "We need to talk."

Nathaniel, unaware of Alexander’s embrace with Isabella after the press conference, only knew that Alexander had gone to great lengths to hide their marriage.

Now, seeing Alexander approach Isabella so openly—without a care for who might see—Nathaniel frowned at her in silent question: What the hell is he doing?

Isabella had known the moment she saw Alexander that he was here for her. She hadn’t expected him to be so bold, showing up at YodaVision in broad daylight.

Her voice was ice. "I’m not interested."

Alexander held her gaze. "Don’t decide yet. If you have conditions, name them."

"There’s nothing to discuss," Isabella said flatly. "If I need to talk, I’ll reach out."
###Chapter 307

Isabella turned away without another glance, her heels clicking sharply against the pavement as she walked toward her car.

Alexander moved to intercept her, but his phone buzzed insistently in his pocket.

He checked the caller ID and hesitated, watching as Isabella slid into the driver's seat. With a frustrated sigh, he answered the call. Nathaniel had been ready to intervene when he saw Alexander approach, but seeing the man back down, he smirked coldly before joining Isabella in the vehicle.

Nathaniel hadn't caught their entire conversation. As the car pulled away, he asked, "Where did he want to take you?"

Isabella explained about Eleanor Whitmore's upcoming birthday gala.

Nathaniel raised an eyebrow. The Graves and Whitmore families weren't particularly close, though with such a lavish celebration planned, his family would likely receive an invitation. He simply didn't visit often enough to know these details.

"Smart decision not to go," he nodded. Then his expression darkened. "Didn't he already parade Victoria around the Whitmore estate? He'll probably bring her to the birthday party too." His fingers tapped against the armrest. "So why invite you? Wouldn't your absence make things easier for them?"

The same thought had crossed Isabella's mind. But with Alexander and Victoria now irrelevant to her life, she hadn't dwelled on it.

Nathaniel's eyes narrowed. "Unless... the family didn't approve of Victoria when he introduced her." He turned to study Isabella's profile. "And now he's banking on Grandmother Whitmore's fondness for you. If you give your blessing, they might accept Victoria more readily."

Isabella's grip tightened on the steering wheel. "Possibly."

Nathaniel let out a derisive laugh. "No wonder he's suddenly so eager to reconcile. The man's calculations are transparent."

Isabella remained silent, focusing on the road ahead.

Meanwhile, Alexander ended his call with clipped politeness.

Dominic Fairchild lingered nearby. When Alexander pocketed his phone, he ventured, "Was that Ms. Sinclair?"

Alexander offered a tight smile. "Indeed." He gestured toward the street. "Mr. Fairchild, care to join me for lunch?"

Dominic hesitated only briefly before nodding. "Certainly."

Half an hour later, they sat across from each other in an upscale bistro. Alexander swirled his wine glass. "I heard from Mr. Kensington that you'll be discussing a new venture with him soon."

Dominic's expression remained neutral, though internally he noted how closely Alexander monitored the Kensington family affairs.

"That's correct," he replied evenly.

Alexander leaned forward. "I find that project quite intriguing myself. Perhaps you could share some details?"

Dominic nearly laughed aloud. The pretense was laughably thin - if Alexander truly cared about the business, he would have asked about the venture directly rather than leading with Reginald Kensington's name.

This was about protecting Victoria's family interests.

"My apologies, Mr. Whitmore," Dominic said smoothly. "That information remains confidential at this stage." He took a deliberate sip of water. "I'm sure you understand."
###Chapter 308

Isabella had no clue what Alexander and Dominic discussed. After her lunch meeting with Nathaniel, she returned to the office to focus on work.

On Wednesday, she received a call from Charles inviting her for dinner that weekend. He casually mentioned, "Josephine will be there too." Isabella hesitated briefly before agreeing.

Friday afternoon found Isabella in the middle of an important meeting when her phone buzzed. Before she could answer, the call disconnected.

With the meeting still ongoing and the number unfamiliar, she dismissed it without a second thought.

The caller had been Josephine.

She'd officially started working at Montgomery Enterprises on Wednesday.

Her intention was to tell Isabella about her new job and permanent move to Salzburg.

But the moment she dialed, Genevieve's words echoed in her mind—how Alexander's inner circle, including Julian, had never warmed to Isabella despite her efforts, while Victoria had been effortlessly accepted.

If Isabella learned about her position at Montgomery Enterprises, she'd immediately suspect Victoria's involvement. That knowledge would only cause pain. The thought made Josephine abruptly end the call.

After work, prompted by Beatrice, she returned to the Kensington estate. Before even entering, she noticed multiple luxury vehicles parked outside—a clear sign of visitors.

Before arriving in Salzburg, Beatrice had mentioned how Victoria's connection to Alexander had become common knowledge among the city's elite.

The extent of Alexander's devotion to Victoria was practically public record in their circles.

Josephine hadn't fully grasped the implications until witnessing it firsthand. The daily parade of high-profile visitors seeking favors from the Kensingtons made their elevated status undeniable.

Seeing these powerful figures—CEOs, politicians, celebrities—personally courting Victoria's family left Josephine speechless.

Only then did she understand how profoundly Alexander's influence had transformed the Kensingtons' social standing.

Yet while Beatrice interacted with these visitors cautiously, Victoria maintained an aloof distance, often avoiding them altogether. Remarkably, none dared take offense, continuing their overtures regardless.

Spotting the luxury cars, Josephine knew more guests had arrived.

She slipped in through a side entrance, moving upstairs unnoticed. Victoria was there, seeking solitude with a book. Glancing up, she asked, "Just finished work?"

Josephine stopped. "Yes."

Since Victoria had already spoken to Julian about the job, she considered the matter settled and paid it little attention.

Turning a page, Victoria suddenly looked up. "Did Julian say anything when you met?"

Watching Victoria read, Josephine marveled at her relentless drive.

Rumors swirled about Victoria recently impressing tech moguls at several high-profile conferences.

Snapping back to attention, Josephine answered, "I haven't met Mr. Montgomery yet."

Victoria paused. "Julian didn't reach out?"

"No."

Victoria had expected Julian, knowing Josephine was connected to her, would at least arrange a meeting and assign someone to mentor her.

Then again, such obvious favoritism might harm Josephine's workplace reputation.

"Never mind," Victoria said dismissively.

Josephine nodded and retreated to her room without another word.

Victoria set her book aside and called Julian. He let it ring several times before answering with a curt, "Hello."

Victoria smiled. "I heard Josephine started at Montgomery Enterprises. Thank you, Julian. Are you free soon? I'd like to take you to dinner."

Julian's tone remained detached. "Josephine earned her position. No thanks necessary."

If he hadn't investigated personally, how would he know her qualifications?

Victoria smiled but didn't press. As she prepared to speak, Julian interrupted, "I'm busy. Another time."

Knowing Julian's recent workload, she simply replied, "Of course," and ended the call without hesitation.

In truth, Julian had no urgent matters. What he truly wanted was to call Isabella.

The moment Victoria hung up, he dialed Isabella's number.
###Chapter 309

Isabella was still at her office when Julian's call came through. She answered, "Mr. Montgomery?"

His voice immediately softened upon hearing her. "Lily misses you. Are you free this weekend? Perhaps we could go out?"

Her eyes remained fixed on the financial projections displayed across three monitors. "I'm swamped for the next two days. Next week?"

When she mentioned being busy, Julian's gaze dropped. "Of course. Next week then."

"Perfect."

Already mentally returning to her spreadsheets, Isabella added, "Let's talk later?"

There was a brief pause. "Alright."

The call ended, and Isabella worked until nearly midnight before leaving the office.

The following morning found her at the Montgomery estate.

When Charles had gone abroad for treatment years ago, Sophia had just turned three.

Back then, the little girl had been utterly charming and completely attached to Charles. He'd adored her.

Even when leaving for overseas treatment, he'd been reluctant to part with her - something even Alexander, who'd barely noticed Sophia at the time, must have remembered.

After waiting so long to return, Charles had clearly wanted to see Sophia during his first invitation. Yet Alexander had brought Victoria instead, leaving Sophia behind.

This time, Charles had specifically mentioned Sophia would be coming. But when Isabella arrived, the child was nowhere to be seen.

Spotting her, Charles beamed. "I've had the kitchen prepare all your favorites. You must eat well today."

Isabella smiled. "I will."

After some conversation, Charles suddenly said, "I heard that rascal Alexander planned to bring Victoria to Eleanor's birthday gala. Naturally, she refused - threatened that if he dared bring that woman to ruin her celebration, she wouldn't attend her own party."

Isabella's coffee cup froze halfway to her lips.

Charles continued, "That fool Alexander might be infuriating, but this is Eleanor's first birthday celebration in years. He seems to have backed down. Still, it's put her in a terrible mood lately. If you have time, call her. She could use your company."

Isabella nodded slowly. "I will."

Last week, Alexander had called, texted, even waited outside her office building. Then suddenly - nothing. She hadn't thought much of it.

Now Charles' words made her realize - Alexander must have already made his choice. With no need to convince her further, he'd stopped reaching out.

Charles added, "The others - Richard and Catherine - won't accept her either."

Alexander backing down about the gala made sense. But regarding his marriage to Victoria? If he insisted, no one could truly stop him. Charles clearly understood that too.

He frowned, clicking his tongue in displeasure before abruptly changing the subject.

They'd been talking for about fifteen minutes when a car pulled up outside.

Last time Alexander visited, Charles hadn't bothered greeting him. But guessing this arrival might be Sophia, Charles' eyes lit up as he stood. "That must be Sophie!"

He hurried toward the entrance. Moments later, Isabella followed.

As Charles predicted, it was Sophia.

The moment the girl stepped from the car and saw Isabella, she came running. "Mommy!"

Before Isabella could respond, Charles was already smiling at Sophia, about to speak.

But when Alexander emerged from the vehicle, that smile vanished.

He snorted, giving Alexander an icy glare. "I believe I said to have someone drop Sophie off. Did I not make it clear you weren't welcome here? What are you doing?"

Alexander's gaze flickered to Isabella beside Charles before he replied calmly, "I thought you were being sarcastic."

Another derisive snort. Alexander said, "Don't be angry. I'm just dropping Sophie off. I'll leave shortly." Ignoring him, Charles turned back to Sophia with warmth. "Sophie, I'm Grandpa Charles. We used to have such fun together. Do you remember me?"

Sophia clung to Isabella's hand, studying Charles before shaking her head.

While Charles interacted with Sophia, Alexander's eyes lingered on Isabella without speaking. After a moment, he simply told Charles, "I'll be going now," before returning to his car and driving away.
###Chapter 310

The afternoon sunlight streamed through the windows of the Montgomery estate as Isabella Sinclair sipped her coffee across the chessboard from Charles Montgomery.

Sophia Whitmore kept glancing at the clock, clearly eager to return to the Whitmore residence with Isabella later. During a quiet moment, Isabella texted Alexander Whitmore, requesting he arrange for Sophia's transportation home that evening.

Alexander left the message unanswered. She assumed he hadn't seen it yet. However, right after dinner - though Alexander himself didn't appear - the car he'd sent for Sophia arrived punctually at the Montgomery mansion.

Once Sophia departed, Isabella drove away as well.

Eleanor Whitmore's birthday celebration loomed the following week. Isabella had already resolved not to attend.

After careful consideration, Margaret Sinclair agreed their absence would be best. With their decision made, Isabella and Margaret called Eleanor that evening.

Eleanor answered while still finishing dinner. Her injured leg had nearly healed, allowing normal movement again.

She glanced at Alexander before excusing herself from the dining room, warmth coloring her voice. "Isabella, have you eaten yet?"

"We have," Isabella replied, having put the call on speaker. After exchanging pleasantries with Eleanor, she broached the subject. "Grandmother, I'm sorry. Granny and I won't be able to attend your birthday celebration in person."

Eleanor had anticipated this. Though disappointed, she understood. Her soft chuckle carried through the phone. "That's quite alright, dear. Just promise me this won't create distance between us. Call me often, yes? And remember - if you ever need anything, don't hesitate to ask. No formalities between family."

"I understand. Thank you, Grandmother," Isabella responded.

Their conversation continued briefly before ending.

With Eleanor's birthday approaching, Catherine Whitmore had returned to the Whitmore estate the previous day.

Henry Whitmore was also present.

Earlier, Catherine had inquired about Alexander and Isabella's situation, revealing to Henry that their divorce remained in process, not yet finalized.

Given Isabella's closeness to Eleanor and the pending divorce status - coupled with this being Eleanor's first major birthday celebration in years - Isabella's attendance seemed almost expected.

Watching Eleanor leave the dining room, Henry couldn't resist asking, "Alexander, is Isabella coming to Grandmother's birthday?"

Sophia had already finished eating and left the dining area.

Alexander continued eating methodically. "Ask Grandmother later," he replied.

Henry paused. Did Alexander not know? Or had Isabella just called about this? If she'd planned to attend, a special call wouldn't be necessary.

Meaning she likely never intended to come.

Henry genuinely liked Isabella. He studied Alexander, fighting the urge to ask if he was absolutely certain about the divorce.

But Eleanor, Catherine, and Richard never interfered in Alexander's affairs. Henry knew he lacked standing to question the decision either.

When Eleanor returned, Henry asked gently, "Grandmother, what did Isabella say?"

Eleanor's gaze flicked to Alexander, who continued eating with perfect composure, his expression unchanged at Isabella's name. "She apologized and said she wouldn't be attending the celebration," Eleanor replied.

Alexander showed no reaction to the unspoken implications. He silently served Eleanor some food, only for her to move her bowl away, leaving his utensils suspended mid-air.
###Chapter 311

Eleanor Whitmore's birthday arrived without fanfare.

Alexander had reminded Isabella in advance, so Sophia had already prepared a birthday gift. The moment she came downstairs for breakfast, she presented it eagerly.

Eleanor's eyes crinkled with warmth. "Thank you, Sophia."

Alexander handed over his gift next. "This is from both Isabella and me. Happy birthday."

At his words, Eleanor shot him a knowing look.

Before she could respond, the butler entered carrying two gift boxes. "Mrs. Whitmore, these presents were sent by Madam Kensington and Mrs. Whitmore."

Eleanor accepted them, then glanced at Alexander. She knew he'd mentioned Isabella's name just to please her, but she'd stopped interfering in their relationship.

She huffed. "Isabella already sent me a separate gift. No need for your empty gestures." With that, she turned away.

Alexander simply chuckled, unfazed. He urged Sophia to finish breakfast so he could drive her to school.

After delivering her gift, Isabella grabbed her car keys and headed to work. Shortly after arriving, she and Nathaniel left for a business meeting at InnovaTech.

They spotted Victoria immediately upon arrival.

Victoria only acknowledged Nathaniel. "Mr. Graves."

She wore a bright smile, showing no sign of disappointment about missing Eleanor's birthday banquet.

Nathaniel gave her a brief glance, lips curving slightly without responding. He and Isabella proceeded with their business.

Nathaniel found it interesting that Isabella wasn't attending Eleanor's celebration.

That evening, he returned home and accompanied his parents to the banquet venue.

They arrived early, finding the hall still sparsely populated.

The Whitmores took Eleanor's milestone birthday seriously. Nearly all family members, including Sophia, were already present.

Nathaniel hadn't seen Sophia in nearly three years.

When they first met, he'd noticed her resemblance to Alexander. Now, the similarity was even more striking.

When the Graves family arrived, the Whitmores greeted them warmly. "Mr. Graves, Mrs. Graves, Mr. Nathaniel."

After exchanging pleasantries, Melissa Graves studied Sophia.

Nathaniel and Isabella had met after she became Frederick's student.

Melissa had always admired Isabella - her brilliance and closeness in age to Nathaniel made her wish they could be together.

But when she hinted at this, Nathaniel immediately shut it down, explaining Isabella already loved someone.

Before Melissa could process this, Isabella had married. She knew about Isabella and Alexander's relationship.

She also knew Sophia was their daughter.

Noticing Melissa's gaze, Eleanor smiled. "This is my great-granddaughter, Sophia."

Melissa gently ruffled Sophia's hair. "Absolutely precious."

Sophia greeted politely, "Mrs. Graves."

Then her eyes lingered on Nathaniel a moment too long.

Eleanor chuckled. "Sophia, why are you staring at Nathaniel like that?"

Sophia tilted her head. "Mr. Graves looks very familiar."
###Chapter 312

Before Nathaniel could respond, Sophia tilted her head and studied him. "Mr. Graves, your voice sounds so familiar."

During the Winter Solstice gala, Isabella had placed Nathaniel on speakerphone during their lengthy business negotiations.

Sophia had been present that evening. Of course she'd recognize that distinctive baritone.

But Nathaniel merely arched an eyebrow. "Do I?"

Sophia nodded enthusiastically. "Mm-hmm!"

"Perhaps I just have one of those voices," Nathaniel deflected with practiced ease.

Alexander coughed into his fist to disguise a chuckle.

Nathaniel shot him a look. What exactly was so amusing about this situation?

As more guests streamed into the ballroom, the Whitmore family excused themselves to attend to other visitors, cutting the conversation short.

Rumors had swirled for years about Alexander's secret marriage and child. Tonight, the speculation ended.

Gasps rippled through the crowd when a miniature version of Alexander appeared, clutching his hand and calling him "Daddy" in a clear, carrying voice.

The truth was undeniable now - the elusive billionaire heir did indeed have a daughter.

Whether he remained married, or had divorced, remained a mystery the Whitmores carefully guarded.

Dominic had met Sophia before but kept the information to himself.

When his childhood friend Simon spotted the little girl, his jaw practically hit the marble floor.

"Holy hell! Whitmore actually got married? And the kid's what - five? That means if Victoria marries him, she'd be an insta-mom?" The thought of the notoriously high-maintenance Victoria Kensington playing stepmother was almost comical.

Simon nearly voiced how disadvantageous this would be for Victoria. Then he remembered the vast gulf between the Kensington and Whitmore family fortunes.

Considering Alexander's status and influence, even with baggage, Victoria would still be marrying up spectacularly.

Besides, the child was a daughter - no threat to future inheritance.

As long as Victoria produced a male heir, her position would be unassailable.

Alexander's past relationships became irrelevant in the grand scheme.

Across the ballroom, a society matron gushed to Melissa Graves. "Nathaniel's accomplishments at such a young age! YodaVision's success speaks volumes about your son's brilliance."

Melissa smiled demurely. "You're too kind. He's had some fortunate breaks."

The conversation inevitably turned to Isabella.

"Your son and Ms. Sinclair seem quite close," the woman probed. "Any wedding bells in their future?"

While Nathaniel and Isabella maintained a strictly professional relationship, Melissa didn't correct the assumption.

"The young people will decide their own timeline," she said with a knowing smile.

To outsiders, it sounded like wedding preparations could commence at any moment.

Julian and Oliver observed the exchange from a nearby table.

At the mention of Isabella's name, both men strained to listen.

Despite Isabella and Nathaniel's frequent public appearances over the past six months, Oliver never believed the Graves family would seriously consider her as a daughter-in-law.

YodaVision's meteoric rise made Nathaniel one of the most eligible bachelors in the country.

With his wealth, looks, and pedigree, he could have any woman.

Why would he choose a divorced single mother with no notable family connections or extraordinary talents?

Yet Melissa's tone suggested genuine approval. Oliver turned to Julian in disbelief. "Have the Graves lost their minds?"
###Chapter 313

Oliver's words hung in the air. "Or perhaps they're simply unaware of Isabella's past?"

Many had assumed there was something romantic between Isabella and Nathaniel.

Ever since discovering Isabella was also Frederick's student, Julian had observed their interactions closely. He found no trace of romantic involvement between them.

He couldn't tell if Melissa genuinely wanted them together or if there were ulterior motives behind her words.

But one thing was certain - given Isabella's accomplishments, she was worthy of anyone, regardless of her past.

"They likely know," Julian replied.

Oliver's eyes widened. "Then why would they—"

He stopped mid-sentence, realization dawning. "Wait... so Isabella has actually fallen for Nathaniel? She no longer loves Alexander?"

Before Julian could respond, Oliver connected the dots.

"No wonder she remained so composed during the divorce proceedings. She didn't even fight for Sophia's custody. I thought she was scheming to win Alexander back, but she already had Nathaniel lined up."

"Having Sophia would have complicated marrying into the Graves family."

Julian remained silent.

Oliver was genuinely shocked the Graves family would accept Isabella under these circumstances.

When Alexander approached moments later, Oliver couldn't resist sharing. "Julian and I overheard Nathaniel's mother speaking with guests earlier. From her tone, she seems supportive of Isabella marrying Nathaniel."

"I suspect the wedding will happen shortly after your divorce is finalized."

Alexander arched an eyebrow, amused. "Is that so?"

"That's exactly how Melissa sounded," Oliver insisted. "Ask Julian if you don't believe me."

Alexander turned to Julian.

After a brief hesitation, Julian nodded.

Melissa's words had indeed suggested as much.

Alexander chuckled but said nothing further.

Just then, Charles arrived, fashionably late among the guests.

Spotting him, Alexander gave Julian's shoulder a pat before moving to greet the older man. "Mr. Montgomery."

Charles ignored him completely. Handing his gift to Eleanor, he exchanged pleasantries before turning to Sophia with a warm smile. "Sophia, come give me a hug."

The girl obeyed immediately.

Charles's eyes crinkled affectionately. "Such a sweet girl."

Sophia peered up at him. "Mr. Montgomery, didn't Mom come with you?"

She'd already asked Alexander about Isabella earlier. He'd told her Isabella was too busy to attend.

But seeing Charles here reminded her how close he was with her mother. His presence without Isabella made her question again.

The guests buzzed with curiosity about the identity of Sophia's mysterious mother.

At her question, many eyes turned - including Dominic's - eager for clues about this enigmatic woman.

Charles smiled kindly. "No, your mother had work commitments."

Sophia sighed. "Oh, okay."

Her manner of addressing Charles confirmed her mother wasn't part of the Montgomery family.

Yet this exchange left guests no wiser about Alexander's ex-wife's identity.

To those unaware of the full story - including Dominic - Charles's response suggested Alexander and Sophia's mother were already divorced.

They assumed the separation had been kept from the child.
###Chapter 314

The society pages of Salzburg were buzzing after Eleanor Whitmore's birthday celebration. Word spread like wildfire that Alexander Whitmore had been secretly married and fathered a six-year-old daughter.

Victoria Kensington never lacked suitors.

Despite her public relationship with Alexander, countless men still pursued her relentlessly.

When news broke about Alexander's hidden marriage and child, Victoria's admirers were devastated. They believed someone of her caliber deserved better.

The morning after the birthday gala, several determined suitors showed up at The Grandeur's headquarters, attempting to convince Victoria to leave Alexander.

Victor Pembroke and other executives had to intervene before the situation escalated. The incident became watercooler gossip throughout the company.

Some employees whispered, "We knew Ms. Kensington was popular after that Valentine's Day incident, but this is next level."

"Absolutely."

The entire company knew about Victoria and Alexander's strong bond. But few had suspected he'd been married with a child.

One bold employee finally asked, "Ms. Kensington, is it true? Mr. Whitmore was married before? With a daughter?"

Victoria smiled serenely. "Yes."

Seeing her composure, another ventured, "And you...?" Victoria chuckled. "We get along splendidly. Sophia adores me. We have a wonderful relationship." Since it was work hours, the gossip session ended quickly.

At 5 PM, Victoria was finishing paperwork when Sophia burst into her office. "Victoria!" The woman's face lit up as she scooped up the giggling child. "You're early."

Sophia nodded enthusiastically. "Mm-hmm!"

Victoria stroked her hair. "Give me ten minutes to finish, then we'll go to Whitmore Enterprises to meet your father."

"Okay!" Sophia chirped.

The child's sudden appearance had caused whispers. But seeing their interaction erased all doubts.

The resemblance to Alexander was uncanny.

Earlier when Victoria mentioned getting along with Alexander's daughter, some had been skeptical.

But witnessing Sophia's radiant joy at seeing Victoria, the truth was undeniable.

Victoria hadn't exaggerated.

Their bond was genuine.

People often said stepmother roles were challenging.

Though Victoria and Alexander weren't married yet, everyone expected an announcement soon.

One awestruck employee murmured, "Ms. Kensington, even children fall under your spell. You're incredible."

Victoria shook her head. "You flatter me. Sophia has the sweetest temperament. Our relationship is mutual - I can't take all the credit."

Another observed, "Mr. Whitmore's daughter is exquisite. She'll grow into a stunning beauty."

"No question."

As they studied Sophia, some employees noticed something familiar in her features beyond just resembling Alexander.

They also wondered - what kind of woman could have borne Alexander's child?

Curiosity burned, but no one dared pry.

Twenty minutes later, Victoria closed her laptop. "Ready to see Daddy, sweetheart?"

Sophia eagerly shouldered her unicorn backpack and grasped Victoria's hand. "Yes!"

Victoria prompted gently, "Say goodbye, darling."

"Bye everyone!" Sophia waved enthusiastically.

The enchanted staff chorused, "Goodbye! Visit again soon!"

"Okay!" Sophia promised.

Watching them leave, Victor remarked, "For all those doubters who can't accept Ms. Kensington's happiness with Mr. Whitmore, he's certainly shutting down rumors effectively."

"Having his daughter visit her at work? That's a power move. Mr. Whitmore doesn't play around when it comes to Victoria."

"Exactly. Ms. Kensington is truly blessed."
###Chapter 315

Isabella Sinclair, Nathaniel Graves, and Maxwell Sterling, the general manager of InnovaTech, had a private group chat.

The day's events were so scandalous that Maxwell couldn't contain his inner gossipmonger. He immediately spilled every juicy detail to them.

Neither Isabella nor Nathaniel cared much about how many admirers Victoria Kensington had or how obsessed they were with her.

But by afternoon, Maxwell messaged again.

Mr. Whitmore's daughter came to the company looking for Ms. Kensington. When Ms. Kensington claimed she got along well with his daughter before, most of us didn’t believe her.

But after seeing the little girl today? It’s clear—Sophia Whitmore absolutely adores her.

Isabella’s fingers froze over the keyboard. It wasn’t because she was upset about Sophia being close to Victoria.

She had just realized—if word got out about Victoria and Sophia’s relationship, there was no way to keep it from her uncle and grandmother any longer.

She’d always known this day would come eventually, but—

Nathaniel glanced at her expression and immediately guessed her thoughts.

With a scoff, he said, "The only reason Sophia’s existence spread so fast is because Alexander himself is influential."

"But Victoria? Who is she? Just someone clinging to Alexander’s coattails. Beyond InnovaTech employees and her little fan club, who in high society actually cares about her relationship with his daughter?"

Then, as if struck by sudden amusement, Nathaniel smirked.

"Now, if people found out you were also Frederick Aldridge’s student—that the Cuap system and our company’s two major projects were your work—and that you’re actually Sophia’s biological mother? That would shake the entire social circle."

"As for Victoria? A nobody trying to play stepmother? Please."

Isabella remained calm about it all.

Still…

She hesitated before speaking. "Uncle Charles and Grandma Margaret have probably already guessed that Sophia is close to Victoria."

"They haven’t asked me about it because they don’t want to upset me—so they’re pretending not to know."

Nathaniel agreed.

He gave her shoulder a reassuring squeeze.

"It’s good they’re mentally prepared. The fact they haven’t said anything means you’re their priority over Sophia. What matters most to them is that you’re happy."

Isabella smiled faintly. "I know."

Then her thoughts shifted to the status of her divorce from Alexander.

Honestly, when she’d signed the divorce papers he gave her, she’d assumed it would be finalized quickly.

She never expected it to drag on for months.

She’d asked Alexander multiple times, and each time, he’d promised it would be done soon. But—

Since she knew he was more eager to finalize it than she was, she hadn’t pressed further. But now…

Decisively, she called Jonathan Blackwood to check the progress.

Jonathan had been handling the divorce proceedings for her weekly. Hearing her inquiry, he replied, "Tomorrow is my scheduled call with Mr. Whitmore’s lawyer. I’ll update you as soon as I get a response."

"Alright," Isabella said. Then, calmly, she added, "If they give the same vague answer again, tell his lawyer I’m willing to walk away with nothing."

"I don’t want a single thing Alexander has given me. He can draft a new agreement immediately—I’ll sign it."
###Chapter 316

Jonathan stopped mid-sentence. "You don't want anything? Are you absolutely certain?"

Alexander had been shockingly generous—allocating Isabella an astronomical sum that could sustain her in luxury for decades.

Jonathan couldn't fathom why she'd refuse it.

Isabella's voice was steel. "I'm sure. But I have one condition."

She'd never intended to take his money. Even walking away empty-handed wouldn't leave a single regret.

When Eleanor had fallen ill, Alexander insisted on repaying Isabella for visiting his grandmother.

Besides two billion dollars, he'd transferred three penthouses near Margaret's neighborhood.

Though legally in her name, until the divorce finalized, they remained marital assets.

If she took nothing, she'd lose those properties.

And if she didn't secure them? The Whitmores or Kensingtons would snatch them immediately.

Knowing the Kensingtons, they'd move in just to torment Margaret daily.

Her jaw tightened. "I only want those three penthouses. Not as a gift—I'll buy them."

Her recent earnings made it possible.

Jonathan grasped her reasoning instantly.

It was a terrible deal for her, but her resolve silenced his objections.

Within minutes, he relayed her terms to Alexander's lawyer.

As Isabella headed for dinner, her phone rang.

Alexander's voice was calm. "Have you eaten?"

"No." She cut to the chase. "Your lawyer told you my terms?"

"He did." A pause. "But Grandmother saw the divorce agreement. If you want changes, you'll need to convince her first."

Eleanor would interfere—Isabella had expected this.

Her reply was icy. "Finalize the divorce first. We'll handle the rest later."

A humorless laugh crackled through the line. "You didn't think to consult me before rewriting our agreement?"

"I didn't expect you to care," she shot back.

Silence. Then—

"Meet me at The Grandeur. We'll discuss this properly."

The line went dead before she could refuse.
###Chapter 317

Alexander's voice came through the phone. "Then, will you talk to Grandma?"

Isabella didn't need to ask to know Eleanor would never agree to her leaving empty-handed.

She countered with a question of her own. "If we keep the current divorce terms, when can we finalize the paperwork?"

"Before year's end."

It was only March. That meant months of waiting stretched ahead. Still...

"Anything else?" Alexander asked.

Isabella ended the call without responding. The moment she did, her phone rang again.

Julian's name flashed on the screen.

He informed her that Lily had come down with the flu and wouldn't be well enough for their planned weekend outing.

"That's fine," Isabella said. "We'll reschedule when she's better."

Concern laced her voice as she added, "Keep me updated on her condition."

Julian chuckled at her obvious worry. "Will do."

After exchanging a few more pleasantries, they hung up.

Isabella turned her attention to developing a new prototype for her passion project. The entire weekend passed in a blur of coding and design.

Monday morning found her reviewing documents in her office before heading to the interview room.

The fourth candidate paused at the threshold. His eyes scanned the room before landing on her. "Nathaniel's not here?"

Isabella looked up. "No."

The man gave her an appraising look. "You're Isabella Sinclair?"

She nodded, not bothering to ask how he knew. "Since he's unavailable, do you still want to proceed?"

After a moment's hesitation, he took a seat. "Sure, let's do this."

His casual demeanor prompted her direct question. "How would you like to conduct this?"

His eyebrows shot up. "You're letting me choose the format?"

"Tell me your preference."

He pulled a laptop from his bag, tapped a few keys, then slid it toward her. Leaning back, he propped one ankle on his knee and popped a lollipop in his mouth, watching her with undisguised curiosity.

Isabella glanced at the screen - lines of complex code stared back. Without comment, she immediately began making adjustments.

Her fingers flew across the keyboard.

"Done." She rotated the laptop back toward him.

The candidate sat up sharply, lollipop forgotten between his teeth. His eyes widened as he scanned her modifications. When he looked up, astonishment colored his features.

She hadn't just reviewed his code - she'd optimized it. Her changes improved modularity, efficiency, and scalability beyond recognition.

"How..." He braced his hands on the table, leaning forward with sudden intensity. "Isabella, right? That's beautiful. Where'd you study? How long since graduation? What major projects have you led? Tell me everything."

His proximity made her uncomfortable. Isabella leaned back, creating distance. "Shall we continue the interview?"
###Chapter 318

Of course we'll proceed with the interview!

The man extended his hand with a confident smile. "Kieran Blackwood. Pleasure to meet you."

Isabella shook it firmly. "I know." She already held his resume in her other hand.

Studying him, she arched a brow. "So, who's interviewing whom here?"

Kieran's grin widened. "Your call."

His resume highlighted expertise in algorithms. Isabella tested his proficiency in data scrubbing, feature extraction, and hyperparameter optimization. She particularly assessed his ability to devise creative solutions under pressure.

Their discussion stretched longer than anticipated.

By the end, Isabella was impressed. For someone who'd only entered AI research eighteen months ago after a career switch, his depth of knowledge was remarkable.

If he maintained this trajectory, he'd reshape the industry.

Closing his file, she finally asked the personal question burning in her mind. "You've lived in Salzburg since childhood. Why return now?"

Their entire conversation had been a mutual evaluation. Kieran had witnessed her coding prowess when she debugged his algorithm earlier. Now he understood why people called her the "Architect of Infinite-CM" - her strategic thinking was terrifyingly precise.

"Your work," he answered without hesitation. "The Cuap language. Especially YodaVision's Infinite-CM project. The AI ecosystem here is exploding while Salzburg's stagnating."

Then he leaned forward. "My turn now."

Before she could react, Kieran stood and closed the distance between them. "Relationship status? Ideal type? And..." His eyes gleamed. "Do I qualify?"

The other interviewers stifled laughter behind their hands.

Isabella remained impassive. "No." She snapped his file shut. "Interview concluded."

As she stood to leave, Kieran took it as acceptance. "I can start immediately. Don't even need orientation."

She walked out without glancing back.

#25 DOMUE

Nathaniel returned that afternoon, loosening his tie. "Any promising candidates today?"

"Two standouts." She handed him the files.

He scanned them, then froze at Kieran's photo. "Him?"

"You know him?"

"The Blackwood heir." Nathaniel whistled. "Top-ranked financier until two years ago when he suddenly switched to AI. His family nearly disowned him - they own half of Salzburg's banking sector."

Flipping the page, he added, "Rumor says he's gone rogue. Whole family's searching Europe for him. Never imagined he'd surface here."
###Chapter 319

Isabella remained silent.

Nathaniel glanced at the resume again. "Well-written. But how's his actual performance?"

"Impressive. With less than two years of study, he's already outperforming PhD candidates from Ivy League schools."

Nathaniel raised an eyebrow. "A prodigy then." He tapped the document. "You want to keep him?"

"I'm considering it, but—"

"Worried he won't stay?"

Isabella nodded. Though Kieran showed genuine interest in Cuap and Infinite-CM, too many variables surrounded him.

"Put him on probation. We can always terminate if he doesn't fit." Nathaniel suggested.

"Agreed."

Meanwhile, Kieran became the instant center of attention upon entering the arcade. His tall frame and aristocratic bearing drew admiring glances.

Several women hesitated to approach. His aloof expression and tightly pressed lips created an invisible barrier.

No one dared break it.

When his phone rang, the excited voice on the other end blurted, "How'd it go? Did Sinclair fall for your charms?"

"Please tell me she bought the love-at-first-sight act!" The caller laughed. "Use more tricks—make her obsessed—"

Kieran's face remained impassive. He spotted Victoria entering just as he ended the call.

"You disappeared without a word." Victoria stopped before him. "Your family panicked. They thought something terrible happened."

She nearly called him reckless, but swallowed the word at his defiant silence.

"I know why you're back. If it's for YodaVision's tech, I support you completely." She studied his reaction. "But if this is about me—if you plan to make Isabella fall for you just to break her heart—"

"That's my fight. Stay out of it."

Kieran's gaze lingered on her face.

Victoria touched her cheek. "Something on my face?"

"No." He looked away.

"About what I said—"

"I'm leaving." Kieran walked off without another word.

"Don't do anything stupid!" Victoria chased after him.

Ignoring her, he stepped into the elevator. As he reached his car, he spotted Alexander watching from another vehicle.

"Long time." Alexander smiled.

Kieran gave him a curt nod before turning to Victoria. "Take care."

Before she could respond, he drove off.

Victoria frowned at the departing car.

Next morning, Isabella found flowers on her desk.

"From the new R&D guy—Kieran," a colleague announced.

Isabella showed no reaction. She simply moved the bouquet aside and began working.
###Chapter 320

Isabella Sinclair had barely settled into her morning work when the prestigious A Journal's acceptance notification popped up in her inbox.

Nathaniel Graves arrived shortly after to discuss their ongoing project. His expression remained unreadable when she shared the news of her paper's acceptance.

With Frederick Aldridge's endorsement as a leading expert in their field, the outcome was practically guaranteed from the start.

As their meeting concluded, Isabella glanced at her watch. "Lunch together?"

Nathaniel massaged his temples with a tired sigh. "Can't. Prior engagement."

She raised an eyebrow. "What's so important?"

A wry smile twisted his lips. "Grandfather's idea of a blind date."

Isabella burst out laughing. "Twenty-eight years old and this is your first setup? Consider yourself lucky."

Nathaniel rolled his eyes.

Truthfully, his family rarely interfered in his personal life.

But this particular match involved his grandfather's longtime friend's granddaughter. Refusal wasn't an option.

"Go on then," Isabella waved him off. "I'll grab something from the cafeteria."

Thirty minutes later, Nathaniel found himself in an intimate bistro clearly designed for romantic encounters.

His date arrived precisely on time.

Fate chose that exact moment to deliver Oliver Westbrook to the same establishment, accompanied by a female companion.

The moment Oliver stepped inside, he spotted Nathaniel's distinctive profile across the room.

Nathaniel's back remained turned, oblivious to the new arrival.

Oliver's lips curled as he deliberately selected the adjacent booth.

Though Nathaniel spoke in measured tones, their proximity allowed Oliver to quickly grasp the situation.

When his companion opened her mouth to speak, Oliver pressed a finger to his lips in warning.

With barely contained glee, he snapped a covert photo and fired it off to their group chat with Alexander Whitmore, Julian Montgomery, and Victoria Kensington.

"Guess the scene? Hint: this place reeks of romance."

Julian had just clocked out for lunch when the notification chimed. He studied the image.

Oliver's clue made the situation obvious, but Julian left the message on read, pretending obliviousness.

Victoria and Alexander similarly maintained radio silence.

Oliver's fingers flew across his screen when no responses came. "Everyone dead? It's lunch hour!"

Still nothing from Julian.

Then finally, Victoria responded. "Saw it."

Oliver perked up. "Knew you'd figure it out. So?"

Victoria's reply came swiftly. "Blind date?"

"Bingo!"

Victoria smirked at her phone but didn't engage further.

Though she'd skipped Eleanor Whitmore's recent birthday gala, the gossip had reached her - Nathaniel's mother openly approving of Isabella.

Apparently, Melissa Graves had even offered to start wedding preparations whenever the couple was ready.

The absurdity had made Victoria scoff.

Clearly, Nathaniel's mother remained ignorant of Isabella's past with Alexander.

That revelation would undoubtedly shatter any approval.

With Alexander and Julian still silent, Oliver tagged them impatiently.

When they remained unresponsive, he messaged Victoria separately. "Alexander not with you?"

Her reply came moments later. "Business trip. Left this morning."

Oliver had just sent his acknowledgment when Alexander finally surfaced in the chat with a single word: "Noted."
###Chapter 321

Alexander's phone buzzed with another message. "Stuck in a board meeting. You guys continue."

Then his status went offline.

Julian slid into his car and made the same decision. He typed quickly, "Swamped with work. Catch you later."

The chat app closed with a tap.

Seeing both men bow out, Victoria sent her parting shot. "Lunch break. Later."

Oliver had no choice but to let it go.

After her midday meal, Isabella headed to the R&D wing for a strategy session.

Kieran Blackwood sat among the analysts.

She dissected problems with surgical precision, proposing solutions before most noticed the issues. He observed in silence, fingers steepled beneath his chin.

As the meeting concluded, Isabella gathered her tablet. She paused when she caught Kieran's intense gaze. "First day at Sinclair Tech treating you well?" The question was pure protocol.

"Adjusting smoothly." His reply came smooth as whiskey.

A curt nod. She exited without another word.

The week unfolded with Isabella balancing corporate duties while negotiating publishing rights with the AI Quarterly journal.

Friday afternoon found her reviewing R&D metrics. She tapped her intercom. "Victoria, send Mr. Blackwood up."

Three minutes later, a knock announced his arrival.

"Sit." Isabella didn't look up from her screen. "Your algorithm shows marginal efficiency gains. Still falls short of benchmark projections."

She launched into a technical critique.

Kieran absorbed every syllable.

Five days at Sinclair Tech had revealed Isabella's true caliber. The poised executive before him bore little resemblance to his interview assessment.

Yet she showed no curiosity about his transformed demeanor. Nor had she mentioned the yellow roses he'd sent as apology on day one.

As if the gesture never happened.

During interviews, he'd recognized her competence. Now, working under her? She operated on a level that humbled his so-called genius status.

She made Salzburg's top AI researchers seem pedestrian by comparison.

But more crucially—

"Any questions?" Her voice sliced through his thoughts.

Kieran stood. "None."

The dismissal was implicit.

Back at his workstation, his phone vibrated. "So? Made progress with the Ice Queen? Who's she picking—you or Graves?"

Pick between him and Nathaniel?

In Isabella's eyes, he was just another replaceable cog in the R&D machine.

"Negative." He terminated the call mid-data analysis.

The phone lit up again—Victoria this time. He silenced it without glancing at the screen.

"Mommy!" Charlotte launched herself into Abigail's waiting arms.

Abigail embraced her daughter, then smiled at the solemn girl beside her. "Sophia."

Sophia watched Charlotte nuzzle against her mother. "Mrs. Winslow."

Charlotte peered around. "Where's your driver?"

Sophia scanned the pickup lane. No black sedan in sight.

Mothers collected classmates left and right. She usually rode home alone.

It never bothered her before.

Parent pickups were for babies. She'd told herself she didn't care.

Now though...

Abigail noticed Sophia's slumped shoulders. "Everything alright, dear?"

Sophia said nothing.

Just then, her chauffeur pulled up.

A quick wave to Charlotte and Abigail, then she slid into the leather seat.

As the car merged into traffic, Sophia glimpsed Charlotte skipping hand-in-hand with her mother through the rear window.

She exhaled, pulling out her phone. Isabella's contact flashed on screen.

Her thumb hovered.

After three breaths, she dialed Alexander instead.
###Chapter 322

The phone rang only once before Alexander picked up. "School's over?"

"Yes!"

Alexander's voice softened. "Missing your mom?"

"Uh-huh."

"You didn't call her yet?"

A chuckle came through the line. "Go ahead and call. She'll answer today."

Sophia's eyes sparkled. "Really?"

"Absolutely. Call her."

"Okay!"

The moment she hung up, Sophia dialed Isabella's number with trembling fingers.

Isabella froze when she saw the caller ID.

Though they'd met twice recently—once when Eleanor took a fall and was hospitalized, and again at the Graves residence—those encounters didn't count toward their usual monthly visits.

It had actually been over six weeks since they'd properly met.

With a deep breath, she answered. "Sophia, are you—"

"Mom!" The sheer delight in Sophia's voice cut her off mid-sentence.

Isabella's fingers stilled on her mouse.

Two heartbeats passed before she managed to respond. "I'm here. Just finished school?"

"Yes! Mom, where are you? I wanted to call earlier but thought you'd be too busy."

"Dad said you'd definitely pick up today. Are you coming home?"

Isabella exhaled slowly. "I'm still at work. Later I'm heading to Grandma's. Do you want to go there or—"

"Wherever you go, I go!"

"Alright." A pause. "Go to Grandma's first. I'll join you after work."

"Perfect!"

The moment she ended the call, Isabella shut down her computer and grabbed her purse.

Sophia heard the car before it even pulled into the Sinclair driveway.

She sprinted outside and launched herself into Isabella's arms. "Mom!"

"Mmm." Isabella lifted her effortlessly.

Margaret appeared in the doorway, smiling. "Perfect timing, Isabella. Dinner's ready."

"Coming."

At the table, Sophia sat glued to Isabella's side.

After three bites, she blurted out, "You haven't cooked for me in forever! Can you make dinner tomorrow? I miss your food."

The truth stung. Since deciding to divorce Alexander, home-cooked meals for Sophia had become rare. And during Sophia's visits to the Sinclair house, Isabella had always been swamped with work.

"Alright," Isabella agreed quietly.

Their social circle remained oblivious to Victoria's interference, so Margaret and Charles never heard about Sophia's growing attachment to the Kensington woman.

But even before Sophia returned from abroad, the elders had anticipated this possibility.

It displeased them, naturally.

Yet they understood—Sophia was just a child, unaware of the decades-old feud between the Sinclairs and Kensingtons.

When Isabella lost the custody battle, Margaret and Charles feared the separation would erode the mother-daughter bond.

Now, watching Sophia cling to Isabella like ivy to stone, their relief was palpable.
###Chapter 323

After dinner, Sophia mentioned something that made Isabella realize Alexander was away on a business trip.

At around 9:00 pm, while Isabella was showering, her phone rang.

Sophia saw Julian's name flashing on the screen and answered. "Mr. Montgomery."

Hearing her voice, Julian paused briefly. "Sophia."

Before Sophia could continue, Isabella stepped out of the bathroom. Seeing her, Sophia handed over the phone. "Mom, it's Mr. Montgomery."

"Okay." Isabella took the phone, but Julian spoke first. "I hope I'm not interrupting?"

"Not at all."

Julian's voice was calm. "I'm currently out of town, so we'll need to postpone our dinner plans."

"That's fine."

After hanging up, Isabella reached for her towel when she noticed Sophia's curious stare.

"What is it?" Isabella asked.

"Mom, you know Mr. Montgomery too?"

"Yes."

"Oh."

The next morning, Isabella went downstairs to prepare breakfast.

About thirty minutes later, as she returned upstairs, she found Sophia on the phone. The girl immediately rushed over. "Mom, it's Dad."

Isabella took the receiver. "What is it?"

"My return got delayed until Wednesday. Sophia probably won't want to leave the Sinclair residence until then. Could you look after her these next few days?"

Isabella pressed her lips together in silence before ending the call.

On Monday, after dropping Sophia at kindergarten, Isabella headed to work.

A major project deadline loomed, making the entire week chaotic. She often worked past midnight, returning home exhausted.

Though Sophia stayed at the Sinclair residence, their only conversations happened during rushed morning routines.

On Thursday afternoon, Sophia called to announce Alexander's return. That same day after school, she went straight back to the Whitmore estate.

On Saturday, Isabella met Julian and Lily at Sunshine Park.

Seeing her, Julian remarked, "It's been a while."

"Has it?" Isabella hadn't particularly noticed.

Julian studied her face, hesitating before speaking. "You know TechNova has multiple shareholders, correct?"

"Mhm."

"Alexander wants to buy out my shares, along with Oliver's and others', to give to—" He didn't finish, but Isabella immediately knew—Victoria.

She'd witnessed Alexander's indulgence toward Victoria at TechNova firsthand.

She'd once joked he might as well rename the company Kensington Corp. She never imagined he'd actually consider such a move.

TechNova, though relatively new, was valued in the billions. His generosity knew no bounds.

Julian added, "Oliver and I agreed."

"Mhm." She wasn't surprised.

Julian, Oliver, and Alexander had been inseparable since childhood. Their bond explained their compliance.

Julian brought this up because TechNova's ownership change would affect YodaVision's business dealings.

He knew how deeply Isabella had once loved Alexander.

Before learning about Nathaniel, he'd believed she'd moved on. Now, he wasn't so sure.
###Chapter 324

For years, the Kensington family's tech empire had been floundering. Without cutting-edge technology or top-tier talent, their profits had steadily dwindled.

Alexander Whitmore had spent months abroad, leveraging his connections to recruit elite engineers for them. His efforts would likely turn their fortunes around soon.

But none of this concerned Isabella Sinclair. If she still harbored feelings for Alexander, knowing about his generosity would only reopen old wounds.

Julian Montgomery chose silence.

After lunch, they parted ways—Julian had pressing matters to attend to.

By Monday, the transfer of Innovatech's shares to Victoria Kensington was complete.

Isabella and Nathaniel Graves learned of it through an industry group chat the moment the news broke.

Alexander had gifted Victoria a $60 million penthouse. Now, he'd handed her an entire company on Valentine's Day. Isabella had never shared these details with Nathaniel.

Though aware of Alexander's favoritism, Nathaniel had never grasped its staggering extent.

His lips pressed into a thin line. "Damn. That's next-level devotion."

Isabella had processed it days ago. "Let's focus on work," she said flatly.

The next evening, they arrived at a gala already teeming with guests.

Julian and Oliver Westbrook appeared shortly after.

Just as Julian greeted them, Alexander and Victoria made their entrance, flanked by the event host.

Victoria shimmered in couture, every accessory screaming exclusivity.

Innovatech's transfer had sent shockwaves through their circles. All eyes locked onto the couple.

"That's Alexander Whitmore and his girlfriend. You've heard about Innovatech, right? Brilliant CEO, yet even he kneels for beauty."

"Handing over a goldmine like that? Talk about a grand gesture."

"If I were Victoria, I'd be floating. A man who spoils you rotten? Dream come true."

A scoff. "Didn't he have a wife before? Funny how the ex-wife never got this treatment."

"Rumor says he married her out of obligation. No love there."

"Explains why he hid the marriage. Would've stayed secret if not for old Mrs. Whitmore's birthday bash."

Nathaniel and Julian instinctively glanced at Isabella.

Her expression didn't flicker.

Genevieve Kensington had also attended, solely to ambush Julian after months of silence.

Spotting him, she swooped in. "Julian."

He ignored her.

Her smile tightened. Noticing Isabella nearby, she forced a sugary tone. "Julian, Victoria and Alexander are here. Let's join them."
###Chapter 325

Julian Montgomery still refused to acknowledge Genevieve Kensington's presence.

At that moment, an acquaintance approached to greet him. Recognizing both Isabella Sinclair and Nathaniel Graves, the four engaged in lively conversation.

Genevieve stood frozen, utterly excluded. Her face flushed with humiliation until she had no choice but to retreat.

Oliver Westbrook observed the scene from a distance. "Julian seems quite close with them," he remarked, referring to Isabella and Nathaniel.

Victoria Kensington nodded in agreement.

After all, if Julian and Nathaniel were merely business associates, a brief exchange would have sufficed at such an event.

Yet they were deep in conversation.

This suggested genuine friendship was developing.

Victoria assumed Julian valued Nathaniel's professional connections. As for Isabella? She was just decoration.

Hearing Oliver's comment, Alexander Whitmore glanced toward the group but remained expressionless.

Victoria turned away - only to spot Kieran Blackwood entering the grand ballroom.

Alexander followed her gaze.

Dressed in an impeccably tailored suit, Kieran appeared more striking than usual, his aloof demeanor intact.

When Victoria looked his way, their eyes briefly met.

She smiled and started toward him, but Kieran deliberately turned away, entering through a side entrance with his colleagues, completely ignoring her.

Victoria halted mid-step, sighing before turning to Alexander. "He's still upset about me informing his family of his whereabouts. Won't answer my calls. Now he's giving me the cold shoulder in public."

Alexander shrugged. "Youthful temper. It'll pass."

Victoria nodded.

Kieran remained oblivious to their assumptions.

While greeting the host, he caught sight of Isabella and Nathaniel from the corner of his eye.

His grip tightened around his champagne flute.

He hadn't anticipated their attendance.

Isabella wore an exquisite light blue gown that accentuated her figure, the intricate embroidery complementing her quiet elegance. She looked ethereal - pure, flawless, breathtaking.

This marked Kieran's first time seeing Isabella in formal attire. His gaze lingered.

His companion noticed and followed his line of sight. "Damn. Who's that vision?"

Kieran blinked. "Isabella Sinclair."

"No way! That's Isabella? Didn't expect such beauty."

Without responding, Kieran set down his glass and strode toward them.

"Mr. Graves. Ms. Sinclair."

They turned, equally surprised to see him. After brief acknowledgments, Julian inquired, "And this is...?"

Nathaniel performed introductions. "Kieran Blackwood." He summarized Kieran's background before adding, "This is Julian Montgomery."

Recognition flashed in Julian's eyes at the prestigious Blackwood name. "Mr. Blackwood."

Kieran returned the greeting.

As conversation flowed, Kieran's attention repeatedly drifted to Isabella. His expression when looking at her...

Julian noticed. His fingers tightened around his glass. Lips pressed thin, he fixed Kieran with a piercing stare.

Kieran met his gaze.

In that charged moment, mutual understanding passed between them regarding Isabella.

An abrupt silence fell as their eyes locked.

The Novel will be updated first on this website. Come back and continue reading tomorrow, everyone!
###Chapter 326

Neither Julian nor Kieran spoke a word.

Isabella and Nathaniel were engrossed in conversation with other guests, completely unaware of the silent tension between Julian and Kieran.

Since Isabella hadn’t eaten dinner yet, she excused herself after a while and made her way to the buffet area.

Kieran followed shortly after, striking up a casual conversation with her.

Meanwhile, Oliver happened to be near the buffet. When he spotted them, he froze for a second before muttering, "Damn." He quickly turned back toward Alexander and Victoria.

Leaning in, he whispered to Alexander, "That Kieran—I think he’s into Isabella. The way he looks at her… tsk!"

Alexander followed Oliver’s gaze and saw Kieran talking to Isabella.

The way Kieran looked at her—head slightly tilted, eyes warm yet intense—was unmistakably the gaze of a man smitten.

He was treating her with deliberate care, taking the empty plate from her hands and setting it aside before reaching for a slice of cake from the top shelf and placing it gently in her palms.

Alexander arched a brow, mildly intrigued by Kieran’s attentiveness.

Victoria had also glanced their way the moment Oliver spoke.

Kieran’s actions toward Isabella were undeniably tender.

If she didn’t know the truth, she might have actually believed Kieran had genuine feelings for Isabella.

Kieran will pretend to like her first. Once she falls for him, he’ll crush her.

Recalling what Kieran’s friend had said, Victoria turned her gaze back to Isabella, who was now laughing at something Kieran said.

Had she already been charmed by him? Or worse—did Isabella actually think Kieran was sincere?

A faint smirk curled at the corners of Victoria’s lips as she lowered her eyes.

She glanced at Alexander. Seeing his complete indifference despite another man openly pursuing his ex-wife, her smile deepened.

Oliver suddenly remembered something and nudged Alexander. "Oh, right. Isn’t Whitmore Group’s tech division looking to collaborate with YodaVision? Shouldn’t you go talk to Nathaniel?"

Alexander took a slow sip of his wine. "Too many people around him right now. I’ll catch him later."

If Whitmore Group pursued a partnership with YodaVision, Isabella and Alexander would inevitably cross paths more often.

Most women would do everything in their power to prevent their man from working with his ex-wife.

But Victoria?

She merely smiled, unfazed.

Across the banquet hall, Julian was caught up in a discussion with another guest.

When he finally looked over, he saw Isabella and Kieran still deep in conversation. Judging by Isabella’s animated expression, they were getting along far too well.

He had known Isabella for a while now. Though their relationship had improved recently, there had been past tensions between them.

Because of that, she never smiled at him so freely. And she certainly never talked this much.

Julian didn’t know much about Kieran. But in terms of looks alone, the man was undeniably striking.

A shadow flickered in Julian’s eyes.

Turning back to the person he’d been speaking with, he said, "Apologies, I have something to attend to. Let’s continue this later."

With that, he strode straight toward Isabella and Kieran.
###Chapter 327

Julian Montgomery's approach didn't escape Kieran Blackwood's notice.

His lips thinned into a displeased line, eyes turning icy as they landed on Julian.

But Julian pretended not to notice, striding toward them with unwavering confidence.

He stopped directly in front of Isabella Sinclair, facing her squarely. "What are you two discussing?"

Isabella, oblivious to the tension between them, shrugged casually. "Just work-related things."

The ease with which Isabella conversed with Kieran suggested he was highly competent in his field. Which meant, compared to Julian, Kieran shared more common ground with Isabella.

Not to mention Kieran now worked at YodaVision. That gave him far more opportunities to interact with Isabella than Julian ever had.

This realization made Julian's smile falter slightly.

Just as he opened his mouth to speak, Nathaniel Graves approached.

Seeing both Kieran and Julian standing beside Isabella struck him as odd.

But he brushed it off, simply stating, "Everyone's gathered here."

No sooner had he spoken than Alexander Whitmore and Victoria Kensington joined them.

"Mr. Graves," Alexander greeted.

Nathaniel responded with a perfunctory smile. "Mr. Whitmore. What can I do for you?"

Alexander said, "There's a potential collaboration I'd like to discuss. I was wondering if you'd be interested."

Whitmore Group's tech division was a powerhouse in the industry, boasting an impressive portfolio of core patents and cutting-edge innovations.

Their upcoming product had already generated international buzz.

The moment Alexander mentioned collaboration, Nathaniel immediately grasped the implications. Truth be told, it intrigued him.

As one of the nation's leading enterprises, they bore responsibility for elevating domestic innovations onto the global stage.

For their products to truly compete internationally, no single company could do it alone. It required industry-wide cooperation and technological synergy.

So despite Nathaniel's personal distaste for Alexander and reluctance to work with him...

He didn't need to consult Isabella on this matter. He already knew her answer would mirror his own.

"Now isn't the time for such discussions," Nathaniel said smoothly. "If you're serious, come to YodaVision tomorrow at a more appropriate hour."

Alexander wasn't surprised by the response. He chuckled. "I'll see you then."

Nathaniel, visibly annoyed, asked coolly, "Anything else, Mr. Whitmore?"

"No, that's all." Alexander replied before adding, "I won't take up any more of your time."

With that, he didn't spare Isabella another glance, turning to leave with Victoria.

Before departing, Victoria's gaze lingered on Kieran and Julian.

Kieran deliberately turned his face away.

Julian remained silent.

The next morning, as Isabella stepped out of her car at YodaVision, she nearly collided with Alexander and Daniel Prescott, who'd just arrived.

She paused mid-step while closing her car door.

She'd known Alexander would come to discuss the collaboration, but hadn't expected him this early.

"Morning," Alexander greeted upon seeing her.

Isabella didn't respond, turning toward the company entrance instead.

Since leaving Whitmore Group, she'd barely seen Daniel. In his mind, Isabella remained the same woman who once clung to Alexander's every word.

Now, faced with her cold indifference, he found it strangely unsettling.
###Chapter 328

Isabella ignored him, so Alexander didn't press further.

Kieran emerged from the opposite end of the parking structure. Spotting them, he strode directly toward Isabella.

"Morning."

Isabella gave a curt nod. "Morning."

Kieran hesitated briefly before turning to acknowledge Alexander with a detached greeting. "Morning."

Alexander's lips curved slightly. "Morning."

Today's meeting at YodaVision was to negotiate a potential partnership. As a key executive, Isabella should have been the one extending professional courtesies to their prospective collaborator.

Yet after Kieran's exchange of greetings, Isabella never once glanced back at Alexander. She marched forward with purposeful strides, showing no intention of fulfilling her hosting duties.

Was this coldness stemming from Alexander's past entanglement with Victoria?

The thought made Kieran steal another look at Alexander.

Surprisingly, the billionaire showed no visible reaction to Isabella's blatant disregard.

Kieran decided not to comment.

The trio entered the elevator in heavy silence.

Inside the confined space, Kieran positioned himself beside Isabella.

Her stiletto heels clicked against the metal floor. The subtle floral notes of her perfume mixed with the crisp scent of her pressed blazer. Even in minimal makeup, she carried an effortless elegance that commanded attention.

Kieran found his gaze lingering on the delicate curve of her jawline.

Only when he noticed Alexander observing him did he abruptly look away.

Alexander merely arched an eyebrow but remained silent.

The elevator chimed as they reached YodaVision's executive floor.

Isabella exited without sparing Alexander a backward glance. Kieran, needing to discuss urgent R&D matters, followed closely behind.

Alexander watched their retreating figures before turning toward the reception area, where an assistant guided him to the conference room.

Twenty minutes passed before Nathaniel finally arrived.

"Apologies for the delay, Mr. Whitmore." Though the words were polite, his tone carried distinct indifference, his expression carefully neutral.

Daniel, standing beside Alexander, stiffened slightly. In all his years serving the Whitmore empire, he'd never witnessed anyone treat his employer with such blatant disregard.

Alexander, however, simply extended his hand. "No trouble at all."

Nathaniel disliked Alexander intensely, but business was business. He wanted this meeting concluded with maximum efficiency.

They dove straight into negotiations about YodaVision's next-generation chip requirements for advanced computing and AI inference capabilities.

While YodaVision already partnered with InnovaTech through previous agreements, those had been handled by Alexander's subordinates. This marked their first direct business discussion.

At Margaret Sinclair's birthday gala last year, Nathaniel had overheard Alexander's conversation with Frederick Aldridge and gained some insight into his technical knowledge.

But today's three-hour deep dive revealed the true extent of Alexander's expertise.

No matter how complex the topic Nathaniel raised, Alexander engaged with flawless comprehension. His questions demonstrated profound understanding of semiconductor architecture and neural network optimization.

By the third hour, Nathaniel found himself reluctantly impressed. The man's grasp of AI hardware might even rival his own.

The realization irritated him more than he cared to admit.

Alexander checked his watch. "Shall we reconvene after lunch?"

Nathaniel gave a terse nod. "Fine."
###Chapter 329

Alexander casually suggested, "Why don't we grab lunch together? My treat."

Nathaniel had zero interest in dining with him. "Thanks for the offer, but I'm exhausted today. I'll just grab something quick from the company cafe. You're welcome to do whatever you prefer."

Alexander flashed his charming smile. "The cafe sounds perfect actually. Mind if we join you?"

Nathaniel couldn't refuse.

Ten minutes later, they entered The Grandeur's corporate cafeteria.

The arrival of the company CEO - combined with Alexander's striking good looks - immediately drew all eyes toward them.

Isabella was already seated at a table, deep in conversation with Kieran Blackwood from R&D. She didn't notice Nathaniel's entrance.

It wasn't until she heard gasps and murmurs that she glanced up - only to see not just Nathaniel, but Alexander Whitmore himself standing there.

Hearing the commotion, Kieran turned to look as well.

Nathaniel, Alexander, and Daniel all noticed Isabella and Kieran sitting together.

Seeing Isabella engaged in what appeared to be an intimate conversation with another man, Alexander showed no reaction whatsoever.

Nathaniel's gaze briefly met Isabella's. A silent understanding passed between them - she would stay out of this, and he'd handle the situation.

Isabella simply nodded and looked away.

From the moment Nathaniel agreed to this collaboration, he'd planned to shield Isabella from any unnecessary interactions with Alexander.

After collecting their food, Nathaniel deliberately chose a table on the opposite side of the cafeteria.

Alexander made no objection.

Throughout the meal, Alexander never once glanced in Isabella's direction.

Daniel, however, stole several looks at her. He'd heard rumors about Isabella and Nathaniel, though he wasn't sure what to believe.

Earlier that morning, Isabella had been ice-cold toward Alexander. Now she acted like he didn't exist.

She'd clearly moved on.

What surprised him more was Alexander's complete indifference to seeing Isabella with another man.

But then again, it shouldn't have.

Daniel had witnessed firsthand Alexander's contempt for Isabella - and his undying devotion to Victoria Kensington.

With that thought, he finally stopped watching her.

By the time Nathaniel and Alexander finished eating, Isabella had already left.

Alexander departed The Grandeur around 3 PM for another appointment. The collaboration details still needed finalizing.

Over the next several days, Alexander returned to The Grandeur multiple times. But aside from that first brief encounter, he and Isabella never crossed paths again.

To any outside observer, they appeared to be complete strangers.

Only Nathaniel knew the truth - that these two were actually married. As news of the Fleming Tech-Grandeur partnership spread through the company, whispers followed.

One afternoon, as Isabella entered a conference room, she overheard a female colleague gushing: "I just saw Alexander Whitmore in the elevator! God, he's even more gorgeous in person!"

"Rich, handsome, and completely devoted to his girlfriend. Did you hear? He just gifted her InnovaTech! Can you imagine? If I..."
###Chapter 330

Isabella Sinclair had relatives visiting from Salzburg, and they'd come to Baumond specifically to see her.

That morning, just as she wrapped up a meeting, Margaret called asking her to join them for lunch.

She stood waiting by the elevator when Joseph Whitfield - the newly appointed general manager of YodaVision - approached with Alexander Whitmore and Daniel Prescott.

Joseph greeted her first. "Ms. Sinclair."

Isabella gave a curt nod.

Joseph wasn't certain if Alexander and Isabella knew each other. Though Alexander had been at YodaVision for days negotiating a collaboration, their paths had never crossed.

Noticing Isabella didn't acknowledge Alexander, Joseph assumed they were strangers. "Ms. Sinclair, this is Mr. Whitmore of Whitmore Group."

Then to Alexander, "This is Ms. Sinclair from YodaVision's R&D department."

Without glancing at Alexander, Isabella stated flatly, "We're acquainted."

Alexander smirked at Joseph. "No introductions necessary. We know each other... intimately."

Joseph blinked, looking between them.

Intimately? That's not the impression I'm getting.

He cleared his throat awkwardly. "Ah, I see."

Isabella remained silent.

Alexander chuckled but said nothing more.

Joseph finally understood - Isabella was deliberately snubbing Alexander. Just like Nathaniel Graves would.

He wondered what history existed between these three.

But Alexander wasn't someone to take lightly.

With a major collaboration pending, both Isabella and Nathaniel treated him with icy indifference. Stranger still - Alexander didn't seem to mind.

Joseph wasn't sure whether to feel relieved or concerned.

As he debated breaking the silence, Alexander's phone rang.

"I'll be right down," Alexander answered before stepping into the elevator.

Joseph forced a smile. "Ms. Kensington picking you up for lunch again? You two seem close."

Alexander opened his mouth to respond when another call interrupted him.

When the elevator doors opened, Isabella strode out without a backward glance.

Outside in the parking lot, she spotted Victoria Kensington waiting by a car.

Their eyes met.

Victoria's gaze was glacial.

Isabella quickly looked away, heading to her own vehicle.

Victoria only softened when she saw Alexander emerging from the building.

As Isabella started her car, she noticed Victoria handing her keys to Daniel before getting into Alexander's car.

She drove off without another glance.

At the restaurant, after seeing Margaret's guests off, Isabella was about to leave when she spotted Dominic Fairchild exiting.

His brows immediately furrowed at the sight of her.

The last time he'd seen her was when Alexander had gone to YodaVision looking for her. He didn't know how things stood between them now, but he'd heard about the Whitmore-YodaVision collaboration.

Would this rekindle old flames?

His expression betrayed his thoughts.

Without acknowledging him, Isabella drove away.

Dominic returned to his office where negotiations with the Kensington family were underway.

At 3 PM, his secretary announced, "Mr. Fairchild, Ms. Kensington is here."

Dominic paused. "Ms. Kensington?"

"Yes. She said Mr. Kensington is ill, so she's representing him for the collaboration discussion."

Dominic's eyes lit up. He hurried to the meeting room.

Victoria apologized immediately. "My father isn't feeling well, so regarding our collaboration-"

Dominic waved it off. "Perfectly understandable."

He couldn't hide his delight, which Victoria noted with a faint smile.

After their discussion, Dominic seized his chance. "Ms. Kensington, would you care to have dinner?"

Victoria declined politely. "I have training for an upcoming race. Perhaps another time."

Dominic knew of her racing career, though he'd only seen recordings. He longed to watch her compete live.

But if she was training today, Alexander would undoubtedly accompany her.

With that thought, he dropped the subject. "Another time then."

After Victoria left, Simon Fairchild called. "Sebastian Ashford is free tonight. Want to meet up?"

Dominic had an idea. "Let's skip the bar. How about something more exciting?"

Simon sounded intrigued. "What did you have in mind?"

"Let's go watch some car racing."

"Racing?" Simon's interest was piqued. "Now that sounds like fun!"

After learning Victoria's training location, they had dinner before heading to the racetrack with Sebastian.
###Chapter 331

Dominic Fairchild and Simon Fairchild settled into their seats just as the practice race kicked off.

Neither knew much about motorsports, leaving them unsure who to cheer for.

The announcer's voice revealed that Racer 38, Victoria Kensington, and two others were the top contenders.

The twist? Victoria was the only female driver on the track. Naturally, all eyes were on her.

She executed two breathtaking overtakes on sharp turns that sent the crowd into a frenzy.

Simon couldn't contain himself. "Damn, she's got nerves of steel! That was insane!"

Dominic, aware Simon didn't recognize Victoria's true identity, simply smirked at the outburst. Victoria dominated both practice rounds.

"Who is this Victoria Kensington?" Simon exclaimed. "I need to meet her!"

The camera then panned to Victoria removing her helmet - revealing her face. Simon's jaw dropped.

"That's Victoria Kensington? No freaking way!"

His shock quickly turned to dismay. "I was literally about to ask her out. And she's Alexander Whitmore's girlfriend?"

Game over indeed.

The realization hit like a ton of bricks. Slumping in his seat, Simon muttered, "So this is the kind of woman Alexander gets to date?"

Victoria spotted them in the stands.

She raised an eyebrow at Sebastian Ashford's unexpected presence.

Approaching their section, she flashed a smile. "Mr. Fairchild, Mr. Ashford - I didn't take you for racing fans."

Dominic responded first. "We weren't, honestly. You mentioned the event, and we had free time. Thought we'd see what the hype was about."

He added, "Impressive driving out there. Two first-place finishes? Congratulations."

Victoria thanked him with a nod.

Sebastian spoke up. "Congratulations."

"Thank you," she replied, turning to him. "It's been a while, hasn't it? When I spotted you earlier, I thought I was seeing things."

"Work's kept me busy," Sebastian said. "Not much downtime lately."

Victoria tilted her head. "I heard you're a fighter pilot, Mr. Ashford. Compared to flying jets, doesn't racing seem tame?"

"Different thrills," Sebastian countered. "No need to compare. You were spectacular out there, Ms. Kensington."

Dominic interjected. "Speaking of, where's Mr. Whitmore? Didn't he come watch you race?"

"Business kept him away today," Victoria explained. "But he'll be here for the main event."

She added, "If you're free, I'd love to see you there too."

Dominic nodded. "I'll make time."

And he meant it - he wanted to witness her skills firsthand. Though Alexander's inevitable presence... complicated matters.

Saturday morning found Isabella Sinclair awake before dawn.

She booted up her laptop to review model data when her phone lit up.

Kieran Blackwood's name flashed on the screen.

Days earlier, he'd proposed an innovative project concept she'd found promising. She'd already allocated resources and was personally overseeing its progress.

Frequent collaboration had led to exchanging numbers.

Assuming it was work-related, she answered.

But Kieran had called for personal reasons - he wanted Baumond activity recommendations.

"What I enjoy might not suit you," Isabella said. "Don't you have local friends to ask?"

"They suggested things that don't interest me."

A pause. Then, "I hear typing. Working?"

"Yes."

"Seriously? You're spending the entire weekend at home?"

Eyes still on her screen, Isabella replied, "I'm taking my grandmother to a play tonight."
###Chapter 332

"A play?" Kieran Blackwood's eyebrows shot up. "What sort of play? Those are practically extinct around here."

Isabella Sinclair hesitated. "It's a vintage performance. Probably not your style."

His gaze turned razor-sharp. "Try me. Just because I grew up abroad doesn't mean I don't appreciate Salzburg's cultural heritage. I've been meaning to explore more local traditions."

Cornered, Isabella reluctantly gave him the theater's address.

Within minutes, Kieran secured an online ticket.

His phone buzzed with an incoming call. "Hey moneybags," his friend's voice crackled through. "We're hitting The Grandeur tonight."

"Can't," Kieran cut in. "Already booked for the evening."

After ending her call with Kieran, Isabella remained swamped with work until late afternoon.

A glance at her calendar reminded her - Lily Montgomery's birthday approached. She hesitated briefly before dialing Julian Montgomery.

Julian had been craving more reasons to connect with Isabella.

Ever since discovering Kieran's interest in her, his urgency had intensified.

Yet beyond their professional collaborations and Lily, they lacked natural touchpoints.

With no current projects requiring him at YodaVision, he'd struggled to find excuses to reach out.

And now that Alexander Whitmore was collaborating with YodaVision...

Julian froze mid-step exiting his car when Isabella's name flashed on his screen.

He answered instantly.

"Hope I'm not interrupting, Mr. Montgomery," Isabella began.

"Not at all," Julian replied, his stern features softening. "Everything alright?"

"I want to make Lily's birthday gift myself but worry she might not like it. Thought I'd get your input."

Warmth flooded Julian's chest at her consideration for his niece. "Lily adores you. Anything thoughtful from you will delight her."

Knowing Lily's personality, Isabella conceded this was likely true. "Any specific suggestions?"

Julian paused. "Do you bake?"

"I do," Isabella brightened. "That solves it. Thanks."

"My pleasure. Reach out anytime if you need anything."

"Will do."

As Julian finally entered the restaurant, Oliver Westbrook and Victoria Kensington were already seated with Alexander.

"Took you long enough," Oliver remarked.

Julian chuckled. "Important call."

Victoria studied Julian's unusually buoyant mood.

Since Josephine Winslow joined his company, she'd made multiple lunch invitations. Each time, Julian politely declined citing workload.

Once or twice, she believed him.

But this many refusals?

Was he still bitter about her matchmaking attempts with Genevieve Kensington? Did he assume every outreach was another setup?

That evening, after dining at the Sinclair estate, Isabella prepared to leave with Margaret Sinclair for the y when Frederick Aldridge called.

"At the Sinclair residence?" he asked.

"Yes."

"Urgent matter. Be ready in ten - car's coming."

"Understood."

Frederick's tone brooked no argument.

When Margaret learned of the summons, she waved Isabella off cheerfully, saying she'd attend with Caroline Sinclair instead.

Exactly ten minutes later, a black sedan arrived.

En route, Isabella learned the urgency - the government-backed project she'd spearheaded faced critical deadlines. With Frederick entangled elsewhere, only she possessed the technical expertise to keep it on track.

Her phone was confiscated upon arrival at the secure facility.

The next forty-eight hours became a blur of nonstop work.

On the third day, as she finally grabbed lunch in the cafeteria, Sebastian Ashford approached her table.
###Chapter 333

Sebastian Ashford blinked in surprise when he spotted Isabella Sinclair. "Ms. Sinclair?"

Isabella gave a polite nod. "Hello, Mr. Ashford."

His lips curved into a smile. "Are you stationed here now?"

She shook her head. "No, my mentor requested my assistance with something."

That made him pause.

Very few had the clearance to bring in external personnel.

Then it clicked—her close ties to Nathaniel Graves, despite their strictly professional relationship.

His eyes widened slightly. "Your mentor... is Frederick Aldridge?"

"Yes," she confirmed with a faint nod.

So she really was one of Frederick's protégés, just like Nathaniel.

The realization hit him like a delayed shockwave.

If she was Frederick's student, suddenly everything made sense.

Why Nathaniel had publicly credited her for YodaVision's breakthrough at the gala.

Why his father had watched her so intently—not just at his grandfather's exhibition, but also during Dominic Fairchild's forum.

His father must have known all along.

But being Frederick's student alone wouldn't warrant that level of scrutiny.

Unless—

Unless those groundbreaking YodaVision projects were hers.

The possibility struck him like lightning.

Sebastian stared at her, momentarily speechless.

Isabella was quiet, composed, never drawing attention to herself. He'd never have guessed someone so unassuming could be behind such revolutionary work.

They found seats in the cafeteria.

"How long will you be on base?" Sebastian asked.

"Not sure. Depends on my mentor."

A brief silence. Then she added, "Feels like ages since we last met outside work. Is training keeping you that busy?"

Sebastian gave a wry smile. "Pilots don't exactly get vacations."

His break was short. After a quick exchange, he excused himself for duty.

Two days later, he saw her again during an AI-human combat drill.

Live simulation—human pilots against AI-controlled jets.

Once data was collected, Isabella and the research team dove into analysis, tweaking algorithms based on combat dynamics.

When Sebastian entered the lab, she was deep in focus, barely noticing him.

Only when he approached did she glance up, offering a polite nod before returning to her screen without pause.

Isabella stayed nearly ten days before leaving.

She departed the base under cover of night, arriving home at dawn.

When she powered on her phone, twenty missed calls lit up the screen.

Kieran Blackwood. Julian Montgomery. Sophia Whitmore. Even Alexander Whitmore had tried reaching her.

She could guess why Sophia and Alexander called.

But Kieran had called first—and most frequently.

So she dialed him back.

He answered instantly. "Finally done?"

"Yes," she said. "Was there an issue? Is it resolved?"

"There was. Everything's handled now."

Ten days ago, he'd shown up at the theater and found her missing. Her phone went straight to voicemail.

When she didn't appear at work Monday, he'd feared the worst.

He'd gone straight to Nathaniel, who assured him it was a family matter.

Now, hearing her voice, he finally relaxed.
###Chapter 334

Isabella dialed Julian's number, recalling he'd tried reaching her two days prior.

"Lily just wanted a video call," he explained casually. "Nothing urgent."

With work looming, they kept the conversation brief.

Hanging up, Isabella grabbed her keys and headed to the office.

Fate had Nathaniel pulling into the parking lot simultaneously.

"Back so soon?" he greeted with a teasing smile as they exited their vehicles.

Isabella grinned. "Couldn't stay away."

Alexander's sleek sedan rolled in then, Victoria seated beside him.

Instead of parking, he halted directly before them.

"Good morning, Mr. Graves," they chorused as they emerged.

Nathaniel's smile vanished.

Perfect. Just perfect.

Without acknowledging them, he gripped Isabella's elbow and steered her away.

Alexander and Victoria seemed unbothered.

Once the couple disappeared, Alexander handed his keys to Victoria, opening her door with a murmur. "Drive safe."

Victoria's lips curved as she watched him—then flicked a glance toward Isabella's retreating form. "Always."

Inside the lobby, Nathaniel glanced back while waiting for the elevator.

No sign of Alexander.

Still playing devoted boyfriend in the parking lot?

The elevator doors slid shut. "Arriving together at this hour," he muttered. "Are they cohabiting now?"

Isabella had no confirmation.

But the morning pickup spoke volumes—Alexander bypassing his chauffeur to personally collect Victoria. Never an inconvenience where she was concerned.

Their bond appeared unshakable.

Lily's birthday loomed in two days.

That evening, Isabella selected a plush pink rabbit at the mall.

The elevator doors opened to reveal Victoria and Beatrice ascending.

Victoria's gaze landed on the stuffed animal, clearly assuming it was for Sophia.

Amusement tugged at her lips.

Since aligning with Victoria, Sophia had abandoned such childish toys.

Yet here Isabella was, still attempting to woo her with fluff? Pathetic.

Victoria looked away, bored.

Beatrice barely acknowledged Isabella—just a cursory glance before doting on her granddaughter.

Her affectionate pat on Victoria's arm broadcasted one truth—only this granddaughter held her favor now.

Isabella remained unfazed.

She continued to the parking garage and drove off.

Dawn had barely broken when Frederick called.

After listening, Isabella responded, "Understood."

She immediately contacted Julian.

"An emergency came up for tomorrow morning. I'll prepare Lily's cake in advance—could you deliver it with her gift? And please apologize for my absence?"
###Chapter 335

Julian Montgomery felt a twinge of disappointment when Isabella Sinclair declined Lily's birthday invitation, but he understood perfectly.

"Work comes first," he said smoothly. "Lily will understand."

The moment Isabella ended the call, her phone buzzed again with a video request from Julian's number.

Only one person would video call her using Julian's phone.

Lily's beaming face filled the screen before Isabella could even greet her.

"Good morning, Ms. Sinclair!" The girl's excitement was palpable. "Uncle Julian told me you can't come to my party tomorrow. That's okay! We can celebrate together another time!"

Without missing a beat, Lily continued, "He said you're baking me a special cake and got other presents too! Thank you so much! Grandma says when someone gives you gifts, you should treat them to dinner. There's this amazing new place - are you free tonight? Uncle Julian and I want to take you!"

Isabella couldn't suppress her smile. "Tonight works perfectly. Thank you, Lily."

"No need to thank me! It's what I should do!"

With school calling, Lily quickly handed the phone back to Julian after their rushed goodbyes.

They finalized dinner plans before disconnecting.

At the office that morning, Isabella informed Nathaniel Graves about needing to return to the research facility the following day.

Nathaniel gave her shoulder a reassuring pat. "You've been pushing hard. I'll handle the R&D team coordination - you focus on your priorities."

"Appreciate it."

Isabella typically worked past eight, but today she began shutting down her workstation at six sharp.

Kieran Blackwood paused at her office doorway, eyebrows lifting at the unusual sight of her packing up. "Early departure?"

"Prior engagement," she explained, then added, "I'll be away for a few days starting tomorrow. Any issues, go straight to Nathaniel."

"Again?"

Isabella murmured an affirmation.

Kieran remained silent, though his expression tightened. She'd just returned, and now she was leaving again.

Thirty minutes later, Isabella pulled into the valet circle of Julian's chosen restaurant.

As she stepped from her car, Julian and Lily arrived simultaneously.

"Ms. Sinclair!" Lily came sprinting over.

Isabella crouched to embrace the girl, then surveyed the luxury vehicles crowding the entrance. "This place is certainly popular."

Julian chuckled. "The owner mastered the art of exclusivity. It's become the power lunch capital."

"Impressive."

"Shall we?" Julian gestured toward the entrance.

"Of course."

Nearby, Victoria Kensington emerged from her chauffeured sedan while finishing a call.

She snapped her phone shut, turned toward the restaurant entrance - and froze.

The sight of Isabella, Julian, and Lily walking together as a unit stopped her dead in her tracks.
###Chapter 336

For a heartbeat, Victoria thought her vision was playing tricks on her.

But the scene before her was too real to deny.

Isabella was walking hand in hand with Lily, while Julian gazed at her with that unmistakable warmth in his eyes.

This wasn’t an illusion. This wasn’t a dream.

Isabella was here—with them.

The way they moved together so naturally, how it was Isabella holding Lily’s hand instead of Julian—

This wasn’t their first time sharing a meal as a trio.

A realization struck Victoria like lightning.

Could Isabella be the woman Lily had been gushing about?

No. Impossible. That made no sense.

Then her traitorous mind dredged up the memory from last year. When Julian had come to InnovaTech for that meeting, he’d sought Isabella out to speak with her privately.

And at recent events, whenever Isabella and Nathaniel were present, Julian never just exchanged pleasantries and moved on. He lingered.

Victoria had assumed it was out of respect for Nathaniel’s position.

Now? She wasn’t so sure.

Could Julian actually have feelings for Isabella?

No.

Absolutely not.

Victoria stood frozen, refusing to accept what her instincts screamed at her.

Julian had known Isabella for years. If she were his type, he would’ve noticed her long ago. Why now?

Besides, what was so special about Isabella anyway?

Maybe she was overthinking this.

Even if Isabella was the woman Lily adored, that didn’t mean Julian was involved. Right?

Reginald, noticing Victoria’s stillness, approached. "Are you alright, Victoria?"

Victoria snapped back to reality. She shook her head. "I’m fine."

"Let’s go inside."

"Alright."

The next morning at 8 AM, Julian’s phone rang. It was Isabella.

When he arrived at the address she’d sent, she was already waiting outside, holding a cake box in one hand and an oversized stuffed bunny in the other.

The moment she spotted him, she handed them over.

Julian accepted them, eyeing the cake. "You must’ve been up early—this looks homemade."

She had, in fact, been awake since before dawn.

But all Isabella said was, "I went to bed early. It was no trouble."

"Thank you. Lily will love this." His gratitude was genuine. The effort she’d put in was obvious.

He glanced at the modest apartment building behind her. "Is this where you’re staying now?"

He knew she’d moved out of Alexander’s place but hadn’t known where until now.

"Yes," Isabella said. "But I’m in a hurry. I should go."

Julian nodded. "Of course."

Isabella turned and walked back toward the building.

Julian didn’t look away until she disappeared inside. Only then did he get into his car.

Since Sophia wanted to celebrate Lily’s birthday, Alexander had reserved a private dining room at The Grandeur. That afternoon, when Lily came home from school and saw Isabella’s handmade cake and the giant bunny plush, her face lit up.

She was so thrilled she refused to let go of the toy, clutching it all the way to the restaurant.

When Julian and Lily arrived, Alexander, Victoria, and Sophia were already there.

As Julian opened the door to the private room, Victoria’s gaze locked onto the stuffed bunny in Lily’s arms. She recognized it instantly—the same one she’d seen Isabella carrying at the mall two days ago.

So Isabella really was the mysterious woman Lily kept mentioning?

Lily was practically glowing with excitement. She barely stepped inside before rushing to Sophia, holding out the plush like a trophy.

"Look what I got for my birthday, Soph! Isn’t it the cutest?"
###Chapter 337

Sophia didn't actually dislike pink.

If something was adorable or charming, she usually appreciated it too.

So when Lily grinned and proudly displayed her plush toy, Sophia smiled warmly and nodded. Yes, it's absolutely precious.

Then she handed her carefully wrapped gift to Lily.

Lily thanked her politely before bubbling with excitement. I also got a homemade birthday cake! It's lavender-colored and gorgeous!

She turned eagerly to Julian. Uncle Julian, will you help me open it?

Oliver raised an eyebrow in amusement. She didn't just bake a cake but brought presents too. Clearly went all out. What's taking you so long, Julian?

The fact that Isabella woke at dawn to bake for Lily despite her hectic schedule spoke volumes about her affection for the little girl.

Even with Alexander and Sophia present, Julian couldn't suppress a tender smile at the mention of Isabella.

Yesterday, Victoria had doubted Julian's feelings for Isabella, but witnessing that soft expression now confirmed it - he was completely smitten.

No wonder he'd stopped answering her calls immediately like he had these past months.

Sometimes he wouldn't answer at all.

Victoria had assumed he was simply busy.

But honestly, what did Isabella have that captivated him so?

Victoria pressed her lips together, unable to comprehend Julian's attraction.

The meaning behind Julian's unconscious smile was unmistakable, and Oliver immediately pounced on it. Finally admitting you're into her? he teased.

Alexander, noticing Julian's expression, mirrored the smile.

The private lounge buzzed with cheerful energy.

Soon, Lily began making her birthday wish.

After she finished, Julian helped cut the cake.

Sophia received the first slice.

Her face brightened after the first bite. This is amazing!

It tasted exactly like Isabella's baking.

Come to think of it, she hadn't seen Isabella in weeks.

Surely Isabella would bake for her birthday too, right?

Oliver wasn't fond of sweets, yet after sampling the cake he conceded, Remarkably delicious. Your girl's got serious talent, Julian. Lucky bastard.

Julian's smile faltered momentarily as he shot Alexander a meaningful glance.

Alexander was eating the cake too.

But he merely nibbled at it silently.

Initially, Victoria had refused to try the cake knowing Isabella made it.

After hesitation, she finally took a small bite.

It wasn't bad, admittedly.

??

Hearing Oliver's praise, a bitter thought struck her - maybe Julian liked Isabella because she fit the perfect homemaker mold.

Noticing how Julian looked at Alexander, realization dawned.

Normally, Victoria wouldn't have thought twice about Julian's glances.

But now she understood their significance.

Alexander and Isabella were still married.

Did Julian truly believe having a wife like Isabella meant happiness?

He must envy Alexander while secretly hoping for their quick divorce so he could pursue Isabella properly.

The shocking truth hit Victoria - Julian's feelings ran deeper than she'd imagined.
###Chapter 338

Isabella reached the military base and immediately immersed herself in work.

The AI-human combat simulations needed critical data upgrades.

Another round of drills was scheduled for tomorrow morning.

That evening, Isabella headed toward the nearly empty mess hall.

She'd just picked up her tray when Sebastian Ashford entered.

He paused mid-step upon seeing her, then flashed a warm smile. "When did you arrive?"

"Yesterday," she answered. "Finished training?"

"The drills this year are brutal."

Modern aerial combat had evolved beyond human versus human - now it was man against machine.

Pilot training methodologies had undergone radical transformations in recent years.

"Stressful?" she asked.

The AI's processing speed and analytical capabilities allowed it to identify enemy weaknesses instantly, formulating counterstrategies with inhuman precision.

Even seasoned pilots like Sebastian felt the pressure against such opponents.

He exhaled sharply. "Challenging. But it's making us better."

The AI's ability to simulate countless combat scenarios provided unparalleled training opportunities.

"You're pushing your limits," Isabella observed.

"Same as you researchers," Sebastian countered. He noticed her eating quickly. "Heading back to work?"

She nodded.

Frederick Aldridge had assigned her multiple urgent tasks.

Her phone buzzed with his message summoning her to R&D immediately.

Placing her utensils down, she stood. "I need to go. Enjoy your meal."

Sebastian nodded. "See you around."

Isabella left the base Sunday morning around ten.

Checking her phone at home, she saw missed calls from Sophia and Charles.

She only returned Charles' call.

He teased her mercilessly about never visiting unless summoned.

Knowing she owed him, Isabella changed clothes and drove to the Montgomery estate.

Alexander's car sat in the driveway when she arrived.

She ignored it, stepping out just as Sophia came running.

"Mommy!"

A month had passed since their last meeting.

Isabella stroked her daughter's hair. "When did you get here, sweetheart?"

Sophia clung to her hand, beaming. "Just now!"

Inside, Alexander and Charles sat drinking tea in the parlor.

Victoria was conspicuously absent.

Charles smiled warmly. "Isabella! Come join us."

Alexander gave her a brief glance before looking away.

She sat beside Charles, who studied her critically. "You've lost weight."

The hectic schedule at base had taken its toll.

Before she could respond, Alexander silently poured her tea.

Isabella nodded her thanks.

Charles announced, "I received two premium lobsters yesterday. How should we prepare them?"

She sipped the fragrant tea. Just as she opened her mouth—

Alexander cut in dryly, "No invitation for me? Such favoritism, Charles."
###Chapter 339

Alexander didn't bother engaging with Nathaniel.

Isabella remained equally silent.

No one acknowledged his presence, yet Nathaniel showed no sign of discomfort. Noticing Isabella's teacup was nearly empty, he reached for the teapot and refilled both hers and Alexander's cups.

Throughout tea and lunch, Isabella's conversations were reserved for Charles and Sophia.

It was unclear whether Nathaniel sensed her reluctance to speak with him or simply had nothing to say himself.

By afternoon, as they prepared to leave the Montgomery estate, Isabella realized she and Alexander hadn't exchanged a single word despite sharing the same space for nearly four hours.

Charles noticed it too.

But Alexander showed no interest in breaking the silence, and Isabella had long since stopped trying.

Charles hadn't invited them today to play mediator. Since neither seemed inclined to bridge the gap, he saw no reason to intervene.

Sophia tugged at Isabella's sleeve. "Are you coming home tonight, Mom?"

She added softly, "It's been so long since you've stayed with us."

Charles sighed quietly at the question.

Alexander remained expressionless.

Isabella gently cupped Sophia's face. "I have plans tonight, sweetheart. I won't be coming home."

"Oh..." Sophia's shoulders slumped. "Are you going back to Grandma's? Or another business trip? I called you last week but couldn't get through. When I went to Grandma's house, she said you were traveling for work."

Isabella hadn't known about Sophia's visit to the Sinclair residence.

She had indeed planned to have dinner with Margaret and the family later.

The thought of Sophia going there alone just to see her made Isabella hesitate.

"I'm heading to Grandma's tonight," she found herself saying. "Would you like to join me?"

"Yes!"

Sophia's face lit up instantly—she'd been afraid her mother would disappear into work again.

Isabella glanced at Alexander, who immediately understood. "So you're staying at Grandma's tonight too?"

"Uh-huh!"

Alexander smiled. "I'll have someone pick you up from school tomorrow."

"No!" Sophia protested quickly. "I want to go back to Grandma's after school tomorrow too."

Alexander chuckled, his eyes flickering to Isabella. "That's not my decision to make—you'll have to ask your mom."

Sophia wrapped her arms around Isabella's waist. "Are you leaving Grandma's again tomorrow?"

"Yes."

"Oh..."

After finalizing arrangements, they exchanged pleasantries with Charles before departing.

The next morning, after dropping Sophia at school, Isabella headed to work.

The elevator doors opened to reveal Alexander and his assistant, Daniel. The three rode up in silence, maintaining their carefully constructed facade of strangers.

Around 11 AM, Alexander left the building. Shortly after, Nathaniel stopped by upon hearing of Isabella's return.

As their meeting concluded, Isabella recalled the morning's awkward elevator ride. "Is the deal with Whitmore Industries still pending?"

"It's finalized," Nathaniel replied. "But there were complications regarding responsibility allocation. He came by to renegotiate some terms."
###Chapter 340

Nathaniel's message popped up first. "Ran into him again this morning?"

Isabella sighed as she typed her reply. "Unfortunately."

Being trapped in divorce proceedings while constantly bumping into her ex? Exhausting didn't even begin to cover it.

But with their companies now officially partnered, these awkward encounters were unavoidable.

After two hectic days at the office, Wednesday arrived. Henry tagged both Isabella and Nathaniel in the group chat.

Nathaniel was already airborne, en route to another province. After getting briefed, Isabella gathered her team and headed to InnovaTech with several engineers.

This marked her first return since Alexander had transferred control to Victoria.

As they exited their vehicles, Dominic stepped out of a nearby car.

His existing partnership with InnovaTech remained unchanged despite the leadership shift.

The only difference? Instead of dealing with Alexander, he now worked directly with Victoria. Their eyes met briefly before both quickly looked away.

The moment they entered InnovaTech's lobby, Victoria came into view.

She appeared cornered by yet another overenthusiastic admirer - this one brandishing a ridiculously oversized bouquet of crimson roses.

Facing the entrance, Victoria spotted Isabella and Dominic immediately.

This was their first encounter since learning about Julian's feelings for Isabella.

Victoria's expression darkened instantly.

Noticing Victoria's irritation, Dominic approached. "Problem?"

Isabella didn't waste a glance on them. Whatever drama unfolded wasn't her concern. She marched straight toward the elevator with her team.

Minutes ticked by. The elevator remained delayed, but Victoria's voice carried across the lobby. "Thanks for intervening."

"Anytime."

Dominic's voice held concern. "Doesn't this building have security? Why wasn't he stopped?"

Victoria exhaled wearily. "He bribed them."

"That's unacceptable," Dominic frowned. "So he can just show up whenever?"

"He won't," Victoria said coolly. "I'll have Alexander handle it later."

Dominic lowered his gaze. After a pause, he murmured, "Understood."

By then, they'd caught up to Isabella's group just as the elevator doors opened.

Everyone entered together.

The YodaVision employees accompanying Isabella recognized the new management situation. They also knew Victoria. One offered a polite greeting.

Now officially in charge, Victoria acknowledged them with a nod. "Appreciate your team's hard work."

"Happy to assist," came the prompt reply.

Victoria maintained her usual poised demeanor.

Then there was Isabella.

Dominic noticed her icy expression as she deliberately ignored Victoria.

The engineers had never witnessed direct interaction between the two women, despite multiple visits.

Now, watching Isabella treat both Victoria and Dominic as invisible - with neither attempting to greet her either -

The tension became palpable.

The elevator descended into uncomfortable silence.
###Chapter 341

The elevator doors slid open. Isabella stepped out without sparing a glance at Victoria or her entourage. She had more important matters to attend to than their petty drama.

Hours later, she was deep in discussion with Maxwell when she noticed the group standing at her department's entrance. Eleanor, Diana, Penelope, and Genevieve Kensington had arrived unannounced.

Maxwell caught her brief glance. "That's Ms. Kensington's family," he whispered.

Isabella merely nodded, returning her attention to her tablet.

The Kensington women had clearly noticed her too. Their expressions ranged from indifference to smug satisfaction as they took in her presence at InnovaTech.

Genevieve led the charge, her heels clicking sharply against the marble floor. The others followed like obedient ducklings.

Maxwell immediately stood to greet them. "Madam Kensington, Mrs. Kensington, Ms. Kensington."

Eleanor and Diana offered practiced smiles. "We heard about the autonomous vehicle system issues," Eleanor said, deliberately ignoring Isabella. "Has everything been resolved?"

"Progress is excellent," Maxwell assured them. "We'll have it fixed by this afternoon."

Diana patted his arm. "Such dedication." Her tone dripped with false warmth.

That's when Genevieve zeroed in on Isabella. "How interesting," she drawled. "I leave InnovaTech for barely a month, and suddenly the systems keep malfunctioning." Her lips curled. "One might think the service provider is... incompetent."

The insult hung in the air like poison gas.

Maxwell opened his mouth to protest, but Isabella beat him to it. "Terminate the contract if you're dissatisfied." Her voice was ice. "The exit clause is quite clear."

Genevieve's face flushed. She knew better than anyone that YodaVision Co. dominated the AI sector. Challenging them would be corporate suicide.

"You arrogant little—" Genevieve spat. "One would think you own YodaVision."

Isabella didn't blink. "Draft the termination papers. Sign them. Then we'll see who has authority here."
###Chapter 342

Breaching contract terms without valid justification required substantial compensation as stipulated. Isabella Sinclair wouldn't hesitate to sever ties with InnovaTech if YodaVision received proper restitution.

Genevieve Kensington's fingers twitched with the urge to draft termination papers immediately.

But she lacked executive authority at InnovaTech. Even acting for Victoria Kensington carried risks - Nathaniel Graves openly supported YodaVision. The entire Kensington clan knew maintaining good relations with him remained paramount.

Terminating YodaVision's contract would provoke Nathaniel's wrath. This single fact made Victoria reconsider any impulsive decisions. Diana Kensington and Beatrice Kensington shared identical concerns.

Diana's lips curled in distaste at Genevieve's hesitation. Even Eleanor Kensington's gaze turned glacial when assessing Isabella. None anticipated such bold defiance from the YodaVision representative.

Eleanor clearly dismissed Isabella as insignificant. "Sharp tongue," she sneered. "But does your signature hold legal weight?"

Maxwell Sterling hadn't expected Isabella to confront the Kensingtons so directly. Tension thickened the air as he reached for her arm, attempting mediation.

Isabella shook him off, locking eyes with Eleanor. Her stare carried more frost than the older woman's. "Test me," she challenged. "Draft the termination. Let's see."

Eleanor's lips thinned. Since Victoria's engagement to Alexander Whitmore, no one from either family had dared humiliate her. Isabella's audacity stung particularly deep.

The confrontation escalated until Victoria's arrival interrupted them.

Isabella seized the narrative before others could speak. "Ms. Kensington insulted YodaVision's competence, claiming that's why we conduct frequent maintenance here. I offered contract termination if InnovaTech finds us inadequate."

She continued relentlessly, "When I suggested drafting termination papers, Ms. Kensington questioned my authority. I invited her to verify my signing power. This woman—" Isabella pointed at Eleanor, "—claims my signature lacks validity. I say prove it."

"They insult my company, yet falter when challenged," Isabella concluded. "What's your verdict, Ms. Kensington?"

Victoria's mouth tightened. Isabella's confidence suggested genuine signing authority. Terminating now would incur massive penalties and delay their autonomous vehicle launch - unacceptable losses for InnovaTech.

Isabella pressed her advantage when Victoria hesitated. "So the mighty Kensingtons talk big but lack conviction? You disparage YodaVision freely, yet balk at consequences. Typical bully behavior."

Victoria's icy retort came: "You're exaggerating a minor issue."

"Minor?" Isabella countered. "Your cousin slandered my company. Your mother backed her. Now you blame us for reacting? I've heard praises of your compassion and integrity. Clearly, reputation exceeds reality."

The air crackled with tension as Isabella delivered her final blow: "The Kensington name carries less honor than claimed."
###Chapter 343

Victoria Kensington and Eleanor Kensington's expressions darkened at Isabella Sinclair's words. Under normal circumstances, they would have forced Genevieve to apologize immediately to prevent the situation from escalating and damaging their reputation.

But Isabella had thrown down an unexpected challenge - offering them the freedom to terminate their contract with YodaVision if they truly believed her team was incompetent.

This bold statement shifted the entire dynamic. Suddenly, the focus wasn't on Genevieve's misbehavior, but on whether Isabella actually held decision-making power at YodaVision.

The Kensingtons had assumed they could handle the apology after establishing Isabella's lack of authority. They never anticipated she'd turn their own strategy against them so effectively.

Neither YodaVision's technical team nor InnovaTech staff were privy to the longstanding feud between Isabella and the Kensingtons. To these outsiders, the argument appeared simple: the powerful Kensington family was defending their spoiled relative despite her clear wrongdoing, then trying to undermine Isabella's professional credibility.

Nathaniel Graves and the others watched in shock. While Genevieve's unpleasant nature was no surprise, Victoria, Eleanor, and Beatrice had always presented themselves as refined, reasonable women. This public display of pettiness shattered that carefully cultivated image.

Victoria recovered first. "My apologies, Ms. Sinclair. Alexander and I value our partnership with YodaVision immensely - we wouldn't have initiated it otherwise. We have complete confidence in your team's capabilities."

She continued smoothly, "Our family has always indulged Genevieve, and old habits die hard. We spoke out of turn, but meant no disrespect. I hope you'll overlook this momentary lapse."

Isabella arched an eyebrow. "So you expect me to pretend this never happened?"

"Name your terms," Victoria conceded. "Within reason, we'll comply with whatever you require to make amends."

The ball was back in Isabella's court. "Shouldn't you be the one proposing appropriate reparations, Ms. Kensington?"

Victoria hesitated. "Of course. Allow me to host lunch for your entire team as a gesture of goodwill—"

"We're on a tight deadline," Isabella interrupted. "Save your business lunches for Mr. Graves." With that, she turned back to her work, dismissing the Kensingtons without another glance.

After offering perfunctory apologies to the remaining YodaVision staff, Victoria led her family away. Once out of earshot, Genevieve exploded.

"This was never about some stupid technical error! That witch is still bitter Alexander gifted InnovaTech to Victoria. She deliberately blew this out of proportion to humiliate us!"

Eleanor's voice turned icy. "Her motives don't concern me. What matters is your reckless behavior. You're not a child anymore, Genevieve. Start acting like an adult."

Victoria's expression remained stormy as they walked away, the weight of this public defeat settling heavily upon her shoulders.
###Chapter 344

Isabella carved out time that afternoon to brief Nathaniel on the incident. "You'll need to redirect the conflict's focus," she advised.

He caught her meaning instantly. A slow grin spread across his face. "Understood. I know exactly how to handle this."

Moments later, Nathaniel's phone buzzed with Victoria's call. He answered with deliberate casualness.

"Mr. Graves, I assume you're aware of this morning's... misunderstanding."

His chuckle was razor-sharp. "Ms. Kensington, are you referring to when your family slandered my team's competence? Or perhaps when they accused us of breaching contract terms?"

Victoria backpedaled. "My apologies, Mr. Graves. Genevieve acted inappropriately. I'll ensure—"

Nathaniel cut her off. "More concerning is how you dismissed my employee for defending our company's reputation. Tell me, does that sound like professional conduct to you?"

His voice turned glacial. "Your actions constitute defamation against Sterling Innovations. Collaboration requires mutual respect—something you've clearly forgotten."

The line crackled with tension. "Effective immediately, I'm terminating our contract. Expect legal documentation regarding reputational damages."

Victoria's breath hitched. She'd anticipated placating him over Genevieve's tantrum—not becoming the primary target. "This is hardly worth dissolving our partnership over—"

"My schedule is packed, Ms. Kensington. I'll await your formal response." The call disconnected with finality.

Nathaniel immediately dialed Isabella. "Done. Full recording secured."

"Excellent work," she murmured.

Isabella had orchestrated this precisely. She knew Victoria would underestimate Nathaniel's retaliation, mistaking this as a simple personnel dispute.

Now they held irrefutable evidence of Victoria knowingly disparaging a business partner—a career-ending misstep in their circles.

Nathaniel snorted. "Honestly, Alexander shoulders the blame here. He owns twelve companies—why hand Innovatech to Victoria?"

His voice darkened. "He never considered how this would put you in an impossible position."

Isabella remained expressionless, though the truth of his words resonated. Some betrayals cut too deep to acknowledge.
###Chapter 345

Victoria was mid-conversation with Nathaniel when the call came through. She sat in the plush private dining room of The Grandeur, surrounded by Eleanor, Beatrice, and their entourage, awaiting their meal.

Eleanor noticed the sudden pallor that washed over Victoria's face as she ended the call. "What happened?" she demanded. "What did Nathaniel say?"

Victoria's fingers tightened around her phone. "He's terminating our partnership with YodaVision. And demanding compensation for reputational damages."

Gasps echoed around the table - from Beatrice, Genevieve, and the others.

Genevieve slammed her palm on the table. "We issued a proper apology! That scheming witch Isabella promised this would blow over if you just spoke to Nathaniel!"

Eleanor's expression turned glacial as realization dawned. "Isabella orchestrated this."

Genevieve blinked. "What?"

Victoria's voice was hollow. "She wanted to sabotage our autonomous vehicle launch by destroying the YodaVision partnership."

The implications hit like a freight train. In the competitive autonomous vehicle market, a single misstep could cripple their product's viability. Finding another partner with YodaVision's technological edge would be nearly impossible - and prohibitively expensive.

Legal battles would drain resources while competitors surged ahead. The potential losses were catastrophic.

Genevieve looked like she'd been struck. None of them had anticipated this nuclear option - least of all Victoria, who'd naively believed an apology would suffice.

"He can't do this!" Genevieve cried. "We have to stop him!"

Beatrice, ever pragmatic, suggested, "Re-negotiate. Increase compensation. Businessmen never turn down profit."

Victoria remained silent. The unspoken truth hung heavy - Nathaniel was willing to absorb financial losses to punish them on Isabella's behalf. That revelation stung more than the business implications.

Eleanor analyzed coldly: "Legal proceedings would be protracted. Victory isn't guaranteed for them."

Genevieve brightened. "Exactly! If they can't win in court-"

"But discovery alone would delay our timeline," Victoria countered. "And if they prevail? We'd miss the entire product cycle."

The table fell silent. Even Diana looked shaken. "Isabella plays the meek lamb so well. I never suspected she had this kind of ruthlessness."

The bitter truth settled over them - Alexander had long chosen his side. They'd underestimated Isabella, assuming her powerless. Now she'd struck where it hurt most.

Eleanor's gaze locked onto Victoria. "You need to speak with Alexander."

The unspoken truth lingered - their only hope lay in the man who'd already walked away.
###Chapter 346

Victoria shared the same concern, but the truth was, they'd started this entire debacle themselves.

Until now, she'd carefully maintained her poised demeanor around Alexander. If he discovered this incident, would he think she and her family had been bullying Isabella? That could permanently damage her carefully cultivated image in his eyes.

Eleanor understood Victoria's worries perfectly. No one knew better than her how crucial maintaining appearances was - the foundation for keeping a man's devotion forever.

Beatrice grasped it too. Alexander adored Victoria precisely because she represented something irreplaceable to him. With careful handling, this might not leave lasting scars. Still, it remained an unnecessary misstep.

She shot Genevieve a sharp look. "You're an adult now. You must learn to control your words and actions."

If mishandled, this incident could deal a devastating blow to both families.

"But I—" Genevieve began weakly.

Initially, she'd dismissed it as trivial. Now the situation had spiraled far beyond her expectations.

Her hands trembled visibly. It had been years since she'd received such a stern reprimand. Though humiliated, she had no choice but to accept responsibility.

"I understand. I'll be more careful with my behavior."

Beatrice fell silent, having said her piece. Diana disliked seeing Genevieve chastised, but facts were facts - her niece had ignited this entire mess.

If this jeopardized InnovaTech's autonomous vehicle ambitions, the financial repercussions would be catastrophic. Compared to those potential losses, Genevieve's bruised ego meant nothing. That's why Diana held her tongue despite her protective instincts.

The truth would surface eventually anyway. If YodaVision insisted on terminating their partnership, Alexander would inevitably learn of it. Only a matter of time.

Victoria knew this. Eleanor and Beatrice understood it too.

When their food arrived, no one touched their silverware. The cheerful atmosphere from earlier had evaporated completely.

Victoria's grip tightened around her phone. After a tense silence, she inhaled sharply and excused herself to make a call.

Alexander answered immediately. "Hello?"

"Alexander," she said, her voice strained. "There's been... an unpleasant situation."

She recounted everything, then added, "Isabella provoked us deliberately earlier. I lost my composure when Mother was insulted. That's how things escalated."

He waited until she finished before responding. "You've miscalculated. If they sue, they won't just demand contract termination and reputation damages. They'll pursue breach penalties too."

"Your actions jeopardized the entire collaboration. Termination would cost YodaVision significantly - and Nathaniel will make you pay for that."

Victoria froze. "Nathaniel didn't mention this during our call."

"He omitted it intentionally. Downplaying the consequences makes you think there's still room to maneuver. It's a tactic to catch you unprepared."

"He wants you to call back, groveling with apologies. He's gathering ammunition against you."

Alexander continued, "If I'm right, Nathaniel likely recorded your entire conversation."

Victoria's breath hitched. The realization struck like lightning. "You mean Isabella orchestrated this? She wanted me to give them recorded evidence?"

"Precisely."

Her lips pressed into a thin line. She'd underestimated Isabella's strategic thinking. Now she grasped the true gravity of her predicament.

After a weighted pause, she ventured, "I need your—"

"I can't promise a solution," Alexander interrupted bluntly. "YodaVision has government backing. My hands are tied regarding Nathaniel."

What about the Sinclairs then?

She considered voicing it but held back. Unless Alexander suggested it himself, she couldn't risk appearing vindictive. Still, she wondered if he'd contemplate that angle without prompting.

Their conversation continued briefly before ending.

When Victoria returned, Diana pounced immediately. "What did Alexander say?"

"He'll mediate, but can't guarantee Nathaniel will back down from termination."

Eleanor cared more about another matter entirely. "Did he comment on the incident itself?"

The autonomous vehicle project paled in importance compared to Alexander's feelings. What truly mattered was whether he still adored Victoria.

She didn't need to spell it out.

Warmth blossomed in Victoria's chest as she answered. "He comforted me and promised to help resolve it. Not a single reprimand."

Eleanor visibly relaxed. Beatrice and Diana exhaled in relief.

Genevieve's mood lifted instantly. "See? Alexander's devotion runs deep. He'd never scold you over something so trivial."

Naturally, Victoria basked in his unwavering affection. Yet today's events had cost her both dignity and financial security.

+25 8047

"Let's set Alexander aside for now," she said coolly. "Genevieve, I won't tolerate a repeat of this. Understood?"

Victoria had never spoken with such icy finality before. Genevieve shrank back, goosebumps rising on her arms. "U-understood. I'll think twice before speaking."
###Chapter 347

That same afternoon, Isabella's phone buzzed with Alexander's call shortly after she arrived at The Grandeur headquarters. InnovaTech stood to lose millions if their partnership dissolved.

Seeing his name flash across her screen, she instantly knew his purpose. Her finger hovered over the decline button.

Two more attempts. Two more ignored calls. Then Nathaniel's phone lit up instead.

Nathaniel answered on the second ring, cutting straight to the chase. "Let me guess - this is about InnovaTech?"

"Correct." Alexander's voice carried through the line. "Name your price, Mr. Graves."

"Not happening, Mr. Whitmore. Victoria crossed a line no business partner should ever cross." Nathaniel's tone turned glacial. "Unless you have other matters to discuss?"

"Is there truly no room for negotiation?"

"None." Nathaniel's response brooked no argument. "My legal team and I will be handling this personally. I suggest you refrain from harassing my employees. Any further attempts would only prove you share Victoria's poor judgment and disrespect for professional boundaries."

"Under those circumstances, continuing our partnership would be impossible."

Alexander couldn't touch Isabella directly, but the Sinclair family remained vulnerable. While Nathaniel and Isabella could protect them, unnecessary collateral damage was best avoided.

Nathaniel's warning served dual purposes - shielding Isabella from harassment while simultaneously protecting her family through veiled threats about their ongoing collaboration.

"Consider how this might escalate," Nathaniel continued, "if our partnership suffers unexpected complications that attract...unwanted attention."

The unspoken implications hung heavy between them. Fleming Tech's high-profile project against their international competitors had been publicly announced months ago. National pride rode on its success, with The Grandeur as their ideal partner.

If news broke that Alexander prioritized defending Victoria over this flagship project? The shareholder backlash alone would drown him. The reputational damage would be catastrophic.

Nathaniel didn't need to spell out the domino effect - plummeting stock prices, investor lawsuits, boardroom mutiny. Alexander could connect those dots himself.

A humorless chuckle came through the line. "Message received, Mr. Graves."

Satisfied his point landed, Nathaniel delivered his parting shot. "Any further questions?"

"None."

The call disconnected. Nathaniel immediately dialed Isabella, who answered before the first ring completed.

"Alexander just called."

"I know. I declined his calls. Did he reach you?"
###Chapter 348

Alexander had called just minutes ago. Isabella mentioned casually.

Nathaniel smirked. "I knew it. You were his first call."

Both had anticipated Victoria would seek Alexander's help, and that he might target the Sinclair family for her sake.

Meanwhile, Alexander had also predicted they might threaten him by jeopardizing the partnership between Whitmore Tech and YodaVision.

That's why he reached out to Isabella first—hoping to negotiate. But she shut him down immediately. So he turned to Nathaniel instead.

As the official head of YodaVision, Nathaniel handled the discussion. It was more appropriate for him to deal with the matter.

This also revealed Alexander's true intentions: setting Isabella up for Victoria, believing her to be meek and easily manipulated. The realization ignited Nathaniel's fury.

Still, concern laced his voice. "How are you holding up?"

She remained composed. "Perfectly fine. How was your business trip? Did the deal go through?"

"Smooth as silk."

They exchanged a few more words before ending the call.

InnovaTech's legal team answered to Oliver. By afternoon, news broke about the terminated partnership between YodaVision and InnovaTech.

That evening, Oliver met friends in a private dining room. He learned Alexander had spoken to Nathaniel—and that Nathaniel wouldn't budge on canceling the deal.

Oliver cursed, echoing Diana's earlier words. "Isabella's always been quiet and modest. Never struck me as the scheming type."

Then he added bitterly, "Then again, she drugged you and played innocent afterward. Should've known she wasn't as pure-hearted as she seemed."

Julian opened his mouth to respond, but Oliver cut in, "Is there really no other way?"

Alexander sighed. "Not right now."

A heavy silence fell before Oliver muttered, "If Julian and I hadn't given up our InnovaTech shares, we could've negotiated with Nathaniel directly. Might've changed things."

But it was too late. Without shares, they had no leverage in the YodaVision-InnovaTech dispute.

Victoria sat quietly, stealing glances at Julian. Oliver had defended her tirelessly, while Julian hadn't uttered a word.

He didn’t care to help her at all. Her lips pursed in displeasure.

With matters at this impasse, the partnership's termination seemed inevitable.

Naturally, Reginald and Beatrice caught wind of the upheaval. Upon learning Alexander and Julian couldn't resolve it, Reginald declared, "I'll talk to her myself."

Meaning Isabella.

Eleanor's expression remained indifferent. "I'll join you."

Beatrice started to speak, but Victoria interjected, "It's pointless. Alexander said Nathaniel and Isabella would see it as harassment. That'll only complicate the court case."

The Kensington and Shaw families' faces darkened at her words.
###Chapter 349

Genevieve stood frozen, utterly speechless. She never imagined even Alexander Whitmore couldn't fix this mess.

Her voice trembled as she protested, "This makes no sense! How can Isabella Sinclair and Nathaniel Graves drag us to court and cancel our partnership over some harmless teasing? That's ridiculous!"

Victoria Kensington's expression darkened. "I had our legal team review the contract between InnovaTech and YodaVision Co. Clause 12 explicitly allows termination if either party damages the other's reputation."

"But this incident barely scratches their reputation!" Genevieve argued desperately.

"Normally, yes," Victoria admitted through gritted teeth. "A public apology and compensation would've sufficed. But—"

Reginald Kensington cut in sharply. "If you'd forced Genevieve to apologize immediately when this started, Nathaniel wouldn't have grounds to terminate. Instead, you defended the insult and accused Isabella of overreacting when she stood up for her team."

He slammed his palm on the table. "You handed Nathaniel the perfect justification to claim breach of trust. In business, sometimes all it takes is one well-timed conflict blown out of proportion to achieve an agenda."

Genevieve swallowed hard. "But Victoria apologized to Isabella as soon as she realized—"

"And now it looks like damage control," Reginald snapped. "Too little, too late. They'll argue we only apologized because termination hurts us."

Genevieve's throat went dry.

"Is Nathaniel absolutely refusing to reconsider?" Reginald demanded. "There must be some way to salvage this."

Their only hope was changing either Isabella or Nathaniel's mind. The former seemed impossible, but perhaps the latter...

Victoria shook her head. "He was adamant on the phone." The unspoken truth hung heavy in the room - Nathaniel was doing this for Isabella.

They had nothing to offer him. Not even Alexander's influence had swayed him. The termination would devastate InnovaTech.

Despite Nathaniel's firm stance, Victoria wasn't ready to surrender. She called repeatedly that evening, getting only voicemail. The next morning, she went to YodaVision Co. to intercept him.

Isabella arrived first, spotting Victoria in the lobby. Their eyes locked. Victoria's hands clenched into fists, her expression icy. She'd underestimated Isabella this time. Never again.

Without acknowledgment, Isabella turned and entered the elevator.

Kieran Blackwood arrived shortly after, noticing Victoria immediately. He'd heard about yesterday's incident at InnovaTech, though news of the termination hadn't spread through YodaVision yet.

As he moved toward the elevators, Victoria called out sharply, "Kieran!"

He paused, turning with raised eyebrows. "Yes?"

"I'm here to see Mr. Graves. Will he be in this morning?"

Kieran shook his head. "Mr. Graves is traveling. He won't be in today."
###Chapter 350

Nathaniel was away on business.

Isabella was deep in thought when Kieran casually asked, "Anything else?"

She shook her head. "You've been at YodaVision for a while now. How's everything going?"

"Good," he replied curtly. "If that's all, I'll head upstairs."

Kieran turned and walked away without hesitation.

Isabella frowned as she watched him leave. His steps were decisive, his posture rigid.

Kieran was clearly still upset about her revealing his whereabouts to the Kensington family. He'd been ignoring her calls for days.

Running into him today, she'd hoped his response meant he was over it. But his demeanor remained frostier than before.

She forced a smile. He just needed more time.

Her phone rang abruptly. An unknown number. The caller identified himself as Nathaniel Graves' attorney, here to discuss termination details of their collaboration.

Isabella's expression darkened.

Nathaniel wouldn't take her calls, yet sent a lawyer? There would be no salvaging this situation now.

With that realization, she strode out of the lobby.

Shortly after Isabella left, Julian Montgomery entered YodaVision on official business. Hearing of his arrival, Isabella immediately left her office for the conference room.

Moments later, Kieran came looking for her. Finding her office empty, he inquired and learned she was meeting with a business partner.

Assuming it was routine, he nearly walked away - until he heard it was Julian.

He froze. Then pivoted toward the conference room.

Inside, Isabella and Julian were mid-discussion when a knock interrupted them. Expecting her secretary, Isabella was startled when Kieran entered.

"Kieran? What-"

"I need to speak with you." Though addressing Isabella, his gaze locked onto Julian.

"Not now," she said firmly. "Later."

Kieran noted the professional distance between them, the presence of others. He nodded. "Understood."

Turning to Julian, he offered a polite nod. "My apologies for the interruption."

Julian studied him silently, understanding exactly why he'd come. Kieran exited swiftly.

The meeting resumed. As Isabella discussed technical details with Jonathan Sterling, Julian's attention remained fixed on her.

He didn't blame Isabella or Nathaniel for defending themselves after the InnovaTech incident.

Yet terminating the collaboration seemed extreme. The Kensingtons had been wrong, but the response felt disproportionate. Almost as if they wanted Victoria to suffer maximum consequences.

Which raised questions.

Was this about Alexander? Did Isabella still resent Victoria for taking him?

If so... did that mean Isabella still had feelings for Alexander after all this time?

Julian stared so intently that Isabella finally noticed. "Mr. Montgomery? Is something wrong?"
###Chapter 351

Isabella Sinclair watched as Julian Montgomery snapped out of his thoughts, offering her a faint smile before shaking his head. "It's nothing," he murmured.

That afternoon, after concluding business discussions with Julian, Nathaniel Graves called Isabella.

Nathaniel's voice was crisp through the phone. "Just got an update from our lawyer—Victoria Kensington still refuses to terminate the contract. She's offering a hefty compensation fee for reputational damages, but I declined."

A pause. "Since negotiations failed, I've instructed legal proceedings."

Isabella's response was measured. "Understood."

Then Nathaniel added, "Alexander Whitmore is coming to the office tomorrow to finalize details. Joseph Whitfield will handle most of the meeting, but there's one document requiring your signature."

In other words, she'd have to face Alexander tomorrow.

Isabella exhaled. "Got it."

The next afternoon, Alexander and Daniel Prescott arrived at YodaVision.

As Nathaniel had mentioned, Joseph Whitfield greeted them first. Midway through the meeting, Isabella received a message from Joseph and made her way to the conference room.

Joseph must have explained her role—stepping in for Nathaniel to review and sign the contract. Neither Alexander nor Daniel reacted when she entered.

She greeted Alexander formally. "Mr. Whitmore."

Alexander shook her hand without comment, his expression unreadable.

Isabella skimmed the document, clarifying a few terms before signing swiftly. "Looking forward to our collaboration."

Alexander's reply was equally professional. "Likewise."

Her task complete, Isabella prepared to leave. She turned to Joseph. "I have other commitments. Mr. Whitfield, would you mind handling the rest with Mr. Whitmore?"

Just as she stood, Alexander checked his watch. "Join me for dinner tonight?"

Before she could refuse, he added, "I'll have Sophia brought along."

Joseph blinked. The invitation had seemed polite—until that last sentence.

Suddenly, Alexander's tone registered as oddly familiar, as if they shared history.

And who was Sophia?

Isabella assumed this was about Victoria. By mentioning Sophia, was Alexander ensuring she wouldn’t decline?

Once, that might have stung. Now, her voice stayed cool. "Apologies. I’m unavailable."

She left without another glance, her exit frostier than intended.

Joseph frowned, glancing at Alexander—only to catch the faintest smirk, as if her rudeness amused him.

Daniel, aware of the InnovaTech debacle, scoffed internally. He’d never respected Isabella, and this petty workplace drama only deepened his disdain.

Joseph escorted Alexander out, baffled. The dynamic between Isabella, Nathaniel, and Alexander was... unusual.

Casual, yet charged.

And Alexander didn’t seem to mind at all.

Not interesting at all.

Very interesting.

Very interesting indeed.
###Chapter 352

The moment Isabella stepped back into her office, her phone lit up.

Sophia was calling.

Remembering Alexander's words in the meeting about dinner plans that would include Sophia, she stared at the screen without answering.

Three consecutive calls went unanswered before a text popped up.

Mom, I have a fencing competition next month. Can you come to my practice session tomorrow morning?

Isabella's grip on the phone tightened.

Since Alexander took Sophia to Salzburg two years ago, she'd missed countless milestones.

She didn't know what classes Sophia was taking. Had no idea about her extracurricular activities.

Before filing for divorce, she'd tried asking Sophia about these things. But her daughter had shut her out.

If not for this text, she wouldn't have known Sophia was learning fencing at all.

And a competition? That was completely new information.

She'd missed so much of her daughter's life already.

The phone screen blurred as she lost herself in thought.

A knock at the door snapped her back. "Come in."

Kieran Blackwood entered with work documents. When it came to business, he was all professionalism.

Tomorrow was Saturday.

After finalizing their discussion, he hesitated. "I saw an incredible ballet performance last month."

"There's another show this weekend. Would you like to join me?"

Sophia's text flashed in her mind. "I have plans tomorrow," she declined. "Rain check?"

Disappointment flickered in his eyes. "Of course."

Another message arrived. Mom, please answer me.

Isabella typed quickly: I'll be there tomorrow. Send me the time and location.

Kieran took the hint and excused himself.

Sophia's call came through immediately. "Mom! You're really coming tomorrow?"

Isabella hummed in confirmation.

"So when are you coming home tonight?" Sophia's voice bubbled with excitement.

"Not tonight." Isabella focused on her computer screen. "Just text me the practice details. I'll meet you there."

Sophia stood in the grand foyer of the Whitmore estate, watching the staff bustle about.

She couldn't remember the last time her mother had walked through these doors.

The realization stung. But tomorrow's plans lifted her spirits. "Okay! Dad will send you the info!"

Isabella paused. "Alright."

"You're home now?"

"Just got back."

"Good." Another pause. "I need to get back to work. Take care, sweetheart."

"You too, Mom!"

The line went dead.
###Chapter 353

The call with Sophia ended abruptly. Isabella stared at her phone screen for a long moment before setting it down. Exactly twelve minutes later, Alexander's text arrived.

Just two lines. A time. An address. No pleasantries. No explanations.

Isabella arrived at the elite fencing academy thirty minutes early the next morning. She watched through the glass doors as a black sedan pulled up exactly four minutes before the scheduled time.

Only the driver emerged with Sophia. Alexander was conspicuously absent.

"Mommy!" Sophia's face lit up when she spotted Isabella waiting. Small fingers immediately tangled with hers, pulling her toward the entrance.

The buzzing of her phone interrupted them. Nathaniel's name flashed on the screen.

"One moment, sweetheart." Isabella squeezed Sophia's hand. "I need to take this."

Sophia nodded eagerly. "I'll go find Coach Ethan!"

The call was brief - just routine updates about their joint tech venture. By the time Isabella hung up, Sophia hadn't gone far.

Coach Ethan was kneeling to tie his shoe when he spotted Sophia. "Miss Whitmore! You're early today." His eyes darted around. "No Mr. Whitmore or Ms. Kensington?"

Sophia beamed. "Mommy brought me today!"

Isabella froze in the doorway. The words hung between them like an unspoken challenge.

The coach's gaze snapped to Isabella, his expression shifting to polite surprise. "You must be Mrs. Whitmore?"

"Mom!" Sophia corrected loudly, bouncing on her toes.

"Ah." Understanding dawned in Coach Ethan's eyes as he extended a hand. "My apologies. Sophia's mother, then."

Isabella accepted the handshake. She could see the calculations happening behind the coach's professional smile. The assumptions forming. The conclusions being drawn.

For months, it had always been Alexander or Victoria - sometimes both - accompanying Sophia to lessons. The coach knew Victoria was Alexander's current... companion. But not the child's mother.

The natural assumption? Divorce. Or worse.

Isabella watched the moment Coach Ethan decided to tiptoe around the elephant in the room. Instead, he launched into praise. "Sophia shows remarkable promise. With her current progress, she could easily place in the top three at next month's regional championship."

Before Isabella could respond, Sophia tugged her sleeve. "Mommy, come help me change!"

The private changing room smelled of leather and antiseptic. Isabella helped Sophia into her protective gear, adjusting each strap with meticulous care. The white fencing jacket made her daughter look impossibly small yet strangely formidable.

When training began, Isabella leaned against the observation window. Coach Ethan had been an Olympic medalist in his prime. His instruction was crisp, precise, demanding.

But Sophia - Sophia was revelation.

Her footwork was lightning quick. Each lunge carried surprising power for someone so small. The way she parried attacks showed reflexes bordering on precognitive. There was an elegance to her movements that went beyond training - something innate.

For one dizzying moment, Isabella could see her daughter years from now, standing atop some international podium, foil raised in victory.

A future she wouldn't be part of.

After thirty-seven minutes of intense drills, Sophia came bounding over, cheeks flushed. "Did you see, Mommy? Did you see me?"

Isabella took the proffered towel, dabbing at Sophia's damp forehead. "You were magnificent."

Coach Ethan approached, wiping his own brow. "She's a natural."

"Thank you for your guidance." Isabella kept her tone even. "Though I suspect her talent would shine under any coach."

The man chuckled. "True enough. But credit where it's due - Mr. Whitmore had her well-trained before she ever walked through our doors."
###Chapter 354

The coach didn't spell it out, but Isabella could read between the lines.

Truth be told, she'd already suspected Sophia's sudden interest in fencing stemmed from either Alexander or Victoria's influence.

But she refused to dwell on it.

Though she'd relinquished custody and wouldn't interfere with Sophia's future, the girl remained her daughter—her own flesh and blood. Even as distance grew between them, Isabella still wished for Sophia's success.

If fencing benefited her, that was enough. The inspiration behind it mattered little.

Isabella didn't watch Sophia's entire training session.

As practice neared its end, she was checking something on her phone when a shadow fell beside her.

She glanced up to find Alexander's intense gaze fixed upon her. Meeting his eyes briefly, she looked away.

"What research are you conducting?" he inquired.

She pocketed her phone without answering.

Alexander seemed poised to say more when Sophia's session concluded. The girl ripped off her fencing mask and sprinted over. "Papa!"

He smiled, tousling her damp hair. "Finished?"

"Yes!" Sophia beamed, then thrust her towel at Isabella. "Mama, could you...?"

After wiping her daughter's face, Sophia peered up hopefully. "I'm starving. Shall we all have lunch?"

"Certainly," Alexander agreed.

Sophia turned to Isabella. "Mama, what would you like?"

Isabella folded the towel neatly. "I have prior engagements. You two enjoy your meal."

Sophia's face fell.

This wasn't unexpected—how many times had Mama declined their invitations before?

But today felt different. Mama had stayed all morning. Maybe...

Her lower lip trembled as she whispered, "Alright."

Alexander intervened smoothly. "Join us. I won't mention... certain topics."

InnovaTech wasn't the only reason for her refusal. "No, you go ahead," she said firmly.

Dining with Sophia alone was one thing—but with Alexander present? Unnecessary.

He studied her for a moment before nodding. "As you wish."

Sophia's eyes welled up, her small hands clenching.

Isabella hesitated, then gently smoothed Sophia's hair. "Next time I'm free, just us two."

The promise barely lifted Sophia's spirits, but she managed a tiny nod.

Having said her piece, Isabella collected her bag.

Sophia panicked at her mother's departure. She grabbed Isabella's wrist desperately. "Mama! Will you come to my tournament next month?"
###Chapter 355

In Sophia's world, there was no space for her, Alexander, and Victoria to exist together.

She had specifically asked Isabella to attend her competition without extending the invitation to Victoria. The message was clear—she understood how things stood between them.

On an important day, Sophia chose her mother. But Isabella didn't feel the satisfaction she once would have.

The competition was set for the following weekend.

Weekends were usually free for Isabella. And when a child competed, it was a significant event for any family. Parents naturally prioritized their children.

In the past, Isabella would have done exactly that—Sophia would have been her first priority. Everything else would have waited. But now...

She wasn't blind to the hopeful look in Sophia's eyes. Yet, her response was vague. I'll see when the time comes. If nothing urgent comes up, I'll be there.

Over the past six months, Sophia had called Isabella countless times, making so many requests that she had learned to recognize the pattern.

When Isabella used phrases like when the time comes or if, it almost always meant she wouldn't show up.

Sophia's nose stung, her eyes turning red. She let go of Isabella's hand, sniffled softly, and whispered, Okay.

Isabella noticed. Of course she did. It wasn't like she felt nothing. But even so, she didn't change her mind.

She reached out, intending to ruffle Sophia's hair before leaving. But the moment her hand moved closer, Sophia turned her face away with a pout.

Isabella paused. She withdrew her hand without another word and simply walked away.

Alexander watched the entire exchange. He didn't stop Isabella. He didn't try to persuade her. Sophia kept her face stubbornly turned away, refusing to look, but she was still listening.

When the sound of Isabella's heels faded into the distance, and she realized her mother had truly left—without even attempting to comfort her—she finally broke.

She turned and buried her face against Alexander's leg, sobbing uncontrollably.

Her fencing coach was stunned.

Sophia was far more mature than most children her age. Bright, opinionated, and spirited. Over the past six months, many kids at the academy had cried countless times.

But this was the first time he had ever seen her cry.

That morning, Isabella had agreed to every one of Sophia's requests, speaking to her with such gentleness and attention.

Yet, knowing how hurt and disappointed the child was, she had walked away without a second glance.

The impression she gave was as if she no longer wanted her daughter. That kind of coldness was shocking.

Any other man would have lost his temper, confronting his ex-wife for treating their child this way.

But Alexander showed nothing—no anger, no argument. He simply watched Isabella leave in silence.

Then he bent down, picked Sophia up, and gently wiped her tears with his fingertips. That upset?

Sophia clung to his neck, crying harder. I'm sad, and Mom doesn't care... She just... left...

Alexander murmured, Mm. I saw.

Sophia wailed louder. Does Mom not love me anymore?

He chuckled. Of course she does.

Sophia peered at him through her tears. R-Really?

Alexander pulled out a handkerchief and wiped her nose. I promise.

It soothed her slightly, but when she remembered Isabella hadn't even tried to comfort her, the tears started again. Then why didn't Mom try to make me feel better?

Alexander pinched her soft cheek, smiling without answering.

Sophia pointed at him indignantly. I—I'm this upset, and you're still laughing!

Alexander took the backpack her coach handed him.

He carried her out, holding her bag. How about I take you out for something nice to make up for it?

I don't want that. I just want Mom.

That's out of my control. You saw it yourself—when it comes to your mother, I have no say.

Sophia had no reply.
###Chapter 356

Last week, Nathaniel Graves visited InnovaTech to negotiate contract termination, but the discussions collapsed. That very afternoon, legal papers were filed.

When Isabella had her explosive confrontation with Victoria Kensington at InnovaTech, Nathaniel was overseas closing a deal.

Perhaps because she couldn't reach him, Victoria refused to let the matter drop.

Monday morning, Isabella arrived at work to find Victoria waiting in the lobby again. Their eyes met briefly before both women deliberately looked away.

Entering the office, Isabella spotted Nathaniel already at his desk.

"You're here early."

Nathaniel shrugged. "Came in forty minutes early to avoid ambushes."

Isabella smirked at that.

Dominic Fairchild happened to visit YodaVision that morning for a meeting. The elevator doors opened to reveal Victoria pacing near reception.

Having heard about the InnovaTech debacle, Dominic immediately understood her presence.

He approached with false concern. "How long have you been waiting? Has Mr. Graves arrived yet?"

"Nearly thirty minutes," Victoria replied smoothly. "He must be running late. Are you here to see him, Mr. Fairchild?"

Dominic nodded.

Before he could probe further, Nathaniel's assistant Victoria Chambers appeared. "Mr. Fairchild, right this way."

Dominic hesitated. "Nathaniel's in?"

Victoria Chambers smiled politely. "Yes."

Victoria Kensington seized the moment. "Ms. Chambers, I'm Victoria Kensington from InnovaTech. I need five minutes of Mr. Graves' time regarding an urgent—"

"Apologies, Ms. Kensington," the assistant cut in, "but you're not on the schedule." She turned back to Dominic. "Shall we?"

Dominic's jaw tightened.

Victoria Kensington pressed on. "I'll wait however long it takes. Just ten minutes—"

The assistant gave a practiced smile before leading Dominic away without another glance.

Inside Nathaniel's office, Dominic noted the deliberate omission. His frown deepened when business discussions began without acknowledging the waiting woman.

"Ms. Kensington has been outside for half an hour," Dominic interjected during a coffee order. "Perhaps you should—"

Nathaniel chuckled. "My schedule's set. Shall we focus on actual business?"

The dismissal was clear.

Dominic leaned forward. "Nathaniel, I understand InnovaTech made mistakes, but termination seems extreme. Are personal grudges influencing professional decisions?"

Nathaniel's smile turned icy. "Contract terms are my judgment call. My reasons stand."

"This doesn't concern you, Dominic."

Dominic had suspected Isabella's influence since Nathaniel's recent uncharacteristic actions against Victoria. Their long partnership made this deviation more jarring.

"Frederick Aldridge won't approve of this behavior," Dominic warned.

Nathaniel raised an eyebrow. "Is that a threat?"

"A fact. He'd never condone his protégé acting so—"

The door slammed shut behind Dominic as Nathaniel stood abruptly.

"Get out."

His voice held lethal calm.

Dominic froze mid-sentence. The air crackled with tension as Nathaniel rounded the desk, eyes darkening dangerously.

"Say another word about my decisions," Nathaniel whispered, "and our decade-long partnership ends now."

Dominic's throat worked soundlessly.

Nathaniel stabbed the intercom. "Security. Escort our guest out."

As boots approached, Dominic finally found his voice. "You'll regret this."

Nathaniel smiled coldly. "Watch me."

The door clicked shut.

Outside, Victoria Kensington's eyes widened as Dominic was marched past her. Their gazes locked—his furious, hers calculating—before the elevator swallowed him whole.

Victoria Chambers approached with a clipboard. "Ms. Kensington? Mr. Graves will see you now."

A slow smile curved Victoria Kensington's lips as she stood.

Game on.
###Chapter 357

Nathaniel crossed his arms. Be what exactly? Blinded by passion? Or completely irrational?

Both.

Naturally, Dominic kept that thought to himself.

Nathaniel saw right through him and smirked. Yet I can't help feeling the truly blinded one here isn't me, but someone else entirely.

Before Dominic could reply, Nathaniel continued, Besides, Frederick's favorite protégé was never me. You're giving me far too much credit, Mr. Fairchild.

Dominic hadn't expected Nathaniel to remain so indifferent even after mentioning Frederick.

But Nathaniel had no patience for games. If this bothers you so much, feel free to terminate our contract.

Of course, you'll need to compensate The Grandeur for all resulting losses.

Dominic thought he'd approached this conversation with perfect professionalism.

Yet Nathaniel had been hostile from the start, and now threatened to sever ties over a simple discussion. It was absurd.

Dominic pressed his lips together. Mr. Graves, let's not be hasty—

Nathaniel's gaze turned glacial. I'm completely serious.

Dominic froze.

Those piercing eyes held no warmth, only steely determination. Dominic realized with sudden clarity that Nathaniel meant every word.

All this over a few words in Victoria's defense? Was it really worth destroying their partnership?

The more resolute Nathaniel became, the more childish Dominic's interference seemed.

He wanted to argue further, but Nathaniel had already dismissed him.

Rising abruptly, Nathaniel said coldly, Since business isn't your priority today, I won't detain you. Victoria, please escort him out.

Mr. Graves!

Nathaniel's smile didn't reach his eyes. How touching, Mr. Fairchild. Does Alexander know how... invested you are in his girlfriend's wellbeing?

Dominic stiffened. His voice dropped. Ms. Kensington and I have a professional relationship. She genuinely wants to resolve this conflict. I merely attempted to mediate.

Is that so?

Since Dominic denied any personal involvement, Nathaniel lost interest. I'm done discussing this. Leave.

Mr. Graves!

Victoria, now.

Nathaniel's tone brooked no argument.

Realizing further discussion was futile, Dominic gave Nathaniel one last searching look before turning away.

Outside The Grandeur's gleaming towers, Dominic spotted Victoria waiting nearby. He hesitated.

She looked up. Finished your meeting already, Mr. Fairchild?

He nodded stiffly. I spoke with Mr. Graves. He knows you're here... but has no intention of seeing you. Perhaps you should go home.

Victoria shook her head. This matters too much. I'll wait.

Her stubbornness sparked unexpected sympathy in Dominic.

But he held no sway over Nathaniel.

Then it struck him—Frederick. Surely he wouldn't condone such behavior?

Dominic and Victoria shared nothing beyond professional courtesy. However much he pitied her, he had no right to interfere.

All he could say was, I'll take my leave then. Good day.

Victoria offered a tight smile.

As Dominic walked away, he paused by his car, then pulled out his phone to call Theodore.

Hours later, Theodore returned his call. What is it?

Dominic hesitated. It's nothing urgent... but Nathaniel's success may have gone to his head. His recent actions have become increasingly reckless...
###Chapter 358

Dominic barely got a word out before Richard interrupted. "Let me guess—you think Nathaniel's taking Isabella's side against Victoria again?"

Dominic's eyes widened. The old man had nailed it. "How did you know? Did someone already tell you what happened?"

Richard snorted. "No. Figured it out myself."

When Isabella and Alexander had agreed to work with his stubborn son for his sake, it was obvious they wouldn't sabotage him professionally.

His son wasn’t the type to stir up workplace drama either. Even if they weren’t friends, their business relationship should’ve remained smooth.

If Dominic wasn’t clashing with Alexander or Isabella directly, the problem had to involve someone he cared about—likely Victoria.

Earlier that year, during a dinner with Frederick, Isabella, and the others, they’d run into Victoria at the restaurant entrance.

Back then, seeing how attentive Dominic was to her—her poise, manners, everything—Richard had been impressed.

But after the meal, Walter dropped the bombshell: Victoria was Alexander’s ex.

Richard didn’t know the full history between Isabella and Alexander, but that day, the way Isabella and Nathaniel reacted to Victoria and her father spoke volumes.

Their dislike was palpable.

Isabella wasn’t the type to feud without cause. If Dominic was butting heads with her, Victoria had to be the reason.

Suspecting as much, Richard had called Dominic that same day to confirm. And sure enough—Victoria was at the center of it.

Then, hearing Dominic claim Isabella was targeting Victoria out of jealousy—that Nathaniel was blindly siding with her—Richard nearly laughed in disbelief.

Remembering that now, Richard let out a sharp chuckle. "So what? You want me to call Frederick, explain everything, and have him rein Nathaniel in?"

"Yes," Dominic said firmly. "Nathaniel’s gone too far this time. If this continues, I genuinely think—"

Richard cut him off.

He had no intention of spelling out the truth. Instead, he said flatly, "That’s not a conversation I’m starting. If you want to help Victoria, talk to Frederick yourself."

Dominic frowned. "This isn’t just about helping her. I respect Nathaniel—I don’t want to see him keep acting like this—"

So he still blamed Isabella?

Richard’s temple throbbed. "Nathaniel’s the reckless one? Funny, I think you’re the one being irrational, letting your bias for Victoria cloud your judgment."

"You don’t even know what happened," Dominic shot back. "How can you be so sure I’m the one in the wrong?"

Richard paused. "Fine. Explain it to me."

Dominic gave a rough summary.

When he finished, Richard said coolly, "This mess is entirely Victoria’s fault. As a company leader, she handled things poorly from the start."

"Instead of addressing the issue, she joined her employees and family in berating YodaVision’s staff. If I were Nathaniel, I’d be furious too."

"Beyond that, her family showed terrible judgment and zero respect for their business partners. If they weren’t afraid of contract penalties, I doubt they’d have apologized at all."

"So from Nathaniel’s perspective, cutting ties is completely reasonable."

Dominic rushed to defend her. "That’s not true. They apologized quickly, and Victoria personally called Nathaniel to make amends. She was sincere."

In his mind, if not for Isabella’s grudge, Nathaniel wouldn’t have considered terminating InnovaTech’s contract over something so minor.

"That’s surface-level," Richard said, done arguing. "Victoria already has a boyfriend. You told me you knew that."

"At first, I didn’t know much about her. She seemed impressive. But now? Her character’s lacking. The way she handles things—she’ll never go far."

"Honestly, son, you and Alexander both have terrible taste in women."

Dominic stiffened at the harsh words.

He opened his mouth to defend Victoria, to make Richard see how exceptional she really was—but Richard cut him off again.

"Look, if you want to help her, I won’t stop you. But if you’re expecting my help? Forget it."

With that, Richard hung up.
###Chapter 359

Dominic Fairchild clenched his fists when Richard refused to help. Without hesitation, he decided to contact Frederick Aldridge directly.

His phone contacts came up empty. No Frederick Aldridge listed.

He texted Richard demanding Frederick's number. The reply was instant and infuriating: "No."

Before Dominic could type a response, another message popped up. "Already spoke to Walter Ashford. Stop wasting my time."

Dominic's blood boiled.

He tried calling Richard again. Straight to voicemail.

With both Richard and Walter blocking his path, Dominic's mind turned to Sebastian Ashford.

He vaguely recalled Sebastian mentioning some professional dealings with Frederick. They'd even shared a business lunch once.

Dominic dialed Sebastian's number immediately.

The call went unanswered until dusk. When Sebastian finally called back and heard Dominic's request for Frederick's contact, his response was blunt. "I don't have Mr. Aldridge's number."

"That can't be right," Dominic protested. "You had lunch with him and my father. You didn't exchange cards?"

"Negative," Sebastian confirmed.

Dominic's suspicion flared. "Are you certain? Or did my father order you not to share it?"

"Honestly don't have it," Sebastian sounded genuinely perplexed. "That lunch was strictly business. To Mr. Aldridge, I'm just another face in the crowd. He's not exactly the mentoring type - keeps everyone at arm's length."

The conviction in Sebastian's voice convinced Dominic.

"Why do you need to reach him?" Sebastian asked.

"Just business," Dominic deflected.

From Dominic's tone, Sebastian pieced together that Richard had already refused the request - and warned others against helping.

Then realization struck. "Did something happen between Isabella Sinclair and Nathaniel Graves?"

Dominic hesitated. "Is it that obvious?"

Sebastian didn't answer immediately.

Previously, Dominic had claimed Isabella and Nathaniel were involved, suggesting Isabella targeted Victoria Kensington out of professional jealousy.

But at last year's gala, Sebastian had observed no romantic tension between them.

Their actual relationship remained unclear - until recently at the training facility, when he learned Isabella was Frederick's protégé.

Suddenly Nathaniel's protectiveness made sense.

Even before discovering Isabella's connection to Frederick, Sebastian had doubted she'd sabotage colleagues over personal feelings.

The idea of her being romantically involved with Nathaniel seemed far-fetched.

As for targeting Victoria? Even less believable.

"What exactly happened?" Sebastian pressed.

Dominic massaged his temples before summarizing the incident.

"I know Victoria shares some blame," he conceded. "But terminating contracts over this? Isn't that excessive?"

Sebastian remained neutral. "I won't comment on that. But you're trying to contact Mr. Aldridge because you think Nathaniel overreacted?"
###Chapter 360

Sebastian was still mulling it over when Dominic pressed him again. "Sebastian, other than your father and mine, do you know anyone else who has Frederick's contact information?"

"No one else," Sebastian replied.

Then a thought struck him. "But didn't you say Ms. Kensington had met Frederick before? She might have his number."

"If speaking with Mr. Aldridge could solve everything, wouldn't she have contacted him herself by now?"

Dominic nodded. "I considered that too. But since she's directly involved, it wouldn't be proper for her to reach out to Mr. Aldridge just to inquire about Nathaniel, would he?"

His thoughtfulness surprised even himself. Perhaps he cared more about Victoria than he realized.

"Never mind," Dominic sighed. "I'll ask around elsewhere."

"Alright."

The fact that Isabella was also one of Frederick's students wasn't public knowledge - which meant it was confidential. Sebastian couldn't share that with Dominic even if he wanted to.

After a pause, Sebastian added, "I've interacted with Isabella several times. She doesn't strike me as the person you're describing."

"Dominic, are you absolutely certain this whole situation arose because Isabella feared Nathaniel might develop feelings for Ms. Kensington? Could there be some misunderstanding?"

"Why don't you speak with Ms. Kensington or others to clarify what actually happened between them?"

Dominic's expression darkened. "Sebastian, whose side are you on?"

"I'm just stating facts."

But Dominic believed Sebastian had been deceived by Isabella. "There's no misunderstanding. I witnessed it firsthand. How could I be mistaken? You should be wary of appearances."

He changed the subject abruptly. "Let's drop this. When you're free, let's meet up."

With work still pending, Sebastian didn't press further. He ended the call.

Meanwhile, Victoria waited outside YodaVision, but Isabella and Nathaniel completely ignored her presence - leaving her standing there like a fool.

Yet Victoria remained determined.

However, an important midday appointment forced her to leave when Nathaniel still hadn't emerged.

For the next two days, work commitments prevented her from returning to YodaVision.

Come Thursday, just as she found time to visit again, a court summons arrived.

Genevieve was livid. "A court summons already? After just a few days? They're really pushing to terminate the contract!"

"And the court accepted such a trivial case? What kind of joke is this legal system?"

With the case officially filed, unless Nathaniel withdrew the lawsuit, they'd have no choice but to proceed to trial.

Frustrated as she was, even Genevieve recognized the situation had reached a point of no return.

Suddenly, Eleanor suggested, "What if we approach the Graves family about this?"

They'd always believed that since Isabella had been married with a child, the Graves family would never accept her relationship with Nathaniel.

Nathaniel's recent blind date with a suitable socialite seemed to confirm this theory.

If the family learned she was letting personal grudges interfere with Nathaniel's business partnerships, they'd likely disapprove.

Under such family pressure, Nathaniel might withdraw the lawsuit.

Victoria immediately grasped her mother's implication.

It was a viable strategy.

Besides Nathaniel, she didn't know any Graves family members. But Alexander did.

She dialed Alexander immediately.

After hearing her plan, Alexander said, "I'll try contacting someone from the Graves family soon."

Genevieve approved the strategy.

Just imagining the Graves family's potential anger and Nathaniel cutting ties with Isabella thrilled her.

But then a realization struck. "Why didn't Alexander think of approaching the Graves family earlier?"

Victoria lowered her gaze. "He and Isabella are still legally married. The Graves family likely knows about their situation."

"It wouldn't be appropriate for him to bring this up directly. Someone else should handle it."

Genevieve smirked. "Fair point."

The Novel will be updated first on this website. Come back and continue reading tomorrow, everyone!
###Chapter 361

Victoria Kensington had anticipated waiting several more days for any developments.

To her surprise, Alexander Whitmore called that very afternoon. "Mr. and Mrs. Graves will be attending an auction tomorrow," he informed her. "Would you like to join?"

A satisfied smile curved Victoria's lips. "Absolutely."

The following evening, shortly after their arrival at the prestigious auction house, Alexander guided Victoria toward Sebastian and Melissa Graves. He made the introductions smoothly.

Though aware of Alexander's relationship with Isabella Sinclair and the ongoing tensions between Isabella and Victoria, the Graves couple maintained impeccable composure. They greeted Alexander warmly, their smiles never faltering. When Victoria was introduced, Melissa extended her hand with practiced politeness. "A pleasure."

The auction hall buzzed with high society's elite.

After initial pleasantries, Alexander and Sebastian drifted into business discussions with other attendees.

Seizing the moment, Victoria maneuvered herself beside Melissa.

After some light conversation, Victoria cut to the chase. "Mrs. Graves, I must confess I came today seeking your assistance."

Melissa's smile remained polished. "Mr. Whitmore is quite accomplished. What could possibly require my intervention?"

"You're too modest," Victoria countered. "This matter concerns Mr. Graves."

Melissa's posture stiffened almost imperceptibly. "Nathaniel?"

"Indeed."

Just as Melissa began to respond, her phone vibrated in her clutch. "Excuse me, I must take this."

"Of course."

Melissa stepped away, putting several paces between them before answering.

When she returned moments later, she offered a polite apology. "My apologies for the interruption, Ms. Kensington."

"Not at all."

"You mentioned an issue regarding Nathaniel?" Melissa prompted, her tone carefully neutral.

Victoria nodded. "Are you familiar with the collaboration between InnovaTech and YodaVision?"

"Briefly. Has there been some complication?"

"A minor misunderstanding, really," Victoria said with a dismissive wave. "Certainly nothing warranting contract termination."

She leaned in slightly. "I've attempted to contact Mr. Graves repeatedly to resolve this amicably. Compensation for any inconvenience is ready."

"But certain parties," Victoria's voice dropped meaningfully, "are exploiting this situation to pressure Mr. Graves into severing ties with InnovaTech."

Melissa's expression darkened. "You're referring to Isabella Sinclair?"

Victoria feigned hesitation before confirming, "Yes."

"Why would she involve herself?" Melissa's fingers tightened around her champagne flute.

"Personal grievances between us, I'm afraid." Victoria sighed. "Termination benefits neither party. Even with compensation, it's a lose-lose scenario."

"InnovaTech values this partnership deeply. Yet despite my efforts, Mr. Graves refuses all communication. He seems determined to proceed with cancellation."

Victoria met Melissa's gaze squarely. "That's why I'm appealing to you, Mrs. Graves. Perhaps you could help him see reason?"

Melissa's gaze dropped momentarily. "I understand."

Recognizing the shift, Victoria pressed her advantage gently. "Your assistance would mean everything."

"You're too kind, Ms. Kensington."

Their conversation concluded when Sebastian returned to his wife's side, leaving the unspoken tension hanging delicately in the air between them.
###Chapter 362

Sebastian and Melissa had just walked out when Alexander turned to Victoria. "Did you wrap up your conversation with Mrs. Graves?"

A faint smile touched Victoria's lips as she nodded.

From the look on Melissa's face earlier, it was clear her disdain for Isabella was growing by the minute.

Melissa had been aware of the conflict between InnovaTech and YodaVision long before this meeting. Nathaniel had briefed her thoroughly.

That phone call Melissa took during their conversation? A carefully staged act. She had recorded every word.

Stepping just far enough away, she glanced back at Alexander and Victoria before sending the recording straight to Nathaniel.

Nathaniel and Isabella were still at the office. After listening, Nathaniel smirked and strode into Isabella's office to update her.

Isabella leaned back in her chair. "Now I'm certain we'll win the lawsuit."

"Absolutely."

Their insistence on terminating the contract wasn't just about cutting ties with InnovaTech—it was about cornering Victoria.

They wanted to push her into desperate measures to stop the termination.

Every attempt Victoria made to reach out to the Whitmores or the Graves family would only tighten the noose.

The more she scrambled, the more mistakes she'd make.

Had she simply apologized and cooperated, they might not have succeeded in terminating the contract.

Even if they had, the compensation wouldn't have been nearly as steep.

But now? Things had changed.

Victoria had already caused the initial conflict. Now she was claiming their push for termination stemmed from Isabella's personal vendetta.

A critical detail: Isabella wasn't just a key player at YodaVision—she was the lead on the InnovaTech collaboration.

Victoria had disrespected that fact, then accused the entire project team of bias to save her own skin.

That alone was damning evidence against any future cooperation.

Worse, Victoria was dragging personal grudges into a legal battle.

If the judge pressed Isabella about their history in court, would Victoria really want those details aired?

At that point, the contract dispute would be the least of her worries.

To avoid exposure, she might even agree to termination—and that sky-high penalty.

Nathaniel's grin widened at the thought.

The moment he left Isabella's office, her phone buzzed. Sophia was calling.

Again.

She'd already tried that morning, but Isabella hadn't picked up.

Tomorrow was Sophia's fencing competition. This was likely about confirming attendance.

Or—knowing how things went—Sophia might have changed her mind, wanting Alexander and Victoria there instead.

Isabella set her phone aside. She'd finish her reports first, then head home.

Sophia called three more times. When Isabella still didn't answer, she slumped on the sofa, clutching a plush toy, frustration simmering.

Alexander walked in, loosening his tie. He took one look at her and sighed. "Your mom didn't answer?"

Sophia tugged roughly at the toy's ears. "Nope."

A heavy silence followed.

Alexander waited, watching her. Finally, she mumbled, "Since Mom's busy... could you and Victoria come tomorrow?"

"Of course." He smiled. "I'll let her know."

"Okay."

"Goodnight, Dad." Clutching the toy, Sophia trudged upstairs.

###Chapter 363

The morning sun painted golden streaks across the sports hall as Alexander, Sophia, and Victoria arrived early for Sophia's competition.

They'd barely settled in when Julian and Lily Montgomery made their appearance.

Sophia spotted them first. "Mr. Montgomery, Lily, you made it!"

Lily strode forward, grasping Sophia's hand. "The competition starts soon. Nerves kicking in yet?"

Sophia remained composed. "Not at all."

Julian had pressing matters to attend to, merely dropping Lily off.

Alexander recognized Julian's urgency. "I'll look after Lily. Go handle your business."

Julian gave a curt nod. "I'll join you all for lunch later."

"Understood."

Their camaraderie appeared unchanged. But beneath the surface...

Victoria's gaze flickered between Alexander and Julian. If Alexander discovered Julian's growing feelings for Isabella, would their friendship survive?

Julian caught her stare and acknowledged her with a slight nod before departing without a word.

Watching him leave, Victoria's lips twisted into a bitter smile. Ever since Julian fell for Isabella, his indifference toward her had become increasingly apparent.

Meanwhile, Isabella received an unexpected call from Nathaniel while resting at home.

"Having lunch with my parents today. They've been asking about you constantly. Care to join us?"

It had been weeks since Isabella last saw Sebastian and Melissa Graves. She agreed readily.

By noon, she was pulling up to the restaurant just as Nathaniel and his parents arrived.

Melissa immediately clasped Isabella's hands. "Darling! You grow more radiant each time I see you."

As they exchanged pleasantries, Miles Westbrook exited his vehicle nearby. Spotting Isabella with Nathaniel and his parents, he froze momentarily.

Isabella noticed him, her smile faltering briefly before she deliberately looked away.

Recovering, Miles greeted the Graves family politely before entering the restaurant alone. Once inside, he dialed Alexander immediately.

Alexander answered on the first ring. "What is it?"

"Guess who I just saw?" Miles teased.

Alexander didn't play along. "Who?"

Miles sighed. Of course Alexander already knew.

"Isabella. With Nathaniel and his parents. They looked... cozy. Melissa was practically glowing while holding Isabella's hand, calling her 'Bella' like she's already family. Are we witnessing engagement preparations here?"

Alexander's response was ice. "Fascinating." His disinterest was palpable.

Given Alexander's history with Isabella, his indifference wasn't surprising.

Changing tactics, Miles asked, "How's Sophia's competition going?"

"Morning session went well," Alexander replied tersely.

"Good to hear," Miles said before hanging up.

Undeterred, Miles decided to share his gossip in their group chat, knowing Victoria and Julian remained unaware.

At that moment, Alexander and Victoria were arriving at the restaurant with Julian joining them shortly after.

Both Julian and Victoria checked their phones simultaneously upon seeing Miles' message.

Victoria's lips curled into a satisfied smirk when she read about Isabella's lunch with the Graves family. Her conversation with Melissa yesterday must have worked.

This meeting was clearly a warning to Isabella, wasn't it?

Then Miles dropped the bombshell:

"Melissa couldn't stop smiling while holding Isabella's hand, calling her 'Bella' with such affection you'd think she was her actual daughter."

"Remember at Mrs. Whitmore's birthday when Melissa said she'd arrange Nathaniel and Isabella's wedding whenever they were ready? She wasn't joking! This is happening!"

Victoria's smirk vanished. The blood drained from her face as comprehension dawned.
###Chapter 364

Isabella Sinclair? How could Melissa possibly approve of her?

If Oliver's words held truth, then when she'd spoken with Victoria yesterday...

Remembering how abruptly the conversation had ended, Victoria's heart sank.

Noticing her shift in mood, Alexander turned with concern. "What's wrong? You look pale."

Victoria forced a smile. "It's nothing."

That evening, she broke the news to her family.

The Kensington and Pembroke families reacted with shock upon hearing Melissa Graves' apparent acceptance of Isabella - a married woman with a child from humble origins - for her distinguished son Nathaniel.

"Impossible," Genevieve scoffed. "The Graves family would never allow such a match. Perhaps Mr. Westbrook misunderstood? Or that woman lied about her past?"

Victoria couldn't comprehend it either.

Maybe Isabella had concealed her marital status. That would explain everything.

Originally, Victoria had considered the lawsuit a manageable risk if private negotiations failed.

But if Melissa had recorded their conversation... the lawsuit would collapse.

Unless Isabella had indeed hidden her marriage. Then there might still be hope.

Acting quickly, Victoria dispatched someone to investigate Melissa's true stance.

Her connections through Alexander made finding willing informants effortless.

By next afternoon, her agent approached Melissa directly. "Mrs. Graves, I heard Ms. Sinclair - who's close to your son - is already married. Is this true?"

Melissa smiled serenely. "Quite correct. You're well-informed."

The confirmation reached Victoria immediately. The Graves family knew about Isabella's marriage.

Which meant they likely knew her husband was Alexander.

Penelope's voice turned acidic. "Knowing she's married and still approving? The Graves have gone mad."

Victoria remained silent, her expression darkening.

Sophia's fencing competition spanned two days.

Mid-afternoon, while reading, Isabella received another call from Sophia.

After brief hesitation, she answered.

Sophia, fresh from her tournament victory, bubbled with excitement. "Mom! Did I catch you at a good time?"

Isabella replied neutrally, "Mm. What is it?"

"I took second place in the finals!"

"Impressive," Isabella offered genuine praise.

Sophia's enthusiasm grew. "I've only trained briefly, so second place is amazing! Next time, I'll win gold!"

"Don't push yourself too hard," Isabella cautioned, though pleased.

"Mom... are you busy? Could you come home for dinner tonight?"

Isabella's tone cooled. "I have commitments."

"Oh. Of course." Sophia's disappointment was palpable, yet she'd grown accustomed to such responses. That Isabella had answered at all was victory enough.

After brief chatter, they disconnected.

Moments later, photos arrived - competition shots, podium moments, Sophia radiant in her fencing gear, trophy held high.

"Dad took these," Sophia texted. "Do you like them?"

Isabella replied, "Beautiful."

So Alexander had attended the entire event.

His devotion to Sophia was undeniable.

As a father, he excelled.

This knowledge brought Isabella some peace.

Come Monday, as Isabella and Nathaniel returned to work, their lawyer reported receiving notice from Victoria's legal team that...
###Chapter 365

The moment the contract termination was finalized, Victoria immediately dialed Alexander's number to update him.

During the auction, my slip of tongue in front of Melissa Graves had been noticed. Nathaniel's reluctance to collaborate with InnovaTech had become increasingly apparent.

Even if we won the lawsuit, there was no guarantee Nathaniel's family wouldn't create future complications.

Since cooperation seemed impossible, terminating the contract early and finding new partners might actually be for the best.

Alexander didn't press for details about what she'd said to alert Melissa.

His response was straightforward: "If you've made your decision, proceed with the termination. Do you need assistance with the fees?"

Victoria felt a warmth spread through her chest at his offer. Since her family's relocation to Salzburg, Alexander had already done so much.

Continuing to rely on him for everything could eventually wear thin his patience, regardless of her talents or their attraction.

She knew better than to test those limits.

"I can handle this myself," she replied firmly.

"Understood," Alexander said, then added, "After terminating with YodaVision, you'll need new partners quickly. Shall I arrange that for you?"

The recent tension with Nathaniel and Isabella had weighed heavily on Victoria. But Alexander's offer lifted her spirits instantly, filling her with a sweet, comforting sensation.

Her voice softened. "Yes, thank you, Alexander."

Meanwhile, Nathaniel and Isabella had delegated the InnovaTech termination to their legal team.

When Victoria received YodaVision's termination terms and saw the $300 million penalty, her brows knitted together.

Compared to their original agreement, this amount was exorbitant.

"Three hundred million?" Genevieve's frown mirrored Victoria's.

It wasn't that the sum was unaffordable or that Nathaniel was being unreasonable.

Before Victoria's relationship with Alexander, this amount would have been devastating for their family.

Now, while substantial, it didn't seem insurmountable.

Alexander had gifted Victoria jewelry worth millions, presented Eleanor with a birthday present valued at tens of millions, and given the $600 million villa to Penelope.

He'd even transferred InnovaTech - worth billions - to Victoria's name.

Against this backdrop, $300 million appeared manageable.

Victoria and Eleanor shared this perspective.

When reviewing YodaVision's terms, they merely frowned slightly. Diana and Beatrice, however, winced at the amount.

Three hundred million remained a significant figure.

Reginald voiced their practical concern: "We don't have that much liquid capital."

Victoria paused.

True, while Alexander's gifts were valuable, they weren't cash assets.

Their families couldn't readily produce $300 million.

"Let's pool our resources," Victoria suggested.

Penelope, feeling the financial pinch, ventured, "Should we ask Alexander for help?"

Before Victoria could respond, Eleanor quietly interjected, "Penelope, while accepting generosity is one thing, directly soliciting help isn't wise. Constant requests breed resentment."

They'd previously discussed this delicate balance.

Penelope understood, but the sting remained.

Ultimately, this situation stemmed from her daughter's actions.

Yet considering Victoria's future with Alexander, even $3 billion would be insignificant.

Once InnovaTech's autonomous vehicles launched, recouping this amount would be effortless.

With this realization, Penelope fell silent.

The others shared similar thoughts, though none voiced them aloud.
###Chapter 366

Isabella swiftly signed the termination papers.

The compensation amount was clearly outlined, and she assured them it would be paid within the agreed timeframe.

When Nathaniel received the update, he scoffed. "She doesn't waste any time."

Their legal team handled the remaining formalities. Once the documents were signed, neither Isabella nor Nathaniel gave it another thought.

Three days later, Frederick had a rare break from his busy schedule. Since it had been weeks since they last met, the trio decided to have lunch together.

At noon, Isabella and Nathaniel left the office. As they arrived at the restaurant entrance, they spotted Victoria and Alexander.

Accompanying them was Gregory Thornton, CEO of a competing AI firm.

Gregory and Nathaniel were acquainted through business dealings. They maintained a cordial professional relationship and often exchanged pleasantries when crossing paths.

Spotting Nathaniel first, Gregory initiated the greeting. "Mr. Graves."

Nathaniel didn't even glance at Alexander or Victoria. He simply nodded. "Mr. Thornton."

Gregory was aware that Quantum Innovations had approached him only after severing ties with Visionary Tech.

Observing Nathaniel's cold demeanor toward the other two, Gregory assumed there had been a messy fallout over the contract termination.

Previously, even when Nathaniel appeared distant, Alexander and Victoria would make polite conversation. This time, neither spoke a word to him.

Victoria's gaze held noticeable frost when looking at Nathaniel.

As for Isabella? Victoria still refused to acknowledge her existence.

Not wanting to prolong the awkward encounter, Isabella and Nathaniel quickly excused themselves and entered the restaurant.

Only after the private room door closed behind them did Nathaniel finally speak. "They barely ended things with us and already partnered with DataSphere. Alexander moves fast."

DataSphere Inc. was another industry leader in artificial intelligence development.

Their collaboration fees would undoubtedly dwarf what Visionary Tech had paid.

Isabella poured herself some water. "Their language processing system was unmatched last year. No competitors came close. Of course they'd turn to Gregory."

She took a sip before continuing. "After cutting ties with us, this is their best damage control. DataSphere makes perfect sense."

Nathaniel understood the logic. That only made him more irritated.

His frustration grew as he added, "I'm guessing Alexander covered Quantum's termination fees?"

Isabella remained silent.

Just then, Frederick arrived.

Neither brought up the matter again in his presence. Their messy business dealings weren't appropriate conversation for their mentor.

Their meetings with Frederick typically focused on AI advancements. Since these gatherings were rare, lunch stretched well past two hours.

As they finally left the private room, the adjacent door opened simultaneously.

Alexander, Victoria, and Gregory emerged at the same moment.

Before anyone could speak, Gregory spotted Frederick first. "Professor Aldridge."

Being in the same industry, Gregory recognized the renowned academic.

Frederick acknowledged him with a nod.

Alexander followed with his own greeting, Victoria echoing him. "Professor Aldridge."

Frederick's expression remained impassive.

At that moment, another group rounded the hallway corner and froze upon seeing them - particularly Dominic Fairchild's reaction to Frederick's presence.

Isabella immediately averted her gaze when she noticed Dominic.

Regaining his composure after a glance at Victoria, Dominic addressed Frederick first. "Professor Aldridge."

Frederick gave a slight nod but remained silent.

Dominic then surveyed the group before asking, "Are you all dining together?"

He'd already heard about Visionary Tech and Quantum's split. Rumors suggested Victoria felt Nathaniel lacked commitment to their partnership.

Even without the termination, given Nathaniel's attitude, future conflicts seemed inevitable.

So she'd agreed to end things for long-term stability.

Yet here they were, sharing a meal shortly after the breakup.

Victoria quickly clarified. "We just happened to run into each other."

Dominic smiled knowingly. "I see."

Isabella and Nathaniel had no interest in further conversation with Dominic, Alexander, or Victoria.

Isabella opened her mouth to speak, but Nathaniel beat her to it. "Professor, shall we?"

Frederick nodded and turned to leave when Dominic suddenly stepped forward. "We met recently at the symposium. Do you remember me?"

"I do." Frederick glanced at him. "And?"

Isabella was about to interject when Nathaniel spoke first. "Professor, we should go."

Frederick nodded again, but Dominic - offended by their dismissive attitude toward him, Alexander, and Victoria - blocked their path.

His expression darkened as he said, "Professor Aldridge, my father is Richard Fairchild. We were introduced last month. Surely you recall?"

"I do." Frederick's gaze turned icy. "Your point?"
###Chapter 367

"Did you hear about the contract termination between VodaVision and InnovaTech?"

"Your student Nathaniel has become increasingly arrogant and reckless, blinded by love to the point of losing all judgment. Have you noticed this?"

Dominic Fairchild had intended to say these words, but when his gaze landed on Alexander Whitmore, the words caught in his throat.

These matters concerned Victoria Kensington after all.

With both Victoria and Alexander present now, Dominic realized he had no right to speak on the subject.

Speaking out of turn in front of so many people would be equivalent to revealing his thoughts about Victoria to others.

That would only cause her unnecessary trouble.

Noticing Gregory Thornton standing beside Alexander, Dominic recognized his identity.

Now that InnovaTech and YodaVision had signed the termination agreement, and with Victoria and Alexander dining with Gregory...

The implications became immediately clear.

DataWing was indeed the best alternative for InnovaTech after YodaVision.

Alexander clearly had special regard for Victoria.

Since Victoria had already found a new partner and Nathaniel's behavior was becoming increasingly erratic, perhaps it would be better for her to distance herself from them.

With this realization, Dominic saw no need to bring anything up with Frederick Aldridge.

His thoughts raced as he quickly decided to say, "It's nothing. Sorry to interrupt."

Nathaniel clearly knew what Dominic had wanted to say.

With mocking amusement, he smirked, "I thought you were angry enough to complain to my mentor."

The sarcastic tone made Dominic realize Nathaniel was beyond redemption - smug and utterly unrepentant.

At that moment, Dominic concluded Nathaniel's situation was worse than he'd imagined.

He'd once pitied Nathaniel.

Now, seeing how eagerly Nathaniel was descending into decadence with Isabella Sinclair, Dominic thought: why stop him?

With this in mind, Dominic responded dismissively, "Mr. Graves, you're exaggerating."

Uninterested in Dominic, Nathaniel turned to Isabella and Frederick. "Professor, shall we go?"

Isabella nodded, gesturing politely. "Professor, this way."

When Dominic and Victoria heard Isabella address Frederick as "Professor," they assumed she was shamelessly following Nathaniel's lead.

Still, it displeased them, feeling Isabella's casual address tarnished Frederick's reputation.

As Nathaniel and Isabella headed back to the office, Frederick departed in his car.

Nathaniel remarked, "Dominic is such a fool. I regret ever collaborating with him just to show Theodore Sinclair respect. The thought of continuing to work with him gives me a headache."

Isabella massaged her temples. "Should we have Mr. Whitfield handle him from now on?"

"Please do!" Nathaniel responded.

Isabella smiled as they entered the building.

Stepping off the elevator toward the company entrance, her phone rang.

Alexander was calling.

Isabella didn't answer.

Noticing her sudden change in expression, Nathaniel guessed the caller's identity.

After the ringing stopped, Isabella was about to discuss tomorrow's work when a new message notification appeared.

From Alexander:

"I'm leaving on business tomorrow. Sophia wants to stay with you. Can you look after her during the May Day holiday?"

Nathaniel scoffed upon reading it. "Just like during the Ember Festival - he can't travel without bringing Victoria along. But he wants you to babysit Sophia so he can have alone time with Victoria?"
###Chapter 368

Isabella had the same thought.

She typed a reply to Alexander.

I'm occupied. And remember your promise—keep her away from my grandmother's house.

A few moments later, his response came. Understood.

After that, he didn’t reach out again.

On the third afternoon of the holiday, as Isabella and her family were getting ready for a rafting adventure, Emily sent her a photo.

The image showed Victoria.

Emily was currently in Salzburg, working on a fashion show.

Isabella studied the photo before replying. Is she attending your event?

Unfortunately, yes. Emily’s next message followed quickly. Bad energy all around. But she’s alone—no sign of Alexander.

Isabella sent a simple Okay, uninterested in the details, then asked, When’s your return flight?

Not sure yet. Emily had other matters to handle, so their conversation was brief before she got pulled away.

About fifteen minutes later, Emily’s video call came through.

Isabella hesitated, then answered—only to see Victoria and Alexander appear on screen.

Emily scoffed, lowering her voice. He just showed up. The event’s over, and now he’s here to collect her.

Victoria seemed familiar with the crowd, chatting animatedly while Alexander waited beside her, watching her socialize.

Nathaniel had predicted Alexander would bring Victoria along on this trip. He’d been right.

But seeing them alone—without Sophia—made Isabella’s brows furrow.

Just as she was considering this, the camera suddenly jerked. Isabella thought something had happened to Emily.

Then she realized—Alexander had looked directly into the lens. He’d clearly spotted Emily.

Emily froze under his gaze. Before she could react, he casually looked away.

She and Emily had been close for years. Alexander knew this. Yet even when running into her abroad, he made no effort to acknowledge her.

But then, this was how he treated her family too. Ignoring Emily wasn’t out of character.

After being caught, Emily avoided pointing the camera at them again.

Isabella didn’t care about whatever was going on between Alexander and Victoria. Her thoughts turned to Sophia. I need to make a call. Let’s talk when you’re back—dinner’s on me.

Emily replied instantly. Go ahead. I’ll catch you later.

The moment the call ended, Isabella dialed Sophia’s number. No answer.

She tried a video call instead. This time, it connected.

Sophia’s face lit up the second she saw her. Mom!

Isabella noticed she was in a moving vehicle. Where are you?

I’m overseas! Sophia’s excitement was palpable. Just took a helicopter to see the wildebeest migration! Thousands of them—nonstop! Watching them up close was incredible!

Isabella blinked.

Wildebeest migration? In May?

Are you in Tavora?

Yes! I—

But Alexander and Victoria were in Salzburg.

**

She knew Alexander had assigned bodyguards to accompany Sophia whenever he was unavailable, giving her the freedom to travel as she pleased.

Still, she was so young. Now Alexander and Victoria were off in Salzburg, leaving Sophia to journey so far with only bodyguards.

What if something went wrong?

Isabella tightened her grip on the phone, forcing calm into her voice. Did your father go with you?

No. Sophia’s tone was breezy. Dad said he was busy, so he told me to find something fun to do.

I’d seen the migration on TV and really wanted to see it in person. When I asked, he arranged everything for me.
###Chapter 369

Alexander couldn't make time for Sophia, yet he could spare moments for Victoria?

Before Isabella could respond, Sophia chimed in excitedly, "Dad, I wish you'd called sooner! I could've shown you the helicopter footage from earlier!"

Isabella could tell her daughter was thrilled with Alexander's arrangements this time.

A heavy knot of frustration twisted in her chest, leaving her momentarily speechless.

Sophia continued gushing about her plans for tomorrow and mentioned she'd be flying back home that evening.

As Isabella listened, Sophia suddenly asked eagerly, "Mom, are you free tomorrow? I want to video call you again!"

Isabella snapped back to reality. After a brief pause, she replied, "I'll make time."

"Yay!"

Knowing Sophia was already en route to her hotel eased Isabella's worries. After a few more minutes of chatting, she ended the call.

It was time to meet William and the others for their rafting excursion. She pocketed her phone with a sigh.

She'd been looking forward to this holiday outing. Now, she just felt drained.

Still, she didn't want to ruin everyone else's fun, so she joined them.

While waiting in line at the rafting site, someone tapped her shoulder.

Isabella turned.

Kieran Blackwood stood there, grinning.

He'd asked earlier if she was spending the holiday with family. When she mentioned rafting, his eyes had lit up—clearly enough to make the trip worthwhile.

Seeing him here wasn't surprising. "When did you arrive?" she asked.

"Just this morning."

Since joining YodaVision's R&D team, Kieran had been trying—and failing—to ask her out.

Their interactions had been strictly professional, save for that one gala.

At work, Isabella dressed impeccably. Today, she wore no makeup, a simple tank top, casual pants, and flip-flops.

The golden sunlight kissed her skin, making her glow.

Gone was the polished executive. In her place stood a radiant, approachable woman who turned heads effortlessly.

Kieran couldn't look away.

He looked younger in his T-shirt, shorts, and flip-flops—more like a grad student than a tech professional.

Caroline Sinclair, Isabella's aunt, spotted him and raised a brow. "Who's this handsome young man?"

Isabella replied, "A colleague from YodaVision."

Caroline noticed Kieran's lingering gaze but didn't press.

Isabella wasn't divorced yet. Now wasn't the time for entanglements.

Seeing Isabella's disinterest, Caroline changed the subject.

Their turn came quickly. As Isabella waved goodbye, Kieran called out, "Let's grab coffee sometime!"

She nodded. "Sure."

Once she was out of earshot, Kieran's friend whistled. "Ms. Sinclair is stunning. Even more breathtaking than at the gala."

Kieran's expression darkened. "Shut it."

His friend mimed zipping his lips. Message received.
###Chapter 370

Kieran Blackwood never got the opportunity to go rafting with Isabella Sinclair.

But fate had other plans.

During dinner at The Grandeur, he unexpectedly crossed paths with Isabella and her family again.

Charles and Caroline Sinclair warmly invited him and his companion to join their table.

When Charles discovered Kieran's connection to the Blackwood family, he leaned forward with genuine curiosity. "What brought you back to Salzburg to pursue your career here?"

Kieran's fork hovered mid-air as he considered the real reason for his return.

After a brief pause, he answered carefully. "I've been fascinated by YodaVision's programming language Cuap and their latest project, Infinite-CM. I returned specifically to join the company and learn from the best."

The Sinclair family exchanged knowing glances.

They were all aware of Isabella's pivotal role at YodaVision.

Margaret Sinclair's eyes twinkled as she nudged her granddaughter playfully. Isabella simply lowered her gaze and continued eating her salmon.

Kieran misinterpreted their reactions.

He knew Isabella was brilliant at her job.

But according to his research, she'd only joined YodaVision last year. Cuap had existed for nearly a decade. The tech world credited its creation to Frederick Aldridge.

It made logical sense - a programming language of that caliber would naturally come from someone of Frederick's stature.

As for Infinite-CM, Kieran was certain Nathaniel Graves led the project.

Their brief interactions during meetings had shown Nathaniel's undeniable expertise.

Without deeper collaboration, Kieran couldn't compare their skills. But from what he observed, Isabella often assisted Nathaniel, leading him to assume Nathaniel was the superior programmer.

The Sinclairs proved to be gracious hosts. Their lively conversation and warmth left Kieran with an excellent impression.

When dinner concluded, Isabella's family departed for their estate. Seeing them leave, Kieran and his friend soon followed suit.

The next morning, Isabella's phone buzzed with an incoming call from Sophia.

Her daughter was returning from abroad.

"Mom, Dad won't be back for a few more days. Can I come see you and Grandma when I land?" Sophia's voice carried that particular blend of excitement and fatigue unique to long flights.

Isabella recalled how Margaret had mentioned Sophia several times recently. After a brief silence, she replied, "Of course, sweetheart."

On the final day of the holiday, Sophia went straight to the Sinclair residence from the airport. Her luggage contained carefully selected gifts for each family member.

Margaret, Charles, and Caroline were visibly touched by the thoughtful presents.

Isabella noticed two remaining gifts in Sophia's suitcase - clearly intended for Alexander and Victoria.

She deliberately looked away.

After the gift-giving, travel exhaustion finally caught up with Sophia. Despite her fatigue, she clung to Isabella, wrapping her arms tightly around her mother's waist before drifting off to sleep.

She hadn't even changed out of her travel clothes.

Seeing her daughter's peaceful expression, Isabella couldn't bring herself to wake her. She gently carried Sophia to bed.

The next morning before work, Isabella dropped Sophia off at school. She didn't ask when Alexander would return.

Three days after the holiday ended, Alexander came back to Salzburg. But he contacted Sophia first, not Isabella.

After the phone call, Sophia turned to her mother. "Mom, Dad says he's coming to get me soon."

Isabella simply nodded.

Sophia hesitated, torn between her reluctance to leave the Sinclairs and her father's expressed longing to see her. Eventually, she packed her things.

Thirty minutes later, Alexander's car pulled up the driveway.

Isabella walked Sophia to the car, their hands clasped together.

Alexander stepped out, his gaze meeting Isabella's. "Thank you for looking after her these past few days."

Isabella ignored his gratitude. Turning to Sophia, she said, "Sweetheart, I need to speak with your father privately. Get in the car first."

Sophia nodded obediently and climbed into the backseat.

Once the car door shut, Isabella's demeanor shifted. "Sophia is six years old, Alexander. You honestly felt comfortable letting her travel internationally with just bodyguards?"

Before he could respond, her voice turned icy. "I don't know why you trust those men so implicitly, but this can't happen again."

She expected an argument. Instead, Alexander met her gaze steadily. "Understood."

His compliance caught her off guard.

"We should get going," he added quietly. "You should rest."

Isabella turned without another word and walked back toward the house.
###Chapter 371

Two days later, Nathaniel Graves flew to Salzburg for the International Artificial Intelligence Symposium.

Similar to last year's technology summit, this event served as a premier platform for industry leaders to discuss cutting-edge AI advancements and share technical expertise.

Accompanying him were Isabella Sinclair, Kieran Blackwood, and several newly recruited engineers from YodaVision.

The decision to bring junior engineers like Kieran was strategic - since they hadn't been exposed to sensitive company information yet, there was zero risk of intellectual property leaks.

Upon arriving in Salzburg and entering the convention center, they found the venue already packed. Rumor had it several world-renowned AI specialists would be making appearances.

At last year's summit, Nathaniel had already drawn considerable attention simply by being Frederick Aldridge's protégé.

Now, with YodaVision's growing prominence, his presence caused an even bigger sensation.

The moment he stepped into the grand hall, nearly every head turned in his direction. A swarm of attendees immediately approached to greet him, keeping him thoroughly occupied.

Isabella and Kieran stood off to the side, observing Nathaniel's networking, when suddenly a familiar voice caught Isabella's attention.

"Fancy seeing you here."

Isabella turned.

It was Julian Montgomery, with Jonathan Sterling standing beside him.

She nodded politely. "Mr. Montgomery, I didn't expect to see you here."

Julian wasn't someone who typically attended such conferences personally - sending senior executives or technical experts like Jonathan would have sufficed.

But it had been weeks since he'd last seen Isabella.

Knowing she'd likely attend a major event like this, he'd made the trip himself.

As they exchanged pleasantries, Julian noticed Kieran shooting him icy glares, which he pointedly ignored.

Just then, Alexander Whitmore arrived - noticeably without Victoria Kensington in tow.

Before Isabella or Nathaniel could react to his arrival, the event organizers appeared, ushering in a distinguished gentleman in his sixties with great ceremony.

Both Isabella and Nathaniel immediately recognized the man - Frederick Langley.

Langley was a titan in the AI world.

Earlier, they'd been surprised by Victoria's absence from Alexander's side.

Now, seeing Langley, everything made sense. Victoria stood right beside him, clearly familiar with the renowned professor.

Connecting the dots between Langley's reputation and Victoria pursuing her PhD in Salzburg, Isabella and Nathaniel realized the truth.

Most likely, Langley was her doctoral advisor.

To be accepted as Langley's PhD candidate - Victoria was clearly exceptional.

While not one of deep learning's founding fathers, Langley's contributions to AI were monumental and undisputed.

His appearance electrified the venue.

"Frederick Langley? Is that really him? He actually came?"
"If this is a dream, don't wake me up!"
"I wouldn't dare dream this big!"

An old colleague of Langley's approached to greet him.

After exchanging pleasantries, the man glanced at Victoria and asked, "And who might this be?"
###Chapter 372

Frederick Langley gestured toward the young woman beside him. "This is my PhD candidate, Victoria Kensington."

Along with Victoria, Frederick had brought four other graduate students. Among them, she stood out as the sole representative from Salzburg.

The moment the crowd realized Victoria was Frederick's protégé, waves of envy rippled through the venue.

"Good heavens, she's actually Professor Langley's doctoral student? That's incredible!"

"Not to mention stunningly beautiful. It's like the universe handed her every advantage. How utterly unfair."

"Wait—there's more. She's also Alexander Whitmore's girlfriend."

"No way. I can't handle this. Comparing yourself to others is downright depressing!"

In that instant, Victoria became not just a focal point of the event, but also the object of intense jealousy among the younger attendees.

As whispers spread about her dual status—Frederick's prized student and Alexander's partner—one guest who'd just greeted Frederick turned to Alexander with a teasing grin. "Mr. Whitmore, seems you've hit the jackpot in life, haven't you?"

Alexander offered a polite smile, but before he could respond, Frederick—having just learned his identity—clapped him on the shoulder.

"Not bad at all!" Frederick boomed. "Though I hear you two have been dating for two years. Why no ring yet? Don't tell me you haven't won my student's heart? If that's the case, better step up your game—I'm rooting for you!"

The remark drew hearty laughter from those within earshot.

But not everyone found it amusing.

Isabella Sinclair, Nathaniel Graves, and Julian Montgomery remained stone-faced, as did Dominic Fairchild, who had just arrived.

Dominic's entrance coincided with spotting Frederick holding court beside Victoria.

After an aide briefed him—identifying Frederick as an AI luminary whose decade-long contributions had shaped the field, and more importantly, Victoria's advisor—Dominic's expression darkened.

When Frederick began pressuring Alexander about marriage, Dominic's jaw tightened imperceptibly.

No trace of amusement touched his features.

Isabella and Nathaniel noticed his arrival but pointedly ignored him.

Though disillusioned with Nathaniel, Dominic felt obligated by their business ties and approached with stiff formality.

But unlike previous encounters—where he'd desperately tried to ingratiate himself despite cold shoulders—his tone now carried distinct frost.

Nathaniel didn't bother with pretense either. With a derisive snort, he said, "Mr. Fairchild, if pleasantries pain you, spare us both. Henceforth, outside the boardroom, we're strangers."

Dominic's response came icily. "As you wish, Mr. Graves."

His glare flickered to Isabella with equal venom.

Nathaniel nearly laughed at the sheer audacity.

Just then, Frederick spotted Nathaniel.

Nathaniel's international reputation had preceded him—in fact, he was the primary reason for Frederick's Salzburg visit.

As a legend from AI's pioneering generation, Frederick had been eager to meet this era's rising star.

Without pretense, he strode forward with outstretched hand.

"Mr. Graves, what an honor. Your team's latest breakthrough has captivated me—I've longed for substantive dialogue with you."

Nathaniel's YodaVision had shattered Salzburg's AI monopoly with their Infinite-CM project, leapfrogging competitors and dealing a crippling blow to the industry.

Their achievement had left foreign engineers scrambling. The more desperate they grew, the more they craved insights into Nathaniel's methodology.

Thus, Frederick wasn't alone—countless top-tier engineers worldwide coveted this very opportunity.

The problem? Until now, access had been impossible.

And Frederick wasn't about to waste this chance.
###Chapter 373

Frederick Langley's true intention was merely to uncover the core technology behind Infinite-CM.

Nathaniel Graves shook his hand with practiced ease.

"Professor Langley, you flatter me. I've studied your seminal papers on recurrent neural networks and attention mechanisms over a dozen times—they've fundamentally shaped my research approach."

"The honor is entirely mine."

Frederick naturally wished to prolong their discussion. However, the conference opening ceremony was imminent.

Before they could continue, staff members ushered them to their designated seats.

Following the organizers' introductory remarks, Frederick, Nathaniel, and other distinguished guests delivered their keynote addresses.

Every attendee sought opportunities to network with these two luminaries.

When the first session concluded, both men found themselves swarmed by corporate delegations and academics alike.

Isabella Sinclair, Julian Montgomery, Kieran Blackwood, and Dominic Fairchild had no need to jostle through the crowd. They remained on the periphery, observing quietly.

Alexander Whitmore similarly had no reason to push forward.

But accompanying Victoria Kensington placed him squarely at the center of attention.

His simple gesture—twisting open a water bottle for her—drew another wave of envious glances from surrounding women.

Many industry experts and executives who knew of Alexander and Victoria's relationship had previously questioned his choice.

Given his aristocratic lineage and professional accomplishments, why choose someone like Victoria? While undeniably beautiful with respectable academic credentials, her family background paled in comparison.

Now, discovering she was Frederick Langley's protégé, everything clicked into place.

Previously, people tolerated Victoria out of deference to Alexander. Now, knowing her academic pedigree, their courtesy transformed into genuine enthusiasm.

Victoria noticed everything—the women's jealous stares, the businessmen's sudden deference.

Accepting the water bottle, she took a measured sip and smiled faintly.

Her gaze drifted toward those excluded from the inner circle—Isabella, Dominic, and their group.

Dominic's astonishment was palpable. His wide-eyed admiration couldn't be concealed.

Kieran Blackwood appeared equally shocked, though Victoria remained unsurprised.

Then her eyes met Isabella's.

The other woman's expression remained impassive, as if entirely unaffected.

Victoria suppressed a sneer.

Was Isabella truly indifferent? Or merely pretending aloofness?

After all, she now stood as Frederick Langley's student—a height Isabella could never hope to reach. She could only gaze upward in envy.

Isabella caught the fleeting contempt in Victoria's eyes. Though uncertain of the exact thoughts, the gist was obvious.

Amused, she returned an icy, dismissive glance.

Victoria interpreted this as forced composure.

Shifting her attention to Julian and Kieran, she noticed Kieran's focus remained entirely on Isabella—as if no one else existed.

But Kieran wasn't one to judge by superficialities.

Having witnessed Isabella's capabilities, he'd never genuinely favor someone like Victoria.

Therefore, his apparent fixation on Isabella didn't concern her in the slightest.

As for Julian, he stared in her direction, visibly stunned.

Victoria smiled.

He'd always recognized her talents, but likely never anticipated this level of distinction.

Would he still harbor feelings for Isabella now?

Frederick genuinely wished to engage Nathaniel in substantive dialogue. But between Nathaniel's schedule and the organizers' demands, no opportunity arose.

At lunch, Nathaniel excused himself for another engagement, departing with Isabella and their group.

As they passed Alexander and Victoria, Isabella kept her gaze forward. Alexander, engrossed in conversation, didn't so much as glance her way.

Frederick's Ceravelle visit concluded on the conference's second day. He left disappointed by the missed opportunity for deeper technical exchange.

But his regret proved short-lived.

Shortly before departure, he told Victoria with visible excitement: "NMI's latest issue received an extraordinary submission—innovative perspective, impeccable methodology. The review panel was thoroughly impressed. Once published, I'd love substantive discussions with the author."

As both a world-renowned professor and NMI reviewer, Frederick was technically barred from pre-publication disclosures about submissions—including personal evaluations.

But given his stature, he doubted anyone would challenge this minor confidentiality breach.

Intrigued by his praise, Victoria eagerly anticipated the journal's release.

Fortunately, NMI's new issue would publish imminently.

She understood Frederick wouldn't have mentioned this unless he held high expectations for her.

"I understand, Professor. When the issue releases, I'll study that paper thoroughly."

Frederick nodded approvingly. "Excellent."

After seeing him off at the airport, Victoria finally returned home.
###Chapter 374

Several days after the International AI Summit, Isabella found herself at The Grandeur Hotel one evening. She was attending her cousin William's wedding reception.

The elevator doors were about to close when a voice called out, "Hold that!"

A hand shot between the closing doors. Isabella's breath caught when she recognized Julian Kensington.

He seemed equally surprised to see her. Though they'd only met briefly months ago, he gave her a polite nod.

Then Victoria Kensington appeared beside him. Her eyes flickered with recognition before she deliberately looked away, pretending not to know Isabella.

Julian reached for the control panel, noticing the 18th floor was already lit. He opened his mouth to make conversation.

Isabella turned her face sharply to the side, her posture rigid with rejection. Julian swallowed his words.

He wrapped an arm around Victoria instead, who patted his hand with a practiced smile.

Isabella observed them silently from her corner.

When the elevator chimed at the 18th floor, a wave of laughter and chatter greeted them.

Following the Kensingtons out, Isabella found herself in a packed ballroom.

Reginald and Eleanor Kensington stood by the entrance in formal attire, greeting guests for Victoria's 70th birthday celebration.

The realization hit Isabella like a physical blow. Of course - the elegant outfit, the hotel booking. How could she have forgotten?

"Here comes our birthday queen!" someone announced as Victoria entered.

Then eyes turned to Isabella.

"Lady Kensington, is this your granddaughter?" a guest gushed. "No wonder she captured Salzburg's most eligible bachelor!"

"Such striking beauty! She even resembles you in your youth. What a blessing!"

Isabella's fingers curled into fists. She needed to leave, but the crowd was too thick.

The Sinclair family stood nearby, visibly shocked to see Isabella arrive with Victoria.

For a wild moment, they wondered if Victoria had actually invited her.

Impossible.

They quickly realized Isabella must have taken the wrong elevator - a common mistake for first-time visitors.

When another guest commented on Isabella's resemblance to Victoria, her expression turned glacial.

Before she could respond, Victoria cut in sharply, "You're mistaken. She's no relation of mine. I don't know this woman."

At that exact moment, Alexander Whitmore and Victoria Kensington emerged from another elevator.

"Ah, here's the real granddaughter!" someone announced.

All attention shifted to the striking pair.

Given their status, the guests immediately began showering them with compliments.

"Such presence! Only a top scientist's protégé could carry herself like this. Ordinary people simply can't compare."
###Chapter 375

Isn't that obvious?

Dominic Fairchild, Oliver Westbrook, and their group stood nearby.

They were unaware of the long-standing feud between Isabella Sinclair and the Kensington family. When they heard Beatrice Kensington claim the guests had confused someone else for her granddaughter, they barely reacted.

Reginald Kensington and Beatrice Kensington remained silent, offering no defense for Isabella.

Genevieve Kensington watched the scene unfold with smug satisfaction.

Sophia Whitmore seemed like she wanted to speak up, but with so many influential people present, she kept her head down instead.

At that moment, Margaret Sinclair emerged from the elevator with William and Thomas Sinclair.

Isabella?

The moment they stepped out and saw the crowd, William and Thomas froze when they spotted Isabella preparing to leave.

Hearing Thomas's voice, Isabella turned and saw her grandmother and cousins.

Then Margaret's gaze landed on Alexander Whitmore.

But at the same time, she also noticed Reginald Kensington, Eleanor Kensington, and the rest of the Kensington clan.

Isabella pressed her lips together before turning back to Margaret. Taking her grandmother's arm gently, she said, "Grandmother, the celebration is this way."

For her 70th birthday, Beatrice had invited Salzburg's elite families and prominent figures. Among them were those who remembered the bitter history between the Kensingtons and Sinclairs.

Though decades had passed since they'd last seen Margaret, recognition dawned immediately.

When they heard Isabella address her and saw the striking woman appeared to be in her mid-twenties, they quickly realized this must be Beatrice's other granddaughter.

The one who hadn't been seen at any Kensington family events since Reginald divorced his first wife.

Rumors had circulated for years that after his remarriage, Reginald had completely abandoned his daughter from his first marriage.

Most had dismissed it as idle gossip.

But witnessing Beatrice's cold dismissal of Isabella today, they realized the rumors might hold truth.

More telling was Reginald's silence throughout the entire exchange.

Clearly, he had no intention of acknowledging his daughter either.

Years ago, when Reginald insisted on divorcing the well-connected Sinclair heiress to marry a woman of modest means, many had thought him mad.

Later, they heard the Sinclair family had nearly gone bankrupt, their former glory fading. Meanwhile, the Kensingtons - thanks to the granddaughter from that other woman - had risen spectacularly in social standing.

It was said Beatrice's grandson showed exceptional promise too.

Seeing the Kensingtons' current prosperity contrasted with the Sinclairs' decline, many now wondered if Beatrice and Reginald had made the right choice after all.

This very prosperity explained why so many had traveled from Salzburg to attend Beatrice's birthday celebration.

Among the guests were members of Salzburg's uppermost elite circles - people the Kensingtons could never have associated with before.

Yet today, these very people had come when summoned.

Even without personal connections to the Kensingtons, they'd honored the invitation.

This alone spoke volumes about the family's newfound influence.
###Chapter 376

The moment the Salzburg elite recognized Margaret Sinclair, they noticed the Kensingtons deliberately avoiding any mention of her presence.

It became painfully obvious the Kensington family wanted to bury the past between the Sinclairs and Kensingtons.

Though several guests recognized Margaret, not a single one dared approach her.

Their attention quickly shifted to Julian and Victoria Kensington instead.

One bold guest even complimented Eleanor Kensington right in front of Isabella and Margaret, "Madam Kensington, your grandchildren are exceptional - both in appearance and bearing. You're truly blessed."

Indeed, Julian and Victoria were the pride of both Eleanor and the entire Kensington clan.

Eleanor didn't spare Isabella another glance.

At the compliment, she gazed adoringly at Julian and Victoria with a pleased smile. "You flatter them."

Whatever she said next, Isabella didn't hear. She and her family had already moved through the crowd and departed.

As for Alexander, after that initial glimpse, Isabella hadn't looked his way again.

Dominic and Oliver hadn't expected to encounter Isabella here either, let alone witness the awkward moment she'd been mistaken for Victoria.

They silently watched her leave.

Just then, Julian's assistant arrived with an ornate gift box for Eleanor.

Learning Julian couldn't attend the birthday banquet personally disappointed both the Kensingtons and their relatives.

The Kensington women especially - more disappointed than the men, and visibly anxious.

After Genevieve's recent scandal, both Penelope and Diana had pinned their hopes on a marriage alliance with Julian to salvage their reputation.

But now, Julian hadn't even bothered to show up.

Oliver seemed genuinely surprised by Julian's absence. He hadn't heard of any prior engagements.

Even Victoria hadn't anticipated Julian skipping such an important event.

Her brow furrowed unconsciously.

Alexander showed no reaction whatsoever.

Meanwhile, Isabella's family reached the banquet hall. Shortly after settling in, her phone rang.

Sophia's name flashed on the screen.

Isabella hesitated to answer, but Margaret - seeing the caller ID and remembering how Alexander and Victoria had appeared without Sophia - nudged her to pick up.

Feeling sorry for the girl left behind, Margaret insisted.

Isabella had reached the same conclusion.

Not wanting to ignore Sophia's call in front of Margaret, she excused herself to a quiet corner.

Sophia sounded thrilled Isabella answered. "Mom! Sunday is Mother's Day! I got you a present! Can we meet then?"

Mother's Day. The significance wasn't lost on Isabella.

After a brief pause, she replied softly, "Alright." Then asked, "Are you home alone right now?"

Sophia answered cheerfully, "Yes! Dad isn't back yet."

Isabella remained silent.

Technically, Sophia was Beatrice Kensington's great-granddaughter.

Victoria claimed to adore Sophia, yet hadn't brought her to this family celebration.

Was this what genuine love looked like?

The truth seemed so obvious - couldn't Alexander see it?

But then, blinded by his feelings for Victoria, he'd probably believe any flimsy excuse she offered.
###Chapter 377

Sunday was Mother's Day.

Sophia was driven to the Sinclair residence on Saturday by Alexander's chauffeur.

Her Mother's Day gift for Isabella was a handmade card. In careful cursive, she'd written: "Happy Mother's Day, Mom. Love you." Just six simple words.

"Beautiful, isn't it?" Sophia beamed. "The teacher said I could ask Dad for help, but he's been swamped with work. I did everything myself - the design, the drawings, even gluing these tiny hearts."

It had been months since Isabella last saw Sophia's schoolwork. The girl's handwriting had improved remarkably.

Holding the card, Isabella suddenly remembered last year's incident. She'd flown all the way to Salzburg to celebrate her birthday with Sophia and Alexander, only to find her daughter polishing a bracelet for Victoria Kensington.

According to Sophia, that bracelet had been a joint project with Alexander.

Isabella's expression remained neutral despite the memory.

She closed the card gently. "It's lovely. Thank you."

The next day, Isabella received a call from Frederick Aldridge. That evening, she returned to the military base.

When Sebastian Ashford entered the data center, he stopped abruptly at the sight of Isabella working intensely.

She didn't notice him at first.

Only when she reached for her water glass did she spot Sebastian standing across the room, watching her.

A brief nod. Then back to work.

Sebastian had come for a specific purpose.

After concluding his meeting, he noticed Isabella still at her station and approached.

"It's late. Aren't you going to eat?"

Isabella looked up. "Soon."

Sebastian nodded and left her to her work.

Later, exiting the data center, Isabella found Sebastian waiting outside. Clearly, he'd been standing there for some time.

Hearing footsteps, he turned. "Finished? Heading to the mess hall?"

"Yes. You?"

"Care to join me?"

Isabella paused, realizing he'd waited for her. Probably didn't want to interrupt her work earlier.

Sebastian met her gaze. "You must have seen the footage from my mission last week. In a way, you saved my life."

Every pilot had unique flight patterns - unconscious habits formed through experience.

In this age of advanced AI, such patterns could be digitized and exploited by enemies.

Based on his combat history and enemy data, Isabella's system had flagged his intended maneuver as predictable. It provided counterstrategies, accurately predicting enemy positions and suggesting optimal attack vectors.

That system's guidance had kept him alive.

Isabella understood immediately. "Providing that support is our job. Besides, you kept your cool and made the right call. You saved yourself."

Perhaps it was her duty, but since that mission, Sebastian had heard nothing but praise for Isabella throughout the base - particularly about her data analysis skills and tactical intuition.

Just as Sebastian was about to respond, Frederick approached.

"Come with me," he said to Isabella.
###Chapter 378

Isabella gave a quick nod to Frederick, then turned to Sebastian. "Sorry, I can't join you for lunch today."

Sebastian smiled gently. "No problem."

With that, Isabella walked away.

Sebastian watched as she left with Frederick before heading to the cafeteria alone.

He hadn't taken leave in months. Two days after meeting Isabella, his official vacation began.

Those two days passed without seeing her again.

When he returned home, his family didn't even know he was on leave - everyone was occupied with their own busy lives.

Dominic called him out for dinner when he heard Sebastian was back.

Over the meal, Simon couldn't resist sharing some gossip. "Can you believe the woman Dominic likes turns out to be Frederick Langley's protégé? She's quite impressive."

Sebastian wasn't familiar with AI development and didn't recognize Frederick's name.

Simon knew Sebastian wouldn't know. He himself had only recently learned about it - thanks to Dominic.

Normally, Sebastian showed little interest in such topics.

But after a moment's thought, he suddenly asked, "Between Frederick Langley and our own Mr. Aldridge, who has more influence in AI?"

Simon wasn't sure.

Dominic knew the answer. "Mr. Aldridge."

Frederick had achieved multiple groundbreaking innovations in AI single-handedly. His team had broken through numerous foreign technological barriers against Salzburg's AI industry.

He'd paved the way for the country's current advancements, earning deep respect - even fear - from the international community.

Salzburg's AI success largely owed to Frederick.

While Frederick was remarkable, he still couldn't compare to Frederick.

Even though Dominic didn't care for Nathaniel, he could separate that from his respect for Frederick.

Frederick was Frederick. Nathaniel was Nathaniel.

Sebastian rarely inquired about unrelated matters. His question today seemed unusual.

Still, given Frederick's reputation and their familiarity with him, neither Dominic nor Simon found the question odd.

After that topic ended, Dominic suddenly chuckled. "Last week at dinner with my mom and yours, your mother mentioned arranging blind dates for you. Now that you're back, I doubt you'll escape it this time."

Sebastian was at marriageable age. His family had started bringing it up early last year.

Back then, he hadn't objected or particularly cared.

But now...

He lowered his gaze without responding.

That evening, barely spending time with family, Sebastian received an urgent call. His leave was abruptly cut short, forcing him back to base.

He didn't know if Isabella had already left or was simply assigned elsewhere.

Three days later, after completing a mission, he checked the data center. No sign of her.

Two more days passed. Still nothing.

Finally, four or five days later after another mission, he spotted her in the cafeteria.

He paused when he saw her sitting alone, quietly eating.

After a moment, he approached and sat across from her.

Isabella looked up and smiled faintly. "You're back?"

"Just returned." Sebastian studied her. "I didn't see you last week - thought you might have left."

"I've been here," she replied. "Just not in the data center much."

Sebastian nodded, then asked what had been on his mind. "When are you leaving?"

Assuming small talk, Isabella answered casually, "Tomorrow."

"So soon?"

"It's been over ten days already." She wiped her lips. "I'm finished. Take your time. I should—"

Before she could finish, Sebastian suddenly asked, "Ms. Sinclair, are you seeing anyone?"

Isabella froze - completely unprepared for the question.

Before she could respond, he continued, "If you're single... what do you think of me?"

He knew it was abrupt. But with their busy schedules and her rare appearances at base, opportunities like this were scarce.

Who knew when they'd meet again?

Besides, someone else might make a move first.

Only then did Isabella realize - this was a confession.

Seeing her shocked expression, as if the idea had never occurred to her, Sebastian said, "You don't need to answer now. I just wanted you to know - if you ever consider a relationship, or marriage and family... I hope you'll think of—"

"I'm sorry." Isabella regained her composure, gently interrupting. "Thank you for your feelings, but I've already been married."
###Chapter 379

Isabella's communicator buzzed sharply, cutting off whatever Sebastian was about to say.

She glanced at the screen and immediately stood. "Emergency at the data center. I have to go."

The next morning found her leaving the military base behind.

After a day of rest at her apartment, she returned to The Grandeur headquarters.

The company had just formalized its partnership with Whitmore Technologies. Coincidentally, Nathaniel was scheduled for a meeting there on her first day back.

Unlike previous contract negotiations where she could delegate to Nathaniel or Joseph, this project demanded her direct involvement.

Today's agenda focused on core technology integration between the two corporations. Isabella accompanied Nathaniel to Whitmore Group's headquarters, with Kieran and other engineers in tow.

They reached the conference room just as Alexander approached from the opposite corridor with his assistants and Benjamin.

Alexander exchanged polite greetings with Nathaniel.

Benjamin hadn't seen Isabella since her departure from Whitmore Group, though Daniel had mentioned her new position at The Grandeur.

While Nathaniel had visited several times recently, this marked Isabella's first return.

Alexander's gaze slid over Isabella and Kieran without recognition, his expression carefully neutral as he ushered Nathaniel inside.

Kieran seemed equally disinterested in acknowledging any prior acquaintance.

Isabella offered Benjamin a small smile. "Mr. Hayes. It's been a while."

"You know each other?" Kieran asked.

"I used to work here," she replied simply.

Before further conversation could develop, Walter Pembroke entered - the Yardley University professor consulting on Whitmore's project.

"My apologies for the delay."

"We just arrived ourselves," Nathaniel assured him.

Walter's attention immediately locked onto Nathaniel. "Mr. Graves! Your reputation precedes you. I've been hoping for this introduction."

"You flatter me, Professor Pembroke."

The meeting commenced promptly at 9 AM, stretching until noon. Discussion of technical specifications flowed between Nathaniel, Alexander's team leads, and Walter while Isabella's group took meticulous notes.

Afterwards, Alexander invited everyone to lunch.

As they exited, Walter turned to Alexander. "I haven't seen Victoria in months. With her studying under Professor Langley in Salzburg now, opportunities will be even scarcer. Might we invite her to join us?"

Nathaniel gave a noncommittal nod. "No objection here."

"You're acquainted?" Alexander asked.

"I mentored her during undergrad," Walter explained. "Even then, her aptitude was extraordinary. Studying under Frederick Langley only confirms her potential."

Alexander pulled out his phone. "I'll arrange it."

Thirty minutes later at the restaurant, Victoria arrived with Genevieve and Penelope.

"Professor!" Victoria greeted Walter warmly before her gaze flickered to Nathaniel.

"Mr. Graves, you and Victoria must be well acquainted by now?" Walter prompted.

Nathaniel's response was curt. "We've met."

Walter beamed. "Two rising stars in the field! You should exchange ideas more frequently."

Victoria's smile tightened at Nathaniel's indifferent expression.

She'd expected recognition after he learned of her connection to Frederick Langley - some acknowledgment of their shared professional sphere. Yet his demeanor remained unchanged, his eyes skating over her with the same detached politeness as always.

###Chapter 380

Exchange thoughts? That was laughable. Nathaniel Graves and Victoria Kensington had absolutely nothing meaningful to discuss.

With so many people around, he certainly wouldn't voice that opinion to Walter. Their acquaintance was merely superficial at best.

Nathaniel offered a polite smile. "You're absolutely right, Professor."

Walter Pembroke held considerable prestige in Salzburg's AI research circles.

Both the Kensington and Sinclair families assumed Nathaniel would show more interest in Victoria since she studied under Frederick Langley, a luminary in the field.

Hearing Walter's admiration for Victoria, Genevieve shot Isabella Sinclair a smug look.

Victoria trained under someone as distinguished as Frederick Langley. But Isabella? Who was she? Compared to Victoria, Isabella was insignificant.

Eleanor Kensington, Reginald Kensington, and their companions shared the same opinion.

When Alexander Whitmore had called Victoria earlier, Eleanor and the others had been present.

Upon hearing about the group lunch, they'd decided to join. Not that they intended to freeload - they simply happened to be dining at the same venue.

Discovering they were Victoria's family, Walter extended the invitation.

Turning to Nathaniel, he inquired, "Mr. Graves, I was wondering if—"

Nathaniel's gaze shifted to Isabella.

She showed no objection.

Respecting Walter's seniority, Nathaniel chose not to embarrass him.

Amused internally, he maintained a courteous expression. "Mr. Whitmore is hosting today. If he has no objections, neither do I."

The party moved into a private dining room.

Isabella seated herself beside Nathaniel while Kieran Blackwood took the chair on her other side.

Victoria positioned herself between Alexander and Walter.

After preliminary small talk, Walter and Victoria began discussing Frederick. Their conversation had barely started when Victoria's phone pinged with a notification.

Reading the message, she smiled at Walter. "The latest issue of NMI just published."

Indeed, the newest NMI edition had released today.

This wasn't exactly breaking news—aside from the Kensingtons and Sinclairs, nearly everyone at the table followed top-tier AI journal updates closely.

Most attendees were already aware without Victoria's announcement.

But Victoria had more to share.

She added, "My advisor, Professor Langley, served as reviewer for this issue. He just messaged saying one particular paper stood out remarkably—he believes it's essential reading for all of us."

Her words instantly captured everyone's attention—including Isabella and Nathaniel.

Walter appeared particularly intrigued.

Given Frederick's stature in AI, such high praise indicated something extraordinary.

Walter asked, "Which paper?"

Victoria held up her phone and read the title Frederick had sent her.

The group silently committed it to memory.

Upon hearing the title, Nathaniel arched an eyebrow with an amused smile, turning to Isabella.

She simply sipped her tea with a knowing smile.

The NMI journal—both print and digital versions—had released globally simultaneously.

For a paper to earn Frederick's effusive praise? Walter practically vibrated with the urge to access it immediately.

Yet social decorum demanded restraint.

Still, he couldn't help remarking, "Sounds like it must focus on attention mechanisms."

Victoria nodded. "Precisely."
###Chapter 381

The moment the words left his lips, three sharp raps echoed through the private dining room.

Oliver Westbrook and Julian Montgomery stood at the threshold.

Oliver swung the door open, his eyebrows shooting up at the crowded scene. "Well, this is quite the gathering."

The restaurant belonged to his family.

He and Julian had come for a casual lunch. When the manager mentioned Alexander Whitmore was dining here, they'd decided to pop in for greetings—never expecting such an assembly.

And every face looked familiar.

Taking in the crowd, Oliver immediately decided their planned quiet meal would be dull by comparison. "Alexander, since it's already a party, mind if Julian and I crash it?"

Alexander turned to Walter Pembroke. "Professor Pembroke, Mr. Graves, would you—"

Having just invited the Kensingtons himself, Walter could hardly refuse Alexander's friends now.

Walter smiled graciously. "By all means. Mr. Graves?"

Nathaniel Graves' lips curved slightly. "Mr. Westbrook and Mr. Montgomery are old acquaintances. I've no objections." Initially irritated by the Kensingtons' presence, Nathaniel now felt differently.

He nearly wished the entire restaurant would squeeze into the room—how could he possibly mind two more?

Meanwhile, Genevieve Kensington—who'd been longing to see Julian—couldn't contain herself upon spotting him. She rose abruptly. "Julian, come sit by me."

Julian ignored her completely. He and Oliver had chairs placed beside Alexander instead.

They'd barely settled when another knock sounded.

This time, Dominic Fairchild entered with three lead engineers from his company—partners in Whitmore Enterprises' current project.

Pausing at the sight before him, Dominic's expression flickered with surprise.

Not at spotting Isabella Sinclair or Nathaniel—Alexander collaborating with YodaVision was public knowledge now.

What stunned him was seeing Victoria Kensington seated with the entire Kensington clan.

After a brief glance at Victoria, Dominic offered a curt nod. "My apologies for interrupting."

Alexander waved it off. "Not at all. We've only just begun. Please join us, Mr. Fairchild."

Before sitting, Dominic addressed Walter. "Professor Pembroke, what an honor. I've long admired your work."

"Ah, Mr. Fairchild. The pleasure is mutual," Walter replied.

Benjamin Hayes had reserved an expansive private room with a table easily accommodating thirty.

Even with Victoria, Julian, Oliver and the others added, space remained ample.

Once seated, Dominic inquired, "What were you discussing?"

Walter summarized the conversation succinctly.

"I see," Dominic nodded, then turned to Victoria. "For Professor Langley to personally message you—he must hold you in exceptionally high regard."

Victoria's smile was demure. "I'm deeply honored by Professor Langley's mentorship. I'll study his recommended paper thoroughly—I won't disappoint him."

With both Walter and Frederick Langley endorsing her, Dominic felt genuine happiness for Victoria. Simultaneously, his admiration—and affection—for her grew.

His gaze lingered on her face with palpable reluctance. But with Alexander present, he eventually looked away.

Victoria, naturally, sensed Dominic's escalating interest.

She hadn't forgotten Julian's absence at her grandmother's birthday, and it still rankled.

Her eyes flicked toward him—only to find Julian sipping tea quietly, neither looking her way nor reacting to the praise showered upon her.

A faint crease appeared between her brows before she turned away.

Once again, Victoria Kensington became the room's radiant center—much to the Kensingtons' delight.
###Chapter 382

Genevieve smirked at Isabella.

Eleanor Kensington felt genuine pride for her daughter.

Isabella, as always, didn't even glance their way.

She quietly sipped her tea, fading into the background while Walter Pembroke and Dominic Fairchild conversed.

Seeing Victoria receive admiration from industry experts finally gave Dominic a sense of satisfaction.

Just then, Frederick Langley messaged Victoria again.

YodaVision is truly groundbreaking. Not only does it have Nathaniel Graves as founder, but his engineers are exceptionally innovative.

I plan to visit again soon for deeper discussions with Nathaniel and his team.

The NMI journal's double-blind review process meant Frederick still didn't know who wrote the paper that impressed him so much.

Victoria assumed he regretted not speaking more with Nathaniel during their last meeting.

As she began typing a comforting reply, Walter turned to his student. "Couldn't wait to read the paper, could you?"

"Absolutely!" The student's eyes shone with excitement. "This paper improves large model processing efficiency tenfold! Engineers worldwide are studying it overnight."

"It's making international waves and trending in Salzburg. What's more - it's from YodaVision's team!"

Victoria froze mid-typing. Slowly, she looked up at Nathaniel.

Every eye in the room turned toward him.

Eleanor and the Kensington family frowned at the news.

Such an impressive achievement coming from Nathaniel's team?

Though given his capabilities, this wasn't surprising.

But knowing he supported Isabella - effectively opposing their family - left a bitter taste.

Worse still, the very paper Victoria's advisor praised came from Nathaniel's team. The irony stung.

Walter, however, beamed with genuine pleasure.

"Mr. Graves," he said warmly, "leading your team to such results again. Congratulations!"

Nathaniel simply smiled. "You flatter me, Professor Pembroke. I wasn't the first author."

"This breakthrough wasn't my doing. I merely assisted with minor technical details."

"Just the details?" The student checked his phone's author list. True enough, Nathaniel wasn't first author.

Instead, it read: Isabella Sinclair. Not only first author - but corresponding author too.

Nathaniel ranked second.

The following authors were all YodaVision engineers.

Walter squinted at the name. "First author is Sinclair?"

Victoria, Dominic, Oliver Westbrook, and the Kensingtons froze.

The paper came from YodaVision. Isabella worked at YodaVision.

Could it be...?

Impossible.

Not her.

Then Nathaniel spoke calmly. "Yes. Isabella Sinclair."
###Chapter 383

It was truly Isabella?

Though Dominic, Eleanor, and Genevieve weren't AI specialists and couldn't fully comprehend the revolutionary nature of Isabella's research, they recognized one undeniable fact—Victoria's mentor, Frederick, was a titan in the artificial intelligence field.

For such an internationally acclaimed authority to personally message Victoria, urging her to study this paper meticulously—that spoke volumes.

Adding to the weight, Walter's protégé had just revealed that Isabella's publication had sent shockwaves through global tech circles, with leading engineers pulling all-nighters to dissect her findings.

The implications were clear: Isabella's work carried serious academic clout. But how could someone like Isabella produce such groundbreaking research?

Walter, unaware of Isabella's complicated history with the Fairchilds and Kensingtons, hadn't yet read the paper himself.

Yet merely hearing it boosted language model efficiency for long-text processing by over ten times was enough to electrify him.

He turned sharply to Nathaniel. "This researcher Isabella Sinclair—is she present today?"

"She is," Nathaniel replied smoothly, gesturing toward Isabella. "Allow me to introduce Ms. Sinclair."

Isabella had maintained remarkable composure throughout—whether during the earlier Whitmore Group meeting or now—remaining quietly observant.

But her striking beauty made subtlety impossible. Even those unfamiliar with her had noted the elegant woman in their midst.

No one could have predicted her intellectual prowess.

When realization struck that she authored the paper shaking the AI community, Walter rose abruptly, crossing the room to offer a respectful handshake.

"Ms. Sinclair, I'm Walter Pembroke from Yardley University. My life's work focuses on foundational AI theory and practical applications. This is an honor."

Isabella stood gracefully, accepting his hand. "Professor Pembroke, you flatter me. The privilege is mine."

Walter's deferential manner was so pronounced that observers might have mistaken him for the junior scholar and Isabella the esteemed veteran.

Genevieve's nails dug into her palms.

One paper. Was this spectacle really necessary?

Eleanor's lips thinned.

Nathaniel turned to Victoria with calculated politeness. "Ms. Kensington, you mentioned studying this research intensively."

"Should questions arise, I'm certain Isabella would be delighted to provide guidance."

Victoria's jaw clenched.

A distinguished professor from a top-tier university was fawning over Isabella, and now Nathaniel suggested Victoria seek her rival's tutelage?

Genevieve exploded from her seat. "This is absur—"

"Preposterous!" she nearly shrieked. "Victoria holds a PhD from an Ivy League institution! Who is Isabella? Some undergraduate! Expecting Victoria to beg for her help? Are you mocking us?"

"One paper doesn't prove superiority!"

Those were the words Genevieve wanted to hurl. But Victoria cut her off with icy composure. "Mr. Graves is correct. I'd welcome the opportunity to consult Ms. Sinclair."

Her adaptability was chilling.

Nathaniel's internal scoff went unnoticed.

He knew the bitter history between Isabella and Victoria. Suggesting academic deference was a masterstroke of public humiliation.

Dominic's expression darkened.

While he didn't grasp the paper's technical merits, Nathaniel's apparent slight against Victoria ignited matching outrage.

So Frederick praised it? Still just one paper. This has gone too far, he fumed silently.

Eleanor's face turned glacial.

Genevieve, though seething at being silenced, couldn't protest further after Victoria's strategic retreat.

Just then, Nathaniel's assistant, Victoria Chambers, leaned in. "Mr. Graves, Professor Langley called. He's arriving in Salzburg shortly and requests meetings with you and Ms. Sinclair."

Nathaniel waved dismissively. "Decline."

"Understood." The assistant turned to Isabella. "Professor Langley emphasized he'd fly in solely to meet you if necessary."

"He finds your insights revolutionary and desires in-depth discussion."

Isabella didn't blink. "Regrettably, I'm unavailable. Please convey my apologies."

"Of course."

Dominic and Genevieve exchanged stunned glances.

Frederick wasn't just admiring from afar—he'd cross continents for a conversation? How significant was this research?

Victoria understood Frederick's stature better than anyone.

Hearing her revered mentor practically begging for Isabella's attention turned her complexion ashen.

Oliver, unfamiliar with AI luminaries, decided to investigate the online buzz.

His phone search yielded shocking results—Isabella's paper dominated tech forums, comment sections overflowing with accolades.

Netizens hailed Isabella and Nathaniel as pioneers dismantling Salzburg's AI monopoly, catapulting Ceravelle into technological leadership.

He shot Isabella an incredulous look before whispering to Alexander, "Is she really this brilliant?"
###Chapter 384

Alexander's phone buzzed before he could answer.

He excused himself to take the call outside. When he returned, servers were already bringing out the first course.

Oliver's unanswered question hung in the air, dismissed as easily as yesterday's news.

The brilliant mind behind the groundbreaking paper that had engineers worldwide scrambling for copies sat casually across the table.

As lunch progressed, Walter and his students couldn't resist peppering Isabella with questions about the paper's core concepts and experimental data.

Whether they asked about specific sections or broader industry challenges, Isabella answered each query with effortless confidence.

Victoria observed quietly, her expression unreadable.

Watching Isabella hold her own against Walter's intellectual probing almost made her seem... competent.

But was that truly possible?

Given Nathaniel's reputation, if he'd credited Isabella as first author, he must have prepared her thoroughly.

Her initial shock at Nathaniel's announcement still lingered.

If this paper truly represented Isabella's independent work as Nathaniel implied, wouldn't that make her more accomplished than her own advisor, Frederick?

Impossible.

She wasn't Nathaniel.

The world had many bright minds, but few reached his caliber.

More likely, Nathaniel had written the paper himself and was simply elevating Isabella's reputation.

Satisfied with this conclusion, Victoria cast a dismissive glance at Isabella before looking away.

Eleanor and Genevieve shared Victoria's skepticism.

Hot-tempered Genevieve grew visibly agitated watching Isabella dispense advice to Walter like some esteemed expert.

She barely restrained herself from exposing the charade. But with neither Eleanor nor Victoria speaking up, she bit her tongue despite her fury.

Dominic had initially doubted Isabella's credentials too. But seeing Walter's genuine excitement and focused attention as they spoke, his certainty wavered.

Could she actually be this brilliant?

The meal stretched on unexpectedly.

Before parting, Isabella and Walter exchanged contact information.

Walter, realizing he'd monopolized Isabella's time, turned apologetically to Alexander. "My apologies, Mr. Whitmore. Once we started discussing the research, I completely lost track—"

"Not at all," Alexander interrupted smoothly. "Today's lunch was precisely for everyone to become acquainted. It'll make future collaborations more productive."

As the group dispersed, Julian finally seized his chance to approach Isabella.

"Congratulations," he said simply.

"Thank you," Isabella replied.

Oliver noticed Julian's approach but dismissed it as mere politeness.

Alexander observed Julian speaking with Isabella, his expression unreadable before he looked away.

Victoria's lips pressed into a thin line.

Did Julian actually believe in Isabella's professional competence? Was that why he fancied her?

But no—that couldn't be it.

Julian had shown interest in Isabella long before Montgomery Enterprises partnered with VisionTech.

His attraction clearly had nothing to do with her supposed brilliance.

Alexander's voice broke her thoughts. "Something on your mind?"

Victoria blinked, composing herself.

Seeing how Isabella had stolen the spotlight today while Alexander barely glanced her way, she forced a light smile. "Nothing important."

Whether Isabella's competence was real or fabricated—it didn't matter.

In Alexander's eyes, she might as well not exist.
###Chapter 385

Isabella couldn't care less about Alexander's opinion of her. His judgment meant nothing to her now.

After leaving The Grandeur, Isabella and Nathaniel's team returned to Salzburg Tech for their afternoon meeting.

Eleanor and Genevieve didn't join them this time. But Victoria did.

Seeing Victoria tagging along again, Nathaniel discreetly rolled his eyes. "Mr. Whitmore, regarding Ms. Kensington—"

Alexander anticipated his concern.

Before Nathaniel could finish, Alexander interrupted, "Confidentiality isn't an issue. If anything happens, I'll take full responsibility."

Nathaniel had heard this exact assurance before when they first partnered with InnovaTech.

Still, he needed verbal confirmation.

"Your word puts me at ease," Nathaniel replied with a tight smile.

During the morning session, Alexander had occupied the head chair alone. Now with Victoria present, he had an additional seat placed beside him.

Isabella noticed but quickly averted her gaze.

The meeting commenced.

With Nathaniel leading, Isabella and Kieran remained mostly silent observers.

Midway through, Isabella reached for a water bottle when her throat grew dry.

Kieran was quicker. "Thirsty?" He twisted the cap open before she could respond.

"Thanks," Isabella murmured, accepting the bottle.

Kieran leaned closer to whisper technical commentary about Nathaniel and Alexander's discussion points.

Their hushed exchange continued longer than necessary.

Victoria had already observed their closeness during lunch at The Grandeur.

Kieran had deliberately positioned himself beside Isabella then too.

But was his interest genuine?

Victoria knew Kieran's devotion to her. He'd changed his academic focus to AI for her sake, even returning to Ceravelle because of her.

Could his affections shift so rapidly?

She glanced at Alexander beside her. He'd also noticed Kieran's attentiveness toward Isabella.

Yet after one indifferent glance, Alexander dismissed the interaction entirely.

This observation sparked realization in Victoria.

Alexander knew Kieran's feelings for her.

If Kieran was pursuing Isabella now, his motives were clearly impure. Yet Alexander offered no warning.

Meaning even if Isabella got hurt by another man's advances, Alexander wouldn't intervene.

The revelation brought a faint smile to Victoria's lips.

Meanwhile, Dominic focused not on Kieran, but on Victoria and Alexander.

There was a time when Alexander and Isabella appeared close.

Dominic had worried Alexander might betray Victoria. But recently, their interactions had dwindled.

Perhaps Alexander had been momentarily captivated by Isabella's beauty, but ultimately remained loyal.

His heart still belonged to Victoria.

Today—whether at lunch or now—Alexander showed Isabella no special attention. This observation eased Dominic's concerns considerably.
###Chapter 386

Despite Isabella and Nathaniel's clear refusal through Victoria Chambers, Frederick Langley still appeared unannounced two days later.

His unexpected arrival left them with no choice but to grant him a brief audience.

They maintained polite professionalism during the fifteen-minute meeting before firmly concluding the discussion.

Subsequent meeting requests from Frederick were met with deliberate silence.

With the couple standing united, Frederick shifted tactics and invited Victoria Kensington to lunch the following day.

Over their meal, Frederick discussed industry trends before remarking, "Had you joined The Grandeur last year, your professional growth would have been remarkable. What a missed opportunity."

During their first encounter, Frederick had inquired about her career. Learning of her failed attempt to join The Grandeur, he'd remained neutral.

Now, revisiting the topic, his regret was palpable.

Victoria understood perfectly.

Isabella's groundbreaking paper had sent shockwaves through global tech circles.

Industry insiders speculated that The Grandeur's public disclosure of such significant research indicated even more advanced proprietary technologies remained undisclosed.

Victoria shared this belief.

Her initial interest in The Grandeur had stemmed from their unique programming language. She'd never anticipated their meteoric rise.

Had she known then what she knew now, she would have moved mountains to secure that position.

As Frederick noted, her career trajectory would have been entirely different.

With two years at The Grandeur, she could have single-handedly transformed her own tech startup.

Reflecting bitterly, she realized Isabella had cost her not just Nathaniel, but a pivotal career opportunity.

Frederick probed, "Still considering The Grandeur?"

The thought lingered, but Nathaniel's unwavering support for Isabella made it impossible.

She deflected, "I've established my own company now. We've even partnered with The Grandeur before. Given security protocols, Mr. Graves would never consider my application."

Frederick's disappointment showed as he murmured, "I see."

Friday morning found Isabella returning from her jog when Eleanor Whitmore's call came through with a dinner invitation.

The extended time since their last meeting made refusal unthinkable.

As Isabella prepared to accept, Eleanor added, "I'll invite Alexander and Olivia too. Does that bother you?"

Isabella's calm response held no pretense. "Not at all." And she meant it.

Professional obligations aside, Sophia's existence guaranteed continued interaction with Alexander.

Eleanor understood.

Isabella's easy acceptance signaled true emotional detachment.

She could now regard Alexander purely as Sophia's father. Sharing a civil meal meant nothing more. The realization left Eleanor torn between relief and melancholy.

After the call, Isabella headed to the office.

Her inbox held an email from Frederick.

He inquired about her travel history to Salzburg, offering to guide her through its natural wonders should she visit.

The message included introductions to Salzburg's tech leaders and current research trends among major corporations.

Though framed as a travel invitation, his recruitment intent was transparent.

By highlighting cutting-edge projects, he implied, "Your talents would be valued here."

Isabella saw through the ploy instantly.

Her polite reply declined any near-future travel plans before she closed her email client.

That evening found Isabella arriving at The Grandeur's private dining room where Eleanor waited.

No sooner had she taken her seat than the door burst open. "Mommy!"

Sophia's enthusiastic entrance forced Isabella to catch the flying child.

Margaret Dawson accompanied the girl, but Alexander was conspicuously absent.

As Sophia helped select dishes beside Isabella, Eleanor explained, "Alexander declined this morning. Said he was unavailable."

She huffed. "We'll enjoy ourselves without him. His presence wasn't essential anyway."

Isabella responded with a quiet, knowing smile.
###Chapter 387

The evening meal concluded, Sophia trailed behind Isabella back to the Sinclair estate.

That night, her phone buzzed with an incoming call from Walter, extending an invitation for her and Nathaniel to join him for golf the following morning.

Isabella accepted without hesitation. Yet when the location details arrived, her fingers froze mid-scroll.

The golf course happened to be Whitmore property. She'd walked those greens before.

Still, commitments were commitments. Backing out now would be poor form.

Saturday dawned bright and early as she pulled out of the driveway precisely on schedule.

Upon arrival, she spotted Walter, Theodore, and Richard already waiting near the clubhouse.

Walter's face lit up at their approach. "Right on time."

Isabella offered a polite nod.

"Ever swung a club before?" Walter asked, eyeing her athletic frame.

"I've had some lessons," she admitted.

After exchanging pleasantries, they moved onto the course, clubs in hand, conversation flowing easily between swings.

Just as Isabella was securing her driver back in the bag, two familiar figures materialized in the distance.

Alexander and Victoria.

Normally inseparable from Julian and Oliver, today the pair walked alone.

Having heard of Walter's presence from staff, they'd come to exchange greetings.

Victoria's step faltered upon recognizing Isabella and Nathaniel among the group.

Alexander, ever the diplomat, greeted Walter first. "Mr. Ashford."

Their families moved in overlapping circles. Though Richard Whitmore had been based overseas for years, business kept their connection alive.

"Alexander!" Walter clapped him on the shoulder. "Early bird catches the worm, eh?"

"Just keeping active," Alexander replied smoothly.

Both Theodore and Richard recognized the Whitmore family's ownership of the course. They'd played here often enough, yet rarely crossed paths with Alexander.

The coincidence of today's encounter didn't escape them.

Aware of the complicated history between Isabella and Alexander, they relaxed only when her expression remained neutral.

Nathaniel's jaw, however, had gone rigid.

While Alexander conversed with Walter's group, Isabella and Nathaniel maintained silence.

Unexpectedly, Alexander turned to Nathaniel. "Graves."

Nathaniel's response came through gritted teeth.

Walter, sensing tension, deftly changed course. "How's the InnovaTech collaboration progressing?"

Nathaniel's lips curled slightly. "Still ironing out the kinks."

Alexander smiled. "From our end, everything appears smooth. Should any issues arise, we welcome your feedback."

Nathaniel's grip tightened on his club. "The technical teams work well enough. It's the blurred lines between professional and personal that complicate matters." His gaze locked onto Alexander. "You understand my meaning."

The unspoken challenge hung in the air.

Victoria's fingers twitched at her sides.

Recognizing the precarious turn, Nathaniel added, "This isn't the place for shop talk. We'll address any concerns Monday."

"Of course," Alexander conceded.

Walter, ever the peacemaker, swiftly steered the conversation toward safer waters.
###Chapter 388

Alexander turned to Nathaniel with a casual smile. "Since you're already here, why not stay and join our discussion?"

Nathaniel nodded. "Of course."

After exchanging brief pleasantries, Alexander refocused on Walter, Theodore, and the others. "Where did we leave off?"

Theodore responded, "We were discussing protocol for handling foreign probes entering our territory."

Hearing this, Victoria's mind began racing.

Alexander's eyes sparkled as he turned to Isabella. "What's your take on this? Bella, any brilliant ideas?"

Neither Theodore nor Isabella had fully considered the scenario before Nathaniel and Victoria arrived.

Now that Alexander posed the question again, both hesitated momentarily.

When Victoria heard Alexander use Isabella's nickname, her attention snapped.

Bella? He addressed her so familiarly.

More unsettling was how Alexander's gaze softened whenever he looked at Isabella—genuine admiration shining through.

Victoria's fingers twitched involuntarily.

Just then, Isabella spoke up. "We could seize control of the probe and return it intact."

The moment the words left her lips, Alexander and Theodore burst into laughter.

Theodore's eyes lit up with realization, and he gave Isabella an approving thumbs-up.

Alexander didn't immediately evaluate the idea. Instead, his voice warmed. "You're that confident in your team's capabilities?"

Isabella paused, then shrugged. "It's... manageable?"

Walter chuckled. "True experts never doubt their abilities."

Alexander grinned. "Exactly."

Salzburg had always prioritized diplomacy, maintaining peaceful relations with neighboring nations.

Whether the intrusion was intentional or accidental, returning the probe would prevent unnecessary conflict.

On the surface, the approach appeared courteous—but in reality, it was a masterclass in demonstrating technological dominance.

Successfully hijacking another nation's probe without triggering its self-destruct mechanism would prove Salzburg's overwhelming technical superiority.

The offending party would be furious—but more importantly, wary.

Initially, Victoria didn't grasp the brilliance of Isabella's suggestion.

But as Alexander and the others dissected the technical implications, realization dawned. Isabella's solution wasn't just diplomatic—it was a strategic power play.

This...

She hadn't even considered that angle.

Victoria's expression darkened.

But even if Isabella spoke with such conviction—could she actually deliver?

Or had the international acclaim for her research paper inflated her ego to delusional heights?

As these thoughts swirled, Victoria caught Nathaniel's faint smile—as if he, too, admired Isabella's proposal.

Her breath hitched.

Did he actually believe in her—

Theodore's voice cut through her spiraling thoughts. "Nathaniel, you seem to share Bella's perspective?"

Nathaniel nodded. "I do."

Before Victoria could process this, Theodore pressed further. "Walk us through the strategic advantages."

Nathaniel outlined the key benefits with clinical precision.

Only after his explanation did Victoria fully comprehend the depth of the plan—extending beyond mere technology into geopolitical chess.

Meanwhile, Theodore, Alexander, and Nathaniel had instantly recognized all these layers the moment Isabella finished speaking.

But Victoria needed it spelled out.

Theodore's amused voice snapped her back to reality. "Ms. Kensington, you've been frowning for a while. Something unclear?"

Though his tone was light, the barb landed.

Heat flooded Victoria's cheeks.

Still, she forced composure. "Yes. I've just caught up with everyone's reasoning."
###Chapter 389

Alexander turned to Nathaniel with an easy smile. "Since you're here, why not stay awhile?"

Nathaniel nodded. "Of course."

After exchanging brief pleasantries, Alexander shifted his attention back to Walter, Theodore, and the others. "Where did we leave off?"

Theodore answered smoothly, "We were discussing protocol for foreign probes entering our territory."

At this, Victoria Kensington found herself drawn into contemplation as well.

Alexander's gaze flickered toward Isabella Sinclair, warm with approval. "Thoughts, Isa?"

Earlier, Theodore and Isabella hadn't had time to fully consider the scenario before Nathaniel and Victoria arrived.

Now, both paused briefly to gather their thoughts.

Hearing Alexander address Isabella so familiarly, Victoria stiffened.

Isa? Since when were they on nickname terms?

And the way Alexander looked at her—soft, admiring, as if she were someone extraordinary.

Victoria's fingers curled slightly.

Just then, Isabella spoke up. "We could take control of the probe and return it to them."

The moment the words left her lips, Alexander and Jonathan Sterling burst into laughter.

Theodore's eyes lit up with realization, and he gave Isabella an approving nod.

Alexander didn't immediately comment on the suggestion. Instead, his voice was warm with amusement. "That confident in your skills?"

Isabella tilted her head. "It shouldn't be too difficult?"

Walter Ashford chuckled. "Spoken like someone who truly knows what they're capable of."

Alexander grinned. "Exactly."

Salzburg had always advocated for peaceful relations with neighboring nations.

Whether the probe's entry was intentional or accidental, returning it would prevent unnecessary conflict.

On the surface, it was a diplomatic gesture.

In reality, it was a quiet but undeniable display of technological superiority.

If they could seize control of another nation's probe without triggering its security protocols, it would prove Salzburg's dominance in the field.

The other side would be furious—but also far more cautious in the future.

At first, Victoria didn't grasp the brilliance of Isabella's answer.

But as Alexander and the others dissected the technical implications, it clicked.

Isabella's solution wasn't just clever—it was a power move.

Victoria's lips pressed together.

She hadn't even considered that angle.

And yet—

Was Isabella truly capable of pulling it off?

Or had the international praise for her research paper gone to her head, making her overestimate herself?

Victoria's gaze flickered toward Nathaniel—only to catch the faintest hint of a smile on his lips.

As if he, too, admired Isabella's idea.

Her stomach twisted.

Did he actually believe she could—

Theodore's voice cut through her thoughts. "Nathaniel, seems you and Isa are on the same wavelength?"

Nathaniel nodded. "Yes."

Before Victoria could process that, Theodore continued, "Care to elaborate on the advantages?"

Nathaniel did, breaking down the strategic and technical benefits with effortless precision.

Only then did Victoria fully grasp the depth of the plan—the layers of diplomacy, deterrence, and sheer capability woven into it.

Meanwhile, Theodore, Alexander, and Nathaniel had understood instantly.

She had needed it spelled out.

Theodore's amused voice snapped her back to the present. "Ms. Kensington, you've been frowning this whole time. Something unclear?"

He'd noticed her delayed comprehension—and called her out on it, though his tone was light.

Heat rushed to Victoria's cheeks.

Still, she forced a composed smile. "Just catching up with the discussion."
###Chapter 390

The golf game ended sooner than expected.

Isabella and her group still had afternoon plans.

Alexander and Victoria had joined midway. Sensing they might be intruding on private arrangements, Alexander gracefully bowed out. "We have another engagement. Don't let us interrupt your day."

Nathaniel and Theodore exchanged glances before nodding. "Another time then."

Alexander gave a polite smile before escorting Victoria away.

Nathaniel visibly relaxed once they left. He leaned toward Isabella. "At least he knows social boundaries."

Isabella simply hummed in agreement.

Once out of earshot, Alexander studied Victoria's expression. "Upset?"

Two embarrassing missteps today had indeed dampened Victoria's mood. Seeing how effortlessly Isabella charmed Nathaniel's circle made her stomach churn.

She knew they were being deceived by Isabella's carefully constructed facade. Yet the bitterness remained.

"I made quite the spectacle today," Victoria forced a laugh. "Clearly I need more practice."

Alexander's gaze softened. "You have qualities she'll never possess. Don't dwell on trivialities." The words lifted Victoria's spirits slightly.

Today's events revealed Isabella's sharp wit and strategic thinking - unexpected traits that clearly impressed Alexander.

But only mildly.

Victoria noticed his admiration held no romantic interest. And despite her poor performance, Alexander's affection for her never wavered. In his eyes, she remained captivating.

Their departure wasn't truly about another engagement. Alexander had sensed her discomfort and orchestrated their exit to spare her further distress.

This realization dissolved her remaining gloom.

That afternoon around three, after tea with Nathaniel's group, Isabella returned to the Whitmore estate.

Sophia came running the moment she heard the door. "Mommy!"

Isabella caught her in a hug. "I'm back."

Earlier that morning, Sophia had pouted when left behind. But she seemed perfectly content now, having enjoyed her day without Isabella.

Just as Sophia began chattering, her phone rang.

Alexander's name flashed on screen. "Daddy?"

Isabella couldn't hear his words, but Sophia's response was enthusiastic. "Okay! I'll be ready!"

Hanging up, Sophia turned with mixed emotions. "Daddy's taking me to the new amusement park. His driver's coming soon."

Isabella's expression remained neutral. "Have fun."

Sophia hesitated, torn between staying and the promised adventure. When the car arrived, excitement won out.

After her departure, Isabella retreated to her office.

On Tuesday, Isabella arrived at Whitmore Technologies representing Nathaniel.

Benjamin personally greeted her and Victoria in the lobby. "Ms. Sinclair, right this way."

Isabella followed silently.

Instead of a conference room, Benjamin led her directly to Alexander's office - a space she knew intimately from her brief tenure as his secretary.

Less than a year had passed, yet it felt like another lifetime.

Alexander looked up from his documents as they entered. "You're right on time." He gestured to the seating area. "Please."
###Chapter 391

Isabella gave a slight nod and settled onto the sofa near the coffee table.

Alexander turned to his assistant. "Get us some coffee."

Benjamin responded immediately. "Already arranged."

The door opened as Olivia entered with a tray of coffee cups.

Her steps faltered when she saw Isabella. "Ms. Sinclair?"

Olivia had replaced Isabella at Whitmore Enterprises after her departure. They hadn't crossed paths since.

Isabella offered a polite smile. "It's been a while."

"Indeed it has." Olivia returned the smile but kept it brief, sensing the professional setting wasn't appropriate for small talk.

She carefully placed the coffee before both Isabella and Alexander. As she turned to leave, she suddenly remembered something and turned back to deliver a quick work update.

Alexander listened briefly before responding. "Understood. I'll be available after two. Have him come by then."

"Of course."

Olivia gave Isabella another polite nod before exiting quickly.

Isabella watched her go, absently stirring her coffee.

As head of the executive support team, Olivia's direct access to Alexander's office was standard procedure.

But during Isabella's tenure in the same position, she'd been restricted to communicating only through Alexander's two personal assistants.

In her entire two-year tenure, she'd only been permitted in Alexander's office when Daniel and Benjamin were swamped - and even then, just to deliver beverages.

Direct work reports? Never.

Alexander had kept her at arm's length completely.

The memory brought a wry smile to her lips as she took a careful sip.

Before leaving the company, Olivia had begged her for coffee-making lessons, which Isabella had provided in detail.

The first sip told her Olivia hadn't quite replicated her technique. A second taste confirmed it - different, but still excellent.

When she set her cup down, she noticed Alexander drinking his with evident satisfaction.

There was a time when Isabella had taken secret pride in being the only one who could make coffee to Alexander's exacting standards.

Now?

Just coffee. Preferences changed. Nothing significant.

Looking back, her younger self seemed almost laughably naive.

Alexander's voice pulled her from her thoughts. "Did Nathaniel brief you on our last discussion points?"

"Yes." Isabella straightened. "We can resume where you left off."

"Good." He nodded. "Regarding the mixed-precision architecture we discussed, particularly the parameter scaling issue - your proposed solution was exceptional. I've developed some complementary ideas."

"Of course." Isabella launched into a detailed explanation of their latest inference speed improvements.

Their technical discussion quickly dove into proprietary details of their joint project.

The specialized terminology left Daniel and Benjamin completely lost, reduced to silent observers.

Meanwhile, Alexander and Isabella engaged in rapid-fire technical dialogue.

As their discussion progressed, Daniel noticed something remarkable - Alexander's gaze held genuine professional respect when he looked at Isabella now.

An expression Daniel had never seen directed at her before.

More surprising still - Alexander wasn't just focused. He seemed to be enjoying their exchange, the ghost of a smile playing at his lips.

Daniel exchanged a stunned glance with Benjamin.

After over an hour of intense discussion, Walter and Theodore arrived.

Isabella had met Walter once before.

Theodore she knew better - Nathaniel had introduced them at a tech conference last year after she joined YodaVision.

Theodore, aware she was Frederick's protégé, had sought her out at an exhibition where they'd spoken at length.

He was well acquainted with her professional capabilities, having recently read her published paper.

"Ms. Sinclair, what a pleasure." Theodore greeted her warmly.

"Theodore, always good to see you."

After brief pleasantries, they dove straight into business.

They were deep in discussion when the door suddenly opened.

Victoria stood frozen in the doorway.

Isabella's expression remained perfectly neutral.

Realizing the meeting in progress, Victoria quickly apologized. "My apologies - I didn't realize you were in session. The office seemed empty so I didn't knock—"

Both Walter and Theodore knew of Victoria's relationship with Alexander.

As his girlfriend, her unannounced entries were hardly surprising.

They offered polite smiles, clearly unfazed.

Before anyone could speak, Victoria added, "Please don't let me interrupt—"

Walter waved a hand. "We're nearly finished anyway."

Most of the critical agenda items had already been addressed.

###Chapter 392

Alexander remained oblivious to the tension between Isabella and Victoria. He picked up where Walter had left off. "We were just discussing some industry breakthroughs."

"Ms. Kensington's insights would be valuable here," Walter added. "More perspectives could spark new ideas."

Victoria's response was measured. "I see."

Her gaze flickered toward Cole.

Isabella had intended to leave after the business discussions. But Walter and Theodore's enthusiasm had kept her engaged longer than planned.

Victoria's arrival provided the perfect exit opportunity.

Isabella rose gracefully. "It's getting late. Mr. Whitmore, Professor Pembroke, Professor Sinclair - we'll continue this another time."

Beyond Isabella's recent publication, several AI firms had made significant advancements. During their conversation, she'd quickly grasped each innovation's core.

The exchange had been intellectually stimulating. Both Theodore and Walter clearly wanted to prolong the discussion.

Theodore protested, "Must you leave? I wanted your thoughts on engine integration."

Though collaborating with Whitmore Group, such in-depth technical exchanges were rare. Walter added, "Yes, stay a while longer."

Isabella smiled politely. "Another time. I have prior commitments."

Seeing her resolve, they reluctantly acquiesced.

After bidding them farewell, Isabella turned to Alexander. Their handshake was professional. "Until next time, Mr. Whitmore."

Not just Theodore and Walter had enjoyed the conversation. Even Daniel and Benjamin noticed Alexander's rare engagement during the discussion.

They expected him to ask Isabella to stay.

Instead, Alexander simply returned the handshake. "Next time." He instructed Benjamin, "Please escort Ms. Sinclair out."

Benjamin suddenly understood Alexander's restraint. Without Victoria present, Alexander might have extended the conversation given his professional admiration for Isabella.

But with Victoria here, her feelings took precedence.

Any effort to keep Isabella would undoubtedly make Victoria overthink their history.

"Ms. Sinclair," Benjamin said courteously, "this way."

Isabella nodded. Without acknowledging Alexander or Victoria further, she departed with Benjamin and Victoria Chambers.

Victoria watched Isabella's retreating figure.

Recalling Theodore and Walter's eagerness, she asked lightly, "What were you discussing?"

Walter spoke first, admiration evident. "Ms. Sinclair possesses remarkable breadth in AI innovation. A rare polymath - truly impressive."

"Her insights expanded my thinking considerably," Theodore added. "That's why we wanted to continue. A real missed opportunity."

Victoria hadn't anticipated this.

Her smile faltered slightly before she regained composure. "I see."

Theodore chuckled. "Isabella's an AI prodigy. Brilliant mind, striking beauty. Nathaniel's a fortunate man."

An AI genius? Isabella?

And Nathaniel was lucky?

Theodore's praise elevated Isabella to near sainthood.

Though Victoria didn't know how Isabella had so thoroughly impressed them, their admiration reminded her of Walter Ashford and Arthur Langford.

They too had been captivated.

A single paper had won such favor from industry titans.

Victoria couldn't deny Isabella's skill.

But without genuine substance, the truth would eventually surface.

No matter Isabella's current acclaim, it was merely illusion - nothing substantive.

At this thought, Victoria lowered her head with a faint, knowing smile.

The Novel will be updated first on this website. Come back and continue reading tomorrow, everyone!
###Chapter 393

Theodore Sinclair's assistant remained unaware that both Isabella Sinclair and Nathaniel Graves were Frederick Aldridge's protégés.

When Theodore remarked on Nathaniel's good fortune in being with Isabella, his assistant chimed in, "During last night's interview, Mr. Graves mentioned that as Mr. Aldridge's student, he's always been held to exceptionally high standards."

"Mr. Aldridge insists he stays current with all cutting-edge advancements in the field and masters every technical breakthrough thoroughly."

"Whenever there are knowledge gaps, Mr. Aldridge personally fills them based on his own research."

"Ms. Sinclair is already highly competent. With Mr. Graves' guidance now, her growth will accelerate exponentially."

"Truly, this relationship benefits Ms. Sinclair tremendously."

While factually accurate...

One of Walter Pembroke's students immediately countered, "So you're suggesting Ms. Sinclair's earlier insights were merely regurgitations of Mr. Graves' and Mr. Aldridge's research?"

The unspoken implication hung heavy - Isabella wasn't the prodigy they'd imagined.

Though phrased diplomatically, everyone present, including Victoria Kensington, grasped the underlying meaning.

Walter appeared momentarily stunned, his disappointment palpable. He'd genuinely believed Isabella to be AI's rare polymath. This revelation shattered that perception.

Alexander Whitmore also fell silent.

Observing both men's reactions, Victoria allowed herself a subtle smile.

So Isabella's so-called brilliance was simply parroting Nathaniel and Frederick's analyses.

No wonder Theodore and Walter had been so impressed.

Alexander, while less effusive in his praise, had witnessed Isabella's technical discourse firsthand.

He too must have been momentarily dazzled.

But judging by his current expression, he'd realized the truth - Isabella's insights weren't her own.

The woman simply didn't possess that caliber of intellect.

Theodore, however, knew Isabella was also Frederick's student.

Their previous AI discussions and her leadership in developing YodaVision's revolutionary programming language proved her technical prowess.

He remained convinced the ideas she'd presented originated from her own research.

As Frederick's protégé, such brilliance was entirely plausible.

But these details were confidential, leaving Theodore unable to defend her publicly.

Isabella remained oblivious to the office drama.

After leaving Whitmore Group, she returned directly to YodaVision.

During lunch, Olivia Chambers messaged genuine congratulations: "Ms. Sinclair, I never imagined you'd achieve such success after leaving. My sincerest congratulations!"

Though unaware of Isabella's specific collaboration with Whitmore Group, Olivia recognized partnership status signaled significant standing.

Isabella replied, "Thank you. You seem to be thriving as well - congratulations to you too."

She added, "And your coffee was exceptional. I truly appreciated it."

Olivia flushed with pleasure yet embarrassment. "But yours remains unparalleled, Ms. Sinclair. Despite replicating your methods precisely, Mr. Whitmore still prefers yours. I actually took barista lessons to reach my current standard, just to keep my job."

Their pleasant exchange concluded shortly after.

Nathaniel returned from his business trip that afternoon.

Their lawyer reported that regarding InnovaTech's compensation to YodaVision, Victoria had paid $200 million, with over $100 million remaining pending.

Nathaniel smirked. "Alexander's always been generous with Victoria - gifting properties, companies, even securing her DataWing Inc. partnership post-termination."

"Yet our $300 million compensation drags on? Are they stalling intentionally?"

Isabella speculated, "More likely the Kensingtons don't want to burden Alexander further - they intend to cover this themselves."

A plausible theory.

Nathaniel clicked his tongue. "Given the Kensingtons' current financial strain, raising two to three hundred million while maintaining operations can't be easy."

"Still, Victoria's insistence on personal repayment... Those two really are devoted."

Isabella agreed wholeheartedly.

Though truthfully, she'd understood their bond perfectly since Victoria took that knife for Alexander, and when Alexander demanded their divorce.
###Chapter 394

The conversation shifted from personal matters to work topics between Isabella and Nathaniel.

Soon after, Theodore called to invite her to Salzburg University's upcoming AI symposium next week.

The invitation had originally been sent to YodaVision weeks ago, addressed solely to Nathaniel.

But everything changed when Isabella's groundbreaking paper was published days earlier, sending shockwaves through academic circles.

Given the paper's exceptional quality and far-reaching impact, the university now desperately wanted Isabella to attend as well.

Initially, Isabella had no intention of participating in Salzburg University's event.

Despite the paper's explosive reception, she'd maintained an unusually low profile, refusing all interview requests. "The students are eager to meet you and learn from your expertise," Theodore pressed.

After some convincing, Isabella finally agreed to attend.

The symposium had gathered an impressive roster of industry experts, scholars, and corporate representatives.

On the event day, the campus buzzed with excitement.

Victoria Kensington represented InnovaTech at the gathering.

News of Frederick Langley's recent trip to Ceravelle had spread through professional circles, revealing Victoria as one of his prized PhD students. This connection instantly elevated her status among attendees.

Theodore greeted her politely when they crossed paths.

Numerous student representatives surrounded Victoria when they learned of her prestigious academic lineage.

For many aspiring scholars, simply being Frederick's student represented the pinnacle of achievement.

Bolder students approached Victoria with technical questions.

Answering basic queries posed no challenge for her. The crowd responded with admiring glances and impressed murmurs.

Several experts also introduced themselves, drawn by her academic pedigree.

Soon, Victoria found herself at the center of an admiring crowd.

Then Isabella and Nathaniel arrived.

Frederick's reputation carried immense weight, but the real buzz centered on his recent private meeting with Isabella and Nathaniel.

Their entrance electrified the venue. Every head turned in their direction.

While Isabella's paper had made waves, few knew her by sight.

Both students and established experts had eagerly anticipated meeting the brilliant mind behind the revolutionary research.

Spotting the arrivals, Theodore excused himself from Victoria. "Mr. Graves and Ms. Sinclair have arrived. The chancellor and I must greet them."

Victoria's smile faltered.

Earlier, while mingling with students, she'd overheard their constant chatter about Isabella.

Their burning desire to meet and question Isabella became painfully clear.

The realization darkened Victoria's expression further.

After the formal greetings, scholars and experts finally connected the stunning woman beside Nathaniel to the groundbreaking paper that had shaken their field.

"My god, she's breathtaking!"

"It's unfair - that brilliant and that beautiful? I can't even..."

"Her and Mr. Graves make a perfect pair. They must be together, right? Both field leaders, both gorgeous. Honestly, it's disgustingly perfect."
###Chapter 395

The symposium commenced after Isabella Sinclair and Nathaniel Graves exchanged greetings with Theodore Sinclair and his colleagues.

Isabella and Nathaniel occupied prime front-row seats near the center stage, while Victoria Kensington sat directly behind them in the second row. As rising stars in their field, both Isabella and Nathaniel were invited to share their unique approaches to research and learning, offering valuable insights to the attending students.

When the discussion segment began, renowned experts immediately flocked to Isabella and Nathaniel. These were distinguished figures in their respective specialties - from convolutional neural networks to embodied cognition systems and multimodal interfaces. Isabella handled every technical query with remarkable ease.

She even provided groundbreaking solutions to longstanding problems that had troubled these experts - from missing data modalities to computational bottlenecks. Their faces lit up with excitement as they absorbed her innovative suggestions.

Several professors became so engrossed in their conversations with Isabella that others grew impatient.

"Arthur, you've monopolized her long enough. Give others a chance!"

"Exactly! At least share her time fairly."

"Just one more question about practical scaling issues..."

"That could take hours! Move aside already."

Meanwhile, Victoria engaged in distracted conversation nearby.

"Victoria," Eleanor Kensington nudged her daughter, "Mr. Pembroke asked you a question."

Victoria had been intently observing Isabella's interactions with the experts, barely registering her own conversation. Her mother's prompt snapped her back to reality.

"Apologies, Mr. Pembroke," Victoria offered a strained smile. "I was fascinated by Mr. Langford's discussion with the others."

As an AI researcher herself, Victoria's interest in the technical exchanges seemed natural.

Gregory Pembroke smiled understandingly. "No trouble at all."

Victoria attempted to refocus on their conversation, but Eleanor knew her daughter too well. She'd noticed Victoria's unusual behavior for over thirty minutes now - all stemming from whatever was happening around Isabella.

Eleanor had observed how the experts clamored for Isabella's attention, their expressions filled with professional admiration.

After Gregory departed, Eleanor subtly gestured toward Isabella and asked, "What's troubling you?"

Victoria finally looked away. "Now I understand why Walter and Theodore spoke so highly of Isabella. Her knowledge appears... substantial."

Victoria recognized several of the experts consulting Isabella - all respected authorities in their fields. For such accomplished researchers to seek Isabella's advice spoke volumes about her capabilities.

Victoria had been carefully analyzing Isabella's responses. The breadth and depth of her technical knowledge was undeniable - much of it beyond Victoria's own understanding. No wonder people called Isabella a polymath in AI research.

If Isabella had merely been parroting Nathaniel or Frederick Aldridge during their previous meeting at Whitmore Group, how could she now hold such sophisticated discussions with Professor Langford and others?

As a fellow researcher, Victoria knew no one could fake this level of expertise through mere repetition.

Eleanor hesitated, observing the crowd around Isabella. The scene did suggest genuine ability.

"Of course she's knowledgeable," Eleanor said calmly. "She's spent years at Nathaniel's side, regularly meeting with Frederick. With two of the nation's top AI minds mentoring her, what else would you expect?" She added pointedly, "This is exactly why she worked so hard to keep you away from Nathaniel in the first place. Had you been in her position, you'd undoubtedly surpass her achievements."
###Chapter 396

Some time ago, when Frederick Langley discovered that a research paper he had highly praised during peer review was actually authored by someone from YodaVision, he made a special trip to Salzburg just to meet Isabella Sinclair and Nathaniel Graves.

During that visit, he told Victoria Kensington that if she had joined YodaVision when she returned to Salzburg last year, her professional growth would have been remarkable.

At the time, Victoria completely agreed. She believed Isabella had deliberately blocked her from entering YodaVision, causing her to miss a crucial career opportunity.

But now, seeing how much Isabella had achieved in less than a year by working alongside Nathaniel, Victoria realized she might have lost far more than she originally thought.

It wasn't just Nathaniel - there was also Frederick Aldridge.

Frederick's formidable expertise and access to cutting-edge industry knowledge had played a significant role in both Nathaniel and Isabella's professional development.

Just as her mother Eleanor had said, if Victoria had successfully joined YodaVision back then, with her intelligence and capabilities, her progress would've undoubtedly surpassed Isabella's.

But there were no second chances. All of that was just wishful thinking now.

As these thoughts raced through her mind, Victoria glared at Isabella with icy contempt. So this was Isabella's grand plan all along - leaving Fleming Group, getting close to Nathaniel, and blocking Victoria's path into YodaVision.

Recalling how everything had unfolded, Eleanor finally understood Isabella wasn't as simple as she appeared. "I never imagined she could be this calculating," Eleanor said coldly.

Isabella was still engaged in conversation with other attendees. When she turned and noticed the Kensington women staring, she immediately sensed their hostility.

In the past, their expressions had always been filled with disdain or indifference. Today's venomous glare was something new.

But Isabella had no interest in deciphering their sudden change in attitude. She simply averted her gaze with deliberate indifference.

To Eleanor and Victoria, this reaction only confirmed their suspicions - Isabella was arrogant and smug.

It was as if she had already defeated them.

Today, Isabella was indeed the center of attention. Her pride seemed justified.

Considering the value of her research, Isabella had already surpassed Victoria professionally.

But...

Isabella had Nathaniel. She had technical prowess.

Victoria had Alexander Whitmore.

Eleanor regained her composure. "Her success won't last forever," she said calmly.

She refused to believe Isabella and Nathaniel's relationship would remain stable indefinitely.

When Victoria thought about Alexander's feelings for her and how Sophia Whitmore preferred her over Isabella, she too calmed down.

Her gaze returned to Isabella, now filled with familiar contempt. "I must admit I've been neglecting my research lately," Victoria said. "It's time I refocused on my studies."

Even without Nathaniel and Frederick's professional support, if she dedicated herself to continuous learning, who could say who would achieve more in the future?

Eleanor naturally approved of this mindset. "Alexander can help you," she suggested.

Victoria smiled confidently. "I know. He'll absolutely help me if I ask."

With that, she stopped paying attention to Isabella entirely and rejoined the symposium crowd.

But unlike earlier when she mostly networked with corporate representatives, this time Victoria sought out the event's leading experts.
###Chapter 397

Isabella Sinclair and Victoria Kensington attended the same symposium at Yardley University that day, yet they never exchanged a single word.

By mid-afternoon, Isabella and Nathaniel Graves were preparing to leave campus.

As Theodore Sinclair and the university chancellor escorted them out, Theodore extended another invitation. "There's another seminar this Saturday. Would you both—"

Isabella froze mid-step when her gaze accidentally landed on Eleanor Kensington standing nearby.

She quickly averted her eyes, pressed her lips together, and replied, "I'm afraid I have prior commitments this Saturday. I won't be able to attend."

After bidding farewell to Theodore and the chancellor, Nathaniel finally spoke once their car pulled away. "You seemed troubled back there. What happened?"

He'd noticed her subtle shift in demeanor when Saturday's event was mentioned, particularly when she'd spotted Eleanor.

Isabella lowered her gaze. "Saturday is my mother's birthday."

Nathaniel fell silent.

The Kensington and Sinclair family feud had confined Evelyn Sinclair to a nursing home for years. No wonder Isabella reacted that way when facing Eleanor and Victoria earlier.

After a long pause, he asked carefully, "How do you feel about the Kensingtons now?"

Isabella's hands clenched into fists. "I won't let them get away with what they did. But—"

But with Alexander Whitmore protecting them now, even with YodaVision's success, taking them down would be nearly impossible.

Nathaniel understood without her saying it. "Justice finds its way eventually. The opportunity will come. Don't lose hope."

Isabella nodded silently.

On Saturday, after baking a birthday cake with Charles Sinclair, Isabella drove to the nursing home.

Though it hadn't been long since their last visit, Evelyn looked noticeably thinner.

Evelyn remained detached, oblivious to her daughter's presence or the birthday celebration around her.

Watching the staff cheerfully sing happy birthday while Evelyn sat unresponsive made Isabella and Margaret feel like their hearts were being ripped apart.

The nursing home director approached them.

Seeing their distress, her expression softened. After hesitating, she said, "We ran tests this morning... Evelyn's health has deteriorated significantly. Multiple organ failure is beginning—"

Everyone paled.

"What? How?"

The director explained, "Years of emotional trauma and poor appetite have taken their toll. Her immune system is dangerously weak now. If this continues—"

The unspoken prognosis hung heavy in the air.

Margaret nearly collapsed.

Back home, Margaret locked herself in her room, devastated. But life, however painful, had to continue.

As evening fell, though no one had an appetite, they needed to eat.

Isabella grabbed her phone and drove to the supermarket.

She mechanically selected groceries. At checkout, someone called her name.

Turning, she saw Sophia Whitmore.

Isabella gave a faint nod.

Sophia smiled at first, then frowned at Isabella's expression. "Are you alright?"

Isabella shook her head, unwilling to speak.

After paying, she picked up her bags to leave when Sophia hesitantly added, "Mr. Whitmore is dining at the Kensington residence tonight..."

Meaning Alexander was having dinner with Victoria's family.

Isabella's grip tightened on the bags, but her expression remained neutral. She simply nodded and left without another word.

That evening, the Sinclair household was shrouded in gloom.

Later, Isabella retreated to her room with a book.

It wasn't until nearly 11 PM that she checked her dead phone.

After plugging it in, she showered.

Returning, she saw multiple missed calls—including one from Jonathan Blackwood.

She called him back first.

Jonathan answered immediately.

"Ms. Sinclair, Mr. Whitmore's lawyer just called. All asset paperwork is complete. You can officially file for divorce now."
###Chapter 398

On Evelyn's birthday, Isabella received a message from Alexander about their divorce proceedings.

How perfectly timed.

Just then, Jonathan continued, "Mr. Whitmore said if you're available Monday morning, he'd like to meet at the courthouse at nine to complete the paperwork. Ms. Sinclair, does that work for you?"

Isabella replied, "Monday morning works fine."

"Excellent," Jonathan said. "I'll inform his attorney."

"Thank you."

Besides Jonathan's call, there were multiple missed calls from Alexander.

Probably calling about the same matter. She saw no reason to return his calls.

She spent the weekend at the Sinclair estate.

Monday morning arrived, and Isabella left the house just after eight.

When she pulled up to the courthouse entrance, Alexander was already waiting.

She hadn't taken their marriage certificate when she moved out. Today, he'd brought both the certificate and divorce papers.

Back when they'd registered their marriage, he hadn't even waited for her afterward—just walked away without glancing at their certificate.

Naturally, she'd been the one to keep it. Had nearly forgotten where she stored it. Yet now, for the divorce, he hadn't needed to ask her—he'd somehow retrieved it himself.

As she approached, Alexander stepped out of his car and extended the divorce agreement. "Want to review it again?"

The marriage certificate in his other hand lay open. Their wedding photo stared back at them.

Apparently, he'd been studying it before her arrival.

Isabella averted her gaze without comment. She took the documents, turned, and returned to her car to examine them.

By the time she finished reviewing, it was nearly nine. Isabella exited her car and walked straight into the courthouse.

Alexander followed close behind.

All required documents were in order. With no disputes, the process proceeded smoothly and quickly.

As they stepped outside, Alexander spoke first. "Once the mandatory waiting period ends, we'll return to finalize everything."

"I'm aware." Without looking at him, Isabella walked past his car to her own.

Alexander said nothing more as he entered his vehicle.

Both cars started almost simultaneously, disappearing from the courthouse in opposite directions.

After leaving, Isabella headed straight to InnovaTech. She and Nathaniel still had that meeting at Whitmore Corporation later.

When she arrived at the office, Nathaniel checked his watch. "You're late. I assumed you weren't coming."

"I was at the courthouse filing for divorce." Her tone remained even.

Nathaniel paused. "It's official then?"

"Not quite. There's still the mandatory waiting period before finalization."

"I see." After a beat, he asked, "Still attending the Whitmore meeting?"

"Absolutely."

Seeing her determination, Nathaniel smiled. "Alright then. Let's go."

Twenty minutes later, Isabella and Nathaniel entered Whitmore Corporation's conference room. Alexander and his team were already waiting.

When they entered, Alexander greeted them politely. "Mr. Graves, Ms. Sinclair. You made it."

Isabella and Nathaniel nodded in acknowledgment before taking their seats.

The meeting commenced promptly.

Isabella remained entirely professional throughout, while Alexander maintained pleasant professionalism with Nathaniel and the others.

The conference room held numerous attendees, but aside from Nathaniel, no one knew that Isabella and Alexander—who appeared to be mere business acquaintances—had, just that morning, stood together in court filing for divorce.
###Chapter 399

The clock struck noon when Isabella and Alexander's group arrived at The Grandeur for lunch following their morning meeting.

As they approached their private dining suite, the adjacent door swung open abruptly.

"Victoria! Alex!" Genevieve's voice rang out deliberately loud enough for everyone to hear.

Spotting Theodore among the group, Reginald flashed a polished smile. "Ms. Sinclair, what an unexpected pleasure to find you dining here."

Nathaniel returned the smile with equal politeness. "Quite the serendipitous encounter."

Though the words suggested chance, this meeting had been carefully orchestrated.

News of Alexander and Isabella's courthouse visit to file divorce papers had spread through both families like wildfire.

Learning of Alexander's lunch plans in the district - and Isabella's presence - Genevieve had specifically requested the private room directly across from theirs.

Thus, this "coincidental" encounter came to be.

The knowledge that Alexander had wasted no time initiating divorce proceedings after finalizing the agreement filled Genevieve with glee.

What thrilled her even more was the thirty-day countdown until Alexander could legally dissolve his marriage to Isabella.

After that, Victoria and Alexander's wedding would undoubtedly follow swiftly.

There would be no place left for Isabella in their world.

Genevieve shot Isabella a look brimming with smug superiority.

While Victoria had never openly pressured Alexander to divorce, her anxiety about the situation had been palpable.

Despite her absolute confidence in their relationship, as long as Alexander remained legally bound to Isabella, their connection lacked proper legitimacy.

Hearing on Saturday that Alexander had finalized divorce terms and scheduled Monday's courthouse visit had filled her with quiet satisfaction.

The sentiment wasn't unique to them - both the Whitmore and Kensington families shared in the celebration.

Eleanor barely glanced at Isabella before dismissing her entirely, while Diana couldn't contain her triumphant smile.

"Go ahead," Victoria told Alexander with practiced grace. "We won't keep you."

"I'll see you shortly," he replied.

"Of course," she smiled.

Their exchange painted the picture of deeply devoted lovers.

Theodore and the others exchanged knowing chuckles.

Isabella and Nathaniel wasted no time with pleasantries, moving directly into their private suite upon seeing the Kensington clan.

"They're putting on quite the performance," Nathaniel sneered.

"Obviously," Isabella agreed dryly.

"Pathetic display from supposedly respectable families."

After brief greetings, Alexander's party entered their room while the Kensingtons retreated to theirs.

Diana's satisfaction wasn't complete, however.

Leaning toward Eleanor, she whispered, "That little tramp landing Nathaniel after leaving Alex is too fortunate."

Nathaniel represented significant status, not to mention his connection to Frederick.

The thought stuck in Diana's throat like an unswallowable bone.

She wasn't alone in this discomfort. Since learning of Isabella's genuine professional growth under Nathaniel's mentorship, both Eleanor and Victoria had grown uneasy.

"That divorce will brand her permanently," Diana continued through gritted teeth. "What makes her think she deserves better?"

The label of divorcée soothed Eleanor somewhat.

"Nothing's final until they're married. There's still time."

Diana knew this intellectually, but couldn't shake her unease. Any possibility of Isabella marrying Nathaniel kept her from true contentment.

In the adjacent room, Isabella remained oblivious to the Whitmores' machinations.

Alexander's party settled into comfortable conversation, the atmosphere deceptively relaxed.

After a brief interval, Alexander stood. "Please continue. I'll return shortly."

His earlier promise to visit Victoria's room explained his departure, prompting knowing smiles.

"Take your time, Mr. Whitmore," Theodore chuckled.

"Indeed, no rush," Walter echoed with amusement.

Alexander smiled and exited.

Isabella and Nathaniel observed the charade with detached interest, barely sparing him another glance.

While Isabella paid little attention to his absence, Nathaniel checked his watch impatiently. "Ten minutes. How presumptuous."

Isabella opened her mouth to respond when Alexander reappeared, cutting off her reply.

Nathaniel rolled his eyes dramatically.

Alexander resumed his seat as if nothing had occurred, rejoining the conversation seamlessly.

Then Isabella's phone rang.

She froze at the caller ID.

Nathaniel noticed her reaction and peered at the screen. "Sebastian? Why's he calling you?"

Though he hadn't spoken loudly, Theodore and nearby guests - including Alexander - all heard clearly.

Remembering Sebastian's previous confession, Isabella found herself at a loss for words.
###Chapter 400

Isabella paused for a brief moment before rising from her seat. "Excuse me," she said smoothly. "I need to take this call."

After offering polite nods to Theodore and the others, she stepped out of the private dining room with her phone pressed to her ear.

Nathaniel watched her departure with growing realization. His eyes widened in shock.

He'd once entertained the fleeting thought that something might exist between them when he'd seen Isabella dancing with Sebastian at last year's gala.

But when no further interactions followed, he'd dismissed the notion entirely.

Now this unexpected development left him reeling.

Kieran's attention snapped to Isabella when Nathaniel questioned her.

He didn't know Sebastian Ashford - the name meant nothing to him.

Yet the subtle tension in Isabella's expression told him everything. Nathaniel's reaction only confirmed his suspicions.

Could there really be something between Isabella and this Sebastian?

Alexander knew Sebastian well.

His initial glance toward Isabella had been casual, meant to last only a moment before looking away.

But the unfamiliar expression on her face made him pause. His gaze lingered thoughtfully as she exited the room.

Once outside, Isabella answered the call.

Before she could speak, Sebastian's warm voice came through. "I thought you might not pick up."

Beautiful women received confessions often, and Isabella was no exception. She'd been fielding admirers since her teens.

But after marriage and motherhood, her social circles had changed.

She'd never hidden her marital status at work either, making such declarations rare in recent years.

Sebastian existed in that ambiguous space between acquaintance and friend.

With her divorce from Alexander still pending, his previous confession had unsettled her. This renewed contact only deepened her discomfort.

Just as she opened her mouth to respond, Sebastian continued. "After we last spoke, I did considerable soul-searching. At first, I thought my words might have been impulsive."

"But upon reflection, I realized they weren't impulsive at all. Somewhere along the way, without realizing it, I'd developed genuine feelings for you."

"What I said that night was simply the truth surfacing. So yes, Isabella, my feelings are real."

She'd anticipated the call's purpose, but not this level of earnestness.

Sebastian spoke with measured calm, each word carefully considered and delivered with sincerity.

Before she could respond, he added, "Last time you said you'd 'been married' - not 'am married.' Does that mean your marriage has ended? May I know your current status?"

His tone held no pressure. The question itself was gentle.

Isabella had always respected Sebastian. He was considerate, polite, and valued honesty.

Faced with such sincerity, she couldn't bring herself to be harsh. "I filed divorce papers today, but it's not finalized yet."

"The mandatory waiting period?"

"Yes."

Sebastian chuckled softly. "My timing seems impeccable."

"It's not..." Isabella grew increasingly uncomfortable. "I appreciate your feelings, but I—"

"I know." His interruption was as gentle as his confession. "I know what you'll say - you're not ready for a new relationship. Perhaps you've never considered me in that light. In other words, you don't share my feelings."

Isabella fell silent. He'd anticipated her response perfectly.

His voice came again, warm and steady. "I understand completely. But I don't mind waiting."

She gathered herself to mention Sophia when Sebastian spoke first.

"You said 'been married.' I assumed you might have a child. I've considered that too. My answer remains unchanged."

"So I hope you'll allow me to properly court you. And when you're ready to consider new relationships, I hope you'll think of me first."

Isabella had received countless confessions before. None like this.

Before she could respond, Sebastian continued warmly, "Where are you now? Have you eaten? I just returned to town. Let me take you to lunch."
###Chapter 401

"No thanks, I already ate." Isabella's voice was polite but firm as she declined the offer.

Sebastian's confession had been unexpectedly touching. Yet...

She'd only answered his call to set things straight once and for all.

"I truly appreciate your feelings," she said with quiet conviction. "But as you said yourself, I'm not ready for any new relationships right now. So I'm sorry. Please don't wait for me."

When she sensed Sebastian about to protest, she didn't hesitate - ending the call with a decisive tap.

Phone still clutched in her hand, she stood frozen, emotions churning.

Finally, a wry smile touched her lips before she turned back toward the private dining room.

Her absence had stretched longer than intended.

Nathaniel had guessed the call's purpose the moment Sebastian's name appeared. Now, the prolonged conversation only fueled his curiosity.

As Isabella returned, he leaned in. "What's really going on between you two?"

She sipped her lemon water calmly. "Nothing worth mentioning."

Nathaniel caught the hint. "Not the right place? I'll ask later."

Isabella remained silent.

Kieran was even more restless than Nathaniel.

While waiting for Isabella's return, he'd messaged a contact about Sebastian. Their shared social circles meant quick answers.

Just as Isabella reentered, his phone buzzed with a reply: "Why the sudden interest in Sebastian Ashford?"

Distracted, Kieran typed a quick "No reason" without catching Isabella and Nathaniel's exchange.

Alexander glanced up when Isabella returned, but after a brief pause, resumed his conversation.

Isabella paid little attention to either man. After exchanging a few words with Nathaniel, she refocused on Theodore's discussion.

Soon, Theodore had a technical question and sought her input.

As she moved toward them, Alexander was typing on his phone.

Theodore stood to make space, accidentally bumping Alexander's arm. The phone clattered to the floor.

Without realizing whose it was, Isabella automatically bent to retrieve it - only to see Victoria's name lighting up the screen.

Alexander's phone.

She averted her eyes immediately, placing it on the table. But Alexander was already reaching out. "Mine. Thanks."

She handed it over without comment, taking the seat beside Theodore.

Twenty minutes later, lunch concluded. Isabella rose with the others.

As they exited, the opposite private room's door opened simultaneously.

Nathaniel murmured, "What a coincidence. Arranged, I presume?"

He meant Alexander and Victoria had coordinated their timing.

Having glimpsed Alexander's messages earlier, Isabella knew Nathaniel was right. Kieran quickly moved to walk beside her. When she asked what he wanted, he realized his slow approach wasn't working - but this wasn't the time.

"Nothing," he said.

Alexander noted Kieran's proximity, gave them a measured look, then turned to Victoria emerging across the hall.

Isabella and Nathaniel didn't bother acknowledging the Shaws or Kensingtons. They certainly had no interest in observing Alexander and Victoria's interactions.

They departed without pause.

Downstairs, after brief work-related conversation, Alexander and Victoria drove off.

Watching Isabella leave earlier with Nathaniel and Kieran, Diana remarked, "Wasn't that girl with Nathaniel Graves? And Kieran Blackwood from Gibson Industries beside her?"

"If something develops there, it'll certainly affect her relationship with Nathaniel, don't you think?"

The Kensingtons knew all about Victoria and Kieran's history. They'd fully supported Victoria's choice of Alexander.

Compared to Kieran, Alexander was clearly more accomplished - and had proven willing to sacrifice far more for Victoria.
###Chapter 402

Kieran Blackwood possessed every quality of an ideal partner, which nearly made Genevieve Kensington bolt from the car in protest.

Absolutely not! What if Mr. Blackwood actually falls for that scheming woman? We'd lose an ally and gain an enemy!

Penelope Kensington merely laughed, unfazed. She tapped her daughter's forehead lightly. "Silly girl. With Victoria glowing like a diamond, how could Mr. Blackwood possibly be swayed by Isabella?"

Over the years, she'd witnessed firsthand how men became utterly powerless against Victoria's charms.

Victoria remained silent.

She wouldn't comment on whether Diana's strategy would work—but like Penelope, she harbored no doubts about Kieran's loyalty.

She knew the depth of Kieran's love for her. That certainty was unshakable.

Eleanor Kensington, though quiet, shared the same conviction that Kieran would never truly be taken in by Isabella.

Having settled that matter, she finally spoke. "Because of the YodaVision debacle, Victoria has suffered significant losses these past months. Meanwhile, Isabella seized that very opportunity to elevate herself—and now her star is clearly rising."

"If we allow her to continue unchecked, letting her maintain ties with Nathaniel, she could establish herself firmly in the AI industry."

"So sabotaging her relationship with Nathaniel and reclaiming the connections with Nathaniel and Frederick that Victoria lost—this must be our immediate priority."

"Otherwise, we stand to lose even more ground!"

The words struck home.

Remembering how Isabella had cost them a $300 million breach of contract, then watching her bask in acclaim following her recent paper publication, Genevieve burned with envy.

After hearing Eleanor's analysis, she stopped objecting.

Instead, she leaned forward eagerly. "Then what's our move? Mr. Blackwood is so devoted to Victoria—he'd never cooperate, right?"

Enhancing Victoria's image while convincing Kieran to play along would require careful maneuvering. But it wasn't impossible.

Isabella, Nathaniel, and Kieran returned to YodaVision's headquarters after lunch.

As the elevator doors opened on their floor, they stepped out. Just as they approached the entrance, they spotted a tall, broad-shouldered figure waiting by reception.

Hearing their footsteps, the man turned.

Isabella froze.

She'd already explained her situation with Sebastian Ashford to Nathaniel during the car ride back.

Nathaniel, ever the gossip enthusiast, had been thoroughly enjoying the drama.

Now seeing the man in question waiting in their company lobby, he let out an amused "Well, well" and raised an eyebrow, thoroughly entertained.

Kieran had never met Sebastian before, but one look told him exactly who this was.

There was no denying it—Sebastian was strikingly handsome, living up to every implication of his distinguished name.

Kieran's expression darkened visibly.

Sebastian turned fully, spotting Isabella and Nathaniel. "You're back."

Isabella hadn't anticipated him showing up at her workplace. She pressed her lips together. "You—"

"Guessed you might be here," he said smoothly, then added politely to Nathaniel, "Mr. Graves, it's been a while."

Nathaniel grinned, shaking his hand. "Indeed it has. First time at YodaVision, right? Since you're here, why not join us for a quick tour?"

"Certainly," Sebastian replied with a smile—casting another glance at Isabella while simultaneously catching Kieran's icy stare nearby.

Though strangers, Sebastian immediately sensed Kieran's hostility.

The way Kieran positioned himself close to Isabella, his posture and expression radiating possessiveness—clearly displeased by Sebastian's presence and protective of Isabella.

Sebastian understood immediately.

He paused, then looked at Kieran. "And this is...?"

Nathaniel waited for Isabella to introduce them. When she remained silent, he had no choice but to intervene. "This is Kieran Blackwood, one of YodaVision's engineers."
###Chapter 403

Sebastian Ashford extended his hand with a polite smile. "Sebastian Ashford."

Kieran Blackwood shook it firmly.

Their eyes locked in silent understanding: This would be a fair competition for Isabella's affection.

After the handshake, Sebastian turned back to Isabella.

"My presence made you uncomfortable, didn't it?"

It had.

But she answered diplomatically, "A little."

"I thought so." His voice remained calm, almost apologetic. "I knew you'd feel this way, yet I came anyway."

"Because if I didn't try, I'd always wonder if you might change your mind. Now I have my answer. I'll respect your boundaries moving forward."

So he wasn't giving up?

Before Isabella could respond, Sebastian addressed Nathaniel Graves. "Let's postpone the Grandeur tour. I won't intrude further."

Nathaniel had formed a favorable opinion of Sebastian. If Isabella ever considered remarrying, he believed Sebastian would be a worthy candidate.

But since Isabella showed no current interest, he wouldn't interfere.

"You're always welcome to visit again, Sebastian," Nathaniel replied courteously.

Sebastian nodded. Before leaving, he cast one last glance at Isabella.

She stood silent, lost in thought.

He seemed to want to say more but ultimately settled on, "Until next time."

"Take care."

Then Sebastian departed.

Kieran had initially assumed Sebastian and Isabella were already involved. Now he realized it had been entirely one-sided pursuit.

Isabella had rejected him—clearly and definitively.

This realization lifted Kieran's spirits considerably.

Within minutes of Sebastian's departure, office gossip spread like wildfire—a stunningly handsome stranger had come asking for Isabella.

"Is that her husband?" someone whispered.

Kieran froze mid-click at his computer. Husband? Had he heard correctly?

Before he could react, another colleague chimed in, "Reception thought so too at first. But from their conversation? Pure unrequited pursuit. Definitely not married!"

"Damn, some Adonis chased her to the office? Wonder if her husband knows about—"

Kieran cut in sharply, "Wait. Isabella's married?"

The colleague blinked. "You didn't know?"

"I didn't."

He'd assumed Isabella and Nathaniel were dating. But after joining the company, he'd noticed their strictly professional dynamic—no shared arrivals/departures, zero romantic cues.

Isabella herself had confirmed they weren't involved.

"Ah, you're new," the colleague realized. "Most veterans know, but we've stopped discussing her personal life lately."

Kieran remained silent, reeling from the revelation.

Finally he asked, "What's her husband like? Anyone met him? How's their relationship?"

"We've only seen his silhouette during one video call last year—never his face. No clue who he is."

Another added, "As for their marriage? Hard to say. Isabella's been here years, but aside from that one surprise call, her husband's never appeared again. She never mentions him either."
###Chapter 404

Kieran Blackwood frowned. "He's never visited the office?"

"Not once," a coworker confirmed. "That's why most of us assume Ms. Sinclair is divorced. It's been over six months, and she hasn't mentioned a husband even in passing."

"Exactly."

The logic was sound.

If Isabella Sinclair were still married, would Sebastian Ashford dare to pursue her so openly?

Yet Kieran couldn't shake his unease. The idea that Isabella had ever been married had never crossed his mind.

As he sat lost in thought, Isabella approached. "Is something wrong?"

He wanted to ask, Is it true you were married?

But this was the workplace. Personal questions—especially to a superior—were inappropriate. One slip might be forgiven, but pushing further would cross a line.

Snapping back to reality, he forced a smile. "Nothing. Just thinking."

That afternoon, Isabella's phone rang.

After hanging up, she informed Nathaniel Graves before leaving. "I might not be in until tomorrow afternoon. Can you cover the morning meeting?"

"Of course." He studied her. "Everything alright?"

"My mother has a medical appointment. I want to accompany her."

Nathaniel, unaware of Evelyn Sinclair's declining health, assumed it was routine. "Go ahead. I'll handle things here."

Isabella nodded and left.

The next morning, Isabella arrived at the hospital with Margaret and Caroline Sinclair.

Even there, they kept their distance, careful not to let Evelyn spot them.

During the examinations, Evelyn grew increasingly agitated, thrashing like a wild animal. Multiple nurses had to restrain her for each procedure.

After ten grueling tests, Evelyn finally left with the care home staff.

Margaret, exhausted herself, departed soon after. Isabella stayed behind with the doctor to await results.

Most reports wouldn't be ready until afternoon—some not until tomorrow. But the preliminary findings were concerning.

Isabella's stomach dropped as the doctor explained.

She thanked him and turned to leave. But as she stepped into the hospital lobby, a child's voice called out:

"Mommy!"

Isabella froze. Her fingers clenched around her purse strap.

She considered pretending not to hear—until Sophia Whitmore dashed over and wrapped her arms around Isabella's waist.

"Mommy!"

Isabella turned slightly. She opened her mouth—then spotted Alexander Whitmore watching from the crowd.

She looked away, focusing on Sophia. Hearing the girl cough, she asked softly, "Are you sick?"

Sophia nodded, coughing again before looking up. "Mommy, why are you here? Are you sick?"

"No, sweetheart." Isabella touched her forehead. "Do you have a fever?"

"Last night, but it's gone now." Without waiting, Sophia hugged her tighter and glanced at Alexander approaching. She pouted. "I wanted to call you to come with us, but Daddy said you were busy."

Isabella kept her eyes averted from Alexander.

"I am busy. But I'm glad you're feeling better." She hesitated. "Why come to the hospital? What about Dr. Whitmore?"

For minor illnesses, their family doctor usually sufficed.

Alexander spoke up then. "We're here for comprehensive checkups."

Isabella didn't ask why.

Sophia clung to her excitedly. "Mommy, I don't have school today! Can I visit Grandma with you?"
###Chapter 405

Isabella adjusted her coat with a sigh. "I need to head to the office now. Your grandmother Evelyn hasn't been well lately and needs her rest. We'll arrange a visit when she's stronger."

Sophia's shoulders slumped. Though she'd never openly resented Victoria for cozying up to Alexander, the news of Margaret Sinclair's declining health had left her feeling hollow.

Seeing Victoria now would only remind her of how the woman had ingratiated herself with Alexander, worsening her already fragile emotional state.

"Grandmother is ill?" Sophia's eyes widened with genuine concern. "How serious is it? Mother, why didn't you tell me sooner?"

Isabella hesitated briefly before responding, "I wanted to spare you unnecessary worry."

Gently disentangling Sophia's clinging hands, she added, "It's getting late. I have meetings to attend. Promise me you'll take care of yourself."

Sophia resisted letting go, but recognizing her mother's packed schedule, reluctantly released her grip. The moment their hands separated, fresh tears threatened to spill.

"Mother, why are you always so busy now? Even more than Father. When will we have proper time together?"

"I wish I knew."

The unspoken truth of the impending divorce hung between them. Isabella considered broaching the subject, then reconsidered.

If Alexander planned to marry Victoria post-divorce, that revelation should come from him directly.

Sophia's gaze dropped to the polished hospital floor. "Fine. That's all you ever say lately."

Isabella recognized the weak excuse for what it was. "I really must go now."

"Alright."

As Isabella gave her daughter one last lingering look and turned to leave, Victoria emerged from the restroom area.

Sophia and Alexander stood conspicuously in the lobby - clearly awaiting someone.

That someone being Victoria.

Victoria's steps faltered upon spotting Isabella. Their eyes met briefly before Victoria offered a frosty nod.

Isabella maintained an impassive expression, deliberately looking away without acknowledgment as she strode toward the exit.

Unaware of Victoria's approach, Sophia caught her mother's hand again, her wide eyes shimmering with unspoken pleas.

Isabella felt the desperate cling of her daughter's fingers but gently extracted her hand. "Goodbye, darling."

Seeing her mother's resolve, Sophia finally released her grip, wilting like a flower deprived of sunlight. "Goodbye, Mother."

Alexander observed their exchange silently, making no move to intervene as Isabella departed.

Sophia's gaze followed her mother's retreating form until it disappeared around a corner.

Only then did Victoria approach, running manicured fingers through Sophia's hair in a patronizing gesture before addressing Alexander. "Shall we get dinner?"

Alexander nodded. "Of course."

Sophia finally turned away from where her mother had vanished. "Father, I'd rather eat at home tonight."

"Very well," Alexander agreed. "Home it is."

The trio exited the hospital together, their footsteps echoing hollowly through the sterile corridors.
###Chapter 406

The following morning, Evelyn Sinclair's medical reports arrived.

Her organ failure showed marginal improvement compared to the previous tests conducted at the rehabilitation center.

At this stage of deterioration, proper medical intervention and care could potentially stabilize her condition.

However, Evelyn's baseline health remained critically weak, with her organs deteriorating at an alarming pace - leaving her long-term prognosis uncertain.

After consulting with the physician, Isabella and Margaret experienced simultaneous waves of hope and apprehension.

Hope because Evelyn still had fighting chance; apprehension because her fragile state might hinder full treatment compliance.

That afternoon, Frederick Aldridge extended a dinner invitation to Isabella and Nathaniel.

With Nathaniel away on business, Isabella drove alone to collect Frederick that evening.

As they exited the vehicle at The Grandeur's entrance, Victoria Kensington happened to arrive simultaneously.

Spotting Isabella with Frederick - and notably without Nathaniel - Victoria's eyes narrowed slightly. She approached with calculated steps. "Mr. Aldridge."

Frederick acknowledged her with an icy glance, offering the barest nod before turning back to Isabella. "Shall we?"

He continued their earlier conversation as they moved toward the entrance.

Days prior, during a discussion about AI advancements with Theodore Sinclair and Walter Pembroke in Alexander's office, Isabella had impressed them with her insights.

Even if they considered some perspectives derivative, Victoria had since immersed herself in studying the latest AI developments.

Now she recognized Frederick and Isabella debating cutting-edge topics like neural interfaces and edge computing.

Receiving Frederick's dismissive treatment, Victoria maintained her composure but trailed them inside at a discreet distance.

"Good evening," the hostess greeted. "Do you have reservations?"

"Two under Sinclair," Isabella confirmed.

After checking the system, the hostess smiled. "Right this way, Ms. Sinclair."

Victoria froze upon hearing "two."

Nathaniel wasn't coming?

Isabella now commanded enough respect from Frederick Aldridge to merit private meetings without Nathaniel's presence?

Frederick, though a titan in his field, famously disdained mentoring. His technical knowledge wasn't freely given, and few could engage him in substantive discussions.

Most supplicants never earned his attention, regardless of status.

His reputation for icy arrogance should have drawn criticism, but his unparalleled contributions rendered him untouchable.

Yet here he was, actively exchanging ideas with Isabella Sinclair.

Did Frederick genuinely value Isabella's intellect? Why else would the notoriously inaccessible scholar grant her a private dinner?

Watching Frederick's attentive posture toward Isabella compared to his frigid dismissal of herself, Victoria's crimson lips pressed into a bloodless line as they disappeared into the restaurant.
###Chapter 407

The Grand Ballroom shimmered under crystal chandeliers as Isabella Sinclair arrived on Nathaniel Graves' arm. They'd just returned from Salzburg that afternoon, yet here they were at The Grandeur's annual tech gala.

Her sharp eyes immediately caught Victoria Kensington and Genevieve whispering near the champagne fountain.

Genevieve's face twisted in displeasure. "Must she invade every prestigious event?" she hissed just loud enough to carry.

Isabella merely adjusted her emerald cocktail ring and turned away. After exchanging pleasantries with their host Simon Fairchild, she spotted Kieran Blackwood making his way toward them.

He'd secured an invitation the moment he heard she'd be attending.

Tonight, Isabella wore a liquid silver gown that clung to her curves like mercury, the high neckline contrasting with the daring open back. Her raven hair fell in a sleek curtain, framing features as precise as cut glass.

Cool. Composed. Utterly mesmerizing.

Kieran's breath caught - she reinvented elegance each time he saw her.

"You're becoming quite the regular at these functions," Isabella remarked dryly, having noticed him at the last two industry events.

"Couldn't miss this one," Kieran recovered smoothly, masking his admiration.

Rumor had it Gregory Thornton would attend tonight. The AI pioneer and Frederick Langley were intellectual equals, their contributions to machine learning legendary.

Victoria had met Gregory twice during her doctoral research at Yardley.

Acquaintances, nothing more.

Spotting him across the room, Victoria approached with practiced charm. "Professor Thornton, what a pleasure."

He acknowledged her with a curt nod.

Emboldened, Victoria opened her mouth to continue -

"Have the Sinclairs arrived yet?" Gregory abruptly asked his assistant.

"Just now, sir."

Gregory's entire demeanor brightened. Excusing himself from the circle of academics, he declared, "You'll have to forgive me - I must speak with Sinclair immediately."

Simon Fairchild chuckled. "Eager to debate neural networks with Graves again?"

"Actually, it's Sinclair's latest paper that's revolutionary." With that, he strode toward Isabella without a backward glance.

Victoria's smile froze.

Genevieve bristled. "How rude! After you studied under Frederick -"

"Enough." Victoria's clipped tone silenced her cousin.

Meanwhile, Gregory was already shaking Isabella's hand with rare enthusiasm. "Your quantum computing framework - absolute genius. I've analyzed it six times."

Isabella's lips curved. "You flatter me, Professor."

The paper had barely hit academic journals when invitations flooded in from every major tech conference. She'd declined them all.

So Gregory came to her.

Their conversation sparked like live wires - from her research to AI ethics, from historical breakthroughs to speculative futures. Isabella matched him point for point, her insights razor-sharp.

When Gregory referenced obscure studies, she not only recognized them but expanded with three equally relevant papers, synthesizing core concepts into dazzling new perspectives.

Nathaniel watched, amused, as the usually taciturn Gregory became animated, gesturing wildly between sips of champagne. Around them, other guests gradually stopped pretending not to eavesdrop.

Victoria observed from across the room, her manicured nails digging into her clutch. The evening wasn't going as planned. Not at all.
###Chapter 408

Isabella Sinclair and Gregory Thornton exchanged rapid-fire technical discourse, their conversation flowing with intellectual energy.

Observers could clearly see Gregory growing more animated the longer he spoke with Isabella. His eyes sparkled with professional admiration.

Midway through their discussion, Gregory actually discovered several knowledge gaps in his own expertise. This realization only heightened his excitement.

"You've proven me right," Gregory suddenly declared with a laugh. "Sinclair, your understanding surpasses mine in every way."

The admission sent ripples through nearby listeners. As a leading AI authority, Gregory's public acknowledgment of a younger peer's superiority was unprecedented.

Only Nathaniel Graves wore a subtle, knowing smile in response.

Victoria Kensington stood silently nearby, listening intently.

Genevieve, lacking technical knowledge, grew visibly impatient. "How can they possibly have this much to discuss?"

Victoria remained silent, but her grip on her wine ss turned her knuckles white.

While Salzburg's AI field had made impressive advances recently, with professors like Theodore Sinclair and Walter Pembroke gaining national recognition, they still lagged behind experts like Gregory Thornton and Frederick Langley.

If Victoria had initially dismissed Isabella's knowledge as merely picked up from Nathaniel during the Yardley University symposium, she could no longer maintain that illusion.

Isabella's expertise was alarmingly comprehensive.

To engage Gregory as an equal - even occasionally outmatching him - how could this be achieved in less than a year?

This meant Isabella must have been highly skilled before joining InnovaTech.

That controversial research paper of hers... it might genuinely be her original work after all.

If true, then professionally, Isabella had already surpassed her.

But how?

Isabella had barely graduated before becoming Alexander Whitmore's secretary. Where could she have acquired such advanced knowledge?

"Victoria?" Genevieve finally noticed her cousin's pale complexion. "Are you feeling unwell?"

Victoria took a slow sip of wine, her silence more telling than any response.

Kieran Blackwood had recognized Isabella's brilliance before, but tonight she exceeded even his expectations. As he listened to her technical exchange, a colleague leaned in.

"I did some digging on Ms. Sinclair for you. She's not originally from Fairview."

"Her parents divorced, and her mother has... mental health challenges. She moved here with her uncle's family over ten years ago."

"When their business struggled a few years back, no one stepped in to help. They don't seem well-connected here."

"Things have improved slightly recently, but in Fairview's social hierarchy, they're practically invisible."

Seeing Kieran's impatient glance, his friend continued, "As for her marriage... The Sinclair family's social obscurity makes information scarce."

"Despite extensive inquiries, no one seems to know anything concrete."
###Chapter 409

Kieran Blackwood's brow furrowed deeply. "Absolutely nothing?"

His companion shrugged. "That's right. Rumor has it she married young, and from what I gathered, the marriage wasn't exactly... harmonious."

"The neighbors near the Sinclair estate claim they've never even laid eyes on the man. The family clearly disapproves—they refuse to speak of him at all."

After a weighted pause, he added, "Oh, and there's a child involved."

Kieran's head snapped up, certain he'd misheard. "Excuse me?"

"Truth. Nearly choked on my coffee when I found out. Who would've guessed? Certainly not me, judging by how she carries herself."

Indeed.

Having worked alongside Isabella Sinclair at YodaVision for years, Kieran had never once caught wind of a child. Nothing in her demeanor suggested motherhood either.

Noticing his stunned silence, his friend arched a brow. "Should I keep digging?" The unspoken question hung between them—now that they knew Isabella was a divorced mother, did Kieran still care to pursue her?

Kieran stood motionless, jaw clenched.

By all accounts, he had it all—wealth, looks, a thriving career. Yet romance continually eluded him.

The first woman he'd fancied had chosen another while he was still mustering the courage to confess.

And now, just as he'd begun developing genuine feelings for Isabella, this bombshell dropped. Married. Divorced. A mother.

Who could process that?

His friend sighed, giving his shoulder a sympathetic squeeze. As he turned to leave, Isabella's laughter rang out across the room—still deep in conversation with Nathaniel Graves.

Kieran's gaze locked onto her profile, transfixed.

After a long moment, his expression hardened with resolve. "Tell me everything."

His friend, already mentally scrolling through nearby single women, blinked. "Pardon?"

Then comprehension dawned. His mouth fell open. "You're serious? After all that?"

Kieran merely stared, silent.

Just as his friend began protesting, movement caught their attention—Victoria Kensington gliding into their line of sight, exchanging pleasantries with a nearby guest.

Kieran stiffened.

His companion recognized Victoria instantly. When she glanced their way, he offered an awkward half-wave. "Ms. Kensington."

Victoria nodded coolly, her eyes lingering on Kieran.

He gave her the barest acknowledgment before pointedly turning away.

Taking the hint, his friend hastily continued, "So... about Isabella. Honestly, there's not much else. Want me to push harder?"

Kieran shook his head. "Leave it."

While curiosity gnawed at him about Isabella's ex, he wasn't about to launch a full-scale investigation. Their divorce meant the past was irrelevant.

He'd only requested basic background checks—enough to understand her present, not excavate her history.

His friend shrugged. "Your call."

Across the room, Victoria noted Kieran's dismissal, her smile tightening.

Earlier, when they'd arrived, Kieran had immediately looked their way. To Genevieve, this signaled clear interest. She nudged Victoria playfully. "Seems Mr. Blackwood can't take his eyes off you."

Victoria said nothing.

After witnessing Isabella's effortless charm with Nathaniel, her thoughts had spiraled. If Isabella truly was this magnetic, perhaps Kieran's attention had genuinely shifted.

Isabella possessed a rare beauty that intensified when she spoke—her confidence radiating like sunlight. That kind of woman could captivate anyone. Yet when Victoria searched Kieran's face earlier, he'd been engrossed in conversation, not even glancing Isabella's way.

Now, hearing Genevieve's teasing, a small, relieved smile touched her lips.

The moment shattered as Julian Montgomery and Oliver Westbrook arrived, offering apologies to their host. "Terribly sorry we're late—unavoidable delay on the road."

"Think nothing of it! Among friends, such formalities aren't necessary."

Victoria's smile vanished the instant she spotted Julian.

After greeting their host, Julian's gaze found Isabella instantly. He moved toward her without hesitation, eyes alight with singular focus—completely overlooking Victoria's presence.

It was Oliver who noticed the women first, discreetly elbowing Julian. Only then did Julian offer Victoria a cursory nod.

Victoria saw everything.

Genevieve, oblivious, brightened at Julian's arrival. "Julian's here! Let's go—"

Her suggestion died as Julian beelined for Isabella and Nathaniel. She huffed. "Why does he always gravitate toward her? Infuriating."

Julian's reappearance after weeks abroad sent a visible ripple through the room.

Kieran's expression darkened considerably.

And when Julian reached Isabella's side, Kieran abruptly straightened, striding purposefully in their direction.
###Chapter 410

Julian Montgomery stood beside Isabella Sinclair, but Alexander Whitmore didn't acknowledge him. Instead, he spoke directly to Isabella. "Long time no see."

Isabella offered a polite nod. "Keeping busy these days?"

Alexander adjusted his cufflinks. "Quite. Just returned from Salzburg this morning."

Though he'd been traveling, news had reached him within hours - Isabella and Nathaniel Graves were finally proceeding with their divorce formalities.

Six months had passed since they'd signed the separation agreement last year. Now, at last, the legal dissolution of their marriage was imminent.

Twenty-three more days until the decree absolute. Then he could finally—

Noticing Nathaniel still engaged in conversation with Isabella, Alexander schooled his expression. After exchanging brief pleasantries with the pair, he tactfully withdrew.

Oliver Westbrook was deep in discussion with Victoria Kensington and Genevieve. When Oliver gestured him over, Alexander hesitated momentarily before joining them.

Victoria greeted him coolly. "When did you return?"

"This morning."

Oliver interjected, "What about Nathaniel? He's been away nearly a week—when's he due back?"

As if on cue, Victoria's phone chimed.

She glanced at the screen, her lips curving into a satisfied smile. "Speak of the devil," she announced, holding up her phone. "He just landed."

As she typed her response, Alexander sipped his champagne, his gaze drifting back to Isabella. The corners of his mouth lifted slightly.

At that precise moment, Isabella looked up from her conversation. Their eyes met across the crowded room.

Seeing his apparent good humor, she offered a polite nod before turning her attention elsewhere.

Thirty minutes later, the gala was winding down.

Isabella and Nathaniel prepared to take their leave from host Richard Ashford. As they made their way toward the exit, they crossed paths with Alexander's group.

Being VIP guests, Richard insisted on personally escorting both parties downstairs.

During the descent, though Isabella and Victoria had both spoken at the event, not a single word passed between them.

Genevieve, unable to conceal her irritation, glared daggers at Isabella's back the entire way.

Richard, initially oblivious to the tension, gradually became aware of the charged atmosphere but wisely refrained from comment.

Upon reaching the lobby, just as Isabella and Nathaniel were about to depart, a sleek black sedan pulled up.

Richard chuckled. "Mr. Whitmore, I thought you were occupied tonight. To what do we owe this pleasure?"

Genevieve cut in loudly, casting a pointed look at Isabella. "He just flew back from Europe! Came straight here to collect Victoria!"

Richard laughed. "Ah, young love."

Nathaniel gave Isabella a subtle nudge toward their waiting car.

She offered Alexander a final, perfunctory nod before turning away.

Once inside the vehicle, Nathaniel considered making a remark about the encounter but thought better of it. With the divorce proceedings underway, there seemed little point.

Just then, Isabella's phone lit up with an incoming call.

Sebastian Ashford.

She stared at the screen for a long moment before declining the call.

Nathaniel couldn't resist commenting. "Sebastian's a decent man. You're nearly divorced—are you really not going to give him a chance?"

Isabella set her phone aside. "I don't have those feelings for him. Starting something just because he's interested would be unfair to us both."

"But shouldn't you at least try? Feelings can develop over time."

She shook her head firmly. "If that happens, we'll address it then."

Nathaniel sighed. "Your call."

The following morning, barely an hour into her workday, Isabella's phone began vibrating incessantly.

She froze when she saw the notifications—a rapid succession of bank transfers.

All originating from Alexander Whitmore.

As the staggering sums continued appearing, realization dawned—Alexander was executing their divorce settlement ahead of schedule, transferring the liquid assets specified in their agreement.

They hadn't even filed the final paperwork yet, and he was already fulfilling his financial obligations?

Her suspicions were confirmed minutes later.

Jonathan Blackwood called promptly at 10:15 AM. "Ms. Sinclair, Mr. Whitmore has initiated the asset transfer process."

"The liquid portion—his attorney confirms it's already been deposited into your accounts. Regarding the real estate holdings, all documentation has been processed."

"I'll collect everything this afternoon and deliver the paperwork to you personally."

Isabella nodded absently. "Fine. I'll be at The Grandeur after three."

"Understood," Jonathan replied before ending the call.
###Chapter 411

The afternoon sun streamed through the windows of Isabella Sinclair's office as she reviewed financial reports with Kieran Blackwood. A sharp knock interrupted their discussion.

"Ms. Sinclair, Mr. Blackwood is here to see you." Victoria Chambers announced from the doorway.

"Thank you, Victoria." Isabella turned to Kieran. "I need to handle some personal matters. Let's continue this later."

Kieran exchanged polite nods with Jonathan Blackwood and his associate before excusing himself.

The two lawyers entered, each carrying sleek leather briefcases. As Victoria closed the door behind them, they began methodically arranging stacks of legal documents across Isabella's desk.

After completing the meticulous inventory, Jonathan added, "Mr. Whitmore's attorney asked me to relay a message."

He cleared his throat. "Should you find the management responsibilities burdensome and wish to divest your shares, Mr. Whitmore would be most interested in acquiring them at fair market value."

Isabella's expression remained impassive. "Noted."

With no further business, Jonathan and his assistant departed promptly.

Isabella glanced at the mountain of paperwork now occupying her office, then deliberately turned her attention back to her computer screen.

Thirty minutes later, Nathaniel Graves appeared in her doorway. His curious gaze immediately fell upon the two briefcases resting near her chair.

"What's all this?" he asked, stepping inside.

"The finalized asset division from my separation agreement with Alexander."

Nathaniel whistled low. "All of it? That's what - ten billion dollars worth? I thought the agreement gave him two years post-divorce to transfer everything."

He raised an eyebrow. "You haven't even filed the final paperwork yet, and he's already handed over the entire fortune?"

Isabella nodded. "Every last share and property deed."

Nathaniel gave a humorless chuckle. "Someone's in a hurry."

This explained Alexander's recent urgency about completing the divorce proceedings.

"And the cash settlement?" Nathaniel pressed.

"Cleared this morning."

"Tsk." Despite knowing Isabella had emotionally moved on, Alexander's efficiency stung. "You two haven't even signed the final decree yet, and he's rushing to sever all financial ties."

He crossed his arms. "What - was he afraid you'd change your mind?"

Isabella shrugged. "Does it matter?"

Since requesting the divorce last year, she'd focused solely on the end result, not Alexander's motivations.

Nathaniel hesitated before voicing an unexpected thought. "This level of immediate compliance... in a strange way, it almost suggests he still trusts you?"

Trust?

Their entire relationship had begun with a drunken mistake Alexander still believed she'd orchestrated. What trust could possibly exist between them?

Nathaniel quickly recognized his misstep. "Forget I said that."

Isabella smoothly redirected the conversation. "What brings you by?"

"Our tenth anniversary gala planning. We need to finalize the venue and guest list."

YodaVision's milestone celebration demanded grandeur, especially given their recent high-profile partnership with Whitmore Industries.

As they concluded their discussion, Nathaniel mentioned, "We'll need to extend invitations to Whitmore Industries' executives, naturally."

Isabella's response was calm and professional. "Of course."
###Chapter 412

The evening shadows stretched long across Isabella's office as she gathered her things to leave. Her phone buzzed insistently - Sophia Whitmore's name flashing across the screen.

Tomorrow was Saturday. Isabella guessed her stepdaughter wanted to arrange a visit. But her schedule was already packed.

She had promised Margaret Sinclair they would visit Evelyn at the nursing home together. The doctors needed to discuss her mother's deteriorating condition and adjust medications accordingly.

With a sigh, Isabella silenced the call.

Saturday dawned bright but carried no warmth for Isabella. At the nursing home, Evelyn looked alarmingly frail - her once-lustrous hair now brittle, her complexion ashen.

Dr. Whitmore adjusted his glasses. "The antipsychotics we previously prescribed are causing liver toxicity."

"Given her current organ failure, we've had to discontinue several medications. Combined with the antibiotics..." His voice trailed off meaningfully.

Isabella's knuckles whitened around her purse strap as she nodded.

The medical consultation stretched through the morning. It wasn't until noon that she and Charles finally left the facility.

Sophia called again as they exited. Isabella stared at the ringing phone, then firmly declined.

The calls stopped after that.

But fate wasn't done with her yet. That afternoon, Emily Donovan - freshly returned from Paris Fashion Week - phoned with shopping plans.

Isabella nearly refused. Between Evelyn's decline and Margaret's recent fatigue, outings held little appeal.

"Stop locking yourself away," Margaret chided gently, patting her granddaughter's hand. "Some fresh air will do you good."

Reluctantly, Isabella changed and met Emily at The Grandeur Mall.

Over milk tea, months of separation melted away. When Isabella finally shared Evelyn's prognosis, Emily's cup hit the saucer with a clatter.

"She'll... she'll pull through," Emily offered weakly after a long pause.

Isabella wished she could believe that. But the doctors' grim expressions told another story.

"I shouldn't have dragged you out when-"

"It's fine," Isabella began, then froze. Her entire body went rigid.

Emily followed her gaze to the elegant couple browsing nearby. Reginald Kensington, impeccably tailored, carried shopping bags while his wife Eleanor selected garments with practiced ease.

The Kensingtons looked decades younger than their age, radiating contentment as they enjoyed their Saturday outing.

Emily's nails dug into her palms. "How do people like that sleep at night?"

Isabella lowered her eyes. The injustice burned like acid.

What made it worse, Emily added quietly, was that Alexander still-

Isabella's grip threatened to crack her cup.

They left soon after. The encounter had extinguished what little remained of Isabella's mood.

Monday morning found her at Whitmore Enterprises with Nathaniel Graves. Their tech team meeting proceeded smoothly - conspicuously without Alexander's presence.

During a bathroom break, Isabella rounded a corner to find Alexander deep in discussion with Daniel Prescott. Both men fell silent at her approach.

She moved to pass without acknowledgment when Alexander spoke: "Sophia's been trying to reach you. When she calls, answer."
###Chapter 413

Isabella didn't utter a single word as she strode past Alexander and Daniel into the conference hall.

Several attendees had witnessed her brief exchange with Alexander at the entrance.

Since most were unaware of their complicated history, they dismissed it as mere professional courtesy.

But Nathaniel Graves knew better.

The moment she returned to her seat, he leaned in discreetly. "Did you two—"

"No," Isabella cut him off with a firm shake of her head. "We didn't argue."

Even during their most strained moments, she and Alexander had never resorted to shouting matches - certainly not now when their companies had just formalized their partnership.

The collaboration between Whitmore Enterprises and VisionTech kept Isabella occupied at Whitmore headquarters the entire day.

At precisely 5:17 PM, an excited shout erupted across the conference room.

"Holy mother of code! It actually works!"

"What? What happened?"

"Ms. Sinclair identified flaws in our previous model last week. We implemented her structural modifications to the algorithm and data framework these past three days."

"The efficiency improvements are staggering! That bottleneck that's haunted us for twenty-three months? Gone like yesterday's coffee!"

Another engineer chimed in, "And the alignment issues we've struggled with? Major breakthroughs. I'm telling you, Ms. Sinclair operates on another level entirely."

This praise carried significant weight - Whitmore Enterprises boasted the industry's brightest minds, each recruited at considerable expense.

These were professionals who didn't suffer impostor syndrome lightly.

Yet now they collectively recognized that no matter how skilled one became, there would always be someone operating at a higher altitude.

The entire tech team regarded Isabella with newfound admiration.

One particularly enthusiastic engineer rushed forward to shake her hand. "No wonder you're the lead author on that groundbreaking paper! Your insights are revolutionary!"

Isabella's lips curved into a modest smile just as her gaze landed on an unexpected observer - Victoria Kensington.

Her smile faltered momentarily.

The engineers finally noticed their visitor. "Ms. Kensington! How long have you been standing there?"

Before Victoria could respond, Theodore Sinclair chuckled. "She's been observing for quite some time. You were all too engrossed to notice."

Victoria's tight-lipped smile didn't reach her eyes.

Theodore spoke truth - she'd witnessed the entire exchange where Whitmore's top engineers hung on Isabella's every word.

While Victoria could follow the technical discussion at surface level, Isabella's contributions operated several tiers above everyone else's comprehension.

Her ability to pinpoint core issues and propose elegant solutions left even the senior engineers scrambling to keep pace.

Let alone someone with Victoria's more... generalized skill set.

The engineers, still buzzing from their breakthrough, were about to dive into technical specifics when Alexander's voice cut through the excitement. "Someone want to explain the commotion?"

Normally deferential to their CEO, the engineers barely tempered their enthusiasm.

Just as one opened his mouth, Victoria interjected. "Finished with your meetings?"

Alexander acknowledged her with a nod before his attention shifted to her pallor. Concern creased his brow. "You look unwell. Should I call medical?"
###Chapter 414

"It's nothing." Victoria smiled, then glanced casually at her wristwatch. "We should get going now."

Alexander nodded. "Alright."

After exchanging brief pleasantries with the executives in the boardroom, he followed Victoria out.

Meanwhile, Isabella remained immersed in discussions with the engineering team.

Her thoughts kept drifting to Evelyn's deteriorating condition. Since the diagnosis, she'd been staying at the Sinclair estate every night.

That evening, after wrapping up at Whitmore Corporation, Isabella returned to the Sinclair mansion for dinner.

Just as she finished her meal, her phone screen illuminated with a notification.

A text from Sebastian: "Reporting back to headquarters tomorrow."

Isabella read the message but didn't respond.

Perhaps anticipating her silence, another message followed shortly after. "See you in thirty days."

His way of signaling that once her divorce was finalized, he'd begin courting her properly.

Isabella understood the implication but still didn't reply.

As she set down her phone and reached for the book on the coffee table, it rang again.

Eleanor Whitmore's name flashed on the screen.

"Darling," the elderly woman's voice carried concern through the receiver. "I've heard about Evelyn's situation. How could you and Margaret keep something this serious from me?"

Isabella hesitated, searching for words.

Eleanor pressed urgently, "Margaret mentioned her condition has worsened. How is she now?"

"Her spirits have improved these past couple days," Isabella replied carefully.

A relieved sigh came through the line. "Thank goodness." Then with sudden determination: "Don't worry, my dear. I'll mobilize my connections for Evelyn. The finest specialists will see to her care."

"Thank you, Grandmother," Isabella said. "Though I've already arranged for a leading specialist to evaluate Mother tomorrow."

"Oh?" Eleanor sounded pleasantly surprised. "We'll await their assessment then."

"Yes."

A weighted pause followed before Eleanor murmured, "Your mother truly has..." Her voice trailed off.

Endured so much.

Isabella understood the unspoken words.

Before she could respond, Eleanor quickly added, "Margaret said with proper treatment, there's still hope. Try not to dwell on the worst, darling."

"I won't."

They spoke a while longer before ending the call.

After hanging up, Eleanor's heart ached for her granddaughter. Compelled by emotion, she dialed Alexander.

He answered promptly. "Grandmother?"

"You!" Her voice trembled with restrained emotion.

Alexander detected her agitation. Having done nothing recently to warrant her displeasure, he inquired, "Is something wrong?"

"Nothing," she deflected. "Just needed to vent my frustrations."

One dark eyebrow arched. "Oh?"

Despite her initial anger, words failed her now. With a soft huff, she disconnected.

As he set down his phone, Sophia looked up from her dessert. "Was that Nana? Is everything alright?"

"Apparently she just needed someone to shout at," Alexander mused.

Victoria, seated nearby, chuckled softly. "She probably misses you."

"Doubtful," he countered. "She usually finds my presence irritating."

The next morning when Isabella and Margaret arrived at the hospital, Eleanor was already waiting.

The medical team arrived precisely on schedule.

Leading them was a silver-haired woman who appeared even more senior than both Eleanor and Margaret.

"Is that... Dr. Whitmore?"

Eleanor Whitmore stood among the foremost global authorities on organ failure treatment.

Having retired years prior, her services were virtually unobtainable.

Even those with considerable influence and resources found her inaccessible.

Most leading specialists in the field had trained under her at some point.

When Isabella mentioned arranging for specialists, Eleanor never imagined she meant herself.

The sight of her renowned grandmother in a white coat again left Eleanor momentarily speechless.
###Chapter 415

Isabella recognized Eleanor immediately.

After exchanging pleasantries, her gaze shifted to Evelyn with a warm smile. "You must be Evelyn Sinclair?"

This was their first meeting. Evelyn responded politely, "Yes, that's correct."

Eleanor gave an approving nod. "You're quite lovely - both inside and out."

She'd been fully briefed about Evelyn's mother's condition before arriving at the medical center.

Yet rather than rushing to prescribe treatment, she preferred to assess the situation thoroughly first.

Isabella and Margaret had intended to stay throughout the examination and treat her to lunch afterward.

But Eleanor insisted they leave, promising to contact them once she finalized the treatment plan.

"As for dining together," she told Evelyn with a kind smile, "we'll have plenty of opportunities later - no need to rush."

With no other choice, Evelyn and Margaret departed for the time being.

After leaving the medical facility, Evelyn returned to her office while Margaret accompanied Eleanor back to the Sinclair estate.

That evening after work, Evelyn joined the family for dinner at the estate. Margaret remained present throughout the meal.

As Margaret prepared to leave afterward, she took Evelyn's hand gently and sighed.

She knew about the finalized divorce papers between Evelyn and Alexander days earlier.

Since the decision was made, she wouldn't interfere. Even if she wanted to, some stubborn individuals wouldn't listen anyway.

Perhaps starting fresh was truly best for Evelyn after all.

With that thought, Margaret simply said, "Take care of yourself, dear."

Evelyn nodded. "I will. You too, Grandmother."

Upon returning to the Whitmore mansion, Margaret froze upon seeing an unexpected visitor in the parlor.

"What are you doing here?"

Alexander turned from the window. "You scolded me so harshly yesterday. I assumed you missed me."

Margaret scoffed and asked the housekeeper, "When did he arrive?"

"Around six, madam. I meant to inform you, but Mr. Whitmore insisted-"

"Nana!" Sophia came bounding down the staircase.

Seeing the child, Margaret finally smiled.

She embraced the girl warmly. "Sophia darling, have you eaten dinner yet?"

"Papa and I already ate. What about you, Nana?"

"Yes, dear," Margaret replied, though her weariness showed after the long day.

Alexander noticed immediately. "I actually came to discuss something, but you're clearly exhausted. Perhaps tomorrow morning-"

Margaret knew whatever he wanted would involve Victoria Kensington.

"I can't control your decisions, but spare me these discussions." Her tone turned sharp.

Sophia, witnessing her grandmother's rare irritation, asked innocently, "Nana, are you upset?"

"Just tired, sweetheart." Margaret's expression softened toward the child before hardening again toward Alexander. "Evelyn's mother is gravely ill. Were you aware?"

Even with Eleanor's expertise, Evelyn's mother's condition might be too advanced.

Alexander responded evenly, "I am now."

His detached tone revealed nothing. No surprise, no concern - just the same cold indifference toward Evelyn's troubles.

Sophia looked up. "Hasn't Grandma Evelyn been sick for a long time?"

She vaguely remembered Evelyn mentioning her mother's chronic illness years ago.

"Your grandmother has developed a new condition," Margaret explained gently.

Then without glancing at Alexander, she said coldly, "In future, keep your personal affairs to yourself. You may leave now."
###Chapter 416

Evelyn's medical treatment wouldn't be available immediately.

The following day, Isabella returned to work after her hospital visit, maintaining her usual routine.

Gregory Pembroke had flown in from out of state for business discussions with Isabella and Nathaniel Graves.

At midday, Isabella and Nathaniel took Gregory to lunch at The Grandeur.

Their collaboration was nearing finalization. During the car ride, Nathaniel inquired about Gregory's departure plans.

Gregory smiled warmly. "I'll be extending my stay by two days. Another business meeting came up tomorrow."

Nathaniel raised an eyebrow with interest. "What sort of collaboration?"

"InnovaTech," Gregory replied.

The name made both Isabella and Nathaniel's smiles falter momentarily.

Unaware of the tension between YodaVision and InnovaTech, Gregory continued enthusiastically. "InnovaTech recently made a technological breakthrough. Industry experts are predicting remarkable growth potential."

"Yesterday, Ms. Kensington from InnovaTech proposed a partnership. The terms seemed favorable, so I accepted."

Caught up in their own projects, Isabella and Nathaniel hadn't tracked this development. The unexpected news darkened their expressions.

After exchanging a glance with Isabella, Nathaniel responded neutrally, "Is that so?"

Their conversation continued until they reached the restaurant.

As they exited after lunch, the elevator doors opened to reveal Victoria Kensington and her entourage.

"Mr. Pembroke!" Victoria and Reginald Kensington greeted Gregory warmly, equally surprised by the encounter.

After pleasantries, Gregory gestured to Isabella and Nathaniel. "Ms. Kensington, these two are—"

Nathaniel interrupted smoothly. "No introductions necessary. We're acquainted."

Gregory chuckled. "Of course, we met last time. My memory fails me sometimes."

He added admiringly, "Mr. Kensington, Ms. Kensington, your company's progress is truly impressive. Quite enviable."

Victoria and Reginald accepted the compliment with practiced modesty.

Since InnovaTech's R&D team overcame their technical hurdles, their autonomous vehicle project had gained significant industry traction. Analysts now valued the company at potential billions.

Reginald's struggling tech firm had also made breakthroughs with external assistance, its future suddenly bright.

The Kensington and Sinclair families reveled in InnovaTech's success. Genevieve Kensington couldn't hide her smug satisfaction when looking at Isabella.

All credit went to Alexander Whitmore, who had seemingly anticipated this outcome when transferring the company to Victoria. His unsurprised reaction to the breakthrough spoke volumes.

With both Kensington enterprises thriving and Alexander's impending divorce from Isabella, fortune clearly favored the Kensington family.

Isabella and Nathaniel remained silent observers throughout.

Victoria didn't even glance Isabella's way.

The groups parted ways in the lobby.

Back in the car, Nathaniel researched the news, understanding the Kensingtons' elation.

"Alexander is really—"

Too generous.

He left the thought unspoken, respecting Isabella's feelings, though his own resentment simmered.

Returning to the office, they were reviewing meeting notes when accounting notified them: InnovaTech's final compensation payment—over $100 million—had cleared.

Nathaniel blinked. "They raised that amount already?"

Isabella nodded. "Apparently."

A heavy silence followed before they refocused on work.

Later that afternoon, Isabella's phone rang mid-meeting. Emily Donovan's voice came through urgently.

"Bella, have you heard about InnovaTech?"

"I have."

"That witch got incredibly lucky. If their autonomous vehicles gain market traction, doesn't that mean—"

Isabella's grip tightened on her mouse. Before she could respond, Emily continued, "And your father's company is thriving too."

"They might secure the government's smart traffic platform contract. That project would establish Locket Tech permanently in Fairview."

Emily's voice dripped with resentment. "Why? Why do these people keep succeeding?"
###Chapter 417

Isabella didn't respond to that unspoken question. She'd asked herself the same thing countless times in the past.

The harsh reality was this world operated on its own unfair rules.

That bitter truth had settled into her bones years ago.

So she'd stopped questioning long ago.

Back then, she'd been powerless to change anything. But now-

Both she and Nathaniel were well aware of Salzburg's smart traffic initiative. It represented a golden opportunity.

Yet with AuroraTech's reputation skyrocketing and their current project pipeline overflowing, they'd initially dismissed bidding for it.

But now-

After ending the call, Isabella dove into researching the project specifications online.

The initiative aimed to optimize scheduling for congested urban roads using cutting-edge AI algorithms, integrating traffic monitoring, signal systems, and other critical modules.

While these technical requirements might overwhelm other companies, for her they presented no real challenge.

As for InnovaTech's autonomous vehicle development-

Isabella remained silent for a prolonged moment before rising and striding toward Nathaniel's office.

After hearing her out, Nathaniel's lips curved into a knowing smile. "So the city's transportation project. The Kensingtons have their puppet masters pulling strings, thinking it's already in their pocket?"

"We might have passed initially, but if the Kensingtons are bidding, we'd be fools not to intervene."

He added thoughtfully, "If you're committed to this, you have my full support. Though it'll mean grueling hours."

Isabella shook her head, determination hardening her gaze. "Hard work doesn't scare me."

Then she outlined her strategy regarding InnovaTech's autonomous vehicle initiative.

Nathaniel arched an eyebrow. "You've already formulated a plan?"

"Yes." Isabella nodded firmly. "Whether it's the engine architecture or the AI control systems, I can provide technical oversight. We just need the right manufacturing partner."

Nathaniel had been simmering all afternoon since learning about the Kensingtons' involvement with Alexander. Hearing Isabella's confidence, his mood visibly lifted.

He slapped the desk decisively. "Consider it handled!"

Suddenly taking on two major projects - especially a long-term municipal contract - would inevitably disrupt AuroraTech's existing operations.

Yet Nathaniel offered his unconditional backing.

Isabella recognized his support stemmed partly from personal loyalty. Warmth blossomed in her chest.

"Thank you, Nathaniel," she said softly.

He gave her hair an affectionate ruffle. "Save your thanks. If we land this, my profit margins will thank me enough. I've still got plenty of fight left in this old warhorse."

When Isabella committed to something, perfection became her only standard.

That very night, she began drafting the municipal traffic project proposal.

While the technical hurdles didn't intimidate her, the looming deadline meant every minute counted.

She worked straight through until dawn.

The next day, she'd originally scheduled a site visit to Whitmore Industries with Nathaniel. She canceled.

Instead, she instructed him to contact her remotely if any issues arose.

Even in routine collaborations, Whitmore's engineers often struggled to match her pace.

Showing up in person would only mean wasted hours waiting for them to catch up.

With two major projects now competing for her attention, every second mattered.
###Chapter 418

The following days kept Isabella Sinclair completely engrossed in finalizing details for the smart city infrastructure proposal. She conducted multiple field visits herself, double-checking every technical specification to ensure perfection.

Her diligence paid off when the comprehensive bid documents were submitted with hours to spare.

Nathaniel Graves received the notification first. His response was brief but warm: "Impressive work."

His own schedule had been equally demanding recently.

Between internal corporate restructuring, the ongoing partnership with Whitmore Technologies, and two high-profile industry dinners, every moment was accounted for.

The networking events yielded promising contacts - several autonomous vehicle manufacturers had expressed interest in collaboration.

Nathaniel intended to thoroughly vet these potential partners before committing.

Meanwhile, the YodaVision-Whitmore Tech alliance progressed seamlessly, already entering its second development phase.

To mark this milestone, Alexander Whitmore extended a personal dinner invitation to Nathaniel and their primary project liaison.

Nathaniel's message to Isabella arrived as the celebratory meal concluded.

Though he maintained professional reservations about Alexander, Nathaniel couldn't deny Whitmore Tech's sterling reputation in the industry.

Their engineering team's expertise was undeniable, making the technical collaboration surprisingly smooth.

Less pleasant were the inevitable social encounters - particularly with members of the Kensington and Fairchild families.

Nathaniel excused himself early rather than exchange pleasantries.

From across the room, Genevieve observed his departure with a smirk. Leaning toward Victoria, she murmured, "Ever since Whitmore Tech partnered with YodaVision, that social climber's been acting like she's the linchpin of the entire operation."

"Funny how she's suddenly disappeared these past few days. Maybe she finally realized her place?"

The unspoken implication referred to Alexander transferring control of InnovaTech to Victoria - now the rapidly expanding autonomous vehicle division receiving industry-wide acclaim.

After Alexander departed, Genevieve added smugly, "All Isabella's hustle means nothing when Nathaniel would never hand her a billion-dollar enterprise."

"Her entire career couldn't reach where you started!"

"That marriage scheme and even producing an heir netted her less than Alexander casually gifted you. Pathetic really."

"Imagine her devastation knowing he gave you that fortune without hesitation."

Victoria maintained a composed smile, offering no reply.

Truthfully, she'd felt unsettled witnessing Isabella's professional competence.

But as Genevieve pointed out - what tangible gains had Isabella's relentless efforts actually yielded?

Even with her sharpened skills and connections like Nathaniel and Frederick, how many lifetimes would it take to amass Victoria's level of wealth and influence?

Penelope chimed in with a derisive chuckle, "Some divides can't be crossed."

No matter Isabella's achievements, she remained fundamentally outmatched.

Reginald remained silent but concurred. This explained why despite her relentless striving, she remained irrelevant.

That same evening found Isabella and Nathaniel dining with a prominent autonomous vehicle executive.

The smart infrastructure bid results would be announced within days.

On judgment day, Victoria arrived with Reginald well ahead of schedule, radiating confidence.

They mingled effortlessly with other bidders, exchanging pleasantries with relaxed smiles.

Isabella and Nathaniel entered last.

The sight froze Victoria and Reginald mid-conversation.

YodaVision hadn't registered for this bid. Their presence could mean only one thing.

In that instant, all composure drained from the Kensingtons' faces. Against YodaVision's involvement, even Whitmore backing couldn't guarantee victory.

Suddenly, Isabella's recent absence from Whitmore Tech made perfect sense.

Without acknowledging the stunned pair, Isabella and Nathaniel proceeded to their reserved seats through the murmuring crowd.
###Chapter 419

The tension in the room was palpable.

It wasn't just Victoria and Reginald. The other bidders took one look at Isabella and Nathaniel and immediately knew their chances had just evaporated.

And they were right.

The results were announced swiftly. The smart traffic project went to YodaVision.

Isabella and Nathaniel exchanged a knowing glance. They had expected nothing less. With more pressing matters on their agenda, they had no intention of lingering.

As they walked past Victoria and Reginald without so much as a glance, the Kensington family’s expressions darkened further.

Since relocating to Fairview, Kensington Tech had been thriving—thanks largely to Alexander Whitmore’s backing.

Victoria’s connection to him had opened doors, granting their company visibility within elite circles.

But that recognition was limited. They still lacked a strong public reputation.

The reason? A glaring absence of cutting-edge technology.

This smart traffic project had been their golden opportunity.

Winning it would have catapulted Kensington Tech into the spotlight, solidifying their credibility.

Their entire team had poured their souls into this bid—countless sleepless nights, endless resources. They had been so sure of victory.

And yet…

After Isabella and Nathaniel left, Victoria and Reginald remained seated, silent.

Back at the Kensington estate, the family had been waiting anxiously for news. Genevieve couldn’t hold back any longer and called Victoria.

“Well? Did we get it?”

Victoria’s voice was eerily calm. “No.”

“No?” Genevieve’s face twisted in disbelief. “That’s impossible. Who—”

“YodaVision won.”

Genevieve froze. “YodaVision? But they weren’t even in the running! How—”

Realization struck. Her lips curled into a snarl. “That witch. She’s jealous of you, Victoria. She can’t stand how close you are to Alexander, so she sabotaged us!”

She scoffed. “But the more she pulls these stunts, the more he’ll despise her. I’m calling him right now—”

Victoria cut her off sharply. “YodaVision is collaborating with the Whitmore Group. Even if Alexander wanted to intervene, he couldn’t touch her right now.”

Genevieve hesitated. “Then… what do we do? Just let her get away with this?”

Victoria didn’t answer.

Just because they couldn’t retaliate now didn’t mean they never would.

Back home, Diana, Beatrice, and the others were furious when they heard the news.

This wasn’t just personal—it was about the future of Kensington Tech.

They couldn’t let Isabella keep undermining them.

First, she had interfered between Victoria and Alexander. Then Nathaniel. Now she was sabotaging their company?

“This can’t continue,” Reginald said grimly. “I’ll speak to her.”

The stakes were too high to ignore.

In fact, earlier, when Isabella and Nathaniel were leaving the venue, he had nearly called out to her. But with so many eyes watching, it hadn’t been the right moment.

The next morning, as Isabella stepped out of her car in YodaVision’s parking lot, Reginald emerged from his own vehicle.

“Isabella,” he called, his voice firm.
###Chapter 420

Isabella showed no flicker of surprise when Reginald appeared before her.

The smart traffic initiative was the crown jewel of the Kensington family's tech empire. Yet she'd snatched it from their grasp at the eleventh hour. Did they truly expect her to believe they'd let this slide?

This wouldn't be the last time she struck either.

With the contract signed and the project firmly in AuroraTech's control, the Kensingtons had no legal recourse to reclaim it.

If her instincts were right, Reginald had come crawling with one purpose - to prevent future losses to his family's empire.

And what weapon would he wield? Sentimentality, of course. The cheapest currency of all.

But Isabella had no patience for hollow emotional manipulation.

She spun around, cutting off Reginald's opening words. "I recall that gala last spring quite vividly. Your mother declared before three hundred guests that I was no granddaughter of hers. You've resided in Fairview for eight months now. We've crossed paths at charity events, gallery openings, even the opera."

Her voice turned glacial. "Not once have you introduced me as your daughter in public. So tell me, Mr. Kensington, what exactly do you imagine you could say to me now?"

The truth hung between them like shattered glass - their familial bond existed only in name.

Reginald stiffened. Before he could formulate a response, a dark chuckle echoed from the shadows.

Nathaniel's voice slithered through the tension. "She poses an excellent question. What possible words could justify your neglect, Reginald?"

"This is a private matter between Isabella and-"

"'Isabella'?" Nathaniel's mocking interruption dripped with disdain. "How touching. Yet I don't recall such familiarity when the society pages were watching."

The conversation had reached its natural conclusion. Isabella turned to Nathaniel. "We're leaving."

The absolute indifference in her eyes struck Reginald like a physical blow. His daughter truly saw him as a stranger now.

Without a backward glance, Isabella strode toward the elevators.

Reginald found himself speechless, his carefully rehearsed pleas turning to ash in his mouth.

Nathaniel kept pace beside her, his voice laced with contempt. "The audacity to come begging after publicly disowning you. Pathetic."

Isabella's lips curved without warmth. "I stopped being surprised by them years ago."

When Reginald returned to the Kensington estate, the family descended upon him like vultures.

Eleanor's frown carved deep grooves in her powdered face. "Well? What did she say?"

Reginald shook his head. "She wouldn't even hear me out."

Victoria's manicured nails tapped against her champagne flute. "This was always a long shot. One lost project doesn't mean she can consistently outmaneuver us."

Genevieve snorted. "Exactly. AuroraTech backing her was pure luck. Do we really believe Nathaniel Graves will champion her every whim?"

The unspoken fear hung heavy - Isabella with Nathaniel's resources was unpredictable. Dangerous.

Oliver adjusted his cufflinks. "We simply need better safeguards moving forward. Monitor her activities more closely."

Reginald exhaled sharply. "For now, that's our only option."

The family dispersed, but the tension lingered like storm clouds gathering on the horizon.
###Chapter 421

Since Evelyn's illness was still in its early stages with no severe organ damage yet, Eleanor and her medical team could make multiple adjustments based on her overall health status.

After careful consideration, they finally devised a treatment plan capable of stabilizing her condition.

When the news arrived, the suffocating tension gripping Isabella and Margaret finally dissipated. The oppressive gloom that had shrouded the Sinclair family for two weeks finally lifted.

That evening, overwhelmed with relief, Margaret personally prepared a celebratory dinner for everyone.

As Isabella settled on the living room sofa with Margaret after the meal, her phone suddenly rang - it was Sophia calling.

Mother and daughter hadn't spoken in nearly six weeks.

Truthfully, Isabella should have answered when Sophia first called. But at that time, she'd just learned about Evelyn's organ failure. Devastated, she couldn't bring herself to pick up.

Now...

Seeing the caller ID, Margaret gently urged, "Answer it."

Though unspoken, she deeply valued the bond between Sophia and Victoria.

She'd noticed Isabella hadn't allowed Sophia to visit recently and guessed the reason - Isabella feared seeing Sophia might further destabilize her already fragile emotional state.

While she'd never truly resented Sophia's closeness with Victoria, seeing her during those dark days likely would have stirred bitterness.

Now that Evelyn's condition showed hope, Margaret naturally wanted Isabella and Sophia to reconcile.

Isabella stared at the name flashing on her screen. After a brief hesitation, she finally answered.

Sophia had planned to call again days after Isabella missed her first attempt. But Alexander, who usually encouraged her to call whenever she missed her mother, advised against disturbing Isabella during her busy period.

So Sophia restrained herself.

This time though, she couldn't hold back any longer. It had been too long since she'd seen or even spoken to her mother.

When the call connected and she actually heard Isabella's voice, Sophia immediately brightened. "Mom!"

But before Isabella could respond, Sophia's pent-up emotions overflowed. Her voice turned plaintive, "Mom, you finally answered! You have no idea how much I've missed you lately..."

Hearing her tearful, aggrieved tone, Isabella lowered her gaze, masking her emotions before replying calmly, "Have you eaten dinner?"

"Yes!" Sophia instantly perked up at her mother's voice. Then eagerly asked, "Mom, when are you free? I can come tomorrow - no, I can come right now!"

Isabella said, "I have work tomorrow. But if you want to—"

After a pause, she added, "Check with your father first. If he agrees—"

"He will!" Sophia interrupted excitedly before she could finish. "I'm packing right now! Mom, wait for me!"

She immediately hung up, turned to the man reading beside her, and announced, "Mom said I can visit!"

Alexander turned a page before looking up. "Understood. Need a ride?"

"Nope!" Sophia grabbed Margaret's hand and dashed upstairs to pack.

Minutes later, she bounded downstairs with her backpack, breezing past Alexander still reading in the living room without a glance.

Waving as she sprinted out, she called, "Dad, I'm leaving now!"

Alexander turned slightly, watching her small figure disappear through the doorway. "Alright. Be safe. Good night."

"Good night!" came the distant reply.
###Chapter 422

The morning sun cast golden streaks across Salzburg as Isabella Sinclair navigated through the bustling streets. After dropping Sophia at her prestigious academy, she headed straight to The Grandeur headquarters.

Her previous meetings with two autonomous vehicle company CEOs - arranged by Nathaniel Graves - had proven disappointing. Neither partnership aligned with her vision for innovation.

That evening found them at the annual tech gala at Maplewood Docks, arriving fashionably early to network. Crystal chandeliers illuminated the ballroom as champagne flutes clinked around them.

Their careful scanning of the room halted abruptly when Alexander Whitmore entered with Victoria Kensington on his arm. Both pairs quickly averted their gazes, the tension palpable even across the crowded venue.

The arrival of Dominic Fairchild and Simon Fairchild added another layer to the evening's dynamics. Dominic, ever the diplomat, approached Isabella's group first.

"Mr. Graves, Ms. Sinclair," he greeted with practiced charm. "What a pleasure seeing you both again."

Their polite but frosty nods spoke volumes. The memory of past conflicts still lingered between them.

Sensing the chill, Dominic smoothly transitioned to Alexander's group. "Mr. Whitmore, Ms. Kensington. You both look splendid tonight."

Alexander acknowledged him with a curt nod while Victoria offered a practiced smile. "Mr. Fairchild. How lovely to see you."

Dominic's gaze lingered a moment too long before he excused himself, leaving the two power couples to their respective circles.

The gala buzzed with energy as industry leaders vied for attention. Isabella and Nathaniel found themselves constantly interrupted by eager executives, their original mission temporarily sidelined.

Across the room, Victoria noticed the shift in how people treated her. No longer just Alexander's beautiful companion, she now commanded respect as InnovaTech's CEO. The billion-dollar company transfer had changed everything.

Simon nudged Dominic. "You have to admit, when it comes to grand romantic gestures, Whitmore sets the bar impossibly high."

Dominic watched Victoria work the room, her emerald gown catching the light. "She's earned every bit of it," he murmured.

Simon raised an eyebrow but held his tongue. Both his best friend and their rival seemed utterly bewitched by the same woman.

"Financial freedom does have its perks," Simon mused. "Being able to gift entire corporations on a whim? I wouldn't mind that power."

Dominic shot him a look. "You'd bankrupt yourself within months."

Their banter was interrupted by murmurs spreading through the crowd. Isabella and Nathaniel had finally connected with their target - the reclusive tech genius from Velotra.

Victoria observed the interaction with keen interest, though the constant stream of well-wishers prevented her from discerning their true purpose tonight. The game, it seemed, was far from over.
###Chapter 423

The night Isabella returned home, little Sophia was already fast asleep in her bedroom.

After a quick shower, Isabella slipped under the covers. Almost immediately, Sophia instinctively curled into her arms, murmuring drowsily, "Mommy...you're back?"

"Mm, go back to sleep, sweetheart."

No response came.

Isabella glanced down to find her daughter already deep in slumber once more.

The following morning, Nathaniel left early for a crucial business meeting while Isabella headed to Whitmore Corporation with her team of engineers.

The morning was spent in intense technical discussions with the R&D team.

As the meeting drew to a close, Isabella turned and noticed Alexander standing nearby, listening intently to her explanation.

She hesitated for just a second before continuing, addressing the group, "Actually, there are several excellent academic papers on this exact subject. Would you like me to recommend them?"

"Absolutely, Ms. Sinclair."

Isabella proceeded to list the titles and authors of the relevant publications.

When she turned to retrieve her notes, her eyes accidentally met Victoria's.

Alexander noticed Victoria's arrival and approached. "When did you get here?"

Isabella averted her gaze.

Victoria glanced briefly at Isabella before smiling faintly. "Just now."

In truth, she'd been standing there for several minutes.

She'd arrived just in time to see Alexander standing with his team, completely engrossed in Isabella's technical explanation.

Though she couldn't see his face clearly from her angle, the admiration in his gaze as he watched Isabella speak was unmistakable.

The realization made Victoria's smile falter slightly.

Never before had she seen Alexander look at Isabella with that particular expression.

But it probably meant nothing.

That afternoon, Victoria returned to Whitmore Corporation on business.

She went straight to Alexander's office, only to find it empty.

As she moved to sit down, her attention was drawn to several technical journals on his desk.

Curious, she picked one up and flipped through it, stopping at a marked article. Her breath caught when she recognized the title - it was one of the papers Isabella had recommended that morning.

Remembering how Alexander had stood so attentively beside Isabella earlier, Victoria's lips pressed into a thin line.

An idea occurred to her. She set the first journal down and quickly checked two others.

Both contained marked articles - all recommendations from Isabella's morning presentation.

And she recognized Alexander's distinctive annotation style immediately.

The office door suddenly swung open.

Startled, Victoria looked up to meet Benjamin's surprised gaze.

He recovered quickly. "Ms. Kensington? Mr. Whitmore's still in his meeting. It should wrap up in about thirty—"

"I understand," Victoria interrupted.

Benjamin noticed the journal in her hands. "Ah, those are the publications the boss had me rush out to purchase this morning. Are you interested in them too?"

"He had you buy these...today?"

"Yes, first thing this morning."

Victoria lowered her gaze at this revelation.

Benjamin, needing to retrieve some documents, missed her reaction. "I should get going—"

"Of course. Don't mind me."

"I'll have coffee brought in for you." With that, Benjamin hurried out.

Victoria carefully replaced the journal and moved to the sofa.

Though Benjamin had said the meeting would last another half hour, Alexander returned just minutes later.

Victoria smiled. "You're back early?"

Alexander replied, "Benjamin mentioned you were waiting. The important matters were already concluded."

As he spoke, his gaze flickered briefly toward the journals on his desk before he took a seat beside Victoria.

She noticed the momentary distraction, and her smile dimmed slightly.

For a fleeting moment, she'd thought he'd rushed back for her sake alone. Now she wasn't so sure.
###Chapter 424

The evening air was crisp when Isabella's phone buzzed on the vanity. Sophia had been staying at the Sinclair estate for three days now, and this was the first call she'd received.

"Mom!" Sophia's face lit up as she glanced at the caller ID. "It's Dad!"

Isabella barely had time to acknowledge with a soft hum before Sophia answered, immediately putting the call on speaker. "Daddy!"

Alexander's deep voice filled the room. "Have you eaten dinner yet, sweetheart?"

"I have!" Sophia chirped, swinging her legs where she sat on the edge of Isabella's bed.

After exchanging pleasantries, Alexander got to the point. "I'm sending someone to pick you up tomorrow morning. Remember we have plans with Victoria."

Though Isabella had been occupied with work commitments, these past days with Sophia had been unexpectedly joyful. The child's reluctance to leave was palpable in the way her fingers tightened around the phone.

"Daddy, I don't want to—" Sophia began, then abruptly stopped. A thoughtful expression crossed her face before she continued in a hushed tone, "Okay. But you have to come get me yourself."

Alexander's chuckle was warm with indulgence. "Of course, princess. I'll be there personally."

When the call ended, Sophia launched herself at Isabella, clinging to her arm like a limpet. "Mommy, I don't want to go..."

Isabella understood the unspoken conflict - Sophia's desire to stay warring with her commitment to Victoria. The child had chosen honor over her own wishes, a maturity that squeezed Isabella's heart.

"Start gathering your things," Isabella murmured, stroking Sophia's hair. "Your father will be here soon."

Sophia pouted. "Mommy! I told you I brought extra clothes so I wouldn't have to pack again for summer break. Don't you remember?"

Isabella remembered. She also remembered not agreeing to those summer plans, knowing the divorce would be finalized by then. But she simply said, "I remember," and redirected Sophia to collect her schoolwork.

The headlights of Alexander's car illuminated the driveway sooner than expected. Though the Sinclairs held no affection for Alexander, Margaret and Charles still came out to bid Sophia farewell, their fondness for the child overriding old grievances.

Alexander emerged from the car, his greeting to the elders polite but met with only curt nods. When his gaze found Isabella, she looked away, focusing on straightening Sophia's collar. "Time to go."

Sophia doled out hugs to each family member before climbing into the car. As the taillights disappeared down the drive, Margaret squeezed Isabella's hand. "The divorce proceedings will be finalized soon, yes?"

Isabella nodded silently.

Margaret sighed, her smile bittersweet. "Perhaps it's for the best."

Later, as Isabella settled at her desk, she typed out a message to Alexander: "You should tell Sophia about the divorce soon."

Most children would struggle with such news, but Sophia was resilient. She'd understand.

Alexander's reply came swiftly: "I'll choose the right moment."

Then, before she could set her phone down, another message appeared: "If there are additional terms you'd like included in the agreement, have your attorney contact mine. Within reason, I'll accommodate them."
###Chapter 425

Isabella Sinclair stared at the message Alexander Whitmore had sent, her fingers tightening slightly around her phone before typing a brief reply: "Nothing to add."

Alexander's response came almost instantly. "Understood."

The conversation ended there, the digital silence stretching between them like an unbridgeable gap.

Since Eleanor Whitmore had been brought in to treat Evelyn Sinclair, she'd moved from the nursing home to a private VIP suite at Fairview General Hospital for easier monitoring.

The following morning, Isabella arrived with her grandmother Margaret Sinclair to visit Evelyn.

Though weeks of treatment had passed, Evelyn still looked fragile - her cheeks hollow, her movements slow. But at least the deathly pallor from two weeks ago had faded somewhat.

Yet the sight of familiar faces still triggered her. Even the sound of certain voices could send her spiraling.

As they stepped out of Evelyn's room after their visit, Eleanor Whitmore joined them in the hallway. They'd barely begun discussing Evelyn's progress when footsteps echoed down the corridor.

Isabella turned - and froze.

Penelope Kensington walked toward them, flanked by Eleanor Kensington and Reginald Kensington.

Isabella's breath caught. What were they doing here?

Beside her, Margaret's grip on her arm tightened painfully. If Evelyn saw these people now, after everything...

Penelope's eyes widened when she spotted Eleanor Whitmore. "Is that Dr. Whitmore?" she whispered. "How did the Sinclairs get her to treat them? I thought she'd retired from practice."

Their gazes flickered toward Evelyn's room. Then realization dawned - but Evelyn's condition was psychological, and Eleanor wasn't a psychiatrist. Unless...

Unless there were physical complications now too.

Eleanor Whitmore rarely appeared in public these days. The opportunity to speak with such a renowned physician didn't come often.

Yet without proper introduction, approaching her would be awkward at best.

Eleanor had noticed Isabella and Margaret's reaction to the newcomers. She gave the Kensington group a cursory glance before turning back to the Sinclairs, her voice deliberately carrying. "Her vitals are stabilizing. The progress is slow but steady."

Margaret clasped Eleanor's hands, emotion thickening her voice. "Thank you, Dr. Whitmore. We can never repay your kindness."

Eleanor patted Isabella's shoulder warmly. "Just doing my job."

As they spoke, the Kensington party passed by, stopping several doors down to enter another patient's room.

With other appointments waiting, Eleanor soon took her leave, her medical team trailing behind her.

Isabella watched her go before turning her attention to the occupied room down the hall. Someone from either the Kensington or Pembroke families must be ill. That would explain their presence in the VIP wing.

But if they started frequenting this area regularly... The risk of Evelyn encountering them became dangerously high.

Sharing the same concern, Isabella approached a passing nurse. "Excuse me, could you tell me about the patient in Room 1003?"
###Chapter 426

Before the physician could reply, a junior nurse nearby interjected with the answer to Isabella's inquiry.

"The patient in Suite 1003 is an elderly woman. She collapsed yesterday from hypertension. Diagnostic tests revealed no critical conditions."

"She could've been released immediately, but her relatives insisted on a 48-hour observation period."

"Quite particular too - refused standard accommodations and demanded VIP quarters. Her family was rather... persistent."

"Our premium suites have been at capacity recently, but they leveraged some influential connections."

"After a few phone calls from someone important, they simply commandeered a reserved room..."

The nurse continued her animated explanation until the attending physician discreetly cleared his throat, casting a cautious glance down the corridor.

The young nurse immediately fell silent.

So they'd be vacating tomorrow?

This news brought Isabella some relief. At least the chances of Evelyn encountering any Kensingtons or their associates would decrease.

Yet...

Her deeper concern remained that certain individuals might deliberately seek to agitate her mother.

Frowning, Isabella turned back to the medical staff. "My mother's psychological state remains fragile - she can't withstand emotional disturbances."

"Please monitor all visitors to her suite meticulously. Beyond authorized medical personnel and immediate family, no unauthorized persons are permitted entry."

"Additionally, should anyone inquire about her condition, I must be notified immediately."

The physician nodded. "Understood, Ms. Sinclair. You have our assurance."

Despite professional reassurances, Isabella's tension didn't dissipate.

Just as she'd been investigating the Kensingtons, they were undoubtedly doing the same regarding her family's situation.

The worst possibility? They already knew precisely why she and Margaret were here.

Diana Kensington had been hospitalized.

Nathaniel had prior commitments, so after a brief visit, he departed.

Exactly as Isabella predicted, once Nathaniel left, Penelope immediately informed Diana about spotting Isabella and Margaret in the hallway earlier.

Both women deduced the patient must be Evelyn. But regarding the exact nature of Evelyn's condition...

To confirm, Penelope specifically questioned Diana's nurse. "We noticed Dr. Whitmore earlier. For someone of her caliber to be consulted, the patient must be quite significant. Might you know the diagnosis?"

"Multiple organ failure. Quite severe," the nurse replied.

Penelope and Diana exchanged knowing smiles.

To their understanding, multiple organ failure rarely ended favorably. In other words, Evelyn might be...

Still, Penelope pressed further. "The family looked familiar. Would the surname be Sinclair? The patient - Evelyn perhaps?"

"Indeed. You're acquainted?"

Penelope's lips curved. "Oh yes, quite intimately. We go way back." She added casually, "With multiple organ failure, I imagine time is rather limited?"

"Normally, yes. But they've considerable resources and connections. They secured Dr. Whitmore - she works miracles. The prognosis has improved significantly."

The smiles on both women's faces dimmed slightly.

After the nurse exited, Penelope sneered, "They're getting away far too easily."

She muttered under her breath, "That little gold-digger certainly profited from latching onto Nathaniel."

Had Isabella not ensnared Nathaniel, Evelyn might have already...

Eleanor remained silent, but her brow gradually furrowed in contemplation.
###Chapter 427

For added security, Isabella arranged for two additional caregivers to tend to Evelyn while discreetly monitoring activities in Room 1003.

That same night, she received word that the patient in Room 1003 - Diana Kensington - had been discharged earlier than expected.

Though no incidents occurred during Diana's hospital stay, Isabella maintained the extra caregivers as a precautionary measure.

She instructed them to remain and continue caring for Evelyn.

Nathaniel Graves was currently immersed in critical negotiations for their autonomous vehicle initiative, keeping him exceptionally busy.

Consequently, Isabella attended the prestigious Corporate Excellence Gala in his stead - an official government event recognizing outstanding business contributions.

Nearly seven hundred corporate leaders filled the grand ballroom.

Isabella arrived fashionably late.

The moment she entered, Julian Montgomery excused himself from his conversation and immediately approached.

"Ms. Sinclair, what a pleasure to see you."

She offered a polite nod. "It's been too long, Julian."

Victoria Kensington stood nearby, representing InnovaTech as expected.

Julian had been watching the entrance since the gala began. Spotting Isabella, he'd rushed over without hesitation.

Victoria pressed her lips into a thin line and averted her gaze.

The Grandeur's seating placed them near the front, adjacent to Harper Corporation's delegation.

After brief pleasantries, attendees returned to their assigned seats.

The Fleming Group's reserved seats neighbored The Grandeur's.

Isabella had noticed Victoria in the crowd but saw no sign of Alexander, assuming he wouldn't attend.

Unexpectedly, as she settled into her seat and greeted her other neighbor, Alexander appeared and took the chair beside her.

She deliberately avoided acknowledging him, but he nodded politely. "Just arriving?"

Isabella remained silent.

The executive on her other side leaned forward to greet Alexander.

After exchanging pleasantries, the man nearly commented on how striking the pair looked together.

Remembering their respective relationships, he caught himself.

Instead, he glanced at Julian seated beyond Alexander and remarked, "What an impressive gathering of young visionaries in this row. Truly inspiring company."

Alexander engaged briefly before the man returned to his seat.

With their divorce finalization mere days away, Julian studied the estranged couple.

They sat inches apart yet worlds away. Beyond Alexander's initial greeting, complete silence prevailed between them.

Alexander turned to Julian. "It's been weeks. What's kept you occupied?"

"Our biotech venture hit unexpected complications. Required considerable travel."

"Still unresolved?"

"Progressing slowly."

"Need assistance?"

Julian shook his head. "We're managing."

Alexander nodded, then shifted his gaze to Isabella. Sensing his attention, she instinctively turned.

He remarked, "I reviewed those research papers you mentioned. Fascinating work. Though I've developed some follow-up questions—"

Isabella turned away sharply, cutting him off.

Alexander simply smiled and let the matter drop.

Despite InnovaTech's recent notoriety, its valuation couldn't compare to industry giants like The Grandeur and Fleming Group.

Thus Victoria found herself seated in the third row.

From her vantage point, she watched the trio up front, her lips pressing tighter with each passing moment.
###Chapter 428

Dominic Fairchild also attended the summit.

His seat was positioned in the second row, slightly behind and to the side of Isabella Sinclair and Alexander Whitmore.

He arrived fashionably late.

Just as he was taking his seat, he caught Alexander leaning slightly toward Isabella, initiating conversation.

When Isabella deliberately ignored him, the way Alexander's smile faltered...

Dominic's expression darkened imperceptibly.

For some inexplicable reason, he'd always sensed Alexander treated Isabella differently.

Over the past few months, their interactions had remained strictly professional, leading Dominic to believe Alexander had moved on.

But now—

Dominic's piercing stare was so intense that Alexander couldn't possibly miss it.

Turning his head, Alexander acknowledged him with a polite nod. "Mr. Fairchild, what a pleasant surprise."

Dominic schooled his features into neutrality, responding with a curt hum.

At this prestigious Enterprise Excellence Summit, Walter Ashford stood as one of the keynote political figures. After delivering his opening remarks, Walter and other dignitaries began announcing the list of distinguished enterprises.

Naturally, YodaVision made the cut.

Isabella, Alexander, and Julian Montgomery, along with several other company representatives, ascended the stage to receive their awards. As they accepted their certificates, Walter inquired, "Would any representatives care to share a few words?"

Following Alexander's eloquent speech, Isabella took the microphone. "YodaVision's current success stems from our relentless pursuit of innovation and cultivating teams that embody this philosophy..."

Watching from the audience, Victoria Kensington found the scene mildly amusing.

Really?

While YodaVision had indeed flourished, its achievements hardly correlated with Isabella's contributions.

Yes, she'd published that groundbreaking paper that caused waves—but only after YodaVision had already established its global reputation.

Listening to Isabella now, one might think she'd single-handedly built YodaVision from scratch through sheer determination.

Though she stood on stage accepting the award as the company's representative, everyone knew she merely served as Nathaniel Graves's proxy.

In truth, this honor had absolutely nothing to do with her.

After the speeches concluded, Isabella, Alexander, and the others descended from the stage.

The summit lasted approximately three hours in total.

As it concluded, Isabella prepared to depart.

Noticing her movements, Julian maneuvered past Alexander to approach her. "Leaving so soon?"

"Yes."

However, Isabella had cultivated a respectable reputation in business circles, and numerous entrepreneurs now sought her attention.

Thus, her departure was delayed.

Both she and Julian found themselves surrounded by well-wishers.

Alexander, too, had drawn his own small crowd.

Dominic, aware of Victoria's presence and noting Alexander hadn't immediately sought her out, decided to approach Victoria himself.

Spotting his approach, Victoria greeted him. "Mr. Fairchild, I didn't see you earlier. I'd begun to think you might have skipped the event entirely."

"Unexpected matters detained me," he replied.

As he spoke, his gaze drifted toward Alexander, who had somehow positioned himself beside Isabella again. Dominic's brow furrowed.

Victoria, who monitored Alexander and Isabella's interactions even more closely than Dominic, had naturally noticed as well.

Just as she prepared to comment, Dominic suggested, "Shall we join them?"

Victoria offered a practiced smile. "I still have several matters to discuss with others here. If you have business over there, please don't let me detain you, Mr. Fairchild."
###Chapter 429

Dominic Fairchild remained by Victoria Kensington's side, his presence unwavering.

Moments later, when Victoria turned to search for Alexander Whitmore, she noticed he was no longer standing with Isabella Sinclair. Instead, Isabella was engaged in conversation with Walter Ashford.

Given their longstanding acquaintance, it was only natural for Dominic and Walter to exchange pleasantries in such a public setting.

"Mr. Ashford, may I introduce—" Dominic began formally.

Walter smiled warmly, interrupting gently. "Ms. Kensington and I are already acquainted."

Victoria offered a polite greeting, her smile perfectly measured.

Walter acknowledged her with a courteous nod before turning his attention back to Isabella. His voice softened noticeably. "Isabella, have you been keeping busy lately?"

Though the summit had concluded, they remained in full view of numerous attendees.

The marked difference in Walter's demeanor between his interactions with Isabella and Victoria spoke volumes.

His fondness for Isabella was unmistakable, displayed without reservation.

"Yes, quite busy," Isabella replied simply.

She couldn't ignore Walter's obvious preference.

Previously, their interactions had been ordinary. But Dominic's sudden appearance reminded her that Walter was Sebastian Ashford's father.

Considering Sebastian's persistent advances, Isabella felt no discomfort around Walter. After all, nothing substantial had transpired between them.

While Walter wasn't overtly cold toward Victoria, the contrast in his treatment was stark.

After their initial exchange, Walter showed no further interest in conversing with Victoria. He made no effort to establish rapport, let alone demonstrate any admiration.

Had he wished to show support, he might have at least acknowledged Innovatech, the company Victoria represented.

Her invitation to this summit should have warranted some recognition.

Noticing this subtle dismissal, Victoria's smile faltered slightly.

Dominic seemed oblivious to Walter's coolness toward Victoria, but he did notice Walter's clear desire to continue speaking with Isabella.

Despite his personal dislike for Isabella, Dominic wouldn't dream of interrupting Walter. After brief pleasantries, he guided Victoria away.

Victoria observed that Dominic's opinion of Isabella remained unchanged.

A thought occurred to her. "It seems both Mr. Ashford and your father hold Ms. Sinclair in high regard," she remarked casually. "Recently, Alexander and I happened upon Ms. Sinclair and Nathaniel Graves playing golf with Mr. Ashford and your father..."

Dominic's eyebrows shot up. "My father and Walter played golf with Isabella and Nathaniel?"

"Yes," Victoria confirmed. "They appeared quite familiar, actually. It didn't seem like their first meeting."

She feigned surprise. "You weren't aware your father knew Ms. Sinclair?"

Dominic frowned, shaking his head. "No, he never mentioned it."

This revelation intrigued Victoria.

During their initial meeting, she'd noticed Richard Fairchild's apparent fondness for Isabella. She'd assumed he would have spoken of her to Dominic, potentially altering Dominic's perception.

But apparently not...

Walter, ever the busy official, soon concluded his conversation with Isabella after a few more minutes. Isabella likewise moved on to other matters.

Later, Isabella seized a quiet moment to slip away from the bustling hall.

Noticing her departure, Julian Montgomery's expression shifted subtly. He turned to Alexander beside him. "Alexander, I have matters to attend to. I'll take my leave now."

Alexander glanced at him. "Not joining me for dinner?"

Julian shook his head. "Another time."

"Very well," Alexander conceded easily. "We'll catch up when you're free."

"Certainly."
###Chapter 430

Julian rushed after Isabella, but he was too late. When he arrived at the elevator bank, the doors had already closed behind her.

Across town, Alexander was engaged in conversation when his phone buzzed.

He glanced at the screen and answered.

After a brief exchange, he ended the call just as Victoria approached. "Who was that? You sounded pleased," she observed.

"An old university friend. Benjamin Hayes. He's visiting Fairview on business and wanted to catch up over dinner. My schedule happened to be clear."

Alexander turned to her. "Care to join us?"

When they'd met, Alexander had already graduated. She'd encountered a few of his college acquaintances at social functions, but they'd all seemed like casual connections.

This one appeared different - closer somehow.

She nodded. "I'd love to."

Alexander exchanged a few more pleasantries with their hosts before escorting Victoria to the upscale restaurant where they were meeting.

Benjamin, an expat with striking features, had already secured a table. He rose as they approached. "Alexander! It's been too long." His gaze shifted to Victoria. "And this must be your girlfriend? She's stunning. You make a perfect pair."

Alexander made the introductions.

Benjamin leaned forward, intrigued. "So how did you two meet?"

Victoria smiled. "In Salzburg. I'd just finished my studies at the time..."

When she finished her story, Benjamin let out an impressed whistle. "Brilliant woman! Alex, your taste remains impeccable." He chuckled. "I remember that girl you were crazy about in college - the one who skipped grades to graduate early. Rumor had it you two even married before she finished her degree..."

Victoria's smile faltered slightly.

Alexander's expression darkened. "You're mistaken, Ben. That wasn't my girlfriend."

"Really?" Benjamin looked genuinely surprised. "I only met her that one time when I was back in the country. Must have gotten the wrong impression." He quickly changed the subject. "So, what's good here? You're the local - I'll trust your judgment."

Alexander didn't press the matter further.

The conversation flowed easily as Benjamin proved an engaging dinner companion. He turned to Victoria with interest. "And what do you do?"

"I'm currently working in autonomous vehicle development."

"An engineer? Impressive."

Victoria smiled modestly. "Not as impressive as it sounds. Actually, Alexander founded the company. Later on..." She explained how she became involved.

Typically, this revelation elicited responses like "He must really believe in you." But Benjamin's reaction was different.

His expression shifted almost imperceptibly. Though he said nothing, his demeanor subtly changed - as if reassessing her worth. A flicker of disappointment crossed his features when he glanced at Alexander, as though questioning his friend's judgment.

Victoria's smile tightened.

Catching himself, Benjamin cleared his throat. "How's the company performing?"

Alexander answered smoothly. "We recently achieved a technological breakthrough that significantly increased our valuation."

"Of course," Benjamin nodded, smiling. "With you at the helm, that's no surprise. Growing a tech company's value must be child's play for someone of your caliber."
###Chapter 431

Alexander said, "I haven't been directly involved in the company's recent development."

Hearing this, Benjamin looked at Victoria in surprise. "So Victoria, you're actually the driving force behind it?"

Victoria shook her head modestly. "Not at all. The real credit belongs to our engineering team. Most of them were already established professionals when I joined. The company's current success is, as Alexander mentioned, largely due to his initial vision. My contributions have been minimal."

Benjamin smiled warmly. "You're being too humble."

Initially, when Benjamin learned that Victoria only had her business because Alexander handed it to her, he had assumed she wasn't particularly remarkable and perhaps not quite on Alexander's level.

But observing their dynamic now - how they supported and acknowledged each other's strengths - he realized Alexander must consider Victoria an AI specialist superior to himself. That would explain why he entrusted the company to her care, believing it would thrive under her leadership. It perfectly aligned with Alexander's generous and humble nature.

Victoria waved off the compliment. "Really, I'm not just saying this out of modesty..."

Soon the conversation shifted to lighter topics as they shared amusing anecdotes from their time studying in Salzburg.

Having all been international students there, they found plenty of common ground.

Victoria, with her natural charm and social ease, made the dinner surprisingly enjoyable despite this being her first meeting with Benjamin. At times, she even engaged Benjamin more actively than Alexander did.

Benjamin was visiting the country on a business trip with his father and would be departing the next day. As dinner concluded, he excused himself for another engagement.

Before leaving, he shook Victoria's hand warmly. "Victoria, it's been a genuine pleasure meeting you today. You're remarkably intelligent and delightful company."

He glanced meaningfully at Alexander, hesitating as if to say more, but Victoria smoothly interjected, "You flatter me, Benjamin."

As Benjamin waved goodbye and turned toward his car, he suddenly spotted Isabella Sinclair emerging from the restaurant with Nathaniel Graves and several business associates.

Benjamin didn't recognize the others, but Isabella's face sparked recognition. He pointed in surprise. "That woman... Isn't she—?"

Alexander remained silent.

Isabella, noticing the gesture, had initially intended to ignore Alexander's group entirely. But as she turned away, realization struck - she remembered Benjamin from years ago when he'd visited Alexander during their time together in Salzburg.

That single meeting had ended somewhat awkwardly, though the memory was faint now.

Her business companions were speaking to her, so she quickly refocused on their conversation, deliberately avoiding any further glance toward Alexander's table.

Benjamin noted Isabella's cold demeanor.

His gaze shifted between Alexander and Isabella, both now with new partners, and understanding dawned. He tactfully chose not to comment further.

Besides, he was pressed for time. With final goodbyes to Alexander and Victoria, he entered his waiting car.

Victoria wasn't surprised Benjamin knew Isabella. She had only glanced briefly at Isabella and Nathaniel when they appeared, paying them little mind.

Though her initial interaction with Benjamin had been slightly awkward, she now found him quite pleasant.

"He's genuinely kind and authentic," she remarked to Alexander. "Very easy to be around."

Alexander smiled in agreement. "That he is."
###Chapter 432

The dinner companion for Isabella Sinclair and Nathaniel Graves was none other than Jonathan Sterling, the visionary CEO of tech giant Velotra.

AuroraTech had inked a groundbreaking partnership deal with Velotra just that morning.

Post-dinner, Isabella and Nathaniel made their way to Velotra's headquarters together.

They spent the entire day immersed in technical discussions with Velotra's engineering team, only returning home as the clock struck midnight.

For the next forty-eight hours, Isabella became a familiar face at Velotra's R&D labs, burning the midnight oil alongside their top engineers.

Friday marked the highly anticipated product launch that Velotra had been preparing for months.

Their relentless efforts had one singular purpose - to implement and showcase their revolutionary collaborative concept before the grand unveiling.

This innovation promised to completely redefine Velotra's product launch narrative.

After catching a few hours of sleep in the early morning, both Isabella and Nathaniel arrived at Velotra's launch venue looking refreshed.

The event buzzed with media personnel and industry leaders. Naturally, Alexander Whitmore and Victoria Kensington received invitations as key players in the field.

Running slightly behind schedule due to their packed week, Isabella and Nathaniel's entrance immediately caught Alexander and Victoria's attention.

Victoria's step faltered momentarily when she spotted the pair.

Velotra's invitation strategy made perfect sense - they sought both technological showcase and potential partnerships.

AuroraTech dominated the language systems sector.

Despite ending their collaboration with InnovaTech and partnering with Whitmore Enterprises instead, their new agreement had entirely different parameters.

This meant AuroraTech remained free to collaborate with other autonomous vehicle manufacturers specifically on language systems. Velotra's invitation to Nathaniel clearly signaled their intentions.

Though a relative newcomer, Velotra had shown meteoric growth in recent years, with their self-driving vehicles consistently ranking among the nation's elite.

A partnership with AuroraTech, given its stellar reputation and technological edge, would significantly boost Velotra's competitive standing.

Yet Victoria remained unfazed.

InnovaTech's autonomous vehicle strengths lay elsewhere - they possessed unique technological advantages of their own.

With this reassurance, Victoria calmly averted her gaze.

Jonathan Sterling personally greeted Isabella and Nathaniel upon their arrival, his warm welcome confirming Victoria's suspicions about Velotra's partnership ambitions.

With the VIPs seated, the launch event commenced.

As head of the prestigious Whitmore Group, Alexander naturally occupied a front-row seat among the honored guests.

Victoria, as his companion, found herself seated beside him in the prime location.

Through their recent collaboration, Jonathan had come to recognize Isabella as the technical linchpin of their joint project.

Her seating placement reflected this - more central than even Nathaniel's.

Nathaniel showed no surprise at finding Isabella's seat adjacent to Alexander's.

Without hesitation, he took the assigned seat meant for Isabella, who simply smiled and settled into the chair beside him.

Victoria raised an eyebrow at this seating arrangement but dismissed it - likely the staff assumed the couple wouldn't mind sitting together.

When Alexander noticed Nathaniel taking Isabella's seat, he offered a polite, "Mr. Graves," receiving only a curt nod in response.

The launch presentation began smoothly, following Velotra's planned program to perfection.

At the halfway mark, Jonathan took the stage with a game-changing announcement.

"Our project achieves full intelligent automation," he declared, "not just in autonomous navigation but across the entire engine system. Velotra continues to lead our industry, earning recognition from peers worldwide."

"Recently, we've established a long-term partnership with AuroraTech, achieving remarkable breakthroughs across multiple fronts."

"Now, please join me in welcoming Ms. Isabella Sinclair, AuroraTech's distinguished lead engineer, to share our collaborative advancements. Let's give her a warm welcome!"
###Chapter 433

The moment Nathaniel Graves concluded his introduction, the auditorium exploded with deafening applause.

Alexander Whitmore turned his gaze toward Isabella Sinclair, joining the ovation.

Victoria Kensington hesitated briefly before offering restrained applause, her expression carefully neutral.

Isabella didn't acknowledge Alexander - she simply exchanged a glance with Henry Sterling before rising gracefully and approaching the podium.

As she ascended the stage, Jonathan Sterling's face lit up with enthusiasm. "Ms. Sinclair isn't just an exceptional engineer from InnovaTech," he announced, "but the brilliant mind behind the core technology driving this groundbreaking partnership between Velotra and InnovaTech!"

A ripple of astonishment spread through the crowd.

Victoria froze momentarily, questioning whether she'd misheard.

InnovaTech commanded immense influence globally - their every innovation drew intense scrutiny.

The official announcement of this collaboration at Velotra's flagship event came as no surprise.

Nor did the presence of an InnovaTech representative to explain the technical specifications.

But the person Jonathan called forward wasn't Henry Sterling - it was Isabella.

When Isabella first stood, Victoria had dismissed it as Henry's chivalry letting his protégé shine.

She never imagined Isabella was the architect of this entire venture.

How could this be?

As Victoria struggled to process this revelation, Jonathan continued, "Ms. Sinclair, I'll let you take over the technical presentation now."

Isabella accepted the microphone with effortless poise. "Good evening everyone," she began, her voice calm yet commanding. "I'm Isabella Sinclair, lead engineer at InnovaTech."

"Our collaboration with Velotra focuses on four revolutionary advancements."

She proceeded to outline their breakthroughs in engine microprocessors, AI-driven autonomous vehicle systems, next-generation materials application, and fuel efficiency optimization.

The audience quickly realized true innovation required mastery across multiple disciplines.

Yet Isabella demonstrated profound expertise in every field - from autonomous navigation to composite materials to intelligent powertrain design.

She functioned as her own interdisciplinary team.

As she detailed their achievements in enhanced safety protocols, cutting-edge material science applications, and unprecedented efficiency gains, both technical and non-technical attendees sat in rapt attention.

The crowd wasn't just impressed by Isabella's versatility - they recognized the seismic impact this partnership would have on the industry.

Numerous engineers in attendance gazed at her with undisguised admiration.

Victoria remained rooted in her seat, disbelief etching lines across her forehead.

She knew Isabella possessed AI expertise, but engines? Microprocessors? Fuel systems?

Advanced materials she could accept - Isabella had demonstrated that knowledge before.

But the other specialties?

These weren't casual competencies one simply acquired.

If they were, the nation wouldn't have struggled for decades against foreign semiconductor monopolies.

What made it more astonishing -

Isabella spoke without notes.

Technical terminology, precise metrics, case studies - all flowed effortlessly from her lips as she humbly credited her inspirations.

With each passing minute, Victoria's expression darkened further. Her hands clenched involuntarily, a cold dread creeping through her veins.

Suddenly, a disturbing realization struck her.

Her head snapped toward the man beside her - Alexander Whitmore.
###Chapter 434

Alexander's gaze remained fixed on the stage, completely unaware of Victoria's intense stare.

She bit her lower lip and turned away sharply.

The product launch by Velotra had become an unprecedented sensation.

When Isabella and Jonathan stepped down from the platform, another wave of thunderous applause erupted through the venue.

Every corporate executive in attendance immediately rose to offer their congratulations to Jonathan and Isabella.

Nathaniel moved swiftly through the crowd toward Isabella.

The impact of Velotra's autonomous vehicle technology would undoubtedly send shockwaves through global markets.

Isabella's professional stock was about to soar to unimaginable heights.

Having known her for years, Nathaniel felt genuine pride in her achievement. Without thinking, he pulled her into an embrace. "Congratulations," he murmured.

Isabella's lips curved into a soft smile. "Thank you, Professor." Her whisper was so quiet only Nathaniel caught the familiar title.

The tech moguls present understood talent when they saw it. At this moment, their interest in Isabella far surpassed their curiosity about Jonathan.

A genius like her represented a walking goldmine - if anyone could lure her away...

Mental calculations began behind polite smiles, though no one dared approach Isabella directly yet. This was Velotra's moment after all - Jonathan deserved their respect first.

They swarmed Jonathan with congratulations before casually attempting to engage Isabella in conversation - only to find Nathaniel had already claimed her attention.

Over recent months, Isabella and Nathaniel had become a frequent sight at industry events together.

Some executives had met her before.

Back then, they'd dismissed her as merely Nathaniel's arm candy - beautiful but insignificant.

Then her groundbreaking research paper made waves, forcing them to acknowledge her intellect.

Nathaniel was a prodigy, and Isabella, being both brilliant and in the same field, suddenly seemed like a worthy match.

But after today's demonstration, they realized Isabella wasn't just talented - she was a once-in-a-generation mind.

For Nathaniel to be a genius was impressive enough, but to have a partner who matched him? The man had it all.

Envy flickered behind many carefully composed executive expressions.

As Nathaniel released Isabella, one CEO couldn't resist teasing, "Mr. Graves, keeping Ms. Sinclair's brilliance under wraps like this? That's downright criminal."

"Absolutely," another chimed in.

Nathaniel arched an eyebrow. "Who said anything about keeping secrets? You simply lack vision."

But all eyes remained on Isabella.

After exchanging pleasantries with Nathaniel, they turned to Isabella with renewed interest. "Ms. Sinclair, our warmest congratulations."

"Thank you," Isabella responded gracefully.

"We have several cutting-edge tech initiatives underway. Ms. Sinclair, might you have availability for a more in-depth discussion?"

Before she could respond, another executive interjected, "His 'cutting-edge' projects are child's play compared to what we're developing at-"

Soon a lively crowd formed around Isabella and Nathaniel, the air buzzing with competitive energy.

Alexander remained seated throughout, observing the scene with detached interest.

Victoria sat rigid beside him, nails digging into her palms.

She stole another glance at Alexander. His attention never wavered from the center of activity - not even a flicker of awareness that she existed. It was as if she'd become invisible to him.

Her face drained of color. Jaw clenched, she turned her gaze toward Isabella just a few yards away.

The implications of Velotra's success were painfully clear.

The autonomous vehicle market had limited capacity. Velotra's dominance would inevitably crush competitors' prospects.

If yesterday InnovaTech's technological advances promised hundred-million-dollar opportunities, today...

The mere thought made Victoria's chest constrict.

And Isabella?

Setting aside everything else, if the technologies demonstrated today were truly her creations, the patent royalties alone would generate staggering wealth, not to mention consulting fees and profit shares.

As these calculations spiraled through her mind, Alexander's voice snapped her back to reality.

She turned to find him checking his watch. "Don't we have another engagement? We should leave."

Despite the storm of thoughts, her mind had gone curiously blank.

Wordlessly, she rose and followed him to bid farewell to Jonathan.

Jonathan remained encircled by well-wishers near Isabella and Nathaniel.

Noticing their approach, Jonathan offered Alexander a polite nod. "Mr. Whitmore."

Alexander extended his hand. "Congratulations."

Jonathan smiled. "The pleasure is mutual."

Alexander then turned to Isabella. "Congratulations."

Isabella met his gaze evenly. "Thank you."

Addressing Jonathan again, Alexander said, "We have prior commitments. Mr. Sterling, everyone - until next time."

Jonathan and the others nodded politely.

But as they exchanged farewells with Alexander, many eyes flickered curiously toward Victoria.
###Chapter 435

Rumors had always circulated that Alexander Whitmore's girlfriend Victoria Kensington held a doctorate from an elite international university and was a technological prodigy.

Yet no one could name a single groundbreaking achievement attributed to her.

While InnovaTech had recently made several technological advancements, industry insiders whispered these were likely remnants of Alexander's influence during his tenure, with little connection to Victoria herself.

Meanwhile, Isabella Sinclair had never claimed to be a genius, yet today she'd single-handedly dazzled the entire tech community with her brilliance.

The unspoken comparison hung heavy in the air - perhaps Victoria's "genius" reputation had been exaggerated all along.

No one voiced the thought aloud, but the constant glances bouncing between her and Isabella, the silent evaluations in every pair of eyes, made the message painfully clear to Victoria.

Her porcelain complexion paled further. The way people were mentally measuring her against Isabella - and finding her lacking - made her nails dig crescent moons into her palms.

She might not have personally developed any revolutionary technology, but her academic credentials were impeccable. She wouldn't stand for this silent judgment!

Yet with no direct accusations made, she had no opportunity to defend herself. The frustration simmered beneath her carefully maintained composure.

When it came to academic accomplishments, she couldn't ignore Isabella's internationally acclaimed research paper or today's dazzling press conference performance.

The bitter truth settled in her stomach - academically, she could no longer compete with Isabella Sinclair.

Victoria stood rigid, her expression carefully schooled into neutrality despite the storm raging inside.

After Alexander finished exchanging pleasantries with various executives, he turned to her. "We should leave."

Victoria forced a smile. "Of course."

She took a steadying breath, smoothed her expression into one of polite detachment, and bid farewell to Maxwell Sterling and several other business associates she knew.

Only then did she walk out with Alexander, maintaining perfect poise as they said their goodbyes, though internally she was anything but calm.

Alexander, however, had already moved his focus beyond the press event.

"Mr. Holloway's evaluation is complete? Everything checks out?" he asked in his usual measured tone.

He referred to Vincent Holloway, their upcoming meeting - a potential new partner for InnovaTech.

Hearing Alexander's familiar, steady voice and seeing the same gentle regard in his eyes, Victoria felt some of her tension ease.

She nodded. "The due diligence is complete. His team's capabilities align perfectly with our company's needs."

"Excellent."

The elevator arrived with a soft chime.

Velotra had established significant industry recognition domestically, and today's product launch had been streamed live.

While not yet a household name capable of dominating social media trends instantly, Velotra commanded a dedicated following who'd tuned in for the event.

Initially, the live chat had moved at a leisurely pace, but everything changed when Velotra announced their collaboration with YodaVision. Viewer numbers skyrocketed.

Within minutes, the stream saw a dramatic surge in audience.

As Isabella explained the technology and delivered her speech, the stream's popularity continued climbing until it trended across multiple platforms.

Genevieve Kensington, idly scrolling online during her lunch break, noticed the trending topic and clicked out of curiosity.

When Isabella's face filled her screen, she froze. Before she could process what she was seeing, a flood of comments praising Isabella's brilliance scrolled past.

Beyond the compliments, viewers speculated about how Velotra's launch might disrupt the autonomous vehicle industry.

Many wondered aloud about the substantial profits Isabella, as the technical visionary, would command.

Even someone as disconnected from tech as Genevieve understood the implications immediately.

Panic set in.

She hastily closed the browser and made a frantic phone call.

The entire Kensington family, including Reginald and Eleanor, knew Victoria and Alexander were attending Velotra's launch. They'd assumed it was just another corporate event, nothing worth special attention.

When Genevieve shared what she'd seen, their reactions ranged from disbelief to stunned silence - surely they'd misunderstood.
###Chapter 436

"Isabella understands engines and microchips? That's impossible!"

Even after Isabella Sinclair's research paper caused waves in academic circles, Reginald Kensington still refused to believe she was the true author.

Now Eleanor was telling him Isabella had mastered complex engineering and semiconductor technology?

Preposterous.

Eleanor lowered her lashes. The truth was just a search away.

Minutes later, after watching segments of Isabella's keynote at Velotra's launch event, Eleanor's stomach twisted into knots.

Reginald, however, remained in denial.

Genevieve's furious voice crackled through the phone. "She planned this! First sabotaging Uncle Reginald's logistics venture, now coming after InnovaTech!"

On that point, both Kensington parents agreed.

Whether the breakthrough technology truly belonged to Isabella or not, one thing was certain—Velotra's unveiling would cripple InnovaTech's market position.

Before they could strategize, Genevieve's panic escalated. "What now? Analysts predict Velotra will monopolize the autonomous vehicle sector. InnovaTech can't possibly compete—"

Though Velotra's advancements appeared formidable—

Eleanor unclenched her fist, adopting an artificially calm tone. "Technology evolves daily. Today's leader becomes tomorrow's follower."

"Global autonomous vehicle adoption hasn't commenced. We still have time. The tides of fortune change swiftly. Declaring market winners now would be premature."

Her words contained partial truth.

Yet Reginald knew better. His tech firm had produced no meaningful innovations in years. Gaining technological supremacy wasn't child's play.

If breakthroughs came easily, the world wouldn't have so few tech titans. Early advantage meant everything.

Velotra's progress wasn't incremental—it was revolutionary across multiple domains with global implications.

Competitors could either admire from afar or embark on futile chases—requiring one year minimum, twenty at worst.

By then, the market would have—

Reginald's agitation surfaced. "I wonder what Alexander makes of this development."

Eleanor understood his unspoken request to contact their daughter.

She replied smoothly, "They're handling critical negotiations. Let's discuss this after Victoria and Alexander conclude their business."

"Very well."

No alternatives remained.

After dining with Alexander and Vincent Holloway, Victoria returned to the Kensington estate.

Though her family hadn't interrupted the meal, she knew they'd seen Velotra's broadcast—and Isabella's starring role.

As predicted, she found her parents and Genevieve waiting in the drawing room.

Before questions could begin, she preempted them. "You've seen the news?"

"Indeed," Eleanor confirmed. "What was Alexander's reaction?"

Victoria settled onto the chaise, shaking her head. "He didn't comment."

Eleanor's teacup halted mid-air. "Explain."

+25 Bonus

Victoria's nails dug into her palms. "Regarding Velotra's launch—complete silence. Not one word."

No remarks about Isabella. No analysis of Velotra's technology. Nothing.

Eleanor's porcelain cup clattered against its saucer.

Reginald and Genevieve gaped.

This defied Alexander Whitmore's character entirely.

Velotra's advancements threatened InnovaTech's survival.

Normally, Alexander would've reassured Victoria, dissected Velotra's tech from every angle—engineering, commercial, strategic—and formulated countermeasures.

This time?

Radio silence.
###Chapter 437

An urgent call from the company summoned Alexander away. There were pressing matters requiring his immediate attention.

Victoria's face was pale, her expression troubled.

Eleanor immediately sensed something was wrong. Beyond being overshadowed by Isabella's brilliant performance today, something else must have occurred.

"During the luncheon," Eleanor inquired carefully, "how did Alexander behave toward Isabella?"

Victoria's eyelashes fluttered downward. "He was impressed by her."

Eleanor's countenance darkened visibly.

In the past, Alexander had always dismissed Isabella as insignificant. She'd been beneath his notice, never once earning his admiration.

But now—

"That technology Isabella presented today—do you truly believe it originated from her?"

Though Eleanor hadn't interacted much with Alexander, from Victoria's accounts, she knew he was technologically savvy himself and held genuine respect for technical experts.

If Isabella truly possessed such capabilities, his sudden admiration wouldn't be surprising.

Before Victoria could respond, Genevieve burst out, "Of course it's not hers! She's just an undergraduate—how could she possibly—? It must be Nathaniel—"

Victoria cut her off. "I think it might actually be hers."

Genevieve's eyes widened in disbelief. "That's impossible! How could she—?"

But the facts were undeniable. Isabella had skipped three grades to enter university early—attending Aurelia University, the nation's most prestigious institution.

While Genevieve herself had also skipped grades to attend a reputable university, it paled in comparison to Aurelia.

The implication was clear—Isabella had the academic foundation for serious research if she'd chosen that path.

Reluctantly, Victoria had to acknowledge the possibility that both Isabella's published paper and today's technological presentation might genuinely be her own work.

Eleanor had reached the same conclusion.

Isabella's academic excellence had always been a source of pressure for Victoria.

Victoria clenched her fists. "If it weren't truly her work, would she dare claim it so publicly?"

Genevieve scoffed. "She's shameless! Of course she'd dare!"

Both Eleanor and Victoria ignored her outburst.

Victoria bit her lip. "I just don't understand..."

Even with her accelerated education, Isabella hadn't achieved anything particularly noteworthy during university. After obtaining her bachelor's degree, she'd married Alexander, had Sophia, and later joined Whitmore Enterprises.

Given that trajectory, how could she possibly possess such advanced research capabilities?

Eleanor had pondered this too. She understood her daughter's dilemma.

After dismissing Genevieve from the room, Eleanor spoke gently, "Even if Isabella is truly that capable, you and Alexander share a profound bond. That isn't easily shaken."

"Besides, you have your own considerable strengths. Victoria, darling, don't dwell on this."

How could she not?

Victoria remained silent.

Though Alexander had behaved perfectly normally after the luncheon—treating her with his usual kindness—could he truly be as unaffected as he appeared?

She couldn't help recalling how, just weeks ago, Alexander had gone out of his way to collect research papers Isabella had recommended during technical lectures for Whitmore Enterprises' engineers.

The memory lodged in her throat like a splinter.

If he were truly as composed as he seemed, then why had he not mentioned a single word about the luncheon afterward?
###Chapter 438

The afternoon sun cast long shadows across YodaVision's sleek glass facade as Isabella Sinclair and Nathaniel Graves returned from the Velotraunch event. The conference room buzzed with anticipation before their arrival.

When Isabella stepped through the doors, the engineering team erupted in applause. News of her stellar performance at the launch had spread like wildfire through the company. These were the colleagues who worked most closely with her, yet even they were stunned by her brilliance today.

"Thank you, everyone," Isabella smiled warmly, her emerald eyes sparkling. The celebration continued for several minutes before Nathaniel called the meeting to order.

From his seat, Kieran Blackwood observed Isabella with quiet intensity. He'd made multiple attempts to schedule time with her recently, but her packed calendar had prevented any personal meetings. Now, watching her command the room with effortless grace, doubt crept into his mind.

All those technical questions he'd used as excuses to approach her - he'd thought he understood her capabilities. Today proved how wrong he'd been. The realization hit him like a physical blow: someone as extraordinary as Isabella Sinclair existed on an entirely different plane.

His gaze dropped to his clasped hands. Had he ever truly stood a chance?

As the meeting concluded, Kieran intercepted Isabella in the hallway. "I watched the Velotraunch. You were incredible." His voice carried genuine admiration.

Isabella flashed him a distracted smile. "Thank you, Kieran." Her mind already racing toward the backlog of YodaVision work awaiting her attention, she excused herself with a quick nod.

Kieran didn't follow. Not because he'd given up, but because he'd reached a pivotal realization. If he wanted to be worthy of someone like Isabella, he needed to become someone better. Watching her retreating figure, his jaw set with newfound determination.

Perhaps fate had brought him back to Salzburg for this very reason.

Meanwhile, in her corner office at InnovaTech, Victoria Kensington reviewed contracts with growing irritation. The clock ticked past ten when her assistant entered with troubling news.

"Mr. Holloway's office just called. They're withdrawing from partnership discussions."

Victoria's pen stilled on the document. She'd anticipated fallout from the Velotraunch, but not this swiftly. "I see."

The assistant hesitated. "There's more. Mr. Langford and Mr. Pembroke's offices also called. They're reconsidering their agreements with us."

Victoria's knuckles whitened around her pen. Millions invested, deals nearly finalized - all unraveling in a single morning. She inhaled sharply through her nose.

"Dismissed." The word came out clipped but controlled. Only when the door clicked shut did Victoria allow her composure to fracture, just for a moment. Then she straightened her shoulders and reached for the phone. Damage control began now.
###Chapter 439

The office door clicked shut behind her assistant, leaving Victoria Kensington alone with her spiraling thoughts. The weight of impending decisions pressed down on her shoulders like an invisible force. Technological innovation was the lifeblood of corporate survival in this cutthroat industry. With Velotra's spectacular market debut, her company InnovaTech needed nothing short of a miracle to compete in the autonomous vehicle sector.

Her manicured fingers drummed against the mahogany desk. Seven hundred million dollars already poured into research and development. Seven hundred million that might as well be burning in a bonfire if they couldn't deliver something revolutionary.

The Velotra situation had changed everything. Continuing investments now felt like gambling with company funds. Yet walking away would mean admitting defeat. Her jaw tightened at the thought.

Alexander Whitmore's face flashed through her mind. Even he couldn't predict whether InnovaTech's scientists would make the necessary breakthrough. Asking him would be pointless - he'd only give her that infuriatingly calm, noncommittal response he always did when cornered.

The grandfather clock in the corner marked the passing hours as Victoria remained motionless, lost in thought. A tentative knock startled her from her reverie. "Ms. Kensington? It's past noon. Shall I order your usual from The Grandeur?"

Victoria barely registered the question. Her phone screen remained stubbornly blank. Alexander understood the Velotra threat better than anyone. He'd undoubtedly anticipated how Vincent Holloway and Arthur Langford's enthusiasm for InnovaTech had cooled overnight.

She needed him now more than ever. Yet since last evening's disastrous dinner, complete radio silence. The memory of his transfixed expression watching Isabella Sinclair at the Velotra launch made her nails dig into her palms. That look - as if the entire world had narrowed to only her.

Perhaps he remained as shaken as she was by Isabella's stunning comeback.

Across town, Isabella Sinclair barely had time to breathe between meetings. The phone vibrating on her desk at five o'clock almost went unnoticed. "Sophia?" she answered, tucking the device between her shoulder and ear while sorting documents.

"Mom! School ends next week! There's a parents' meeting tomorrow - can you come?" The hopeful note in her daughter's voice made Isabella pause. Summer already? When had life become such a blur?

"Your father can't make it?" Even as she asked, Isabella knew the answer. With Velotra's explosive success, Victoria would be drowning in damage control, leaving Alexander to pick up the pieces.

"Daddy's free," Sophia admitted, "but I want you! Please, Mom?" That pleading tone undid her every time. "Alright, sweetheart."

Sophia's delighted squeal made her smile despite her exhaustion. "I've got to run now. See you tomorrow morning."

The next day, Isabella pulled up to the prestigious Maplewood Academy gates. Sophia came barreling toward her the moment she stepped out of the car. "Mom!" The force of the hug nearly knocked her over.

Elizabeth Moore, Sophia's teacher, looked pleasantly surprised when she spotted Isabella. "Ms. Sinclair! What a lovely surprise." They exchanged pleasantries while discussing Sophia's academic progress. From everything Elizabeth said, Alexander had been handling parenting duties flawlessly in her absence.

"Mom," Sophia whispered during the meeting, swinging their clasped hands, "can we go to lunch after? Just us?" Isabella squeezed her hand in agreement.

But as they exited the school building, a familiar black sedan pulled up. Sophia didn't seem the least bit surprised. "Daddy!" she called out cheerfully.

Alexander Whitmore stepped out, his gaze finding Isabella's before acknowledging his daughter with a quiet hum. The tension between them crackled like static electricity in the summer air.
###Chapter 440

Isabella held Sophia's small hand while reaching for Alexander with the other. "Let's have lunch together!" She hesitated, almost pulling away, until Sophia whispered, "I can't remember the last time we all ate together as a family."

Seeing Sophia's radiant smile as she swung between them, noticing other children with both parents at the school gates, Isabella's resolve wavered.

She'd chosen to keep the baby despite the unexpected pregnancy. For years, Alexander had been absent from Sophia's life until recently reconnecting. But this new involvement had ironically created more distance between mother and daughter. Sophia had never known what a complete family felt like.

The realization struck Isabella like a physical blow. She'd given Sophia life, raised her alone - yet deprived her of a normal childhood. Whatever future she and Alexander might have, they would always remain Sophia's parents. Even after the divorce, they'd need to co-parent responsibly.

"Mommy?" Sophia tugged her hand, eyes wide with hope.

Isabella glanced at Alexander, finding him already watching her with that uncanny ability to anticipate her thoughts. "Where should we eat?" he asked casually.

"You choose," she replied, turning away to hide her conflicted emotions.

They took separate cars to The Grandeur. In the private dining room, Sophia beamed from her seat between them.

Alexander passed the menu to Isabella first. "Still coming to Whitmore Industries this afternoon?"

"I have prior engagements." Her tone was clipped as she accepted the teacup he poured.

"Sophia's birthday is next month," Isabella changed the subject. "How are you planning to celebrate?" She hadn't attended the last two birthdays. Last year's attempt to visit Salzburg had ended disastrously when Alexander ignored her messages and Sophia seemed content without her.

"You make the arrangements," she said lightly, already knowing custody would go to Alexander post-divorce. She might not even attend.

"Mommy, please come?" Sophia's hopeful voice cracked her resolve.

"We'll see," Isabella deflected, unable to promise.

Alexander fielded multiple business calls throughout lunch. The strained silence between courses was punctuated only by Sophia's cheerful chatter.

As Isabella prepared to leave, Sophia clung to her sleeve. "Just a little longer? Please?" The desperation in those big eyes shattered her defenses.

Alexander, having finished his calls, suggested the arcade across the street. Isabella focused entirely on teaching Sophia the games, pointedly ignoring the man hovering behind them.

"Daddy, play with us!" Sophia eventually called out.

Alexander's gaze flickered to Isabella's rigid posture. "I'm happy watching my two favorite girls," he said softly, that familiar half-smile playing on his lips.

Sophia shrugged and returned to the game, while Isabella steadfastly ignored the warmth spreading through her chest at his words.
###Chapter 441

Isabella and Sophia were immersed in their game at the flashing arcade when Alexander's phone suddenly vibrated. Glancing at the screen, he excused himself to take the call. Victoria's name flashed across the display. Ever since the Velotra press conference, she'd been restless - partly because of Isabella's unexpected presence, but mostly due to growing concerns about InnovaTech's future prospects. The fact that Alexander hadn't contacted her since yesterday afternoon, not even a brief text by mid-morning, only amplified her unease.

To maintain her composure, Victoria had deliberately left her phone in her office during morning meetings and lunch. Yet her resolve crumbled the moment she returned. Her fingers trembled slightly as she checked for missed calls - discovering Alexander had tried reaching her around 11:00 am. More surprisingly, a comprehensive market analysis on autonomous vehicles now occupied her desk.

As she pored through the pages, realization dawned. She'd never truly grasped the immense scale of this emerging market. The potential far exceeded her initial estimates, meaning InnovaTech still had substantial room for growth. Alexander had even included detailed technical development roadmaps in the appendix.

The weight lifting from her shoulders was almost physical. Drawing a steadying breath, she dialed back. "I was in back-to-back meetings and left my phone behind," she explained. "Mmm, I figured," came Alexander's calm response. He must have checked with her assistant when she didn't answer - that thoughtful attention to detail that always disarmed her.

Victoria's lips curved slightly. "I've reviewed the report. The path forward is clearer now."

"The autonomous vehicle sector is expanding exponentially," Alexander affirmed. "Addressing current product limitations could position InnovaTech for substantial growth."

Warmth seeped into Victoria's voice. "Understood." She hesitated, then added, "How was Sophia's parent-teacher conference? Have you eaten?"

"All taken care of."

Just as Victoria considered prolonging the conversation, another call demanded her attention. With reluctant professionalism, she ended their call.

Meanwhile, Isabella remained blissfully unaware of Alexander's phone conversation, her focus entirely on Sophia. Noticing the time, she gently concluded their game session. "Sweetheart, your afternoon class starts soon."

Sophia clung to her mother's arm. "Please take me back to school, Mommy?"

Alexander remained silent, observing Isabella's reaction. Since the school was just blocks away, Isabella nodded. This time, Alexander didn't follow. Instead, he met Isabella's gaze with quiet intensity. "Thank you."

For what? An occasional school run hardly compared to the years of solo parenting. Isabella simply tousled Sophia's hair. "Let's go."

Sophia's delighted grin could've powered the arcade lights. After waving goodbye to Alexander, she skipped hand-in-hand with Isabella to the car. Alexander watched until their vehicle disappeared around the corner before finally entering his own. The engine purred to life, carrying him toward an afternoon of decisions that would shape all their futures.
###Chapter 442

The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the office as Victoria Kensington finished her last email. She glanced at her phone, debating whether to call Alexander Whitmore for dinner.

She dialed his number three times. Each call went straight to voicemail.

Frowning, she called his secretary instead. "Daniel, I can't reach Alexander. Is he still in meetings?"

Daniel Prescott sounded surprised. "Mr. Whitmore left for Salzburg this afternoon for an urgent business trip. Didn't he tell you?"

Victoria's grip on her phone tightened. He hadn't mentioned anything.

"Was this trip planned last minute?"

"Yes, very sudden."

Even if it was urgent, he could have at least sent a text. But there had been nothing—no call, no message. The realization made her chest tighten.

After a moment, she grabbed her purse and left the office, dialing Sophia Whitmore's number.

Sophia was sprawled on the living room floor, assembling a puzzle when her phone buzzed. She grinned when she saw Victoria's name. "Hi, Victoria!"

"Hey, sweetheart," Victoria said, forcing warmth into her voice. "You're home already?"

"Yep! Just doing a puzzle."

Victoria smiled. "Did you have fun at your parent-teacher meeting today? Was your dad there?"

Sophia giggled. "No, silly! Mom came today, not Dad!"

At the mention of Isabella Sinclair, Victoria's smile faltered slightly. "Oh... really?"

She paused, then added, "I called your dad around noon, and he said the meeting was over. I assumed he went."

Sophia, still in high spirits from the day, chirped, "Nope! But after the meeting, Dad took me and Mom out to lunch!"

Victoria froze mid-step in front of the elevator, her finger hovering over the button. "He... suggested that?"

"Yep! He said he'd finish work early so we could all eat together."

Alexander had willingly arranged lunch with Isabella?

Victoria's stomach twisted.

But then she reasoned—maybe it was just to discuss final divorce details. The cooling-off period was almost over, after all.

She kept her tone light. "Did your dad say anything important to your mom during lunch?"

Sophia hummed, distracted by her puzzle. "Not really. Dad kept trying to talk to her, but Mom wasn't really listening. She barely said anything and didn't seem happy."

Victoria exhaled slowly. "Is that so?"

"Yeah."

Victoria stayed silent.

She knew the truth—for the past two years, Alexander and Isabella had barely spoken. No calls, just the occasional text.

If there were divorce matters to settle, he could have handled it through lawyers. Or a simple message.

There was no reason for them to meet.

Yet today, Alexander had gone out of his way to see her.

And from Sophia's words... it hadn't been Isabella seeking him out.

It had been him.
###Chapter 443

The Sinclair family had already been informed about Velotra's recent developments. With Isabella's remarkable career achievements, both Charles and Margaret were overflowing with pride for her. To commemorate this milestone, they arranged a celebratory luncheon at The Grandeur for Saturday afternoon. As Charles' luxury sedan approached the restaurant entrance, another vehicle suddenly swerved into their path from the opposite direction.

The reckless driver had clearly failed to maintain proper speed control, making them technically at fault. Though Charles had the right of way as the leading vehicle, he initially chose not to escalate the situation. However, when the other car aggressively attempted to cut them off, his patience wore thin. With a stern expression, he lowered his window to address the offending driver. Simultaneously, the other driver rolled down their window - equally convinced of their own righteousness. The moment recognition dawned, Charles' face turned to stone.

Reginald Kensington hadn't anticipated encountering the Sinclair family. All the indignant words he'd prepared evaporated instantly. In the passenger seat sat Eleanor, while the backseat contained Diana and Beatrice Kensington. Their collective shock mirrored his own at this improbable coincidence. Without waiting for Reginald's response, Charles decisively accelerated into the parking garage. What had been a joyful anticipation of celebration now carried a bitter aftertaste.

Margaret's cheerful demeanor darkened immediately upon recognizing the Kensington family. Isabella gently squeezed her grandmother's arm, offering silent reassurance. Remembering how her granddaughter's health had flourished and career had skyrocketed, Margaret found solace. She resolved not to let past grievances overshadow present blessings, gradually regaining her composure. After parking, the Sinclair family entered the restaurant with heads held high.

While Margaret's emotional recovery preserved their celebratory mood, the same couldn't be said for the Kensington and Pembroke families. Watching the Sinclairs walk away, Victoria, Diana, and even Beatrice wore expressions of barely concealed resentment. Velotra's success story had reached them all. Despite Alexander Whitmore's intervention stabilizing InnovaTech's direction, their previous investments had become worthless overnight.

More troubling still, InnovaTech's future remained precarious even with its new trajectory. What truly unsettled Diana and Beatrice was Velotra's press conference, where Isabella had publicly claimed credit for their technological breakthroughs, with Jonathan Sterling himself confirming all collaborative innovations originated solely from her. If true, Isabella's current valuation could easily surpass hundreds of billions. But how could that possibly be?

Did Isabella Sinclair truly possess such extraordinary technical genius? Could Nathaniel Graves possibly have no involvement? Was it conceivable she'd developed everything independently yet dared claim full credit? These troubling thoughts further soured the Kensington-Pembroke gathering, particularly for Victoria. Clenching her fists, she coolly suggested, "Shall we proceed inside?"

Snapped from their collective brooding, the group followed her lead. Over an hour later, as they prepared to depart, elevator chatter caught their attention. "Nathaniel remains unattended. Should you encounter suitable candidates, do keep him in mind." "Naturally, my dear. After all these years of friendship, you needn't remind me! Any promising matches will certainly be brought to his attention."

Victoria glanced up to recognize Melissa Graves, Nathaniel's mother, entering the elevator unnoticed. Eleanor and Diana, having met her previously, exchanged knowing glances at her words. Diana permitted herself a small, satisfied smile. Suddenly, Victoria understood her grandmother's quiet amusement.

If Velotra's technological marvels genuinely originated from Isabella, her current valuation might indeed reach astronomical figures. More significantly, such talent suggested limitless future potential - she might well develop groundbreaking new technologies. Essentially, if Isabella possessed these capabilities, she represented a veritable goldmine.

With such extraordinary skills and value, even elite families would overlook her divorced status. This made Melissa's continued search for alternative matches particularly telling. The conclusion became inescapable - Isabella's claimed "technological achievements" must contain substantial exaggeration. They couldn't possibly be entirely her own work.
###Chapter 444

The realization struck not just Diana and Victoria, but the entire Kensington clan. Genevieve sneered first. "I told you she was all smoke and mirrors. None of you wanted to listen." Penelope chimed in with a chuckle, "Who could've imagined she'd have the audacity to pull such a stunt in front of everyone? Right, Victoria?" Though Victoria remained silent, the corners of her lips curled into a knowing smirk.

Genevieve's voice turned singsong. "This means once that gold-digger gets divorced, she'll never make it into the Graves family." If Isabella Sinclair's supposed talents were fabricated, her chances of marrying into elite circles would vanish. The thought visibly lifted Diana, Genevieve, and their companions' spirits.

Inside the chauffeured Mercedes, Diana smoothed her skirt with satisfaction. "Next Wednesday marks the end of the cooling-off period. The moment Alexander returns from Salzburg, those divorce papers get signed." Genevieve practically vibrated with excitement. "Finally!" Even as an outsider, she felt electric anticipation crackle through her veins.

For years, she'd addressed Alexander as "brother-in-law," convinced of his undying devotion to Victoria. Yet the legal shackles binding him to Isabella had always needled her conscience. Diana and Eleanor shared the sentiment. Despite Alexander and Victoria's picture-perfect relationship, that unbroken marital tie to Isabella rankled like a pebble in a designer shoe.

If mere spectators found the arrangement distasteful, Victoria's torment ran deeper. Initially, she'd dismissed the marriage as inconsequential—Alexander's palpable disdain for Isabella made her feel secure in her superiority. What threat could that pathetic woman possibly pose?

But everything changed when Isabella started demonstrating genuine business acumen. Worse still was witnessing Alexander's gradual shift in attitude toward his estranged wife. That legal bond transformed from a triviality to a barbed wire around Victoria's heart.

Genevieve's question sliced through her thoughts. "When's Alexander due back from his trip?" The inquiry conjured yesterday's humiliation—Alexander detouring to see Isabella before departing without so much as a text to Victoria.

Acid churned in Victoria's stomach. Salzburg's annual fiscal reviews always consumed Alexander's attention. Perhaps she was reading too much into his radio silence. "His schedule remains fluid," she answered coolly. Genevieve's brow furrowed. "He won't miss the deadline, will he?" Diana waved a dismissive hand. "Business trips get extended. What difference does a few days make?" The divorce would happen regardless.

Genevieve nodded, but Victoria remained silent. Back in her penthouse, she dialed Alexander's private line. Again. Straight to voicemail. The crystal tumbler in her hand met the marble countertop with a violent crack.
###Chapter 445

The week started like any other for Isabella Sinclair.

Between her demanding schedule at Vetra and YodaVision, she barely had time to breathe. By Tuesday evening, exhaustion weighed heavily on her shoulders as she stepped into the elevator.

She glanced at her phone, noting the date.

Nathaniel Graves, equally drained from the day’s work, caught the flicker of tension in her expression.

"Tomorrow’s the last day of the cooling-off period, isn’t it?" he asked quietly.

Isabella tucked her phone back into her bag. "Yes."

After years of entanglement with Alexander Whitmore, it was finally coming to an end.

Nathaniel wasn’t sure whether to feel relieved for her or saddened. He despised Alexander, but knowing how deeply Isabella had once loved him made the situation bittersweet.

Still, some things had to end, no matter how painful.

Once the divorce was finalized, she could truly move forward.

He gave her shoulder a reassuring squeeze but said nothing more.

The next morning, after her usual run and breakfast, Isabella settled at her desk, ready to dive into work.

Then her phone rang.

Alexander’s name flashed on the screen.

They had agreed—once the cooling-off period ended, they would finalize the divorce immediately.

She answered. "Hello."

Before he could speak, she said, "I’ll be there at nine tomorrow—"

"I’m overseas on business," he interrupted.

She stilled.

He continued, "I won’t be back in time. We’ll have to delay the registration."

Her fingers tightened around the phone.

Sensing her silence, he added, "I’m sorry. This is my fault."

She exhaled sharply. "Understood."

Without waiting for another word, she hung up.

Rubbing her temples, she tried to steady her breathing—but her phone rang again almost instantly.

This time, it wasn’t Alexander.

Sebastian Ashford.

Her frown deepened.

Given her frequent visits to the military base, avoiding him entirely would be impossible.

She liked him—just not in the way he wanted.

Answering now would only encourage him.

But ignoring him felt rude.

After a brief hesitation, she picked up. "Hello."

Sebastian’s voice was warm, almost teasing. "Busy?"

"Very."

He chuckled. "I haven’t started my leave yet, but I had a free moment. Thought I’d call."

A pause. Then, with deliberate lightness, he added, "Even if it annoys you, I regret to inform you—I don’t plan to stop."

She blinked.

Before she could respond, he asked, "How have you been? Still drowning in work?"

"Yes."

"And the divorce?"

She stiffened.

He continued carefully, "I know it’s forward, but I have to ask—wasn’t tomorrow the day?"

He didn’t know the details, but he’d always assumed Alexander was the one pushing for the divorce, and Isabella had simply agreed.

So before she could answer, he added, "I’ll be free in a few days. Once I am—"

"Postponed," she cut in bluntly.

His smile faded. "Why? Did you change your mind, or…?"

"Business trip. He won’t be back in time."

A beat of silence. Then, cautiously, "So once he returns, you’ll go straight to finalize it?"

"...Yes."

Good.

Sebastian exhaled in quiet relief. By the time his leave started, she’d be free.

Not that he said that aloud.

Isabella took a breath. "Mr. Ashford, the reason I answered was actually to—"

"I know," he interrupted, amused. "You were going to say that answering doesn’t mean you’re interested, that it’s just politeness, and maybe to gently reject me again."

She opened her mouth.

"I know," he repeated, chuckling. Her honesty was oddly endearing. "But my stance hasn’t changed."

Then, before she could argue, he added, "I don’t have much time now. Once I’m done here, I’ll find you for dinner. See you soon."

He hung up before she could protest.

To be continued...
###Chapter 446

The clock was ticking down, and the people eagerly awaiting Isabella Sinclair's divorce weren't just Nathaniel Graves and Sebastian Ashford. Julian Montgomery had been counting the days too.

Among all of them, Julian was the only other person besides Nathaniel who knew Thursday marked the official end of Isabella and Alexander Whitmore's mandatory separation period. Though frequently traveling for business, he'd made a special effort to return to the city before dawn on that crucial Thursday.

After catching a few hours of sleep at his penthouse, Julian found himself glancing at his watch repeatedly throughout his morning meetings. By 10 AM, he couldn't resist calling Oliver Westbrook under the pretense of catching up. "I've been swamped with work lately," he said casually. "Haven't had a proper meal with you and Alexander in ages. How about lunch today?"

Oliver's response made Julian's grip tighten on his phone. "I'm free, but Alexander won't be joining. He left for an overseas business trip several days ago and hasn't returned yet."

"Alexander...is abroad?" Julian's mind raced. That meant the divorce couldn't be finalized today. He hadn't spoken directly to Alexander or Victoria Kensington recently, which was why he'd called Oliver - to discreetly gather information. If the divorce had gone through as planned, he would have...

"When is he coming back?" Julian forced his voice to remain steady. Oliver, unaware of the divorce timeline, answered absently, "No clue. You know how this season is - his international business always keeps him hopping between time zones. Could be weeks for all I know."

Julian ended the call with a frown, staring at Isabella's contact in his phone. He'd been preparing to reach out to her today. Now it seemed he'd have to wait longer.

Time passed quickly for those with busy schedules. On Friday afternoon, while Isabella was reviewing contracts at her office, her phone buzzed with an incoming call from Sophia Whitmore.

The young girl's voice bubbled with excitement as she announced her summer break had started. With Alexander still away, she begged to stay with Isabella. Isabella gently refused, though her fingers tightened around her phone. During their last call, Alexander had mentioned he'd only be gone a few days. That had been nearly a week ago now.

Left alone in the Whitmore mansion, Sophia grew increasingly restless. By Wednesday, she called Isabella again, her small voice tinged with loneliness. "Mom, Dad's been gone forever. The house is too quiet without him. Please can I stay with you?"

That plaintive tone broke through Isabella's resolve. After a long pause, she relented. "I'll pick you up after work. Wait for me at your grandmother's place." Sophia's delighted squeal made Isabella smile despite herself as the girl immediately began packing her favorite things to take to the Sinclair estate.

Of course, the Sinclair family knew Alexander's unexpected trip had delayed the divorce proceedings again. During dinner that evening, Margaret Sinclair couldn't help asking, "Sophia dear, any word on when your father will return?"

Unaware of the adults' complicated emotions, Sophia answered between bites of her favorite pasta. "Dad said he's not sure yet. But when we talked yesterday, he said he might miss my birthday party."

Margaret's fork stilled mid-air. Nearly a week had passed since the separation period ended, and Alexander still couldn't confirm his return date. Was he planning to stay away until the entire legal window had closed? If so, they'd have to restart the entire waiting period all over again.

Across the table, Isabella's brow furrowed as well, her appetite suddenly gone. The uncertainty stretched before them like an endless road.
###Chapter 447

The Monday morning sun cast golden streaks across the pavement as Isabella Sinclair approached the corporate tower. Just as she reached the entrance, she collided with Kieran Blackwood arriving simultaneously.

"Good morning," Kieran offered with a warm smile.

Isabella returned the greeting, only to spot Sebastian Ashford standing nearby. Her steps faltered slightly at his unexpected presence.

Kieran's expression darkened when he noticed Sebastian. The businessman ignored Kieran completely, striding directly toward Isabella.

"I returned from my business trip yesterday," Sebastian explained. "It's been weeks since we last met, so I thought I'd stop by."

His gaze held quiet longing. He'd genuinely come just to see her face. Knowing her boundaries well, he added quickly, "Don't let me interrupt your work. I'll be leaving shortly."

Isabella found herself momentarily speechless. Their complicated history made casual conversation impossible. Accepting his dismissal, she simply nodded and turned toward the elevators.

Kieran shot Sebastian a final glare before following Isabella. Sebastian watched her retreating figure, hands clenching slightly. A bouquet of roses lay forgotten in his car - an offering he now knew would only push her further away. He exhaled sharply through his nose before returning to his vehicle.

Inside the elevator, Kieran stood unusually close to Isabella. When she caught him staring, she arched an eyebrow. "Something wrong?"

"Nothing," he said too quickly. Then, unable to resist: "Does Mr. Ashford often visit you like this?"

"Hardly ever," Isabella replied truthfully. Between Sebastian's demanding schedule and her own boundaries, their encounters remained rare.

Kieran's shoulders relaxed slightly. He'd been relieved when Isabella rejected Sebastian's previous advances, but now worried persistence might wear down her resistance. His thoughts jumped to Julian Montgomery - another admirer who'd mysteriously backed off.

A new suspicion formed. Did Julian know Isabella's husband? The question burned in Kieran's throat.

"You seem... curious about something," Isabella observed as the elevator climbed.

Kieran seized the opening. "If I may ask - Sebastian Ashford is quite the catch. Why the lack of interest?" He needed to understand her dealbreakers.

Isabella found the question surprising coming from normally reserved Kieran. Still, she answered frankly: "I'm still legally married. Romance isn't on my radar. And Sebastian?" She shook her head. "There's simply no spark."

Kieran froze. "You're not divorced yet?" This changed everything.

"Not yet," she confirmed as the doors slid open.

Isabella strode toward her office without looking back. Kieran remained rooted in place, mind racing. Suddenly, Julian's withdrawal made sense. Either he knew about Isabella's marital status... or worse, knew exactly who her husband was.
###Chapter 448

The days blurred together in a whirlwind of activity for Isabella. She left before dawn and returned long after sunset each day. Though Sophia had been staying at the Sinclair estate, mother and daughter barely exchanged more than passing greetings.

Alexander, equally consumed by work commitments, reportedly called Sophia nearly every evening. But Isabella always seemed to miss those calls, leaving her unaware of their conversations.

Friday loomed - Sophia's birthday.

Surprisingly, Sophia took the news of Alexander's likely absence with remarkable composure. Wrapping her arms around Isabella's waist, she murmured, "It's alright. Having you here is enough."

But when Isabella explained she might only have time to prepare Sophia's favorite bisque and present a gift, the girl's shoulders slumped. Three years had passed since she last tasted her mother's famous red velvet cake. The memory of buttercream frosting lingered on her tongue.

She'd hoped...

Yet witnessing Isabella's exhaustion each night - dark circles bruising her eyes, fingers trembling around coffee mugs - Sophia swallowed her disappointment. "Okay, I understand," she whispered.

The weight of YodaVision, Whitmore Group, and Velotra projects pressed down on Isabella like a physical force. Midnight oil burned regularly in her office. Still...

This was her daughter's birthday.

Guilt prickled along Isabella's spine. Though the divorce papers remained unsigned, she'd already begun withdrawing from motherhood. The realization tasted bitter. "If I finish early tomorrow," she found herself promising, "I'll bake your cake."

Sophia's radiant smile could have powered cities.

Thursday arrived with cruel irony. Isabella became trapped in a labyrinth of contracts and video conferences. When she finally surfaced, the clock mocked her - 3:17 AM.

Dawn found her scrubbing flour from her elbows in frustration. The 9:15 Velotra board meeting permitted no delays. A hastily prepared bisque and wrapped jewelry box had to suffice.

Nine PM.

Isabella stared at her office clock, stomach twisting. She'd barely spoken three words to Sophia that morning.

Nathaniel observed her expression darken. "Everything alright?"

"Sophia's birthday," Isabella murmured.

Understanding flashed in Nathaniel's eyes. He checked his watch. "You've still got time. Go."

The Sinclair mansion glowed against the night sky. Margaret waited in the foyer, worry lines deepening. "Alexander never called," she confided. "Sophia's been...quiet."

Isabella's breath hitched.

Upstairs, Sophia lay curled with a graphic novel. "You're home," she noted, voice carefully neutral.

"I'm sorry-"

"I know." Sophia's smile didn't reach her eyes.

The realization struck Isabella like lightning - somewhere between boardrooms and bedtime stories, an invisible chasm had opened between them.

Then - salvation.

Sophia's phone lit up with "Dad's" caller ID. Her answering "Hello?" held frost.

Alexander's chuckle traveled through the speaker. "Happy birthday, princess."

"Mm."

"Mad at me?"

Silence.

"I'm sorry," Alexander continued, amusement undimmed. "The satellite connection was- wait, look outside your window."

Sophia bolted upright.

Alexander's voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper. "Turned out the Jakarta deal could wait...but my daughter's birthday couldn't."

The bedroom window framed Alexander below, leaning against his Aston Martin, phone glowing at his ear. Sophia's shriek of joy rattled the glass as she flew downstairs.

Isabella watched from the shadows, something unnameable tightening in her chest.
###Chapter 449

Sophia clutched her phone tightly as she dashed down the grand staircase. When she discovered Alexander had flown back from Salzburg just to surprise her, the gloom that had shadowed her face all day finally lifted. Isabella watched from the hallway, hesitating briefly before following her daughter and instructing the security to admit Alexander's car.

The moment the sleek black sedan rolled into the Sinclair estate's driveway, Sophia burst through the front doors. She practically launched herself into Alexander's arms the second he stepped onto the cobblestone path.

Today was supposed to be her special day, yet Alexander hadn't called once. Isabella had been absent all afternoon at some business meeting. The crushing feeling of being forgotten had weighed on Sophia all day. Now, seeing her father's unexpected arrival, tears welled up instantly in her eyes. The dam of suppressed emotions broke as she buried her face in his tailored suit.

Alexander's hand hovered momentarily when he felt the dampness on his jacket. A flicker of realization crossed his sharp features. It wasn't just his absence that had upset her - Isabella must have contributed to this emotional outburst too. His gaze found Isabella standing several paces away, her expression unreadable. Their eyes locked briefly in silent communication before she looked away.

Watching Sophia's trembling shoulders, Isabella knew exactly why her daughter was crying. Yet she remained rooted in place, arms crossed, offering no comfort. When Isabella made no move to intervene, Alexander focused entirely on Sophia, gently thumbing away her tears. "I should have called," he murmured. "I should have been here sooner."

His words only made Sophia cry harder, all her bottled-up loneliness pouring out. Alexander didn't hush her. He simply held her close, one hand rubbing soothing circles on her back until her sobs subsided into hiccups. Only then did he produce a small velvet box from his pocket.

Sophia's breath caught when she saw the gift. Wiping her cheeks, she managed a watery smile. "Thank you, Daddy." As father and daughter conversed quietly, Isabella maintained her distance, observing silently from the shadows.

With about an hour left before midnight, Alexander crouched to Sophia's level. "Anything special you'd like to do to finish your birthday?" Sophia bit her lip, glancing between her parents before shaking her head.

Alexander followed her gaze to Isabella. "Would you prefer coming home with me tonight, or staying here with your mother?" The question hung heavily in the air.

Sophia hesitated, studying Isabella's impassive face. Though her mother had been distant lately, she still fulfilled every request Sophia made. That had to mean something, didn't it? Decision made, Sophia crossed to Isabella and slipped her small hand into her mother's. "I want to stay with Mom."

Alexander didn't argue, simply nodding at Isabella. It was Sophia's birthday wish, after all. Isabella's fingers tightened slightly around Sophia's. "Alright then." Her voice was cool but not unkind. "It's late. Say goodnight to your father."

"Goodnight, Daddy," Sophia whispered, then impulsively added, "You'll pick me up tomorrow morning, right?"

Alexander's smile softened his usually stern features. "Of course." His gaze shifted to Isabella. "Thank you for tonight."

Isabella inclined her head slightly. "She's my daughter too." With that, she turned, leading Sophia back toward the house without another word.

Alexander remained by his car until the heavy oak doors closed behind them. Only then did he slide into the driver's seat, the engine purring to life as he disappeared into the night.
###Chapter 450

Upstairs in the Sinclair mansion, Isabella carefully unwrapped Alexander's birthday gift for Sophia while chatting with her daughter. The little girl listened quietly until Isabella's phone buzzed with an incoming message.

It was from Alexander. "Emergency meeting in Salzburg tomorrow afternoon. The divorce proceedings will need to be postponed another week."

Isabella's fingers hovered over the screen as she typed her reply. "Can't you reschedule for Monday morning?"

His response came instantly. "Already tried. Impossible. My apologies."

She pressed her lips into a thin line, choosing not to respond. Sensing her displeasure, Alexander sent another message. "Even if I can't return by next Friday, I'll definitely be back before the following Monday. You have my word."

The concrete timeline eased some of Isabella's tension. She set her phone aside without replying, knowing he'd see she'd read the messages. True to form, he didn't push further.

After tucking Sophia into bed when the girl grew drowsy, Isabella retreated to the ensuite bathroom for a long, steaming shower. The day's events had drained her completely. Slipping between the cool sheets, she reached for the lamp switch.

In her sleep, Sophia instinctively curled against Isabella's side, small fingers clutching her nightgown. "Mommy..." the child murmured.

Isabella whispered soothing words before realizing Sophia remained asleep, her tiny grip surprisingly strong. The sight tugged at Isabella's heart.

The next morning, Alexander arrived precisely at nine. Sophia came bounding downstairs in her favorite sunflower dress, backpack bouncing. When she heard her father's car pull up, she grabbed Isabella's hand insistently.

The Sinclair family - Margaret and Charles - pretended not to notice Alexander's presence outside. They bid Sophia farewell without acknowledging him. Dragged along by her enthusiastic daughter, Isabella had no choice but to step outside, though she stopped at the threshold.

Sophia launched herself into Alexander's waiting arms. "Daddy!" He swung her up effortlessly, murmuring something that made her giggle before his gaze found Isabella's.

"I'll have her back by seven. Thank you for watching her this coming week." His deep voice carried across the driveway.

Isabella nodded curtly. "Understood."

After Sophia blew exaggerated kisses to her mother, Alexander buckled her into the car and drove away from the Sinclair estate.

Between YodaVision, Whitmore Group, and Velotra's pressing technical issues, Isabella's weekend promised little respite. After a brief hospital visit to check on Evelyn, she retreated to her home office, drowning in paperwork.

Alexander's flight to Salzburg departed at 5:15 PM. After returning Sophia promptly at three, he raced to the airport.

News of his abrupt overseas trip reached the Kensington family swiftly. Diana Kensington's displeasure was palpable. "He couldn't spare one more day to finalize the divorce?" she huffed.

Genevieve nodded vigorously. "Exactly!"

Though Alexander was divorcing Isabella for Victoria's sake, and Victoria had his assurance he'd return by the promised date, their anxiety lingered. Until those papers were signed, anything could happen.

Victoria remained silent, remembering how Alexander had flown across continents just for Sophia's birthday celebration. Diana noticed her niece's expression and patted her hand. "Once you and Alexander have children of your own, he'll undoubtedly cherish them just as much - if not more."

Victoria offered a noncommittal hum, her thoughts elsewhere.

To be continued...
###Chapter 451

The Sunday sun hung high when Kieran Blackwood's friend grimaced at his phone screen. They were sharing brunch at The Grandeur when his companion peeked over curiously. "Seriously? It's the weekend," his friend groaned, spotting the work emails. "YodaVision isn't paying you enough to sacrifice your days off. I thought you were busy plotting how to ask Isabella Sinclair out."

Kieran's fingers paused over his phone. This wasn't about YodaVision - it was personal ambition burning through his weekend. He ignored the jab about Isabella. Before discovering she remained legally married, he'd spent weeks crafting perfect date invitations. Her confession about the pending divorce had changed everything. The separation was real, but that marriage certificate still existed...

"Earth to Kieran?" His friend's knuckles rapped the mahogany table. "You've been zoning out all morning. What's going on in that genius brain of yours?"

Kieran blinked back to reality. When he'd believed Isabella divorced, her ex-husband barely registered in his thoughts. Now knowing Alexander Whitmore had initiated the divorce proceedings, questions gnawed at him. Isabella was everything - brilliant, compassionate, effortlessly elegant. What kind of man would willingly let her go?

He was about to ask his friend to discreetly investigate Alexander when a familiar voice cut through the restaurant chatter. "Kieran Blackwood? Out before noon on a Sunday?" Victoria Kensington approached with a knowing smile, her designer heels clicking against marble floors.

Kieran's posture stiffened. "Victoria." His greeting carried frost. Since joining YodaVision, he'd maintained professional distance, especially after learning about her relationship with Alexander.

Unfazed, Victoria slid into the vacant chair. "Your sister contacted me again," she said, accepting the tea a waiter offered. "She's worried about you wasting your potential at YodaVision when the family business needs you." Her manicured fingers traced the porcelain rim. "Months away haven't changed anything. When will you consider coming home?"

Kieran's jaw tightened. He couldn't fathom why someone who once shared his passion for AI would push him toward dull corporate inheritance. "That's between the Blackwoods and me," he said curtly.

Victoria studied his stormy expression before continuing gently, "I understand your attachment to YodaVision. Believe me, I'd give anything to work there." She hesitated. "But your father's health is declining..."

"I know about his condition," Kieran interrupted.

Before tension could escalate, his friend interjected smoothly, "Ms. Kensington, are you dining alone today? I don't see Mr. Whitmore with you."

"Family outing," Victoria replied, glancing toward the entrance. "Alexander's returning from Salzburg tomorrow."

At that moment, Dominic Fairchild approached with a polished smile. "Ms. Kensington, what a pleasant coincidence."

Victoria nodded graciously before noticing his companion. "Mr. Ashford! It's been ages."

Sebastian Ashford offered a curt nod before his gaze locked onto Kieran. Recognition flashed between them like lightning.

Victoria began introductions, "This is Kieran Blackwood from YodaVision. Kieran, this is—"

"We've met," both men said simultaneously, their voices overlapping with eerie precision.

Victoria's smile faltered. Even Dominic's usually composed expression cracked with surprise. As far as they knew, these two men occupied entirely separate worlds - one a rising tech star, the other a elusive business magnate. Yet their charged silence spoke volumes of some unspoken history.
###Chapter 452

Victoria Kensington and Dominic Fairchild didn't question how Kieran Blackwood and Sebastian Ashford knew each other. With practiced grace, Victoria suggested, "Since we've met by chance, why don't we have lunch together?"

Dominic opened his mouth to agree, but Kieran cut in sharply. "I have prior commitments. Another time."

Before Dominic could react, Sebastian smoothly added, "Same here. Business matters require my attention." His polite refusal caught Dominic off guard, making him blink in surprise.

Noticing Dominic's reaction, Victoria's smile faltered slightly. She'd always sensed Sebastian's cool detachment toward her - not hostile, but distinctly uninterested. The realization stung more than she cared to admit.

"Another time then," Dominic conceded awkwardly.

Victoria forced a bright smile. "Of course, whenever you're available."

Sebastian gave a curt nod, squeezed Dominic's shoulder in silent communication, and strode away. Kieran had already returned to his phone, effectively dismissing them both. His blatant indifference was new - in the past, she'd always caught him stealing glances when he thought she wasn't looking.

Now? Nothing.

A faint crease appeared between Victoria's brows before she smoothed her expression. "Your parents worry about you," she said gently to Kieran. "Call them sometime." Without waiting for a response, she turned on her heel.

The Kensington and Shaw families observed the exchange from a discreet distance. As Victoria rejoined them, Diana Kensington remarked, "That was the Fairchild heir and Walter Ashford's grandson, wasn't it? Such distinguished young men from Fairview's elite families."

"Particularly Sebastian Ashford," Beatrice Kensington added eagerly. "He rarely appears at social functions. You should have prolonged the conversation!"

Victoria had barely taken her seat when Penelope chimed in, "They're all exceptional matches. Josephine and Genevieve are still unattached..."

"Exactly!" Diana agreed enthusiastically.

Josephine spoke quietly, "But both Mr. Blackwood and Mr. Fairchild seem quite taken with Victoria. Wouldn't it be awkward?"

Beatrice shot her daughter a disapproving look. "Nonsense! Feelings develop over time. If Victoria facilitates introductions, who knows what might blossom? You must try."

Josephine fell silent under her mother's glare.

Victoria finally interjected, "I'm not close enough with them to make such introductions."

Diana waved a dismissive hand. "Then simply bring Josephine or Genevieve along next time there's an event they're attending."
###Chapter 453

The past weeks had been a whirlwind for Isabella since joining forces with Velotra. Each day blurred into the next, filled with endless meetings and negotiations. As another Monday dawned, her schedule became even more packed, leaving no room for personal matters. When she finally surfaced from her work haze, seven days had vanished without notice.

Exhausted, Isabella dragged herself home late that night to find Sophia already asleep. Though the child had been staying at the Sinclair residence recently, their interactions had been minimal. Watching her daughter curled up alone in the oversized bed, Isabella lingered by the bedside before quietly retreating to shower.

Morning light filtered through the curtains when Isabella awoke. Sophia stood by the door, dressed and ready with her backpack. "Did I wake you, Mommy?" the girl asked, leaning against the bed.

Isabella sat up, shaking her head. "No, sweetheart." She studied Sophia's outfit. "Going somewhere?"

"Papa's back! He's coming to get me soon." The words jolted Isabella - Saturday. Alexander's scheduled return day.

After freshening up, Isabella descended to breakfast. The doorbell chimed as Alexander arrived. Leading Sophia to the entrance, Isabella noted how impeccably put together he looked - no trace of travel fatigue.

As if reading her thoughts, Alexander scooped Sophia up and said, "I returned last night." When Isabella remained silent, he continued, "Thank you for watching her. Are you free for lunch today?"

"No need," Isabella declined coolly.

Alexander simply nodded. "Then I'll see you Monday."

"Fine."

Sophia piped up, "Mommy, I'll visit again when you're less busy!"

"Of course," Isabella replied automatically. The next time they met would likely be for divorce proceedings. The realization made her pause. "Take care of yourself."

Misinterpreting the sentiment, Sophia beamed. "I will! Bye, Mommy!"

"Goodbye."

As Alexander's car disappeared down the driveway, Isabella turned back toward the empty house.

That evening found Alexander and Victoria dining with Charles Montgomery, recently returned from abroad. "When Chester came back last year," Charles remarked between courses, "he kept raving about how much Ceravelle had changed."

Alexander nodded. "You should visit more often."

"Absolutely," Charles agreed. "Actually, I've been fascinated by YodaVision lately. Since Whitmore Group partners with them, perhaps you could introduce me to Mr. Graves and the renowned Ms. Sinclair?"

Victoria, who had been quietly observing, stiffened slightly at the mention.

Before Alexander could respond, Charles continued, "When you first described YodaVision's programming capabilities years ago, I didn't grasp their significance. But after studying CUAP these past two years, I understand why you were so taken with their technology..."

The conversation flowed around Victoria as she maintained her composed facade, though her fingers tightened imperceptibly around her wineglass. Across the table, Alexander's expression remained unreadable as he fielded Charles's enthusiastic questions about the tech company and its brilliant co-founder.

###Chapter 454

Alexander Whitmore smiled, his fingers tapping rhythmically against the polished mahogany desk.

"Absolutely, my interest hasn't waned in the slightest."

Victoria Kensington knew well of Alexander's fascination with NovaTech's Luminar programming language.

That was precisely why, when she'd expressed her desire to join NovaTech last year, he'd given his wholehearted support.

He saw immense potential in her.

Perhaps it was his admiration for Luminar's creator that made him brush off Nathaniel Graves' cold demeanor - a hostility stemming from Isabella Sinclair.

Alexander simply chuckled it off.

"Though I must admit," he said candidly, "I've managed to offend Mr. Graves before."

His opinion of me isn't exactly favorable at the moment."

"If you're hoping to collaborate with him while asking for my assistance," he continued, "it might actually backfire."

Harrison Montgomery raised an eyebrow in surprise but didn't press further.

"Understood. I'll find another way to make the connection."

Harrison's pharmaceutical empire had been struggling with their AI model's dismal success rate in antibody discovery.

Their ambitious plan to design revolutionary antibody molecules using multimodal generation architecture, combined with atomic structure prediction capabilities, had hit an insurmountable wall.

After six months of failed partnerships, Harrison turned his attention to NovaTech.

Harrison's international reputation preceded him.

A collaboration would benefit NovaTech immensely.

Both Isabella and Nathaniel showed particular interest in this field.

After brief discussions, they scheduled a meeting with Harrison for the following morning.

Harrison arrived at Sterling Heights with two engineers in tow.

Having watched several interviews featuring Nathaniel and Isabella before returning to the States, Harrison thought Isabella looked stunning on camera.

He wasn't prepared for how breathtaking she appeared in person.

Time was of the essence.

After exchanging pleasantries, Isabella's team dove straight into dissecting the technical flaws in Harrison's current multimodal architecture setup.

Isabella and Nathaniel engaged the engineers in deep discussion - from fusion strategies to data alignment, and computational efficiency improvements - addressing each issue methodically.

By meeting's end, Harrison was so impressed he immediately instructed his team to draft a contract, eager to formalize the partnership with NovaTech without delay.

As Isabella and Nathaniel prepared to leave, Harrison personally escorted them to their car with uncharacteristic courtesy.

The moment their vehicle disappeared from view, he dialed Alexander.

"The problems that stumped my engineers for months?" Harrison said, voice tinged with awe.

"Mr. Graves and his girlfriend solved them effortlessly."

"They're truly remarkable. I'm confident our challenges will be resolved swiftly."

Alexander chuckled, "The right partnership does yield double the results with half the effort. Congratulations."

After exchanging pleasantries, Harrison couldn't resist adding, "Mr. Graves' girlfriend is astonishingly beautiful. More importantly, she's brilliant."

"I expected Mr. Graves to lead the discussion, but she matched him at every turn. Their synergy was flawless."

Harrison's voice dropped conspiratorially, "I'm thoroughly intrigued by Ms. Sinclair now. If she weren't taken, I'd pursue her without hesitation!"

Alexander was mid-bite when the comment came through.

His fork paused mid-air, eyebrow arching slightly.

"Oh? Is that so?"

The conversation wasn't private.

Sophia Whitmore and Victoria Kensington sat in the private dining room as Alexander took the call on speakerphone.

Every word Harrison uttered reached Victoria's ears with crystal clarity.

Her fingers tightened imperceptibly around her wine glass.

###Chapter 455

Isabella froze mid-bite when Harrison's words reached her ears.

Harrison continued without hesitation.

"I'm completely serious. Her beauty, her poise, her composed demeanor—she's everything I've ever wanted."

His voice held unwavering certainty.

"And that brilliant mind of hers? It's like my dream woman walked right out of my fantasies."

Alexander remained silent, his lips curving into a faint smile.

With the divorce papers not yet finalized, it felt inappropriate to encourage another man's interest in Isabella.

Their conversation ended shortly after as Harrison had pressing matters to attend to.

After her meeting with Harrison, Isabella returned home for a brief respite.

That evening, she meticulously packed all necessary documents for tomorrow's divorce proceedings—her ID, household registry, everything.

Double-checking the contents of her bag, she was about to turn off the lights when her phone rang.

Frederick's voice came through crisp and clear.

"Be ready in ten minutes. The car's coming to pick you up."

Tomorrow was supposed to be the day she and Alexander finalized their divorce.

Isabella hesitated.

"Professor, I—"

"Can this wait until morning?"

Having visited the research facility numerous times, she understood all too well that every second counted—not just in terms of astronomical costs, but often in lives saved.

Frederick didn't entertain her request.

The line went dead the moment he finished speaking.

The cooling-off period for their divorce was nearly over.

Isabella had no idea how long this emergency assignment would last.

If she couldn't return before the deadline...

They'd have to restart the entire divorce process from scratch.

Her lips pressed into a thin line as she sat motionless for a long moment.

Then, shaking herself from her thoughts, she changed quickly and sent a message to Nathaniel.

His reply came instantly—a single thumbs-up emoji conveying perfect understanding.

Dressed and ready, Isabella hesitated again before texting Alexander.

"Urgent work matter came up. We'll need to reschedule the divorce. I'll contact you when I'm back."

Whether he was busy or simply hadn't seen her message, she received no reply.

By the time the black sedan pulled into the Sinclair estate, her phone screen remained dark.

As the car passed through the gates, she surrendered her phone to the security officer as protocol demanded.

The agent beside her immediately began briefing her on the situation.

Isabella hadn't even reached the facility yet, but her mind was already immersed in the technical challenges ahead.

Three days later, after seventy-two hours of continuous work, the entire engineering team collapsed into exhausted sleep the moment their final task completed.

Isabella was no exception.

Her brain felt like molten lead, her body too heavy to lift.

Like her colleagues, she folded her arms on the desk and was asleep within seconds.

She woke to find the fatigue still clinging to her bones, though her mind felt marginally clearer.

Reviewing the latest data sets, she was about to dive back in when she noticed Sebastian sitting nearby, engaged in quiet conversation.

Catching her gaze, he offered a polite nod and smile.

Isabella returned the gesture automatically before her attention snapped back to the fresh data streaming across her screen.

Within seconds, she was fully absorbed in her work once more.

The numbers didn't care about divorce papers or cooling-off periods.

They demanded her complete focus—and for now, that was exactly what she needed.

###Chapter 456

By the time Isabella finished her work and surfaced from her intense focus, she realized with a start that Sebastian had already left his seat without her noticing.

The following days saw her working around the clock until the mission was finally resolved.

She collapsed into bed and slept for a solid twenty-four hours before feeling remotely human again.

Though improved, her complexion remained noticeably paler than before she'd entered the facility.

That entire day had been spent in restless slumber with barely any food consumed.

As evening approached, hunger finally roused her from bed.

Making her way to the dining hall, she unexpectedly crossed paths with Sebastian emerging from the opposite wing.

His eyebrows lifted in surprise.

"I assumed you'd already left NovaTech."

Given the mission's significance, he could roughly estimate her arrival timeline.

With operations now concluded, he'd expected her departure yesterday after completing her objectives.

Isabella shook her head.

"There are still some matters requiring my attention," she explained.

Originally scheduled to leave yesterday, Frederick had requested her personal assistance with lingering issues.

Sebastian offered a warm smile of understanding.

Taking in her still-sleepy demeanor, he guessed she'd only recently woken from her marathon rest.

He restrained further questions.

"Heading to eat?" he inquired instead.

"Care to join me?"

Under the circumstances, refusal seemed impolite.

"Of course," she acquiesced.

They collected their meals and settled at a table facing each other.

Sebastian studied her carefully.

During his recent leave, while no romantic progress had occurred between them, he'd managed to obtain Nathaniel's contact through mutual acquaintances and learned Isabella's divorce remained unofficial.

According to Nathaniel, her husband had urgent overseas business with no definite return date - meaning the divorce likely remained pending.

With the legal separation incomplete and her feelings currently platonic, Sebastian saw no benefit in pressing the matter.

Their conversation steered clear of personal topics - no inquiries about divorce paperwork, no questions about her child's gender, age, or personality.

Instead, they discussed mission-related events at the facility.

Work topics always provided ample discussion between them.

But NovaTech's environment bred unpredictability.

Their conversation was abruptly interrupted when Isabella received an urgent notification from Frederick.

Spotting the alert, she dabbed her lips and rose quickly.

"I'm needed immediately. Please, finish your meal."

Sebastian nodded gently.

"Of course."

As she turned to leave, their gazes accidentally locked.

The unguarded longing in his eyes gave her pause.

She hesitated, dropping her gaze momentarily before looking away.

After a brief silence, she offered a soft "Goodbye" before hurrying off.

Sebastian's reluctance stemmed from practical concerns - his upcoming assignment would take him away from NovaTech for weeks.

By his return, Isabella would certainly have departed.

Their next meeting likely wouldn't occur for at least a month...

###Chapter 457

After wrapping up her tasks at NovaTech headquarters, Isabella Sinclair finally checked her phone upon arriving home.

The screen illuminated with Alexander Whitmore's belated response - a single word "Got it" sent over an hour after she'd left for work.

For fifteen days since their canceled meeting, that solitary message remained his only communication.

Meanwhile, Sophia Whitmore's calls had flooded her phone five times in the past week alone.

Isabella typed a quick update: "Finished with work. Available Monday."

The message bubble hovered unanswered.

She set her phone aside, deciding not to wait.

As for Sophia's missed calls, nothing seemed urgent enough to warrant an immediate callback.

Nearly two weeks had passed since her last hospital visit.

After freshening up and breakfast, Isabella accompanied her family to see Evelyn Sinclair.

Her mother's condition showed gradual improvement.

"Thank you, Dr. Whitmore," Isabella expressed her gratitude.

Eleanor Whitmore gave a reassuring pat.

"No thanks necessary - it's my duty."

Their visit concluded, Isabella and Margaret Sinclair descended via elevator.

The sliding doors revealed an unexpected trio: Diana Kensington, Victoria Kensington, and Genevieve.

Both Sinclair women paused momentarily before composing themselves and proceeding forward.

The Kensington women's expressions darkened noticeably.

Since Alexander initiated divorce proceedings, Isabella had reportedly cooperated fully.

Their final appointment had been postponed twice due to his business commitments.

They'd expected to conclude matters this coming Monday during Alexander's availability.

Yet Isabella had suddenly become unreachable - skipping work and ignoring calls.

To them, this clearly signaled deliberate avoidance, an attempt to stall past the mandatory thirty-day waiting period.

Genevieve's glare burned with undisguised hostility.

Diana's icy stare matched her niece's intensity.

Isabella met their gazes with equal frost before looking away.

The Kensington women stiffened at her audacity.

Genevieve's temper flared.

"You—"

"Genevieve."

Victoria's calm interjection carried unspoken warning.

Public confrontations served no one's interests, especially with the divorce still pending.

Genevieve clenched her fists, consoling herself with the inevitable outcome.

Once Alexander wrapped up his business, no amount of stalling would prevent their separation.

Her frustration resurged remembering Alexander had taken Sophia abroad for an extended business trip, planning additional vacation days.

"Victoria," she complained, "can't you ask Alexander to return sooner? He can vacation with that girl after the divorce!"

Victoria remained unperturbed.

"Unnecessary. Alexander handles his affairs competently."

Meanwhile, as Isabella settled into her car, her phone finally vibrated with Alexander's response: "Understood. Returning tomorrow."

###Chapter 458

Isabella glanced at the message before dismissing it without reply.

That evening, she joined her family for dinner at The Grandeur.

As they arrived, she let them enter first while she searched for parking.

Parking her car, Isabella grabbed her purse and stepped out, completely unaware that the sleek black vehicle beside hers belonged to Victoria Kensington.

Victoria had just ended a call when she spotted Isabella through her tinted windows.

Just as Isabella locked her car and turned toward the restaurant entrance, a familiar voice called out, "Bella?"

Only one person ever called her that—Frederick Aldridge's wife, Vivian Prescott.

Isabella froze mid-step before slowly turning.

Sure enough, Vivian stood a few feet away, elegant as ever.

Victoria, who had been about to exit her own car, paused in shock upon recognizing Vivian.

Vivian Prescott wasn't just a renowned medical researcher—she was Frederick Aldridge's wife.

Though she maintained a low public profile, anyone in elite circles knew exactly who she was.

Victoria hesitated, watching as Isabella turned toward Vivian with visible emotion.

"Mrs. Aldridge!" Isabella breathed.

Vivian's face lit up with warmth.

She opened her arms.

"My dear Bella, it's been too long."

Isabella melted into the embrace.

"It really has."

Vivian pulled back slightly to cup Isabella's face, her thumb brushing affectionately against her cheek.

"Look at you—more beautiful every time I see you."

Isabella laughed softly.

"You haven't aged a day, Mrs. Aldridge."

Vivian waved off the compliment with playful arrogance.

"Of course I haven't."

They both laughed before Vivian continued, "I've been buried in research in Crestwood these past years, but I've followed your work with Nathaniel at NovaTech. That recent breakthrough with Luminar? Absolutely brilliant."

A faint blush colored Isabella's cheeks.

"We got lucky. Are you here alone? Would you like to join us?"

"Business dinner, I'm afraid," Vivian sighed.

"But I was planning to reach out—it's been nearly five years since I last saw you and Nathaniel. How about we arrange something before I leave town?"

Isabella nodded eagerly.

"Absolutely."

Vivian's eyes sparkled.

"Perfect. My niece is obsessed with Luminar—mind if I bring her along?"

"Not at all," Isabella assured her.

Then, more softly, "And thank you again for arranging Dr. Whitmore's consultation for my mother."

Vivian waved it away.

"Think nothing of it."

She checked her watch.

"Ah—my guests just arrived. Can't keep them waiting or they'll think I've gone full diva."

Laughing, Isabella linked arms with her.

"Let's go in."

Neither woman noticed Victoria still sitting in her car, gripping the steering wheel, having witnessed the entire exchange.

###Chapter 459

The moment Isabella and Vivian left, Victoria stood frozen in place for what felt like an eternity, unable to snap out of her daze.

It wasn’t until Eleanor, who had been waiting inside The Grandeur, called to hurry her along that she finally blinked back to reality.

She hung up, stepped inside, and took her seat, her face unnaturally pale.

Eleanor frowned.

“What’s wrong? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

Victoria shook her head.

“Nothing.”

Her voice was faint, as if all the strength had been drained from her.

Her entire demeanor was distant, her gaze unfocused, as if her soul had left her body.

Something was clearly wrong.

Eleanor’s concern deepened.

Not long after Isabella returned home from dinner, her phone buzzed with a message from Alexander.

"An urgent matter has come up in Willowbrook. My return to Fairview will be delayed by a few days."

Isabella read it and exhaled sharply, frustration bubbling up inside her.

But given that she had canceled their last planned meeting just weeks ago, she had no right to complain.

Still, if there was a next time…

She tossed her phone aside and headed for the shower.

The next morning, Isabella returned to work at NovaTech as usual.

Kieran Blackwood smiled when he saw her.

“You’re back?”

Isabella nodded.

“Yeah.”

Since Kieran had joined NovaTech, Isabella had already taken multiple extended leaves.

When Nathaniel had mentioned she was dealing with personal matters, Kieran had wondered what could possibly take so long.

Now, he assumed it must have been related to her divorce.

With a child involved, custody negotiations alone could drag on for months.

He just wasn’t sure if she had finalized things yet.

After exchanging brief pleasantries, Isabella settled back into her work.

Three days later, she still hadn’t heard from Alexander—but she did receive a call from his mother, Catherine.

"Eleanor has been admitted to Central Hospital. Severe influenza, compounded by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and respiratory failure. She’s asking for you."

There was no time to process the shock.

Isabella grabbed her bag and rushed to the hospital.

When she arrived, Victoria Whitmore, Henry, Catherine, and Richard were already gathered outside the emergency room.

Victoria pursed her lips and said nothing.

Catherine remained silent as well.

Only Henry acknowledged her.

“Isabella.”

Isabella didn’t respond immediately.

Instead, she asked, “What’s the latest update?”

Henry answered, “She’s still in emergency care. No change yet.”

Richard, aware that Isabella and Alexander hadn’t officially divorced, greeted her politely.

“Mrs. Whitmore.”

Isabella listened, then gave a slight nod.

Richard continued, “I’ve contacted Mr. Whitmore and Sophia. They’ve booked a flight and should be back tonight.”

Isabella replied, “Alright.”

Under the circumstances, even Victoria, who normally despised her, didn’t bother picking a fight.

After Richard finished speaking, the hallway fell into tense silence.

The wait stretched on, agonizingly slow.

Finally, the emergency room doors opened.

Isabella, Catherine, and the others surged forward.

“Doctor, how is she?”

The doctor removed his mask.

“We’ve stabilized her, but her condition remains critical. Recovery will depend on her own strength and willpower now.”

###Chapter 460

The doctors couldn't predict when Eleanor would regain consciousness.

Isabella remained at the hospital with the family for more than an hour.

When Eleanor still showed no signs of waking, Catherine suggested gently, "You should head home first. I'll contact you immediately if there's any change in her condition."

Isabella's gaze lingered on Eleanor's ventilator-assisted form.

After glancing at her watch, she responded, "It's still early. I'd prefer to stay a while longer."

Catherine didn't press further.

Henry and Victoria stayed as well.

Isabella waited until nearly midnight when the doctors confirmed Eleanor's vitals had stabilized but cautioned she wouldn't wake soon.

Only then did she finally leave to rest.

About ninety minutes after Isabella's departure, Alexander and Sophia arrived at the hospital.

Alexander already knew about Isabella's earlier visit.

He and Catherine agreed to keep vigil together, while Richard would take Sophia home to sleep.

For Sophia, this marked her first direct encounter with mortality's fragility.

Clutching Alexander's waist, she buried her face against his chest, eyes welling with frightened tears.

"I don't want to go home. I need to see Grandma."

Alexander lifted her effortlessly, checking the time.

"It's nearly 1 AM. She's probably asleep already. Let me check first."

"Can I call—"

"I'll handle it," Alexander assured, pulling out his phone to text Isabella: "Still awake? Sophia and I are at the hospital. I'm staying overnight with Grandma. Seeing her condition frightened Sophia—she wants to come to you. Would that be alright?"

Isabella hadn't slept either.

Though exhausted, memories of her own grandfather's medical crisis at Sophia's age kept her awake with shared anxiety.

Reading Alexander's message, she instantly replied: "Bring her here."

"Thank you."

As Isabella set her phone down to fetch water, another message arrived: "Can we delay the divorce proceedings for now?"

She understood he meant waiting until Eleanor's condition improved.

After a brief hesitation, she typed: "Agreed."

No further response came.

Thirty minutes later, Sophia arrived.

After helping her bathe and tucking her in, Isabella drew the girl close, stroking her hair gently.

"Sleep now."

It was the first maternal embrace since mentioning divorce.

Nestled against her mother, Sophia's tension melted.

Exhausted from the day's emotional turmoil, she soon drifted off.

By morning, Eleanor remained unconscious.

After briefing the housekeeper, Isabella and Margaret brought Sophia back to the hospital.

Alexander appeared swamped with work—when they arrived at eight, he was already deep in discussion with Benjamin, documents spread across the table.

Noticing their entrance, both men paused.

Alexander rose to greet them.

"You're here."

Isabella nodded softly.

"Madam Sinclair," Alexander acknowledged Margaret, who responded with a curt nod before moving to Eleanor's bedside.

With a morning meeting approaching, Isabella prepared to leave after checking on Eleanor.

But Sophia clung to her sleeve.

"Mom, I want to stay with you. Can I come to your office?"

###Chapter 461

Sophia's hopeful expression faltered as Isabella hesitated to respond.

Alexander intervened smoothly, "Your mother has important meetings today. Let's not distract her."

The little girl's lower lip trembled as she gazed up at Isabella with pleading eyes.

"I have back-to-back meetings at NovaTech this morning," Isabella explained gently, crouching to Sophia's level.

"Then I'm heading to Sterling Heights for a client presentation. It wouldn't be appropriate to bring you along - how about we plan something special this weekend?"

Sophia's shoulders slumped, but she nodded reluctantly.

"Okay..."

With Eleanor still unconscious and the conversation stalled, Margaret took her leave when Isabella departed.

The elevator doors slid shut behind them.

"He's not concerned about Sophia disrupting your work," Margaret observed dryly.

"He's worried someone might recognize her at NovaTech and start asking questions."

Isabella understood immediately.

If word got out that she and Alexander remained legally married, Victoria would be the first to suffer the consequences.

To protect Victoria's reputation, Alexander would naturally keep their marital status under wraps until the divorce was finalized.

The truth couldn't surface now.

Outside the hospital, Isabella waited until Margaret's car disappeared around the corner before entering her own vehicle.

At that precise moment, Julian Montgomery arrived at the entrance, immediately recognizing Isabella's silhouette as she slid into the driver's seat.

His lips parted to call out, but her car had already merged into traffic.

Julian swallowed his greeting.

Oliver Westbrook rounded the car and clapped him on the shoulder.

"Earth to Julian? Let's move."

Shaking himself from his thoughts, Julian followed Oliver upstairs.

Sophia greeted them with renewed enthusiasm.

"Mr. Montgomery! Mr. Westbrook!"

Julian smiled warmly and ruffled Sophia's hair before setting his fruit basket beside the bedside table.

His gaze caught on the gift basket from Isabella and Margaret, noticing the small card with Isabella's distinctive handwriting - a get-well message for Eleanor signed simply "Bella."

Seeing her familiar script sent an unexpected warmth through Julian's chest.

He stared at the card, momentarily transfixed.

"Julian?"

Oliver's voice snapped him back to reality.

"Sit down already. What's so fascinating over there?"

Julian turned to find both Oliver and Alexander watching him.

When his eyes met Alexander's piercing gaze, he quickly looked away.

"Right," he muttered, placing his fruit basket down.

But before taking his seat, he hesitated, then deliberately repositioned his gift to sit flush against Isabella's.

The moment he settled into his chair, Alexander's phone buzzed.

Victoria's name flashed on the caller ID.

Alexander answered smoothly.

"How's your grandmother? Any change?"

Victoria's concerned voice came through.

"Not yet."

"And Sophia? Is she feeling better?"

"Much improved."

"Could I speak with her briefly?"

Alexander handed the phone to Sophia.

"Is it Victoria?" the girl asked excitedly.

"Yes."

Sophia practically snatched the phone.

"Victoria!" she chirped.

Oliver scratched his nose awkwardly upon realizing who was calling.

Earlier, he'd asked Alexander if Victoria would be visiting Eleanor, only to learn Catherine had laid down strict rules the previous night - Victoria was expressly forbidden from entering the hospital room.

Catherine's exact words had been razor-sharp: "I won't have outsiders disturbing your grandmother's recovery."

###Chapter 462

The thought crossed Oliver's mind to share some gossip, but with Sophia and Richard present, he decided it wasn't the appropriate moment and kept quiet.

Alexander and Julian both had pressing matters demanding their attention.

After visiting Eleanor, Julian and Oliver didn't linger long in the hospital room.

Yet it had been ages since their group had shared a proper meal together.

Before departing, Oliver proposed, "If you can both clear your schedules, shall we have dinner tonight at The Grandeur?"

Alexander and Julian responded simultaneously, "Absolutely."

Alexander spent the remainder of the day at the hospital managing work affairs.

That evening, Catherine arrived to relieve him, allowing him to head to the reserved restaurant.

Sophia had returned to the Sinclair residence by noon, so Alexander went to dinner alone.

Upon arrival, Julian and Oliver were already seated.

Victoria was the last to arrive.

As she pushed open the private dining room's door, Alexander turned and spoke first.

"You made it."

Victoria offered a slight smile.

"Indeed."

Her gaze immediately noticed Julian's presence nearby.

When she'd first learned of Julian's growing affection for Isabella, shock had been her initial reaction.

But beyond surprise lay profound confusion.

She couldn't comprehend what qualities Isabella possessed—aside from physical beauty—that could possibly captivate someone like Julian.

Particularly considering how Julian had been utterly repulsed when Isabella drugged Alexander into marriage.

The drastic shift in his attitude—to the point of falling for her—defied understanding.

But now...

Recalling what she'd witnessed days earlier in the parking lot...

Discovering that NovaTech had been co-founded by Isabella and Nathaniel...

Realizing the Luminar programming language she'd long admired was developed under Isabella's leadership...

Remembering how affectionately Isabella had addressed Vivian...

Knowing Isabella played a significant role in NovaTech's success and revenue generation...

And piecing together all the fragments about Isabella's connection to NovaTech over the past six months—she finally understood exactly what Julian saw in Isabella.

In truth, Julian had likely known for ages that Isabella was Frederick's protégé.

He'd probably been aware of her NovaTech involvement all along.

Yet despite this knowledge, he'd never breathed a word to her.

She remembered her tireless efforts to impress him—her desperate hopes of gaining Frederick's notice.

How often she'd expressed admiration for Luminar's creator.

Now she felt like nothing more than a pitiful fool.

Absolutely ridiculous.

Clutching her handbag until her knuckles whitened, Victoria bit her lip hard to maintain composure.

Still, tears of humiliation shimmered in her eyes.

The realization struck her—Julian's romantic feelings for her had long since faded, quietly transferring entirely to Isabella.

These thoughts raced through her mind in mere seconds.

Alexander noticed her sudden stillness.

Turning to speak, he caught her unusually pale expression.

He paused.

"Are you unwell? You've gone quite pale."

At this, Oliver and Julian also turned to look.

Victoria's grip on her handbag had turned her fingers bloodless.

After a moment to collect herself, she forced a faint smile.

"It's nothing."

###Chapter 463

To maintain appearances, Victoria forced herself to behave normally, engaging in lively conversation with Alexander, Julian, and Oliver throughout the evening.

When she returned home, Diana and Penelope were chatting on the sofa.

"Victoria," Penelope called out between bites of watermelon, "has Mrs. Whitmore regained consciousness yet?"

Victoria shook her head.

"Not yet."

"Really?" Penelope frowned.

"Do the doctors have any estimate?"

Another shake of Victoria's head made both Penelope and Beatrice exchange worried glances.

They'd learned about Eleanor's sudden hospitalization shortly after the ambulance arrived.

This development had prompted Alexander to postpone his divorce from Isabella - news he'd immediately shared with Victoria.

Divorce proceedings during a family medical crisis would appear unseemly to outsiders.

While they understood Alexander's reasoning, it didn't make the delay any less frustrating.

If Eleanor hadn't collapsed, Alexander and Isabella could have finalized their divorce within days.

Now, with Eleanor still unconscious, the timeline became uncertain.

Diana remained optimistic.

She patted her daughter's shoulder with a reassuring smile.

"Whether Mrs. Whitmore wakes tomorrow or next month, it changes nothing. You and Alexander will marry regardless. This is merely a temporary delay - like fine wine needing more time to mature. Why are you more anxious than the bride-to-be?"

Penelope blinked, then chuckled.

"You're right."

Her expression darkened.

"I just hate that Isabella still gets to call herself Alexander's wife."

Normally, Victoria would remain composed when such topics arose, projecting serene confidence about her relationship with Alexander.

But tonight...

As Penelope and Diana continued talking, Victoria kept her eyes downcast, remaining silent.

When the conversation lulled, she murmured, "I'm exhausted. I'll retire early."

Penelope, oblivious to her distress, cheerfully replied, "Sleep well, Victoria!"

Eleanor, however, noticed the tension in her daughter's posture.

Days earlier, Victoria had overheard disturbing truths about Isabella in the parking garage.

Though Eleanor had sensed something amiss then, Victoria's silence and Eleanor's urgent trip out of town had prevented further discussion.

Now, attributing Victoria's odd behavior to fatigue, Eleanor simply nodded.

"Rest well, dear."

Meanwhile, as Isabella finished organizing her desk, Nathaniel entered her office with a stack of embossed invitations.

"The anniversary preparations are complete," he announced, placing them before her.

"These are for your personal distribution."

Isabella accepted them with a grateful smile.

"Thank you."

Nathaniel waved off her gratitude.

"No thanks necessary between us."

He hesitated before adding, "We've sent invitations to NovaTech as well. Given the circumstances..."

Isabella nodded calmly.

"It's perfectly appropriate. I understand completely."

###Chapter 464

Isabella left the corporate headquarters and returned to the Whitmore estate, but Sophia was nowhere to be found.

She'd apparently gone to accompany Alexander at NovaTech.

Eleanor's deteriorating health weighed heavily on Isabella's mind, leaving her restless.

For several consecutive days, she made dawn visits to the medical center to monitor Eleanor's condition.

Sometimes Alexander would be present, other times it would be Catherine and Victoria.

While Catherine didn't approve of Isabella as her daughter-in-law, she maintained polite gratitude whenever Isabella came to check on Eleanor.

Victoria had never warmed to Isabella either, but with divorce proceedings imminent between Isabella and Alexander, she saw no purpose in further criticism.

Their recent interactions had been notably free of her usual biting remarks.

That particular morning when Isabella arrived at the medical center, the Whitmore siblings - Victoria, Alexander, and Henry - were all present with Catherine.

After examining Eleanor's charts, Isabella turned to leave when Alexander rose abruptly.

"Let me walk you out."

"No need."

Her refusal came crisp and final as she exited without so much as a backward glance.

Alexander didn't press the matter.

Victoria had been traveling extensively and realized this marked their first encounter in weeks prior to Eleanor's hospitalization.

Watching Isabella's retreating figure show none of her former affection for Alexander, Victoria remarked dryly, "She's clearly moved on."

Alexander offered a faint smile in response when his phone interrupted with an insistent ring.

Meanwhile, Isabella proceeded directly to Sterling Heights after leaving the medical center.

Around midday, she and several associates prepared to venture out for lunch.

As the elevator doors parted on the ground level, they nearly collided with Victoria Kensington approaching from the lobby.

Though not a regular visitor to Sterling Heights, Victoria's frequent enough appearances meant most staff recognized her - and everyone knew she was Alexander's current romantic interest.

The employees offered respectful greetings appropriate to her status.

"Ms. Kensington."

Victoria hadn't anticipated encountering Isabella.

Their eyes met briefly before Victoria averted her gaze, fingers tightening around her designer handbag.

Responding to the warm welcomes with practiced grace, Victoria offered polite smiles and nods before brushing past Isabella into the waiting elevator.

Moments later, she arrived at the executive floor where Benjamin and Daniel greeted her courteously.

"Ms. Kensington."

She reciprocated with a professional smile before knocking and entering Alexander's office.

Finding him still immersed in paperwork despite the hour, her expression softened genuinely.

"Still working through lunch?"

Alexander glanced up.

"Almost finished."

Though he'd returned to Fairview days earlier, this marked his first full day back at Sterling Heights - other obligations had consumed his schedule until now.

Victoria approached, noticing the embossed invitation in his hand.

She leaned closer, curiosity piqued.

"What's this?"

Alexander turned the card toward her.

"NovaTech's decade anniversary gala invitation. It arrived days ago but I'm only now reviewing it."

Victoria's smile faltered momentarily.

Noticing her reaction, Alexander studied her face.

"Something wrong?"

Victoria quickly composed herself with a strained smile.

"NovaTech... Has it really been ten years already?"

Alexander nodded.

"Time flies."

Victoria watched him intently, her grip on her purse turning white-knuckled.

After a measured pause, she ventured, "Will you be attending?"

"Of course," Alexander replied without hesitation.

"Given our current partnership with NovaTech, I'd make time even if my schedule were packed."

Victoria offered a tight-lipped smile.

"I see..."

###Chapter 465

Alexander's voice was calm as he extended the invitation.

"Would you care to join me?"

Victoria instinctively opened her mouth to decline.

The words "I'm not sure I'll be available" hovered on her lips.

But remembering how out of character that would sound, she caught herself mid-breath.

"Of course," she amended with forced brightness.

She moved toward the sitting area when a document on Alexander's desk caught her eye.

Her steps faltered.

Noticing her hesitation, Alexander picked up the file.

"NovaTech is developing a new large-scale model. This contains research on their Luminar programming language and two flagship projects."

His fingers tapped the cover.

"Fascinating work, really. They've made significant breakthroughs. You might find it educational."

In different circumstances, such an offer would have thrilled Victoria.

She would have eagerly accepted the materials, hungry for knowledge.

Now, her smile felt brittle.

She took the documents with stiff fingers.

"Thank you."

A thought struck her.

"But if we're only beginning to study NovaTech's technology now..."

She chose her words carefully.

"Won't the market have moved on by the time we develop something comparable? Technology evolves so rapidly these days."

"True," Alexander conceded.

"But we're not looking to replicate NovaTech. We aim to extract their core innovations and build upon them."

Victoria nodded mechanically.

"That makes sense."

Alexander's eyes lit with rare enthusiasm.

"What NovaTech has created isn't fleeting. Take Luminar - it took years for the industry to recognize its value."

He leaned forward.

"As for their recent projects? Even with today's rapid advancements, I estimate competitors will need at least three years to match them."

His admiration for NovaTech's accomplishments was palpable.

Victoria felt ice forming in her chest.

Alexander had always valued brilliance above all else.

If he ever discovered Isabella was behind Luminar's development...

Worse still, those two projects had launched shortly after Isabella joined NovaTech.

The timing suggested she'd led them personally...

Victoria's gaze flickered to Alexander, now engrossed in another file.

Her grip tightened on the documents until her knuckles whitened.

That evening at the Kensington estate, dinner began pleasantly enough.

Laughter and light conversation filled the dining room.

Then the television news featured a segment about NovaTech.

Victoria froze mid-bite.

On screen, Harrison Montgomery was being interviewed about his company's partnership with NovaTech.

"The collaboration has exceeded all expectations," he declared.

"Issues that plagued us for months were resolved within weeks. We've had numerous overseas firms express interest in working with NovaTech as well."

The mood at the table darkened instantly.

Since NovaTech had secured the smart city project the Kensingtons coveted, resentment toward the company had festered in both families.

Despite being in early development stages, NovaTech already had new partnerships forming.

Meanwhile, the Kensington Group and their tech division remained stagnant.

Reginald Kensington, already stressed about company matters, pushed his plate away with a clatter.

He massaged his temples, appetite gone.

###Chapter 466

Genevieve pursed her lips and let out a derisive laugh.

"Biting off more than they can chew with all these massive projects—let's see if NovaTech doesn't choke on them."

But even as the words left her mouth, they rang hollow, dripping with envy rather than conviction.

If NovaTech dared take on such an ambitious workload, they clearly had the resources to back it up.

Beside her, Reginald Kensington's expression mirrored his daughter's bitterness.

The Kensington family's tech enterprise and InnovaTech had been hitting roadblock after roadblock, while NovaTech's progress seemed unstoppable.

"How does Nathaniel Graves keep finding such exceptional talent?" Reginald grumbled under his breath.

Ever since NovaTech rose to prominence, both their competitors had tried poaching their engineers.

But with NovaTech's skyrocketing reputation, every major corporation—domestic and international—had joined the bidding war.

The Kensingtons and InnovaTech found themselves outmatched in this fierce competition.

Despite offering generous compensation packages, luring away top-tier innovators proved nearly impossible.

The fact that NovaTech continued releasing groundbreaking innovations despite constant poaching attempts only proved their deep bench of brilliant minds.

This realization burned like acid in their throats.

Victoria Kensington kept her head down, pushing food around her plate in silence.

Both families had pinned their hopes on her technical expertise, but the deeper she delved into the industry, the more she understood the staggering difficulty of true innovation.

When she offered no solutions, no one pressed her—they assumed she too was frustrated by InnovaTech's stagnation.

The next morning, Isabella Sinclair entered the conference room for her scheduled meeting.

Moments after she took her seat, Nathaniel Graves arrived.

Before the meeting commenced, he leaned toward her and murmured, "My mother mentioned an interesting auction coming up. They're selling a rare, flawless diamond—one of a kind."

Isabella froze.

"Are you certain?"

"Absolutely."

Nathaniel remembered because years ago, when they'd first met—barely acquaintances then—a similar diamond had gone to auction with a starting bid exceeding two hundred million.

Isabella had been sixteen.

That was when he'd learned about her family situation.

She'd confessed wanting to buy her mother the diamond because Evelyn Sinclair adored them—especially the rarest, most exquisite specimens.

Perhaps, just perhaps, such a treasure might help rouse her mother from her catatonic state.

But diamonds of that caliber were nearly impossible to acquire.

Back then, the Sinclair family finances couldn't stretch to such astronomical sums.

Besides, the notion that a gemstone could heal Evelyn had always been Isabella's desperate hope, not a medical certainty.

Who would gamble their entire fortune on such a fragile chance?

Her younger cousins had still been children, and the family business barely stayed afloat.

So Isabella had watched helplessly as that opportunity slipped away.

Over a decade had passed.

Now another legendary diamond had surfaced—this time from a private collection, carrying centuries of provenance.

If they missed this chance, another might not appear in their lifetime.

Isabella's pulse quickened.

"I want to go."

Even if the diamond didn't perform miracles, if it brought her mother a moment of joy—even just to hold and admire—that would be enough.

She wouldn't regret it.

###Chapter 467

On the opposite side of the room, Victoria handed her mother a crisp envelope.

"Mother, the invitation you requested."

Eleanor Kensington's eyes lit up as she tucked it into her designer clutch.

"Marvelous. Do convey my gratitude to Alexander."

"Neither of us will be attending tomorrow's event," Victoria stated plainly.

Eleanor's perfectly manicured fingers stilled.

"I see."

The night of the prestigious auction arrived.

Isabella Sinclair made her entrance alongside her aunt Caroline, their heels clicking against the marble floors.

At the registration desk, their paths crossed with Eleanor and Beatrice Kensington.

Recognition flashed across Eleanor's face when she spotted Isabella.

Her lips pursed slightly.

This wasn't just any auction - the starting bids exceeded what most elite families could afford.

Only the crème de la crème of global society had received invitations.

Without Alexander's influence, the Kensingtons wouldn't have secured seats.

But Isabella...

Given Nathaniel Graves' current prominence and their connection, obtaining an invitation would've been effortless.

The thought made Eleanor turn away pointedly.

Their premium seats, courtesy of Alexander, placed them near the front.

Fate, it seemed, had a sense of humor - Isabella and Caroline were seated directly beside them.

Just as they settled in, Oliver Westbrook arrived.

His step faltered when he noticed Isabella.

Then he saw Eleanor beside her.

A quiet "oh dear" escaped his lips.

This was social dynamite waiting to explode.

After seating his companion, Oliver immediately texted Alexander: "Isabella's at the diamond auction. Sitting right next to your future mother-in-law!"

The reply came swiftly: "Noted."

Nothing more.

Complete indifference.

Oliver blinked at his phone.

When he glanced back, Isabella caught his gaze and deliberately looked away, her expression unreadable.

Eleanor, however, offered a polite nod.

"Mr. Westbrook."

He returned an awkward smile.

"Mrs. Kensington..."

Moments later, Dominic Fairchild arrived.

His seat happened to be beside Caroline's.

He ignored Isabella completely, and she returned the favor, treating him like invisible air.

Still, like Oliver, he acknowledged Eleanor with polite deference.

The auction commenced with a parade of luxury items - each carrying price tags starting in the tens of millions.

Isabella remained disinterested until the main event.

When the legendary diamond was unveiled, the entire room gasped.

Even Isabella, who typically didn't fawn over jewels, found herself mesmerized by its unparalleled brilliance.

Eleanor, a self-proclaimed connoisseur, was rendered speechless.

She'd owned countless exquisite pieces, but nothing compared to this masterpiece.

Her gaze remained locked on the display case.

"Starting bid - four hundred million," announced the auctioneer.

Paddles shot up immediately.

Isabella's was among them.

Eleanor's head snapped toward her in shock.

She'd assumed Isabella was merely spectating - admiring what she couldn't possibly afford.

The realization that she was actually bidding...

"Five hundred million," Isabella declared coolly.

The number hung in the air as Eleanor's carefully maintained composure faltered for the first time that evening.

###Chapter 468

The moment Isabella Sinclair opened her mouth, not just Eleanor Kensington, but Beatrice Kensington, Dominic Fairchild, and Oliver Westbrook all froze in shock.

Beatrice's reaction was predictable.

As for Dominic, he'd done some background checks on Isabella before and knew her family came from modest means.

While the Sinclair family business had seen recent improvements, they were nowhere near the league where they could casually drop hundreds of millions on a single diamond.

Oliver, who prided himself on knowing Isabella's situation inside out, mentally calculated the Sinclair family's current assets.

Even scraping together 100 million in liquid cash would be challenging for them - let alone 500 million.

Though Alexander Whitmore had once gifted Isabella two billion as a token of gratitude, that money had been used to stabilize the Sinclair family's financial situation.

Even if their business was thriving now, and even if she still had a substantial portion of that two billion left, wasn't spending this obscene amount on a single diamond... excessive?

His fingers flew across his phone screen as he texted Alexander in excitement.

"Just spotted your wife at the auction house. Was wondering what she's doing here. Now I get it... You know about the Aurora Diamond going up for bid, right? Starting price was 400 million, and she just jumped it to 500 million. Is she seriously planning to buy that thing? Holy sh-"

Before Oliver could finish typing, another bid came in at 550 million.

Then Isabella's clear voice cut through the auction hall again.

"700 million."

Oliver's jaw dropped.

He hit send anyway, shooting off the half-finished message to Alexander.

Everyone in attendance tonight had expected this rare blue diamond to fetch at least a billion.

But Isabella's bidding style - leaping in increments of 100 to 150 million - had the price skyrocketing to 700 million in just three rounds.

The entire venue turned to stare at the unknown woman with the bottomless pockets.

Most attendees were either wives or daughters of high society's elite.

While they might not know each other personally, they at least recognized faces.

This unfamiliar woman throwing around money like confetti had everyone whispering, trying to place her identity.

The bidding war continued.

Each time a new offer came in, Isabella countered immediately, pushing the price to one billion with her next bid.

Seeing her ruthless determination, Eleanor suddenly understood - Isabella wasn't here to play.

She was here to win.

The older woman's lips pressed into a bloodless line.

Oliver, now thoroughly dazed, checked his phone.

Alexander still hadn't replied to his first message.

Unable to contain himself, he fired off another: "Your wife just pushed bidding to one billion. Damn, she's dead serious about getting that rock. Since when was she into diamonds?"

This time, Alexander responded almost immediately.

A single punctuation mark: "."

Oliver blinked at his screen.

What the hell was that supposed to mean?

Initially, dozens had shown interest in the auction.

But as prices climbed beyond reasonable investment returns, most dropped out.

Some present had deeper pockets than Isabella, but their wealth came with strings attached - they couldn't spend with the same reckless freedom she displayed.

By the time bids hit 1.6 billion, only two determined parties remained in the game.

###Chapter 469

The diamond ultimately went to Isabella.

Oliver had braced himself for this outcome, yet the official announcement still left him reeling.

He watched in disbelief as Isabella and Caroline moved to complete the transaction.

Only then did he snap out of his daze and message Alexander.

"Isabella just spent 1.8 billion on the diamond..."

A single word came in reply.

"Okay."

That was it?

Just... okay?

Oliver frowned at his screen.

"What did that earlier message you sent mean?"

Alexander must have been occupied.

Several minutes passed before his response arrived.

"It meant mind your own business."

Oliver stared at the words, utterly speechless.

He'd only been trying to share the shocking news.

Perhaps to prove her marriage to Alexander hadn't been about money, Isabella had always dressed modestly during their time together.

Her transformation was staggering.

Eleanor and Beatrice sat equally stunned by Isabella's extravagant purchase.

They remained motionless long after the gavel fell.

It was only when Dominic rose to leave and approached to greet them that Eleanor finally stirred.

Beatrice seemed to recall something suddenly.

"That diamond... she must have bought it for her, right?"

She didn't need to specify who.

Eleanor knew immediately she meant Evelyn.

Everyone remembered Evelyn's passion for diamonds, particularly one exceptionally valuable stone she'd owned years earlier.

The memory made Eleanor lower her gaze.

After completing the paperwork, Isabella and Caroline prepared to depart.

Isabella's bold move had drawn considerable attention from other attendees.

Beyond Oliver, Dominic, and Eleanor's group, several others at the auction recognized Isabella.

While she finalized her purchase, many had already begun investigating her background.

They discovered her family circumstances were actually quite ordinary and that she was currently dating Nathaniel.

Nathaniel came from a prosperous family.

With NovaTech's rising success, he had become both a sought-after elite in their circles and an "ideal son-in-law" in the eyes of many wealthy families.

The prevailing assumption was that Isabella had relied on Nathaniel's financial backing to secure the diamond.

This realization caused many who had initially wanted to approach her to quickly abandon the idea.

However, those who had worked with NovaTech or sought to build connections with Nathaniel still approached her.

Isabella understood their motives perfectly.

After exchanging brief pleasantries, she found an excuse to leave.

Many members of the Kensington and Sinclair families had been intensely interested in the diamond.

They desperately wanted to see it in person, but with only one invitation among them, attendance had been impossible.

When Beatrice and Eleanor returned, Genevieve immediately rushed over.

"Aunt Beatrice, who won the diamond?"

"What was the final price?"

As she asked, Victoria and Diana, along with others, turned expectantly toward Eleanor.

Their curiosity was palpable.

After a brief pause, Eleanor responded.

"The final price was 1.8 billion."

"And the winner was... Isabella."

"W-What?" Genevieve stammered, certain she had misheard.

Diana and Beatrice reacted with similar shock.

Diana's expression darkened instantly.

"Her?"

"How could it possibly be her?" Genevieve exclaimed.

"Where would she get that kind of money?"

Victoria also froze upon hearing the astronomical price and Isabella's name.

After a moment, she simply lowered her head and silently studied the teacup in her hands.


###Chapter 470

At the Sinclair estate, Isabella had already discussed the upcoming diamond auction with Margaret before attending.

Gazing at the dazzling gem Isabella had acquired at great expense, Margaret remained silent for a long moment before finally speaking.

"Your mother did have a profound love for diamonds... but if they truly possess any power, they could either restore her sanity or push her further into madness."

She paused, her expression thoughtful.

"So... Bella, safeguard the diamond for now."

She continued, her voice measured.

"Regarding its use in your mother's treatment, let's observe how her condition progresses first."

Isabella had indeed considered this possibility herself.

She found her grandmother's reasoning sound.

Yet such rare diamonds were exceptionally difficult to obtain.

If she let this opportunity slip, who knew when another might arise?

Besides, financial constraints weren't an issue currently.

Even without immediate use, she proceeded with the purchase.

Hearing her grandmother's words, she simply responded, "Very well."

She hadn't visited Evelyn at the medical facility for several days.

The following morning, she decided to go.

She arrived quite early, yet when she reached the hospital, both Alexander and Oliver were already present.

Richard, however, was noticeably absent.

When she knocked and entered, both men turned toward her.

Isabella offered Alexander a brief nod of acknowledgment before moving directly to check on Evelyn.

Seeing Isabella completely disregard him, Oliver widened his eyes and muttered to Alexander, "She really doesn't acknowledge anyone's presence anymore, does she?"

Alexander settled into his seat and responded with a noncommittal hum.

Then he added, "And?"

Oliver didn't answer.

A short while later, Isabella emerged from the private room.

But she didn't depart immediately.

Instead, she looked at Alexander and inquired, "How has Grandmother been these past two days?"

Alexander poured a glass of water and approached to offer it to her.

Isabella shook her head, indicating she didn't want it.

Alexander didn't insist and set the glass aside before replying, "She's shown some improvement."

"According to the medical team, she might regain consciousness within the next few days."

"Understood," Isabella said.

With that, she prepared to leave.

Just then, Alexander mentioned, "Sophia's away for training."

"She returns tomorrow."

She wasn't particularly interested in Sophia's whereabouts.

But since Oliver was present, his eyes shifting between her and Alexander with unmistakable curiosity, she chose not to engage.

She simply offered a brief "Noted" before turning and walking away without a backward glance.

Oliver watched her departure, only turning away once her figure vanished from view.

He then looked at Alexander and remarked, "I've noticed... since you two began divorce proceedings, your dynamic actually seems more harmonious than before."

Alexander, typing on his laptop, didn't glance up.

He offered an ambiguous response, "Is that so?"

Most couples tore each other apart during divorces.

What was happening between these two was rather unusual.

Oliver didn't voice that thought aloud.

He suddenly remembered something and said, "Regardless, you two have Sophia between you."

"Though she made mistakes in the past, that's all behind us now."

He continued carefully, "Since she's moved on, and if you can also let things go for Sophia's sake, then..."

"There isn't some irreparable hatred between you."

"For Sophia's benefit, perhaps maintaining a civil relationship moving forward isn't such a bad idea..."

Alexander remained silent.

Oliver studied him, uncertain of his thoughts.

But since Alexander didn't respond, Oliver couldn't press further—so he simply fell quiet.


###Chapter 471

Alexander had been occupied the entire time, leaving no room to entertain Oliver.

After sitting idly for a while, Oliver grew restless.

"Fine then, I'll go find Julian instead," he announced.

Without glancing up, Alexander replied coolly, "Do you really believe Julian has time for you?"

Oliver fell silent.

True to Alexander's prediction, when Oliver arrived at Montgomery Enterprises, Julian was indeed swamped with work.

Seeing that Julian was equally unavailable for conversation, Oliver couldn't help but remark, "Surely you have time for lunch at least?"

Julian turned a page in his document and responded, "I have a lunch date scheduled."

Oliver's interest was immediately piqued.

"Your mother is still setting you up on blind dates?"

"I heard the last one became completely infatuated after just one meeting."

"How did that situation resolve itself?"

"Has she finally given up?"

Before Julian could answer, his secretary entered carrying an extravagant bouquet, looking slightly uncomfortable.

"Mr. Montgomery, these are from that young lady again."

"I tried to refuse them, but the delivery person insisted..."

Julian responded indifferently, "Understood."

"Dispose of them as you see fit."

"You may leave."

"Yes, sir."

After the secretary departed, Oliver raised an eyebrow with an amused smile.

"Nothing happened these past couple days, so I assumed she'd moved on."

"But apparently..."

He couldn't resist adding, "Honestly, that heiress from Hunt Corporation—her looks, education, family background, personality—she's supposedly flawless."

"What exactly don't you find appealing about her?"

Julian paused, turning to give him a sharp glance filled with clear disdain.

"Did you come all this way just to gossip?"

Oliver chuckled.

"You're only realizing that now?"

"Keep talking and I'll have security escort you out."

"Seriously though," Oliver pressed on.

"I've met Ms. Hunt personally."

"She's genuinely impressive."

"You're really not even slightly interested?"

Seeing the dangerous look in Julian's eyes, Oliver quickly added, "I just think, well, you're not getting any younger."

"It's understandable your mother is concerned."

"But if you don't like Ms. Hunt, then what type of woman do you prefer?"

"Tell me, I can introduce you to someone—"

Julian set down his pen.

"One more word and you're leaving."

Oliver immediately closed his mouth.

Fine.

Recognizing that Julian had reached his limit, Oliver decided not to push further.

"Alright, you're busy at noon, but you must be free for dinner?"

"Not available."

"What? You're not actually angry, are you?"

Julian paused before saying, "I'm heading to NovaTech later."

"I already have evening plans."

Oliver assumed Julian meant business-related matters, probably having dinner with Nathaniel and the others after their meeting.

Since it involved official business, he didn't insist further and left feeling somewhat disappointed.

Around three in the afternoon, Julian arrived at NovaTech.

When Isabella learned of his arrival, she set aside her work and went to greet him.

The moment Julian saw her, he immediately rose from the sofa.

"It's been a while."

Isabella nodded.

"It has."

Indeed, considerable time had passed since their last meeting.

Truthfully, this matter didn't require Julian's personal presence.

But he had made the trip specifically to see her.

Isabella hadn't expected him to come personally either.

Still, she didn't dwell on it—simply assuming it indicated his serious commitment to their collaboration.

Kieran only discovered later that Julian had come to NovaTech.

Needing to speak with Isabella urgently, he went to the meeting room to find her.

Julian had been smiling and conversing pleasantly with Isabella, but the moment Kieran entered, his smile noticeably faded.

Kieran's gaze toward Julian also carried a distinct chill.

However, considering Isabella wasn't officially divorced yet, and that both he and Julian had feelings for her, he saw no point in openly displaying their rivalry at this moment.

So, he looked away and focused on discussing work matters with Isabella.


###Chapter 472

Isabella finished her tasks and noticed Kieran hadn't departed.

He was observing Julian with a thoughtful expression.

Unsure if they had private matters to discuss, she inquired, "Is something the matter?"

Kieran had previously noticed Julian's affection for Isabella, though he hadn't acted on it.

After today's interaction, it was evident Julian's feelings remained strong and he wasn't planning to retreat.

Kieran quickly deduced Julian likely knew Isabella wasn't yet divorced—and probably knew exactly who her husband was.

The thought crossed his mind to probe Julian for information about Alexander.

But remembering Julian's piercing gaze earlier, Kieran realized even if he had the information, he wouldn't willingly share it.

Moreover, asking would reveal his own lack of knowledge about Isabella's personal life...

The risk wasn't worth it, and Kieran never acted impulsively.

Having reached this conclusion, he averted his gaze and offered a light smile.

"It's nothing."

"I have some matters to attend to, so I'll take my leave now."

Isabella responded, "Very well."

Julian had noticed Kieran's intense scrutiny but couldn't read his exact thoughts.

However, from Kieran's determined expression, he recognized a formidable rival for Isabella's affection.

After Kieran departed, Julian chuckled casually.

"That's the Blackwood heir, correct?"

"I'd heard he was rather spoiled and reckless, but after several interactions, he seems quite dedicated to his work."

Isabella, assuming casual conversation, replied, "He's very serious about his responsibilities."

"He never complains about working late or coming in early."

"More importantly, he possesses genuine talent."

"Overall, he's quite impressive."

After learning about Kieran's background, Isabella had initially assumed he joined NovaTech on a whim.

His sustained dedication had surprised her.

Daily collaboration felt surprisingly comfortable—quite different from their first encounter.

Though Julian seemed to praise Kieran, he was subtly probing Isabella's feelings toward him.

Hearing her positive assessment, Julian smiled inwardly.

He'd heard Kieran returned to the country specifically because he admired NovaTech's programming language Luminar and joined because of it.

Which meant—he'd also returned for Isabella.

From how Kieran looked at Isabella during their work discussion, Julian recognized profound professional admiration.

In fact, it bordered on reverence.

If his guess was correct, Kieran probably still didn't know Isabella was the actual developer behind Luminar.

Even without that knowledge, she had already captivated him purely through her abilities.

If Kieran ever discovered Isabella was the very person he sought, wouldn't his admiration intensify...

Based on her response, Isabella clearly held a favorable opinion of Kieran.

In that context, Kieran remaining at NovaTech seemed an effective strategy to win her affection.

Especially with her divorce from Alexander nearing finalization—well, there's a saying about proximity fostering connection.

After concluding business, Julian invited Isabella to dinner.

She accepted.

As they exited the meeting room, they encountered Kieran leaning casually against the doorway.

Seeing Isabella and Julian together didn't surprise him at all.

He seemed to have anticipated Julian would use work as pretext for dinner.

His presence suggested he'd been waiting for precisely this moment.


###Chapter 473

Kieran’s sudden appearance didn’t seem confrontational.

He wasn’t there to interfere or stir up trouble intentionally.

His gaze settled on Isabella, his tone casual and familiar.

“Having dinner with Mr. Montgomery?”

Isabella responded with a simple, “Yes.”

“You’ll be returning to the office later, I assume?”

“I have matters to attend to,” she confirmed.

Kieran gave a slight nod.

“Alright.”

“I’ll find you at the office then.”

Without another word, he turned and walked away.

Julian understood the subtle provocation in Kieran’s demeanor.

It was a clear message: Julian had to work hard for Isabella’s attention, while Kieran moved freely in her world.

Kieran didn’t need tricks to be near her.

He was already part of her daily life.

Yet, Julian felt no anger or anxiety.

He remained calm and observant.

At this point, Isabella showed no romantic interest in either of them.

They were essentially in the same position—neither ahead of the other.

If anything, Julian wished she would show some emotion.

Any hint of feeling, whether for him or Kieran, would be better than this neutrality.

At least it would mean she cared.

He had already informed Isabella that Lily was now under her grandmother’s care.

It had been some time since they last heard about her.

Once they were seated in the restaurant’s private room, Isabella finally asked, “How is Lily doing?”

Julian’s heart warmed at her concern.

“She’s doing well,” he replied gently.

“She called a few days ago and said she misses you.”

“She wants to come back and visit.”

Isabella smiled softly.

“I’d like that.”

After a brief pause, Julian added, “I also heard Sophia’s training has been going exceptionally well.”

“She’s likely to achieve something significant in the upcoming competition.”

At the mention of Sophia, Isabella’s expression shifted slightly.

She lowered her gaze, offering a quiet hum in response.

Before she could say more, the door to the private room swung open abruptly.

“Julian!”

The voice was unmistakable.

Julian’s expression darkened instantly.

Isabella, however, remained perfectly composed.

Genevieve stood frozen at the doorway, her eyes widening in shock when she noticed Isabella.

“What are you doing here?” she blurted out.

Isabella ignored her, maintaining her calm demeanor.

Julian’s voice was cold and sharp.

“What are you doing here, Genevieve?”

Though he had always been distant, this level of iciness was new.

Genevieve was taken aback, rendered speechless by his tone.

“I—I just…” she stammered, her confidence crumbling.

“Genevieve, mind your manners,” interjected Diana and Beatrice as they approached.

They, too, were surprised to see Isabella, but they knew NovaTech and Julian maintained a strong professional relationship.

A business dinner wasn’t entirely unexpected.

Diana offered a polite smile.

“Our apologies, Julian.”

“Genevieve shouldn’t have interrupted your meal.”

As elders, Julian afforded them basic respect.

“It’s alright,” he said curtly.

But toward Genevieve, he showed no leniency.

“Ms. Kensington,” he stated firmly, “we are not acquainted well enough for such interruptions.”

“I expect this won’t happen again.”

“Is that clear?”

His words were a direct and public rejection.

Genevieve had genuine feelings for Julian.

Hearing his firm dismissal, especially in front of Isabella, brought tears to her eyes.

“I—I didn’t mean to…” she choked out, her voice trembling.

But Julian’s resolve didn’t waver.

He decided to make himself perfectly clear.

“If I’m not mistaken, Ms. Kensington, you seem to have certain… expectations regarding me.”

“Let me be unequivocal: there is no possibility of a relationship between us.”

“I expect you to respect that boundary moving forward.”


###Chapter 474

Diana and Beatrice were taken aback by Julian's firm rejection of Genevieve right before their eyes.

Though he had always maintained impeccable manners toward the Kensington family, his refusal was unexpectedly direct.

Diana still harbored hopes for a union between Genevieve and Julian.

She offered a conciliatory smile, attempting to smooth things over while keeping options open.

"This was indeed Genevieve's mistake."

"We'll have a serious talk with her later."

"Our apologies for interrupting your meeting."

"Perhaps we could have Victoria bring Genevieve another day to offer a proper apology—"

Julian cut her off, seeing straight through her intentions.

"That won't be necessary."

He paused briefly, his gaze flickering almost imperceptibly toward Isabella before continuing.

"When it comes to matters of the heart..."

He allowed a half-second silence to hang in the air.

"...They cannot be forced."

"Ms. Kensington and I are not suited for each other."

"I hope you can help persuade her—not to waste her time and future on me."

His words left no room for misunderstanding.

Diana glanced at Isabella, who had remained detached throughout the entire exchange, calmly sipping her tea.

She couldn't shake the feeling that Isabella was silently amused by the Kensington family's humiliation.

Her smile tightened.

She forced a dry laugh.

"You're absolutely right."

"I'll speak with Genevieve properly."

"Thank you, Mrs. Kensington," Julian responded with polite finality.

Genevieve had already fled in humiliation much earlier.

Once Diana and Beatrice departed and the door closed again, Julian resumed his seat.

"My apologies for wasting your time," he said to Isabella.

Ever since recognizing Genevieve's feelings for him, he had always made his lack of interest clear.

Yet Genevieve showed no signs of retreating.

He had attempted to address it directly multiple times, but each occasion ended with her pretending not to understand before quickly escaping.

Today finally presented a rare opportunity for a one-on-one meeting with Isabella.

He refused to let Genevieve's dramatics consume valuable time.

Her persistent disregard for boundaries and willful ignorance had finally exhausted his patience.

Knowing Victoria had taken Alexander from Isabella, he understood the delicate and strained relationship between the Kensington, Sinclair, and Whitmore families.

The terminated contract between NovaTech and Luminar had only deepened the rift between Isabella and the Kensingtons.

Additionally, Genevieve had always openly displayed her dislike for Isabella.

Under these circumstances, being brutally honest in front of Isabella was the most effective way to make Genevieve surrender her pursuit.

Considering all factors, he decided to lay everything out plainly.

Isabella offered a gentle smile.

"It's quite alright."

Julian hesitated momentarily before adding, "I apologize, earlier I—"

He didn't complete his sentence, but Isabella understood his meaning perfectly.

She responded with a faint smile.

"It's fine."

"Besides, what you said was true."

She had learned this lesson through personal experience—love truly couldn't be forced.

Now she could accept this truth with peaceful resignation.

Perhaps Julian had sensed this about her, which was why he spoke so candidly.

That had been his precise intention.

Still, even though she had moved on from the past, hearing someone reference it inevitably stirred unpleasant memories.

Thus, he felt compelled to apologize.

Isabella had no desire to dwell on bygones and smoothly changed the subject.

Julian studied her flawless, delicate features.

His heart stirred with unspoken words, but remembering her unresolved marital status, he restrained himself and followed her conversational lead.


###Chapter 475

Two days later, at noon, Isabella and Alexander were heading to the cafeteria for lunch when her phone suddenly rang.

It was a call from Alexander.

Isabella saw the caller ID and hesitated briefly before answering.

"Hello?"

"Grandma's awake."

Joy surged through Isabella's heart.

She responded, "I'll be right there."

"Alright."

After ending the call, she turned to Kieran, who stood waiting beside her.

"Sorry, something urgent came up—I can't join you for lunch."

Kieran glanced at her phone screen, recognizing the importance of the call.

"No problem."

Isabella nodded and hurried away.

When she arrived at the hospital, Alexander, Sophia, Victoria, Catherine, Richard, and others were already gathered.

As she entered, Sophia rushed into her arms.

Alexander also turned to look at her, then redirected his attention to Eleanor.

"Grandma, Isabella is here."

Hearing that Isabella had arrived, Eleanor smiled weakly and tried to focus on the doorway.

Isabella stepped forward and took her hand.

"Grandma."

Eleanor gently patted her hand, attempting to speak, but before any words could form, she slipped back into unconsciousness.

Isabella panicked.

"Grandma—"

Alexander gently placed a hand on her shoulder, offering comfort.

"Grandma just woke up."

"Her condition is still unstable, and she has very little energy."

"The doctor said this is normal—nothing to worry about."

Isabella let out a sigh of relief, though Eleanor's pale complexion made her fear it might be a final rally before the end.

She asked, "What's the current situation...?"

Alexander replied, "Although her condition isn't fully stabilized yet, the doctor believes she will gradually improve."

With those words, the heavy weight on Isabella's heart finally eased.

After a while, to avoid disturbing Eleanor's rest, everyone—including Isabella and Alexander—left the ward.

Most of them, whether Victoria or Alexander, had received the news of Eleanor waking up while on their way to lunch.

None of them had eaten yet.

Richard had been particularly busy with work and had only visited Eleanor twice during her coma.

This time, he had taken extra days off to stay.

Seeing that everyone still hadn't eaten, he said to Isabella, "Since you're here too, why don't we all go eat together?"

Richard had always been occupied with work.

Whether before or after her marriage, Isabella hadn't seen much of him.

But since childhood, he had always treated her kindly.

Faced with his invitation, neither Catherine nor Victoria objected—their silence implying consent.

Over the many years of her marriage to Alexander, Isabella had gone out to eat with the Whitmore family less than three times in total.

Looking back, those occasions felt like they happened ages ago.

Since she and Alexander were already preparing for divorce, she didn't want to intrude on their family gathering.

So she said, "It's okay, I still have work to handle—maybe next time."

Everyone could tell she was politely declining.

Hearing this, Richard paused and glanced at Alexander.

Before Alexander could respond, Sophia lowered her head in disappointment, fiddling with the small plush toy in her arms.

Alexander didn't try to persuade her to stay either—he simply said, "I'll walk you out."

He wasn't just walking her out—he clearly had something to discuss.

Isabella understood and said, "Thank you."

Alexander turned to Sophia and said, "Sophia, go play with your Uncle Henry for a while."

"I'll be back soon."

"Okay," Sophia replied, though her eyes still lingered longingly on Isabella.

Isabella saw the reluctance in her gaze, paused for a moment, and then gently ruffled her hair.

"When I have time, I'll take you out to have fun."

Sophia immediately brightened up and grabbed the hand that had patted her head.

"Okay!"


###Chapter 476

Isabella and Alexander walked side by side out of the hospital room.

After putting some distance between them and the door, Isabella spoke first.

"You can say what you need to say now."

Alexander turned to look at her.

"Grandmother's condition isn't stable yet."

"I'd like to postpone our divorce for a few more days."

Isabella didn't meet his gaze.

Her expression remained unchanged, showing no surprise at his request.

After a brief silence, she responded.

"Understood."

"Thank you."

As she started to walk away, Alexander added, "Is there anything you want?"

"As a token of gratitude, I can help you with anything—or grant you a wish."

Isabella paused slightly at his offer but didn't turn around.

Her voice remained calm.

"It's fine."

"You can't give me what I want."

She realized her words might be misinterpreted—that he might think she wanted his love—so she added, "I don't mean what you think."

Alexander chuckled softly.

Standing just two steps behind her, he studied her profile.

"How do you know what I think?"

Isabella didn't know how he had interpreted her words.

Judging by his tone, he didn't seem angry.

Whatever he thought she meant, she didn't intend to explain further.

She simply walked away in silence.

Watching her retreating back, Alexander called out, "Then let's just say I owe you a favor?"

Isabella didn't stop walking.

"Suit yourself."

That evening, news of Eleanor Whitmore's awakening and the delayed divorce between Isabella and Alexander reached both the Sinclair and Kensington families.

Diana Kensington remarked, "It's better that Mrs. Whitmore woke up rather than remaining in a coma."

"Now that she's conscious, Isabella and Alexander's divorce is that much closer."

"However you look at it, this is good news."

Genevieve and Penelope silently agreed, though they didn't voice their opinions aloud.

Genevieve had been in low spirits lately after being publicly rejected by Julian Montgomery in front of Isabella days earlier, so she remained quiet.

Victoria Kensington felt the same way as the others.

In fact, compared to everyone else in both families, she was the most eager to see Isabella and Alexander officially divorce.

Despite her impatience, she had to accept Alexander's decision to delay the divorce for his grandmother's sake.

Eleanor Whitmore's awakening should have made Victoria happy—from any reasonable perspective.

But then she heard that Isabella would be going to the Whitmore Corporation tomorrow...

Last time, Isabella had only briefly demonstrated her skills at Whitmore Corporation and already gained recognition from the R&D department's core team—including Alexander himself.

If she appeared again and showcased her professional abilities once more, and if Alexander witnessed it...

The thought made Victoria lose her appetite.

She clenched her spoon as her mood darkened.

The next day, after visiting Eleanor at the hospital with Margaret Sinclair, Isabella prepared to head to Whitmore Corporation.

Alexander was also at the hospital and knew she would be going there.

By the time Isabella left, it was already late morning.

Since she didn't need to return to NovaTech, she could go straight to Whitmore Corporation.

Alexander also needed to return to the company to handle matters.

In theory, they could have gone together.

But neither of them suggested it.

Instead, they left the hospital separately, one after the other.

When Isabella arrived at Whitmore Corporation, most people were already present in the conference room.

The meeting had been underway for some time.

After Isabella finished speaking with several colleagues, she suddenly noticed Alexander had entered the conference room at some point.

She glanced at him briefly before looking away.

Noticing her confusion, the staff member sitting beside her leaned in and whispered with a smile, "Mr. Whitmore came in more than ten minutes ago."

"He wasn't supposed to attend today's meeting."

"But since he arrived, he's been sitting there watching and listening to you speak the whole time..."

"It's pretty obvious he came just to hear your presentation."

Isabella had already built a strong reputation in Whitmore Corporation's technical department.

In fact, many people from the department wanted to attend her sessions, though not everyone had access to the conference room.

Isabella said nothing in response.

The meeting continued.

After she finished another round of explanations, Alexander still showed no intention of leaving.

Just then, someone gestured outside the glass wall and leaned toward him to whisper, "Mr. Whitmore, Ms. Kensington is here."

Alexander heard the message and retracted his gaze from Isabella, looking toward the conference room entrance.

Victoria was indeed standing just outside the door.

Others in the room also noticed her presence.

Since they were on a break, someone gossiped in a low voice, "Mr. Whitmore's girlfriend came to the office to find him again."

Isabella overheard the comment but didn't react.

Seeing Victoria, Alexander stood up and left the conference room.

Walking toward her, he asked, "Didn't you say you had something to handle at InnovaTech?"

"Why did you suddenly come over?"


###Chapter 477

Victoria offered a faint smile.

"Everything was handled, so I came over."

Truthfully, she hadn't felt settled at all.

The meeting wasn't even halfway finished before she departed NovaTech.

She was aware Alexander didn't need to attend the specific meeting Isabella was in today.

Yet, just as she predicted, he had indeed come down from his office specifically to observe Isabella's presentation.

That thought left a bitter taste in her mouth.

Her expression tightened slightly.

Alexander checked his watch.

"I have a video conference starting in about ten minutes."

"It will run over an hour."

"Would you like to come upstairs with me and wait?"

"Alright," Victoria agreed.

Victoria returned to the Kensington residence that afternoon.

Diana noticed her immediately.

"You're back so early?"

"I thought you and Alexander were going out for lunch?"

"He had pressing matters to attend to," Victoria replied flatly.

"I see," Diana said, noting her daughter's weary demeanor.

Victoria kicked off her heels, intending to head upstairs and rest.

Her mother, Eleanor, observed her closely.

"Is something the matter?"

"You haven't seemed yourself lately."

Victoria paused for a brief moment.

She then answered as if it were nothing.

"It's nothing."

"Just feeling a bit tired."

Recently, NovaTech had been swamped with issues.

Their core technology still lacked any significant breakthrough.

It was understandable for her to feel strained and frustrated.

Because of this, Eleanor didn't push further.

She simply instructed a staff member to prepare some nourishing soup and told Victoria to eat something.

Penelope was already home from her outing.

When Victoria sat down beside her, she greeted her casually.

"Victoria."

Victoria responded with a noncommittal hum.

As Victoria ate her soup, Penelope cracked open some sunflower seeds.

"Oh, that reminds me."

"The Fairchild family's daughter, Eleanor, had her engagement called off by the Pembroke family."

The Fairchild and Pembroke families she mentioned were from Geneva.

Both families were considered social equals.

Eleanor Fairchild and the Pembroke family's eldest son, William, had grown up together.

Both were refined, accomplished, and reportedly shared an excellent relationship.

Eleanor was quite beautiful and academically brilliant.

While still at university, she had secured several patents, significantly boosting her family's company's standing.

The Pembroke family had always expressed great satisfaction with their future daughter-in-law.

Rumors even suggested the wedding was imminent.

Unexpectedly, the Pembroke family broke off the engagement.

Diana was instantly intrigued.

"Why was it called off so suddenly?"

"Did something happen?"

"It's rather dramatic, actually," Penelope said between seeds.

"Apparently, William cheated."

"With Eleanor's personal assistant, of all people."

"The assistant is supposedly a graduate student."

"Quite capable in her own right, though nowhere near Eleanor's professional league."

"But people say she has a much more vibrant personality."

"Unlike Eleanor, who's all business—very serious, always buried in her work."

"William is now absolutely determined to end the engagement."

"Didn't everyone say he greatly admired Eleanor before?"

"Praised her talent?"

"And she is genuinely beautiful."

"William is known for being so composed and self-disciplined."

"It's hard to picture him doing something like that..."

"Exactly!"

"But you know how men can be."

"It's not always about a woman's accomplishments or how talented she is."

"Just because you're more accomplished doesn't guarantee a man's love."

"Too true," Genevieve chimed in, her own mood lifting slightly with the gossip.

"What's the real use of a woman just being capable and talented?"

"If that's all she offers, a man will inevitably grow bored."

"William losing interest was only natural."

Victoria had been listening with only half an ear, merely passing the time.

But hearing this particular part, she suddenly paused and looked up.

Isabella was undoubtedly exceptional in her professional field.

But in virtually every other aspect, she couldn't compare to Victoria.

Even if Alexander didn't yet know Isabella was a protégé of Frederick, he was already well aware of her capabilities.

So far, he had only shown a degree of professional appreciation for her—nothing more...

Then she remembered that morning at Whitmore Industries.

From the moment Alexander learned she had arrived, he hadn't glanced at Isabella even once.

He had simply escorted her upstairs immediately.

The dark cloud that had loomed over Victoria's head for days suddenly dissipated.

A genuine smile finally touched her lips.


###Chapter 478

Isabella had been fighting a cold these past few days.

That Saturday morning, after visiting her mother Evelyn, she drove to the hospital to see Eleanor.

When she arrived, both Alexander and Sophia were already there.

Eleanor looked much better than when she had first woken up.

A warm smile immediately lit up her face when she saw Isabella.

While Isabella chatted with Eleanor, Alexander remained quiet in the background.

He poured Isabella a fresh glass of water before settling into a nearby chair.

His hands moved deftly as he peeled apples for both Sophia and Isabella.

Once the apples were peeled and neatly sliced, he arranged them on a small ceramic plate.

He offered it to Isabella with a quiet gesture.

She had no choice but to accept it gracefully.

"Thank you," she said softly.

"You're welcome," he replied calmly.

Seeing them interact so peacefully made Eleanor sigh inwardly.

Isabella had already spent considerable time with Evelyn earlier that day.

After about forty minutes with Eleanor, it was time for the older woman's meal.

Eleanor looked toward Alexander and suggested, "The staff here will take care of my lunch."

"Isabella has been visiting me daily during my hospital stay."

"Alexander, why don't you take her out for a meal?"

Isabella opened her mouth to decline, but Eleanor gently patted her hand.

"I don't mean anything by it," she assured, glancing meaningfully at Alexander.

Her expression made it clear she wasn't attempting matchmaking.

Like Oliver, Eleanor had come to realize that since the decision to divorce, they actually got along better.

She found this development quite pleasing.

With Sophia between them, even if they wouldn't remain husband and wife, maintaining a good relationship would benefit everyone involved.

Alexander turned to Isabella.

"Any preferences?"

"Perhaps something local?"

When Sophia heard they might go out to eat with Isabella, she immediately brightened.

She rushed over to clutch Isabella's hand.

"Yes! Mommy, what would you like to eat?"

Isabella hesitated for a moment before responding, "Local cuisine would be fine."

Alexander stepped away to take an incoming phone call.

While his back was turned, Eleanor lowered her voice and confided to Isabella, "I truly don't have any hidden agenda."

"It's just... since you've already let him go, and Alexander has softened his stance recently..."

"If you two can maintain a good relationship, it will be better for Sophia's future."

Given how much Alexander clearly favored Victoria, did they really believe some lingering sentiment could complicate matters between him and Victoria?

As for Sophia...

Isabella remained silent.

After exchanging a few more words with Eleanor, she left the hospital room.

Later, in the private dining room, they had just settled when Isabella's phone rang.

She excused herself to take the call outside.

While speaking on the phone, she noticed Diana and Genevieve approaching.

Alexander maintained his own permanent private room at this establishment.

Usually when the Kensington women visited, they dined and charged everything to Alexander's account.

When Diana and Genevieve arrived at the restaurant and learned Alexander was also present, they initially thought nothing of it.

They assumed he was conducting business and simply requested a different private room.

However, when they spotted Isabella standing directly outside Alexander's exclusive private room, they immediately halted.

Genevieve's expression darkened considerably.

"What are you doing here?" she demanded.

Isabella, still engaged in her phone conversation, neither answered nor acknowledged them.

The restaurant manager knew Isabella had arrived with Alexander.

Moreover, he had witnessed Sophia clinging tightly to Isabella's hand earlier.

They appeared to have an excellent relationship.

Unaware of the full situation, the manager wiped his brow nervously and awkwardly explained, "This lady came with Mr. Whitmore..."

Genevieve immediately pressed, "Just the two of them?"

Alexander had previously instructed that the Kensingtons should be treated with utmost courtesy.

Since that standing order hadn't been revoked, the manager could only continue telling the truth.

"No, Mr. Whitmore's daughter is also with them."


###Chapter 479

Alexander and Isabella had shared years of history and a lengthy marriage, yet his heart had never truly belonged to her.

Even with their daughter Sophia binding them together, a solitary meal between the two wouldn’t raise concern within the Kensington or Sinclair families.

No one believed anything meaningful could rekindle between them.

Genevieve’s intense reaction stemmed purely from her personal dislike of Isabella.

Eleanor and Diana, however, remained largely indifferent.

Eleanor had no intention of interrupting Alexander’s private dining experience.

She gently patted Genevieve’s arm, a silent signal to hold her tongue, then addressed the restaurant manager.

“Please lead the way,” she stated calmly.

Without another glance toward Isabella, she gracefully entered an adjacent private room, arm in arm with Beatrice.

Isabella undoubtedly possessed significant talent in the AI field.

Her connection with Nathaniel and her ability to secure his unwavering loyalty were notable achievements.

Yet, in Alexander’s world, she remained insignificant.

This was precisely why Eleanor and Diana couldn’t be bothered by his dinner with Isabella.

They didn’t deem it important enough to even mention to Victoria.

The mere sight of Isabella irritated Genevieve.

While she didn’t genuinely believe Isabella could steal Alexander from her cousin, she was convinced Isabella would exploit this rare alone time to sabotage his relationship with Victoria.

The moment she entered their private room, she pulled out her phone and sent a message.

“Victoria, we just saw her at the restaurant—she’s having dinner with Alex!”

“Their daughter is there, of course.”

Victoria rarely responded to Genevieve’s messages.

However, since this involved Alexander, she replied casually, “I know.”

“Alexander informed me.”

Seeing this, Genevieve felt a wave of relief.

“Good.”

“I was worried she might try something.”

“If he’s being transparent with you, then I’m not concerned anymore.”

Victoria didn’t reply after reading the final message.

Previously, learning of Isabella’s professional competence had caused her some anxiety—though she still hadn’t viewed her as a serious threat.

But the recent revelations changed everything.

Discovering Isabella was Frederick’s protégé and a major shareholder of NovaTech delivered a massive blow.

It had completely shaken Victoria’s confidence for a time.

She had since worked to regain her composure.

Beyond professional capability, she was not inferior to Isabella in any other aspect.

She had adjusted her mindset regarding Alexander’s meeting with Isabella.

Still, she had to acknowledge the significant gap in ability between someone like Nancy and Isabella.

If Alexander were to discover Isabella’s connection to Frederick, and that the two or three projects from NovaTech he so admired were all led by her—could he truly remain completely unmoved?

Isabella finished her phone call after several minutes and returned to the private room.

Seeing her return, Alexander inquired, “Was it something urgent?”

Isabella had no desire to engage with him.

But noticing Sophia’s eager gaze, she simply shook her head.

Sophia immediately ran over and grabbed her hand.

“Mom, come help me choose the dishes!”

Isabella took her seat.

“You haven’t ordered yet?”

“No,” Sophia replied.

“Dad said we should wait for you to come back.”

It was a considerate gesture from Alexander, but Isabella felt no emotional response.

She sat down beside Sophia, took the menu, and began selecting their meal.


###Chapter 480

Alexander seemed to sense Isabella's reluctance to engage.

After she finished ordering, he brought up Sophia's upcoming event.

"Sophia has a major competition in Geneva next Thursday."

"Will your schedule allow you to attend?"

"Please, Mom? Can you come with me?"

Since it was in another country, the trip would require at least two days.

NovaTech, Velotra, and Whitmore Group all had pressing matters demanding her attention.

Isabella hesitated, weighing her commitments.

Before she could respond, Sophia read her expression perfectly.

She'd lost count of how many times Isabella had postponed their plans due to work obligations.

Even on weekends, and during visits to her great-grandmother, quality time with her mother remained scarce.

Sophia fiddled with her spoon, tracing the rim of her teacup.

She lowered her head before Isabella could speak.

"During my last training match abroad, all the other children had their parents cheering them on."

"I was the only one..."

Initially, she hadn't minded Alexander's absence.

She was accustomed to traveling with just the household staff.

But watching other families support their children together made her feel profoundly alone.

She had tried calling Isabella during the competition, but her mother hadn't answered.

Fortunately, Alexander had picked up.

Isabella's lips parted slightly, but no words emerged.

Her silence spoke volumes, functioning as a rejection.

Sophia's nose tingled with unshed tears.

She pressed her lips together tightly, turning her face away.

There was a time when Isabella would rearrange her entire schedule to attend Sophia's events.

But now...

She had resolved to create distance.

Yet seeing Sophia's distress made her resolve waver.

She took a deep breath and turned to Alexander.

"You're unavailable that day as well?"

"After Grandmother's identification, I rescheduled numerous appointments."

"Tuesday is my absolute deadline—I must be in Edinburgh."

Isabella frowned, her hands clenching silently beneath the table.

Watching them negotiate her importance, Sophia's eyes instantly reddened.

She tossed her spoon onto the table with a clatter.

"Since you're both too busy, forget it."

"I'll go alone!"

She spun around and bolted toward the private room door.

In all her years, Isabella had rarely seen her daughter this upset.

She froze momentarily, stunned by the outburst.

By the time she reacted, Alexander was already moving.

He crossed the room in swift strides, intercepting Sophia before her hand could touch the doorknob.

He bent down and scooped her into his arms effortlessly.

Sophia struggled against him angrily.

"Let me go."

Alexander remained perfectly calm.

He gently pinched her cheek.

"Have I ever missed an important moment when I had any choice in the matter?"

Her sobs hitched slightly at his words.

Nestled in his embrace, she clutched his shirt without responding.

Her sidelong glance, however, was directed at Isabella—who had risen but then stopped upon seeing Alexander's intervention.

Sophia knew exactly who truly caused her pain.

She was merely taking her frustration out on Alexander.

The real source of her anger... was Isabella.


###Chapter 481

Isabella constantly claimed she was swamped with work.

No matter how packed her schedule was, she should still find time for a phone call.

Yet when Sophia tried reaching her, she seldom returned the calls.

And Isabella almost never initiated contact herself.

It felt like everything else in her life took priority over her own daughter.

The more Sophia dwelled on it, the more her heart ached.

Silent tears traced paths down her cheeks.

Seeing her distress, Alexander spoke before Isabella could respond.

He gently wiped Sophia’s tears.

“Your mother truly is under immense pressure at work right now.”

“But after next year—things should ease up for her.”

Sophia, still so young, clung to his comforting words.

The heavy weight in her chest lightened slightly.

She rubbed her eyes with her small hands and looked at Isabella, hope flickering in her gaze.

“Is it true, Mom? Will you have more time after next year?”

Sophia was her daughter.

Even though custody was no longer hers, Isabella wanted her to be happy.

Seeing that hopeful look, she couldn’t bring herself to shatter it completely.

But she also couldn’t make a promise she might not keep.

Not with the uncertainties ahead.

“The major projects should wrap up by year’s end,” Isabella said carefully.

“But new commitments might come up.”

“I can’t guarantee I’ll have more free time.”

It wasn’t the answer Sophia had hoped for.

But she noticed the hesitation in Isabella’s eyes.

That tiny hesitation told her that her mother still cared.

That was enough to lift her spirits.

She slid down from Alexander’s lap and rushed over to hug Isabella.

“That’s okay.”

“But when you do have time, please answer my calls more often.”

Isabella paused, glancing briefly at Alexander.

He met her gaze calmly, his expression neutral.

It was as if he was telling her, “It’s your decision. I won’t interfere.”

After a brief silence, Isabella nodded.

“I’ll try.”

Sophia’s mood shifted quickly.

Once reassured, she brightened up completely.

“Okay!”

Just then, a server knocked and entered with their food.

The three settled back at the table.

Sophia even scooted her chair closer to Isabella’s.

She chattered happily throughout the meal, sharing amusing stories from her recent training match.

Midway, she pulled out her tablet from her little bag to show Isabella photos from the event.

While Isabella engaged with her, Alexander remained quiet.

He focused on deboning her fish and serving her portions.

Sophia’s nonstop talking stretched the meal longer than usual.

It was only when exhaustion finally set in that she began to quiet down.

Knowing Isabella couldn’t carry her, Sophia climbed willingly into Alexander’s arms.

Within moments, she was fast asleep.

With Sophia asleep, only Alexander and Isabella remained.

A heavy silence hung between them.

Isabella glanced at the sleeping child in his arms, picked up her purse, and stood.

“I should go.”

“Please… take good care of her.”

Alexander nodded.

“I will.”

Without another word, Isabella opened the door and stepped out of the private room.

Alexander stayed seated, holding Sophia a little longer.

Eventually, he rose and carried her out into the quiet evening.


###Chapter 482

Isabella still attended the Monday meeting at NovaTech.

Alexander had an important executive session that required his full attention.

He didn't personally attend Isabella's presentation this time.

However, when his meeting concluded, Daniel and Benjamin heard him inquire, "Has the downstairs meeting adjourned yet?"

"If the follow-up proposal has been submitted, bring it to me immediately."

They exchanged knowing glances, recalling how Alexander had previously sat in on Isabella's meetings.

They observed the substantial pile of documents awaiting Alexander's review.

He was scheduled for a business trip tomorrow, requiring all current files to be processed today.

In comparison, the project discussed in Isabella's meeting wouldn't commence until next month.

The proposal remained in its preliminary stages.

Alexander could easily review it after his return.

But since he requested it, Benjamin retrieved the newly delivered documents from the downstairs meeting.

He placed the proposal on Alexander's desk.

Although labeled as preliminary, Isabella had thoroughly developed the subsequent workflow.

The report Alexander received was exceptionally detailed and well-structured.

He immediately focused on the specific implementation procedures.

The pages contained extensive technical terminology that largely eluded Daniel and Benjamin's understanding.

The proposal spanned multiple pages, but after reviewing just the initial section, they noticed a subtle smile gracing Alexander's features.

He scanned through the document with remarkable speed, focusing on key technical terms.

They watched as his reading pace accelerated—eight pages of dense content consumed in under three minutes.

By the time he finished, the satisfaction in his eyes became unmistakable.

His evident approval of the proposal was clear.

Just as Daniel and Benjamin prepared to comment, Alexander closed the document and stated, "They're likely heading to a group luncheon."

"Benjamin, inform them I'll be joining."

Both men paused momentarily before Benjamin responded, "Certainly."

Indeed, Isabella's team had scheduled a lunch gathering for noon.

As departure time approached, Isabella and her colleagues prepared to leave when NovaTech's technical department head, Sebastian Hayes, announced, "Just received word that Mr. Whitmore will be joining us for lunch."

Isabella showed little reaction.

Nathaniel, who was also present today, pressed his lips together upon hearing this.

Leaning toward Isabella, he murmured, "Given the current cooperation phase between our companies, his personal involvement seems unnecessary."

"Why is he coming?"

Isabella simply shook her head.

If he didn't know, she certainly couldn't speculate.

Alexander had considerable work to complete, so Isabella, Nathaniel, and their team arrived at the restaurant first.

They waited briefly before Alexander appeared with Benjamin.

When Alexander entered, several NovaTech senior executives and engineers immediately rose to greet him.

After brief pleasantries, his gaze shifted to Isabella and Nathaniel.

He extended his hand for a formal handshake.

"I've reviewed the follow-up proposal."

"The conceptual framework is outstanding."

"Thank you for your diligent work."

The senior technical staff appeared surprised by this announcement.

Their proposal had just been submitted—how had Alexander already reviewed it?

So quickly?


###Chapter 483

Under the circumstances, Nathaniel and Isabella had no choice but to formally shake hands with Alexander.

They had barely settled into their seats when Nathaniel's phone rang urgently.

A critical situation had arisen at NovaTech demanding his immediate return.

After Nathaniel excused himself from Alexander and Sebastian, Isabella noticed his troubled expression.

"Is everything alright?" she whispered with concern.

Nathaniel gently squeezed her shoulder reassuringly.

Leaning close, he murmured softly, "Nothing to worry about, darling."

"I've got this handled."

His comforting words immediately eased Isabella's worries.

The other guests observed their intimate exchange with admiration, silently acknowledging their strong bond.

Benjamin and Daniel exchanged knowing glances toward Alexander.

While others remained unaware, they knew Alexander's presence today centered entirely on Isabella.

Yet when they studied his expression, they found it unreadable - his thoughts completely concealed.

With Nathaniel's departure, the luncheon continued.

After orders were placed, conversation naturally shifted toward collaboration details between their companies.

It was then that Alexander focused his attention on Isabella.

"I'm particularly intrigued by the heterogeneous computing solution outlined in section three of your proposal," he remarked.

"Full implementation could significantly enhance both perception chips and terminal performance."

He paused thoughtfully.

"However, the technical challenges remain substantial."

"Overly complex programming architectures, rapid computing units hampered by slow data transfer rates - these present major obstacles requiring considerable investment and manpower."

Alexander's gaze intensified.

"While your proposal mentions AI-assisted code partitioning as a solution to programming complexity, current AI segmentation technology lacks maturity."

"Wouldn't this approach introduce additional complications?"

The technical team from NovaTech exchanged surprised glances.

When Alexander had earlier claimed to have studied their proposal, they'd assumed it was mere politeness.

Now, hearing his specific technical references, they realized he had genuinely analyzed their document thoroughly.

Isabella herself felt pleasantly surprised by his depth of understanding.

Since Alexander represented NovaTech and had raised valid concerns, she responded professionally.

"You've identified the core challenges accurately."

"Regarding computing power limitations at this stage, I can commit to providing billion-parameter scale models."

"As for toolchain integration difficulties, we can..."

As Isabella elaborated, Alexander engaged deeply in the technical discussion.

"Current technology still requires breakthroughs in high-reliability system development," he interjected.

"Are you considering alternative approaches, or...?"

Their conversation progressed into increasingly specialized territory.

As they spoke, Benjamin and Daniel noticed the particular light in Alexander's eyes.

The senior executives and technical staff present gradually realized the truth.

Alexander had already formed comprehensive solutions for this project's challenges.

And remarkably, Isabella's proposed approaches aligned perfectly with his own vision!

In that moment, Benjamin and Daniel finally understood why Alexander had grasped the entire proposal's essence after merely reviewing key points in the office.

They comprehended the meaning behind that peculiar smile after his reading, and his unusual insistence on attending this luncheon.

Observing how he looked at Isabella - that smile playing beneath his intense gaze - they quietly lowered their heads in simultaneous realization.

###Chapter 484

Alexander and the team exchanged knowing looks.
They finally understood he had joined the lunch solely because of Isabella.
But Alexander was already in a committed relationship.
Their bond appeared strong.
He likely just admired her professional expertise.
Nothing more.
Probably.
Isabella and Alexander continued their technical discussion for quite some time.

Their conversation flowed naturally around the specific components that interested him.
Once that topic was exhausted, the dialogue naturally concluded.
After that, Alexander and Isabella did not speak again.
But Daniel, Benjamin, and other observant individuals at the table noticed Alexander's occasional glances toward Isabella.
As the lunch was winding down, Alexander's phone suddenly rang.
No one heard what was said on the other end.
But his expression shifted dramatically.

He ended the call and addressed the table.
"Ms. Sinclair, everyone, my apologies. An urgent matter requires my immediate attention. Let's reconnect another time."
Since he spoke directly to her, Isabella felt compelled to respond.
"Of course. Safe travels."
Alexander and Daniel departed swiftly.
Watching his hurried exit, Sebastian remarked, "Mr. Whitmore seemed genuinely distressed. He left in quite a rush. Something serious must have happened."

Isabella's heart clenched with sudden concern.
Was it possible Eleanor's condition had taken a turn for the worse?
She quickly retrieved her phone from her bag.
If something had happened to Eleanor, Alexander would have undoubtedly messaged her the moment he stepped out.
Her screen showed no new notifications from him.
His sudden departure was unrelated to Eleanor.
A wave of relief washed over her.

Meanwhile, Benjamin and Daniel only learned the truth after leaving the restaurant.
Victoria's car had been rear-ended.
She was seriously injured.
Alexander and Benjamin rushed to the hospital immediately.

Genevieve approached them the moment they arrived.
"Alex, thank goodness you're here."
Alexander's gaze fixed on the emergency room doors.
"How is she?"
Before Genevieve or anyone else could answer, the doors swung open.
The waiting family surged forward.
"Doctor, my daughter—"
"Doctor, my granddaughter—"
"Doctor—"
The overlapping pleas made the doctor frown.

He raised a hand, requesting silence.
The family gradually quieted down.
"The head injury is not life-threatening. However, the full extent will only be clear after she regains consciousness and we conduct further tests."
The Kensingtons crowded around the doctor, firing endless questions.
Alexander instructed Benjamin to handle Victoria's admission paperwork downstairs.

Once the formalities were complete, everyone gathered around Victoria's hospital bed, their faces etched with worry.
Daniel had returned to NovaTech, leaving Benjamin as Alexander's sole support at the hospital.
Alexander had originally scheduled a business trip for tomorrow.
But a last-minute change, right before his lunch with Isabella, had moved the departure up.
Benjamin checked his watch and approached Alexander.
"Mr. Whitmore, it's 2:30 PM. We must leave for the airport by three to make our flight."

The doctor had said Victoria's injuries weren't fatal.
But her head trauma remained significant.
She likely wouldn't regain consciousness for at least another hour.
###Chapter 485

Alexander didn't hesitate for even a second.

"Contact them," he commanded. "Tell them we'll meet tomorrow instead."

Benjamin opened his mouth to speak, but stopped when he saw Alexander's gaze had already returned to Victoria.

He simply nodded in acknowledgment.

As Benjamin turned to leave the hospital room to make the call, Alexander suddenly remembered something.

"Have Daniel handle those urgent documents," he added without looking away from Victoria. "I'll contact him about the details later."

"Understood," Benjamin replied.

He stepped outside and followed Alexander's instructions, calling Daniel first.

"Alright, got it," Daniel responded.

But instead of ending the call immediately, he couldn't help adding, "Lately, the boss has been paying more and more attention to Isabella. Today he even... Well, I thought Mr. Whitmore..."

Benjamin knew exactly what Daniel meant.

He'd had the same thought himself.

But now, seeing how concerned Alexander was about Victoria, he realized they'd both been overthinking it.

Perhaps Alexander's attitude toward Isabella had changed somewhat recently.

But the one he truly cared about, the one he truly loved, was still Victoria.

Victoria woke up shortly after 4:30 PM.

Seeing Alexander there, she smiled weakly. "Didn't you say you had a business trip this afternoon? Why..."

Genevieve cut her off before she could finish. "Because he was worried about you, so he postponed until tomorrow."

She smiled knowingly before adding, "And he's been here at the hospital with us this whole time, waiting for you to wake up."

Hearing this, Victoria felt a warm flutter in her chest and smiled.

But she quickly adopted a concerned tone. "I'm fine now, Alexander. You should go handle your work."

"No rush," Alexander replied firmly.

Hearing his insistence on staying with Victoria, Genevieve, Diana, and the others exchanged knowing, teasing smiles.

The test results came back that evening after the doctor reexamined Victoria.

When both families learned she had no serious injuries, they collectively breathed a sigh of relief.

Though her head injury wasn't severe, she still needed to remain hospitalized for observation and rest.

That evening, Oliver came to visit Victoria at the hospital, bringing fresh flowers and fruit after hearing about her accident.

"Julian couldn't get away due to an urgent matter," Oliver explained. "He said he'll visit when he's free. This fruit basket is from him."

Hearing this, the smile in Victoria's eyes faded slightly.

She responded coolly, "Is that so? Thank him for me then."

Her reaction stemmed from knowing Julian was merely keeping up appearances.

Even if he had the time, he wouldn't actually come to see her.

Eleanor and Diana also felt Julian's "urgent matter" was just an excuse.

However, they didn't know Julian had developed feelings for Isabella and had been distancing himself from Victoria because of her.

They still believed his absence was simply to avoid Genevieve.

The next morning, Isabella went to the hospital to visit Eleanor.

Just as she walked out of the parking lot, she spotted Genevieve and Eleanor.

Since Alexander had not only postponed his business trip for Victoria the previous day but had also stayed at the hospital with her for hours, the entire Kensington family was buoyed by his show of devotion.

Seeing Isabella, Genevieve tilted her chin up and gave a cold hum.

She deliberately raised her voice. "Aunt Eleanor, yesterday when Victoria had her accident, Alexander rushed straight to the hospital, postponing his business trip again and again."

"And because he was still worried about her," she continued pointedly, "he even said this morning he had to see her at the hospital before he could feel at ease enough to leave on his trip."
###Chapter 486

Isabella finally understood why Alexander had rushed off yesterday.
It was because of Victoria.
She had long grown accustomed to how much he prioritized Victoria.
She knew Genevieve's words were deliberately meant for her ears.
Her expression remained neutral as she walked past them.
She entered the elevator first.
The button she pressed revealed her destination.
Genevieve, Diana, and the others realized she was visiting Eleanor.
They knew about Eleanor's illness.
They hadn't personally visited the hospital yet.
But they were aware she was staying here.
They had secretly inquired about her room number the previous night.
Seeing Isabella's chosen floor confirmed their suspicions.
The Kensingtons and the Shaws had never actually met Eleanor.
They had obtained her room number through discreet means.
But they hesitated to barge in uninvited.
They feared offending the powerful matriarch.
Now they watched Isabella visit so casually.
Lilian and Patricia immediately felt resentment.
Genevieve shot Isabella a venomous glare.
Other people occupied the elevator.
She restrained herself from making a scene.
Once they stepped out, she ground her teeth.
"She's about to divorce Alexander yet still clings to Mrs. Whitmore Senior."
"Utterly shameless."
Then another thought struck her.
"She's cozying up to Mrs. Whitmore Senior to sabotage things."
"She wants to turn Alexander's family against Victoria."
Lilian and Patricia shared the same suspicion.
They recalled how the Whitmores still refused to let Alexander bring Victoria for visits.
Despite Eleanor's grave condition.
Lilian's gaze turned icy cold.
Meanwhile, Eleanor had just finished her medical check-up.
She felt overjoyed to see Isabella arrive.
They chatted warmly while Isabella arranged the flowers.
She placed them in a vase on the small round table by the window.
Once finished, she glanced down at the parking lot.
She spotted Alexander below.
She only looked for a moment before withdrawing her gaze.
She sat back down beside Eleanor to continue their conversation.
Eleanor's spirits remained low despite her hospitalization.
Visitors came regularly but she still felt bored.
Seeing Isabella lifted her mood considerably.
Noticing this, Isabella decided to stay longer.
Eleanor knew Isabella had work commitments.
Though reluctant, after nearly half an hour she spoke.
"Isabella, I won't keep you from your work."
"Please visit me again when you have time."
Isabella checked the time.
It was indeed getting late.
She was about to agree when the door opened.
She turned to see Alexander entering.
She realized he'd probably been at the hospital for half an hour already.
Yet he only now came to see Eleanor.
Thinking of Victoria in a ward downstairs, she understood perfectly.
She was about to look away when he greeted her.
"You're here."
Isabella responded with a faint hum.
She turned back to bid farewell to Eleanor.
Alexander asked, "Leaving so soon?"
Eleanor snorted. "Soon?"
"Isabella has been here over half an hour already."
"Do you think she's like you, always showing up this late?"
Isabella didn't reply to him.
After saying goodbye again to Eleanor, she turned to leave.
Just before exiting completely, she heard Eleanor speak to Alexander.
"Good thing Isabella stayed to chat with me."
"Now that you're here, you can keep me company too."
Then she heard Alexander's response as she left.
"I'm leaving on a business trip shortly."
"I need to head to the airport in a few minutes."
So he had time for Victoria but not for Eleanor.
It wasn't that he didn't care.
Having known him for years, Isabella knew he deeply cared for his grandmother.
But in his limited free time, most went to Victoria.
Because he cared deeply for her too.
###Chapter 487

Isabella didn't accompany Sophia to the competition in Salzburg on Thursday.

Victoria wasn't upset about it.

She just acted sweetly and made Isabella promise to take her out after the competition ended.

Isabella couldn't resist her pleading and agreed.

Work had overwhelmed Isabella for the past few days.

She hadn't visited Eleanor at the hospital since Tuesday.

On Friday morning, she finally made time to go.

Downstairs, she spotted Victoria walking outside with a bandage on her head.

Victoria was on the phone.

"I'm feeling much better now. Sophia, just focus on your competition. Don't worry about me."

She looked up and saw Isabella.

Victoria immediately averted her gaze with indifference.

She continued her phone conversation.

"You'll call me the moment results are out? Of course I'll be waiting by my phone. I won't miss your call."

"It's almost time for your team gathering. Go meet your coach now. Good luck!"

It wasn't even eight in the morning yet.

Sophia had called Victoria bright and early as usual.

Isabella listened with a calm expression.

She walked past Victoria into the elevator.

Inside the ward, she learned Eleanor had felt stuffy staying indoors.

Eleanor had gone downstairs for a walk too.

Isabella set down the flowers she brought.

She turned to head down to the garden.

There, she saw Eleanor with Victoria and Lilian.

She also spotted Martha, but she wasn't with them.

Apparently, Martha didn't know Victoria was hospitalized.

She hadn't noticed Victoria and Lilian at all.

Victoria and Lilian were very aware of Martha.

They had been watching her.

They saw Isabella arrive.

They immediately pulled back their gazes and walked away.

Isabella approached Martha.

Martha finally noticed her and immediately smiled.

"Isabella, you're here."

"Grandma."

Victoria and Lilian had already walked away.

They saw Martha's smile clearly.

They considered going over to greet her.

But Martha's illness had struck suddenly.

She supposedly couldn't handle shocks.

They decided against approaching.

Since Martha adored Isabella, Lilian didn't dwell on it.

She spoke with a sneer.

"People say Mrs. Whitmore Senior can't control Alexander."

"No matter how much she dotes on that woman, Alexander is still divorcing her."

By the same logic, even if Martha disliked them.

If Alexander insisted on marrying Victoria, Martha couldn't stop him.

Furthermore, Martha had fallen gravely ill this time.

Rumor said if she'd arrived ten minutes later, she wouldn't have made it.

Her condition was severe.

Yet Alexander hadn't called off the divorce for her sake.

Martha hadn't used her illness to force him either.

That showed Martha had accepted the divorce.

She might even be preparing to welcome Victoria into the family.

Lilian spoke again.

"So, don't rush."

After this close call, Victoria realized Alexander cared more than she thought.

That settled her heart somewhat.

She wasn't in such a hurry anymore.

Still, watching Martha dote on Isabella while disliking her felt uncomfortable.

But ultimately, everything between her and Alexander depended on him.

Since Martha couldn't truly stand in their way, why care about her opinion?

With that thought, Victoria stopped caring whether Martha or the family liked her.
###Chapter 488

Isabella Sinclair escorted her grandmother Margaret to the opera on Saturday evening.

They approached the ticket checkpoint amidst a well-dressed crowd.

A familiar voice called out her name from across the lobby.

She turned to see Kieran Blackwood weaving through attendees with a warm smile.

"What a pleasant surprise," he said, reaching them. "I didn't expect to see you here."

Isabella returned his smile. "We came for the maestro's performance. You enjoy opera too?"

His eyes lingered on her. "I've recently developed an appreciation for it."

This marked the first time he'd used her first name outside professional settings.

He greeted Margaret with a respectful nod. "Good evening, madam."

Margaret acknowledged him with a polite smile, observing his attentive manner toward her granddaughter.

She noticed the particular way he looked at Isabella.

Young people who appreciated traditional opera were rare these days.

But Margaret recognized something deeper in his demeanor.

Since Isabella seemed unaware, Margaret remained silent.

Kieran noticed they came without company. "Didn't bring your daughter along? Not fond of opera?"

At the mention of Sophia, Isabella's smile tightened slightly.

Her daughter had promised to return to Fairview by noon.

They were supposed to spend the day together upon her arrival.

Yet evening had fallen without any word from her.

No airport pickup request. No call after landing.

Isabella had grown accustomed to such disappointments.

She knew exactly where her daughter's priorities lay.

"Something like that," Isabella replied tersely.

Kieran had hoped this topic would spark conversation.

Instead, he encountered clear disinterest.

Her expression turned cold at the mention of her daughter.

Perhaps the custody situation still pained her.

He decided to change the subject immediately.

Inside the theater, Kieran exchanged his front-row tickets to sit beside Isabella.

He had prepared by studying opera beforehand.

Soon he was engaging both women in lively discussion about the performance.

Their conversation flowed pleasantly throughout the intermission.

As the performance reached its climax, the hall fell completely silent.

Isabella's phone vibrated discreetly in her clutch.

She glanced down to see a message from Alexander Whitmore.

"Grandma's health has improved significantly. Thank you for your frequent visits these past weeks. Are you available Monday?"

She understood his meaning immediately.

Just as she anticipated, he was setting their divorce appointment.

She typed a brief reply. "Yes."

His response came instantly. "Good. See you in the morning."

She didn't respond further.

Returning her phone to her bag, she fixed her eyes on the stage.

The opera had reached its most dramatic aria.

Kieran turned to make a comment but stopped abruptly.

Though her gaze was directed forward, her mind was clearly elsewhere.

The smile faded from his lips as he recognized her distant expression.

Her attention might be on the performance, but her heart carried other burdens entirely.
###Chapter 489

Sunday afternoon brought a call from Sophia.

She wanted to visit.

Isabella remembered her promise to the girl.

She agreed immediately.

A driver brought Sophia over.

The moment she stepped out of the car, Sophia rushed into Isabella's arms.

She spent some time cuddling with Isabella and Margaret.

Then she announced her big news excitedly.

She had won first place in her fencing competition.

She had brought the trophy in her little backpack.

She shoved it happily into Isabella's hands.

Margaret watched with a beaming smile.

She couldn't stop praising Sophia's excellence and capability.

Isabella knew she hadn't contributed much to Sophia's fencing.

She also knew her future involvement might be limited.

After a moment's thought, she made a suggestion.

"How about we buy a frame to mount your trophy?"

Sophia immediately declined.

"Dad already had a custom frame made for me before the competition."

She described it as super pretty.

She had taken a picture of it.

Hearing Isabella's suggestion, she pulled out her phone.

She handed it to Isabella proudly.

"See? Isn't it beautiful?"

Isabella glanced at the photo.

Even through the image, she could tell the frame was extremely expensive.

Alexander had prepared it secretly in advance.

That showed how much thought he had put into it.

Sophia already had a custom frame.

But Isabella's suggestion still made her very happy.

Sophia stayed overnight at the Sinclair residence.

The next morning, Isabella packed required documents into her bag.

Sophia noticed but didn't understand what they were.

She didn't ask any questions.

Isabella looked at her daughter's clear eyes beneath that pretty face.

She realized Alexander still hadn't told Sophia about their divorce.

She hesitated for a moment.

Sophia looked back at her, puzzled.

"Mom? What's wrong?"

Isabella worried that saying anything might cause problems.

She decided it was better for Alexander to handle it.

"Nothing, sweetheart."

"I'm going to work now. Don't run around, okay?"

"Got it. Bye, Mom."

Isabella nodded and went downstairs.

She left for the courthouse.

Alexander was already waiting outside when she arrived.

"Morning," he greeted.

Isabella nodded silently.

They walked in together without further conversation.

The procedure didn't take long.

It was completed quickly.

Isabella was about to leave when Alexander's phone rang.

He had been preparing to leave as well.

Seeing the caller ID, he answered while slowing his pace.

Isabella walked ahead but still caught his voice.

"Everything went smoothly. It's done."

"I'll go over to your place in a bit."

He continued speaking.

"I've already sorted out the issues with NovaTech."

"The plan is prepared. Don't worry."

"I'll drop by personally later."

He and Victoria began discussing other matters.

The distance between them grew.

Isabella could no longer hear their conversation.

She got into her car and drove away.

Shortly after, Alexander also got into his car and left.

They didn't even say goodbye after finalizing their divorce.
###Chapter 490

Isabella left the courthouse and returned to NovaTech.

She made it just in time for the morning meeting.

As she took her seat, Nathaniel leaned over and whispered. "All finished? That was quick."

Isabella nodded. There had never been much conflict between her and Alexander.

Both approached the divorce with surprising positivity, so the paperwork processed smoothly.

Nathaniel added, "If not for the mandatory waiting period, you'd be officially divorced today. Now you still have to wait thirty days."

"Once this waiting period ends, get that certificate immediately. Don't delay again. Otherwise, just like last time, you'll miss the deadline and have to restart everything. It's such a hassle."

"I know."

Last time the waiting period ended, she and Alexander had agreed to get the divorce certificate the very next day.

But unexpected matters arose for both of them.

They completely missed the deadline.

Wednesday marked the anniversary of her maternal grandfather Lorenzo Rodriguez's death.

Though he passed away in Fairview, he was buried in Geneva.

On Tuesday at noon, Isabella and Margaret headed to the airport, preparing to return to Geneva for the memorial.

Sophia accompanied them.

Isabella hadn't originally booked Sophia's ticket.

But since Sophia was staying at the Sinclair residence and expressed a desire to go, she brought her along.

The family rarely returned to Geneva after leaving.

They only went back for Lorenzo's memorial days.

The old residence in Geneva had already stood for decades when they left.

Now, nearly twenty years later, it had been almost forty years since it was first inhabited.

Despite regular cleaning, it had fallen into disrepair and became uninhabitable.

So in recent years, whenever they returned, they stayed at a hotel.

Both Isabella and Charles had work commitments, requiring them to return to Fairview by Wednesday night.

As for the others...

Geneva was a city of sorrow for Margaret.

She never intended to stay long.

Edward and William were both born and raised in Fairview, feeling little attachment to Geneva.

None of them planned to linger.

Though Geneva no longer held much sentiment for the Sinclair family, they always visited the old residence during returns.

That evening after dinner, Isabella, Margaret, and the rest went to the old family home.

They were accustomed to the home's dilapidated state.

But seeing it again still weighed heavily on Isabella and Charles.

They had considered tearing it down and rebuilding.

But the house held too many important memories for Margaret and Charles.

Especially Evelyn's room—perhaps due to its location, it remained in relatively good condition.

Sophia had been in good spirits initially.

But seeing the grief affecting Isabella and Margaret dimmed her mood.

She quietly held Isabella's hand, following closely behind.

Before going abroad with Alexander, Sophia had visited Geneva every year with Isabella for Lorenzo's memorial.

She was young then, but retained vague impressions of the place.

Her memories were faint, but she remembered Celeste and the others always seemed sorrowful during visits.

Seeing Isabella's sadness now, she hugged her at Evelyn's room doorway to comfort her.

Feeling the girl's embrace, Isabella paused.

She lowered her head and met Sophia's worried gaze.

A complex look flashed in her eyes, but she ultimately said nothing.

She only reached out and gently stroked the girl's cheek.
###Chapter 491

The morning air felt crisp and cool as Isabella and Margaret made their way to the cemetery. Isabella's gaze lingered on the tombstone, memories of Nathaniel's silver-haired appearance flooding back. Unlike him, the Sinclair family typically maintained a youthful appearance for their age. When Evelyn had divorced all those years ago, Nathaniel had been in his fifties with only a few strands of gray in his hair.

Isabella remembered clearly how within a year of Evelyn's accident, Nathaniel's hair had turned completely white. His health had deteriorated rapidly after that.

It was only last year that she discovered his illness had been accelerated by years of suppressed grief and heartache. Had he not fallen ill, he might still be with them today. Margaret's eyes grew moist at the thought of how even on his deathbed, he had worried about his beloved Evelyn. After all these years, Evelyn still hadn't managed to rebuild her life as Nathaniel had hoped.

Leaning on Charles for support, Margaret knelt and gently touched the cold marble of the tombstone.

"Nathaniel..." Her voice caught in her throat. She wanted to say their precious daughter still hadn't recovered, that she had failed him. But the words remained unspoken. Her fingers traced the engraved letters silently as tears streamed down her face.

Isabella's eyes reddened. She released Sophia's hand and turned away. Sensing the heavy atmosphere, Sophia looked up at her mother with questioning eyes. "Mommy?"

Isabella simply shook her head, unable to speak.

More than an hour later, they finally left the cemetery grounds. The Sinclair family still maintained connections with several relatives and old family friends in the area.

Each year during their visit, they would traditionally pay visits to these connections together with Margaret. This year, when they arrived at the Fyre residence, the family matriarch Eleanor—who was around Margaret's age—paused when she noticed Sophia.

"This must be Isabella's daughter... Sophia, right? It's been years since I last saw her! She's grown so much!"

Isabella nodded and encouraged Sophia to greet Eleanor properly.

Eleanor hesitated for a moment before asking, "Did your husband come with you this time?" Last year, when Sophia hadn't accompanied them, Isabella and Margaret had explained that Alexander was working overseas with their daughter. Now the child was here, but her father...

Throughout their marriage, Alexander had only accompanied Isabella back once to pay respects at Nathaniel's grave. That had been several years ago, when their relationship had just begun to warm again.

With Sophia present and unaware of the impending divorce, Isabella simply said, "He's occupied with work."

Seeing how casually Isabella spoke of Alexander, Eleanor didn't press further and quickly changed the subject. After some conversation, she seemed to recall something and lowered her voice. "I heard the Kensingtons and the Shaws moved to Fairview and have been doing quite well."

"That Kensington granddaughter and her supposedly very capable boyfriend—apparently their relationship has grown stronger. Both families even returned to Geneva a few days ago. Rumor has it they're about to announce their engagement."

Normally, mentions of the Kensingtons or Shaws wouldn't affect Margaret and Isabella. But today, with everyone already in a somber mood, they fell silent at the news. After a long pause, Margaret finally said, "I know."

Eleanor looked concerned. "I heard the granddaughter's fiancé comes from quite an influential family."

"With those two families gaining such powerful connections in Fairview... They won't come after you, will they?"

For now, the Kensingtons and Shaws still didn't dare confront them directly. But if Victoria actually married Alexander... Then everything would change.
###Chapter 492

That evening, Isabella prepared to return to Fairview with her family.

They arrived at the airport together.

Everyone settled into business class seats.

Sophia sat by the window with Edward and his family on the right side.

Isabella and Margaret took the middle section on the left.

With Edward watching Sophia, Isabella helped adjust Margaret's seat.

She was speaking with her grandmother when Eleanor, Diana, and the others approached.

The Kensington family showed no surprise at seeing the Sinclairs.

Smiles spread across their faces instead.

They clearly knew about the Sinclair family's return to Geneva.

They were aware they shared this flight back to Fairview.

Genevieve looked at Isabella with a provocative smile.

She spoke deliberately loud enough for everyone to hear.

"Grandma, Aunt Diana, some people visited the hospital daily when Mrs. Whitmore was ill."

"They tried currying favor, clinging to Eleanor, thinking it would stop Alexander from divorcing."

"But as soon as Mrs. Whitmore recovered, before Victoria even spoke, Alexander immediately scheduled the divorce paperwork."

"Before, when someone dragged their feet refusing to finalize it, I was worried."

"But Victoria said she trusted Alexander to handle it—and she was right."

The Kensingtons knew Genevieve aimed these words at the Sinclairs.

Diana chuckled lightly and patted Genevieve's hand.

She threw a mocking glance toward Isabella and Margaret.

Eleanor's expression remained cool and unsurprised.

She didn't even look at the Sinclair family.

She simply glided past them and seated herself elegantly.

Charles and Margaret knew Genevieve's words targeted them.

Seeing Isabella addressed that way, Margaret's expression darkened further.

Charles, arranging luggage, let his face harden.

Genevieve walked slowly, deliberately drawing things out.

Passengers behind grew impatient.

Someone urged, "Why are you standing around chatting? Move along!"

The Kensingtons had been feeling smug recently.

Genevieve, displeased at being rushed, turned to snap.

Isabella, hidden by a nearby luggage bin, stretched out her foot.

Genevieve stumbled, falling forward straight onto Diana.

Both tumbled to the ground together.

Eleanor had just sat down.

Seeing this, her expression changed instantly.

She jumped up to help.

"Mom, are you alright?"

Genevieve scrambled up from the floor, face dark with fury.

She glared sharply at Isabella.

"It was you! You did that on purpose!"

Isabella looked at her coldly.

"I don't know what you're talking about."

"You—!" Genevieve wanted to retort.

The passenger who complained earlier spoke up again, this time defending Isabella.

"You were too busy gossiping to watch where you were going—don't go blaming others!"

The carpeted floor provided little cushion.

Genevieve had knocked her mouth against an armrest.

Blood trickled from her teeth.

Furious, she wanted to argue further.

The impatient passenger barked, "If you don't want to fly, then get off the plane."

"Stop blocking everyone else!"

Other passengers chimed in, annoyed.

"Exactly!"

"You..." Genevieve trembled with indignation.

With more people staring, Eleanor cut in.

"Genevieve, sit down."

Seething, Genevieve didn't dare disobey.

Before sitting, she shot Isabella a venomous glare.

"Just you wait."

Isabella ignored her.

She calmly finished adjusting Margaret's seat before sitting down.

Diana had struck her forehead, looking disheveled.

Seeing her mother's injury and elegant clothes in disarray, Eleanor's expression darkened.

She hadn't witnessed what happened but knew it was Isabella.

After having a stewardess tend to Diana's wound, she returned to her seat.

On her way back, she shot Isabella a cold, cutting look.

Noticing the gaze, Isabella met it evenly with one just as frosty.

Eleanor knew confronting Isabella here would only escalate things.

If caught on camera and spread online, their side might end up worse off.

With that thought, she cast Isabella a final cold glance and returned to her seat in silence.
###Chapter 493

Genevieve remained furious after takeoff.

She immediately ordered a drink from the flight attendant.

Once the attendant left, she concealed the cup behind her back.

She began marching directly toward Isabella.

Eleanor had anticipated this move.

She noticed Genevieve approaching and frowned.

Eleanor gave a subtle but firm shake of her head.

Genevieve refused to back down despite the warning.

She continued advancing toward Isabella.

Eleanor’s expression turned stern.

She discreetly sent a text message.

"Return to your seat immediately."

Her voice remained low but carried undeniable authority.

Genevieve instantly recognized that tone.

It meant no arguments would be tolerated.

Diana, seated nearby, understood the situation perfectly.

She reached out and patted Genevieve’s hand in warning.

Genevieve pouted with visible resentment.

Within both the Sinclair and Kensington families, Eleanor and Victoria held ultimate authority.

Genevieve had learned long ago not to challenge them.

She shot one final glare toward Isabella.

Then she turned back and slumped into her seat.

She sulked silently for the remainder of the flight.

Sophia remained completely unaware of the near confrontation.

She noticed nothing amiss.

Once the plane landed in Fairview, Sophia immediately rushed over.

"Mom!"

Isabella gently stroked her daughter’s cheek.

"Were you well-behaved during the flight?"

"Yes!" Sophia answered proudly.

Their seats were directly across the aisle from the Kensingtons.

Eleanor turned at the sound of Sophia’s voice.

Her gaze was icy and detached.

Diana, Genevieve, and even Beatrice glanced over as well.

Sophia looked up mid-conversation.

Her eyes accidentally met Eleanor’s.

Eleanor immediately averted her gaze.

Her face showed no emotion.

Sophia didn’t recognize her or the other elders.

She only knew Victoria and Genevieve.

So she simply dismissed Eleanor’s cold stare as that of a stranger.

She thought nothing more of it.

After disembarking, Isabella and Charles led their group out first.

They exited the terminal without looking back.

Watching their departing figures, Genevieve could no longer contain herself.

"Aunt Eleanor, Grandmother—are we really letting her treat us this way?"

"Why should we tolerate her arrogance?"

Eleanor’s tone remained calm but firm.

"It’s temporary."

"She won’t be smug for long."

Once Isabella and Alexander finalized their divorce, opportunities for retaliation would abound.

Penelope added gently, "Exactly."

"Didn’t you see how unsettled she looked earlier?"

"It means your words struck a nerve."

"That’s true..." Genevieve muttered.

The reassurance soothed her wounded pride.

She thought about Alexander and Isabella’s impending separation.

She remembered Alexander’s heart had always belonged to Victoria.

Her mood gradually improved.

A sense of gleeful satisfaction washed over her.

The next morning, Sophia left the Sinclair residence to return to Alexander.

At the office, Isabella had just concluded a major meeting.

Nathaniel leaned in close to whisper.

"Yesterday, both NovaTech and Locket Tech received several hundred million in new investments."

Isabella paused briefly.

She showed no surprise.

She had suspected this ever since overhearing Alexander’s phone call with Victoria on their courthouse visit day.

That evening, she and Nathaniel attended a banquet.

They spotted Victoria and Reginald immediately upon entering.

Alexander was absent.

But news of his massive investment in NovaTech and Locket Tech had already spread.

Guests flocked around them eagerly discussing potential partnerships.

Alexander’s investment track record was legendary.

His substantial backing suggested both companies held genuine promise.

Several of Victoria’s former suitors were also present.

With Alexander absent, they seized the opportunity to chat her up.

Victoria handled herself with practiced ease and calm composure.

But the moment she noticed Isabella, her expression instantly chilled.

Her family had already informed her about the incident involving Genevieve and Diana on the plane.

Victoria was different now.

Even if she couldn’t match Isabella’s AI expertise, she possessed something else—Alexander.

Her own charm was a form of power.

In her eyes, it was no less valuable than Isabella’s professional skills.

So when she looked at Isabella tonight, all traces of her former timidity were gone.
###Chapter 494
Isabella lifted her gaze without thinking, immediately catching the disdain and arrogance in Victoria's eyes. The moment their eyes met, Victoria quickly looked away. Nathaniel smirked coldly. "She really thinks highly of herself."

Watching the guests eagerly swarming around Victoria and Reginald, all hoping to collaborate with them, Isabella tightened her grip on her glass. She lowered her gaze and spoke softly. "She has someone who loves her deeply. Someone who gives her all the confidence in the world."

"Of course she's arrogant. That's only natural." She paused briefly before adding, "There are several highly capable individuals within the Kensington family."

Nathaniel knew she had been wanting to take action against the Kensingtons lately. But she never let him ask too many questions, perhaps not wanting to involve him too much in case things went wrong. Now that she had brought it up herself, he realized the situation wasn't progressing smoothly.

He leaned in closer, his voice dropping to a whisper. "Not going well?"

She had attempted to breach Kensington Tech's security system multiple times, but their defenses were significantly stronger than before. Despite her extreme caution, the IT experts Alexander had hired for the family had nearly traced the attempts back to her. It was clear Alexander was helping them guard against her.

With his vast wealth and extensive connections, Alexander could funnel endless resources, manpower, and capital into Kensington Tech. Whether through cyberattacks or other methods of sabotage, bringing down the Kensington family was proving nearly impossible. The reason no one in the Whitmore family could restrain him was simple: his empire was too colossal.

Rumors suggested that years ago, some analysts had already calculated that his personal wealth surpassed that of the entire Whitmore Group.

Though NovaTech had developed well in recent years, compared to Isabella and Nathaniel's personal fortunes, they were still on an entirely different level from Alexander. For him, propping up both InnovaTech and Kensington Tech simultaneously was hardly a challenge.

The thought made Nathaniel's jaw clench in frustration. Worried Isabella might act rashly, he advised quietly, "Don't rush it. Your chance will come."

"I know."

Neither felt like staying any longer. After lingering at the banquet for barely half an hour, they prepared to leave.

As they reached the hotel entrance and headed toward the parking lot, they spotted Alexander standing not far away with Victoria and Reginald. Alexander hadn't even attended the banquet. It was obvious he had come specifically to pick Victoria up.

At that moment, Alexander, Victoria, and Reginald noticed them too. Victoria's expression was cool, while Reginald frowned at the sight of Isabella. Alexander, however, gave them a polite nod.

Both Isabella and Nathaniel looked away, deliberately ignoring him.

Their car wasn't parked far from Alexander's. They had guessed correctly—he really had come just to fetch Victoria.

As they reached their vehicle, they saw Alexander and Victoria waving goodbye to Reginald. Then they got into the car together and drove off. It was late at night, and he was here to pick her up. They were probably already living together.

Thinking of this, Nathaniel pursed his lips and muttered, "Get some rest."

Isabella nodded. With that, they each got into their own cars and left.

To accelerate their project's progress, Isabella, Nathaniel, and several NovaTech engineers headed to the airport to meet with people from the Whitmore Group. They were preparing to travel to Edinburgh for system testing.

But just as they arrived at the airport and joined the group, they saw Alexander and Victoria there too.
###Chapter 495

Kieran Blackwood had also joined this round of system testing.
Isabella Sinclair didn't expect to see him here.
Her eyes paused on him briefly.
Kieran seemed equally surprised to find her with Alexander Whitmore.
Noticing her gaze, he turned away with deliberate indifference.
Isabella offered a faint smile at his coldness.
Her presence here wasn't about accompanying Alexander to Edinburgh.
She had her own business trip scheduled elsewhere.
"It's about time," she told Alexander. "I should get going now."
"I'll walk you over," he offered.
Isabella smiled lightly. "No need. It's just a few steps. Handle your business—I'll call after I land."
"Alright," he said.
Their exchange drew murmurs from both NovaTech and Fleming Group staff.
People quietly remarked on their apparent closeness.
Nathaniel Graves gave a soft, mocking laugh.
Isabella remained silent, her expression unreadable.
After greeting a few Fleming Group employees, she turned and left.
She didn't glance at Nathaniel or Isabella on her way out.

On the plane, Isabella and Alexander ended up seated across the aisle from each other.
Nathaniel needed to discuss matters with Sebastian Hayes.
Noticing their proximity, he asked quietly, "Will this be alright?"
Isabella shook her head. "It's fine."
Kieran sat beside her.
After settling in, he leaned over to speak with her in low tones.
His line of sight naturally included Alexander across the aisle.
Alexander sat with his phone, eyes fixed on the screen.
From takeoff to landing, he and Isabella didn't exchange a single word.
Only when he occasionally noticed her speaking with Kieran did his eyes flick over briefly.
Then he turned away again.

They arrived in Edinburgh and went straight to work that afternoon.
Their schedule was tight.
Since they'd arrived late, the day's tasks wrapped up past eight in the evening.
Progress hadn't gone smoothly.
Back at the hotel, Isabella continued working.
She sorted things out until past eleven.
Finally satisfied with her progress, she headed into the bathroom for a shower.

She had just finished when the doorbell rang.
Glancing at the display screen, she saw who stood outside.
Her hand, still towel-drying her hair, stilled momentarily.
After a brief hesitation, she walked over and opened the door.
"What is it?"
Her hair remained damp, strands falling over her shoulders.
Water droplets trailed down her slender neck into the collar of her robe.
Alexander's eyes flicked over her once before looking away.
"It's Sophia. She called."
He held out his phone.
Isabella took it and answered right there.
"Sophia?"
"Mom, I'm buying you a present! I didn't know what you'd like, and I couldn't reach you..."
Sophia chattered cheerfully over the line.
Isabella understood immediately.
"I see. I've been busy today. My phone must have died—I missed your calls. I'll check it soon. I'll let you know once I've picked."
"Okay!" Sophia hung up quickly.
Isabella handed the phone back to Alexander.
He gave a small nod. "Goodnight."
He was about to leave when Kieran appeared down the hall.
Kieran froze when he saw her standing there with Alexander.
###Chapter 496

Alexander paused when he saw Kieran approaching.

He recognized Kieran immediately.

His eyes narrowed slightly as he took in the situation.

Isabella stood in her robe, hair still damp from her shower.

Alexander's gaze lingered on her for a moment before turning away.

He didn't say a word as he walked down the hallway.

Kieran watched Alexander's retreating figure with a thoughtful expression.

He then turned his attention back to Isabella.

His brows furrowed as he put the pieces together.

Alexander had clearly been visiting her.

But why would Alexander Whitmore be here at this hour?

There shouldn't be any business between NovaTech and Alexander personally.

Even if there were, it should have been Sebastian from Whitmore Group contacting Nathaniel.

Not Alexander himself showing up at her hotel room.

Isabella noticed the questions in Kieran's eyes.

She could guess what he was thinking.

But she offered no explanation.

Instead, she simply asked, "It's late. Did you need something?"

Kieran snapped out of his thoughts.

"I had some ideas about the project," he said. "Wanted to discuss them with you."

Isabella nodded and stepped aside. "Come in."

Her suite was spacious and elegant, with a separate work area.

Kieran settled on the sofa but couldn't contain his curiosity.

"Why was Mr. Whitmore here so late?" he asked.

Then quickly added, "Not that it's any of my business. I was just surprised."

He had seen them together moments earlier.

Neither had looked uncomfortable or guilty.

That suggested nothing improper was happening.

Still, he couldn't understand Alexander's presence here.

Isabella opened her laptop, her expression neutral.

"It was a personal matter," she said quietly.

Kieran froze for a moment.

Then he remembered Victoria.

Of course. Isabella and Victoria had their history.

Was Alexander here to mediate between them?

The thought made Kieran reflect on his own reasons for joining NovaTech.

It had been connected to Victoria too.

But now, it all felt like distant history.

Isabella redirected the conversation to work matters.

Kieran had never considered any connection between her and Alexander.

Knowing her character, he couldn't imagine her involved with someone else's partner.

Since she called it personal and didn't elaborate, he assumed she didn't want to discuss Victoria.

He let the matter drop and focused on work.

Kieran had genuinely come with project ideas.

But if he claimed no personal motives, that wouldn't be entirely truthful.

As they discussed the technical details, his eyes kept drifting toward her.

Her wet hair clung to her neck in dark strands.

Tiny water droplets traced paths along her skin.

He felt his throat tighten.

Abruptly, he looked away and cleared his throat.

"Perhaps you should dry your hair first?" he suggested.

Isabella nodded. "Alright. Organize the notes from our discussion. I'll be right back."

She disappeared into the bedroom.

The sound of a hair dryer soon followed.

When she returned, they had just resumed their conversation when her phone chimed.

She picked it up and glanced at the screen.

A message from Alexander: "Sophia says you haven't replied to her yet."

Only then did Isabella remember Sophia's earlier call.

She typed a quick response: "Got it."
###Chapter 497

Isabella presented her solutions the next morning.

She had resolved all the technical issues from yesterday's test.

Everyone believed it would take two or three more days to fix.

She accomplished it overnight.

Sebastian and the NovaTech team were thrilled.

Kieran hadn't stayed long in her room last night.

Before leaving, he had asked about her progress.

She had already outlined her approach to him.

Watching everyone's surprised reactions now filled him with pride.

He couldn't help but smile.

Then his gaze drifted toward Alexander sitting across the room.

His smile gradually faded.

Alexander was watching Isabella with his head slightly turned.

A subtle smile played on his lips.

His eyes held clear admiration and interest.

Perhaps even something deeper.

Kieran pressed his lips together tightly.

He wasn't the only one who noticed.

Nathaniel, seated nearby, also paused in surprise.

The cooperation with Whitmore Group had been largely led by Isabella recently.

He had heard that during a recent meeting, Alexander had specifically come downstairs to hear her presentation.

But he had never witnessed it himself.

Seeing Alexander look at Isabella like this astonished him.

During the recent staff dinner, Sebastian and Daniel had also noticed Alexander's particular focus on Isabella.

At that time, they thought it was merely appreciation for talent.

But if it were only that, his gaze seemed too intense.

As Alexander's personal secretary, Daniel considered himself familiar with his relationship with Victoria.

Watching this now, his frown deepened more than anyone else's.

Alexander clearly cared about Victoria.

So why was he looking at Isabella this way?

Unaware of the swirling thoughts around her, Isabella finished her presentation.

She quietly returned to her seat.

But Kieran noticed Alexander's gaze still followed her.

His expression darkened immediately.

Nathaniel discreetly glanced at Alexander.

He leaned slightly toward Isabella and murmured, "The way Alexander just looked at you was... unusual."

Isabella blinked, puzzled. "What do you mean?"

Nathaniel hesitated for a moment.

After a pause, he said, "It seems he doesn't really know you at all."

Isabella lowered her eyes.

She answered softly, "Yes."

Alexander had never cared about her.

He knew very little about her life.

Nathaniel assumed he must have been unaware of her strength in AI until now.

He was probably just surprised to discover it.

At that, Nathaniel pressed his lips together and said no more.

But Kieran couldn't forget Alexander's look during the meeting.

All day long, he paid attention to Alexander's movements whenever possible.

Yet through the day, Alexander made no unusual gestures.

Between him and Isabella, there was no interaction beyond work requirements.

Seeing this, Kieran began to think he had imagined things.

The system issue had been resolved in time.

That day's work proceeded smoothly.

They had been working for nearly half a month.

With the problem solved, the group went to a bar to celebrate that evening.

Alexander hosted, so nearly everyone from Whitmore Group and NovaTech attended.

Isabella initially had no intention of going.

But realizing she hadn't relaxed in a long time, she decided to join them.
###Chapter 498

Alexander was meant to join them too, but a last-minute issue kept him away.

That evening, Nathaniel was technically the host.

But when he reached the bar, he only exchanged brief pleasantries before excusing himself, citing another engagement.

Benjamin, who had several close friends in Edinburgh, was quickly pulled away when they came looking for him.

Isabella, unfamiliar with Benjamin's circle, followed him to say hello but didn't linger in their private booth.

She returned to the NovaTech staff and others, dancing for over half an hour before finally settling back into her seat to chat.

She was undeniably striking.

Once seated, men kept approaching, asking her to drink with them.

She declined each one without hesitation.

Most took the hint and left quietly.

A couple proved more persistent.

One, a slick man with a shy yet arrogant air, frowned.

"Pretty lady, you're not local, are you? Don't you know who I am? Won't you just have a little drink with me?"

Another chimed in, sneering.

"Exactly. Don't you bother to ask around about who Mr. Lugo is? He personally comes over to invite you, and you just snub him? Are you sure you want to offend him?"

Isabella's brows knit together.

Though Nathaniel hadn't spent time with his staff or the NovaTech crowd since arriving, he was still in a VIP room upstairs.

His booth had a clear view of the main floor.

Isabella's beauty was impossible to overlook.

Even the two executives speaking with Nathaniel had noticed her, and the scene unfolding below.

One remarked, "Quite a view down there."

The other gave a short laugh.

"Plenty of eyesores in that view, too. And..."

He trailed off, but the meaning was clear—trouble was brewing.

They knew Tobias Lugo.

In Edinburgh, his family name carried weight.

While Isabella had her group around her, that might not be enough.

Alexander glanced toward the floor, then turned his head slightly in Daniel's direction.

Daniel instantly understood.

Back when Isabella worked at Whitmore Group, Alexander had paid her little mind.

But over the past two years, he had doted on their daughter Sophia.

Daniel knew well that while divorce papers might be looming, Alexander had never interfered with Sophia's bond with her mother.

In other words, even if Alexander didn't care for Isabella, even if he was cold to her, even if he could ignore her entanglements with Benjamin, he would never sit by and watch some shady man harass the mother of his child.

With that thought, Daniel gave a nearly imperceptible nod and slipped downstairs before the situation escalated.

"Mr. Lugo, isn't it?" he said smoothly once he arrived. "I'm Daniel Prescott, secretary to Mr. Whitmore of Whitmore Group."

Whitmore Group was one of the country's most powerful conglomerates.

Even if Alexander wasn't an Edinburgh native, Tobias could hardly claim ignorance of the name.

At Daniel's words, Tobias glanced up toward the VIP rooms.

Spotting Alexander and his companions watching from above, his expression shifted.

A moment later, though clearly reluctant, he backed down and stalked off.

With the crisis averted, Daniel cast Isabella a brief look, then turned and left just as quietly as he had come.

The NovaTech group all exhaled in relief.

"Good thing Mr. Whitmore had someone step in. Otherwise..."

Isabella listened in silence, her expression cool and unreadable.
###Chapter 499

About ten minutes later, Isabella headed to the restroom with a couple of colleagues.

She pushed the door open and saw someone inside. She was about to apologize and step back when a hand suddenly clamped over her mouth and nose.

Before she could struggle, her vision blurred and her consciousness slipped away.

The person who grabbed her was quickly joined by a woman waiting just outside.

They hastily disguised Isabella and supported her out of the restroom. Carefully avoiding NovaTech’s security, they made their way outside.

Just as they were about to push her into a waiting car, their path was abruptly blocked.

At that moment, Alexander’s phone rang.

After a brief call, he stood up and told the executives beside him, “Something’s come up. We’ll continue this another time.”

Daniel noticed his abrupt departure and quickly followed.

By the time they reached the street, the kidnappers had already been subdued.

Daniel was startled to see Isabella unconscious, but he quickly understood the situation.

What puzzled him was—when had Alexander arranged all this?

The men outside stepped forward respectfully. “Mr. Whitmore, we’ve apprehended them.”

Alexander glanced at the unconscious Isabella, walked over, and wordlessly lifted her into his arms.

He carried her straight to the car.

Daniel paused, then hurried after them.

No sooner had Alexander settled Isabella in the back seat than her phone rang from her purse.

The two engineers from NovaTech had grown worried when she didn’t return from the restroom.

After searching and not finding her, they immediately called.

Alexander didn’t answer.

He adjusted Isabella against him, then simply ended the call.

The engineers, now even more concerned, immediately contacted Nathaniel.

Alarmed, Nathaniel dialed Isabella’s number himself.

This time, Alexander answered.

“Isabella, are you—” Nathaniel began, but was cut off.

“She fainted. I’m taking her back to the hotel,” Alexander stated flatly.

Nathaniel froze. “Alexander?”

“Mm.” Then he added, “I’m hanging up now.”

“You—” Nathaniel tried to protest, but the line had already gone dead.

In the front seat, Daniel watched the rearview mirror. Seeing Alexander still holding Isabella, he started to speak, but the privacy divider slowly rose, blocking his view.

Daniel stared in surprise, speechless.

The hotel wasn’t far, but the drive still took about half an hour.

Alexander carried Isabella out.

Daniel noticed her clothes were still neat, though her lipstick was slightly smudged.

It looked like she had been kissed—or perhaps it was just smeared during the struggle. He couldn’t be sure.

Without explanation, Alexander took her straight upstairs. Daniel had no choice but to follow.
###Chapter 500

The elevator doors slid shut.

Alexander pressed only his floor button.

Daniel hesitated before speaking. "I shouldn't accompany you further."

Alexander gave a brief nod. "Understood."

Daniel then selected his own floor.

Morning light streamed through the hotel corridors.

Alexander emerged from a room wearing a bathrobe.

Last night's clothes were draped over his arm.

He shut the door firmly behind him.

Victoria stepped out of the elevator just then.

Her face brightened when she saw Alexander.

But her smile froze mid-greeting.

Her eyes caught the shirt on his arm.

Vivid lipstick stains marked both collar and shoulder.

All words died in her throat.

Alexander turned the corner without noticing her.

A door opened and closed down the hall.

Victoria stood motionless, stunned.

Her gaze dropped to the room number.

Daniel had clearly said Alexander was in 2503.

She checked the keycard he'd given her.

It definitely said 2503.

So why was Alexander leaving 2508?

Her lips pressed into a thin line.

She pulled out her phone and called Daniel. "Who's in 2508?"

Daniel sounded surprised by her question. "Ms. Sinclair."

Confirmation struck her like a physical blow.

Her fingers tightened around the phone.

She took a sharp breath. "What happened these past two days?"

Nothing could explain Alexander emerging from Isabella's room at dawn.

Wearing a bathrobe. Carrying yesterday's clothes.

Daniel reluctantly explained last night's events.

He concluded with, "After returning to the hotel, Mr. Whitmore dismissed me. I don't know what occurred between them afterward."

Victoria ended the call without another word.

She stood frozen for a long moment.

Then she moved mechanically toward Alexander's room.

Meanwhile, Isabella woke with a throbbing headache.

Her mind felt foggy and disoriented.

Memories of the bar restroom flooded back.

The hand covering her mouth. The chemical smell.

She bolted upright in bed, fully awake.

Panic surged through her as she scanned the room.

Recognition slowly dawned.

This was her own hotel room.

She blinked in confusion.

Had it all been a nightmare?

But her body felt heavy with residual fatigue.

She reached for her phone to call Nathaniel.

It rang before she could dial.

Nathaniel's voice came through. "You're awake?"

"My head is pounding," she murmured. "Someone attacked me in the restroom. I think I passed out. But I'm back in my room now. What happened?"

Nathaniel hesitated before answering. "Alexander saved you."

He gave a brief account of events.

Isabella's hand stilled against her temple.

A strange stillness settled over her.
###Chapter 501

Nathaniel's voice came through the phone once more. "How are you feeling now? Any discomfort? If you're not well, we can reschedule this morning's meeting—"

"I'm fine."

Isabella's response was quick. She suddenly realized she wasn't wearing yesterday's clothes anymore. Her own silk pajamas felt familiar against her skin. Her body felt clean and refreshed—someone had bathed her.

She didn't know if Alexander had asked hotel staff to assist her, or if... It wasn't something she could discuss with Nathaniel anyway.

After exchanging a few more words, she ended the call.

Seeing how late it had gotten, Isabella didn't waste time dwelling on last night. She washed up, touched up her makeup, grabbed her bag, and stepped out of the room.

The moment she did, she came face-to-face with Alexander and Victoria.

Isabella's steps faltered.

Alexander and Victoria stopped as well.

The moment Victoria saw Isabella, her expression turned icy.

"Isabella."

Just then, Nathaniel also stepped out of his room. Seeing Victoria and Alexander together, his jaw tightened as he walked directly over.

Isabella withdrew her gaze.

Alexander greeted him calmly. "Mr. Graves."

Nathaniel didn't know when Victoria had arrived in Edinburgh. But seeing her standing with Alexander, and hearing Alexander greet him so casually, Nathaniel ignored him altogether.

He spoke only to Isabella. "Isabella, let's go."

She took the lead, heading toward the elevators.

At that moment, Kieran also happened to step out of his room. Spotting Alexander, Victoria, Isabella, and Nathaniel all waiting for elevators at the same time, he paused in surprise.

But since Isabella and Nathaniel were standing at a different set of elevators, apart from Alexander and Victoria, the scene looked almost as if they weren't acquainted at all.

Kieran didn't spare much attention for Alexander or Victoria. He went straight to Isabella and Nathaniel, entering the same elevator as them.

Downstairs, Isabella and the other NovaTech engineers gathered at the hotel entrance.

On the other side, a fashionable young woman standing with a group glanced over, then waved with a smile when she saw Alexander and Victoria arriving. "Victoria, over here."

Alexander and Victoria walked toward her.

Just then, the car that was to take Isabella and Nathaniel arrived. Neither of them spared Alexander and Victoria another glance, boarding first and leaving.

Alexander did attend the morning meeting, but Victoria did not accompany him.

Nathaniel couldn't help but remark sarcastically. "That really is rare." He had assumed Victoria would follow along.

Isabella kept her silence.

The morning's work went smoothly. As long as there were no surprises, after one more busy afternoon, they would be able to return to Fairview that same evening.

At noon, after finishing the morning's work, the people from Fleming Group and NovaTech went to a restaurant together.

Alexander did not go with them.

Smiling, Sebastian explained. "Ms. Kensington's best friend just returned from overseas, so Mr. Whitmore is busy hosting her today. That's why he won't be joining us for lunch."

Hearing this, Nathaniel smiled without warmth. "Mr. Whitmore certainly keeps himself busy."

Sebastian didn't catch the irony in his tone. Thinking he was simply teasing about how close Alexander and Victoria were, he laughed.

"Isn't that right?"

The afternoon schedule also went smoothly. Once work was done, they boarded their flight back to Fairview that same night, just as planned.

From what Sebastian said, Alexander seemed to have another project to discuss. That day, both he and Victoria stayed behind, not returning with them on the same flight.
###Chapter 502

Isabella returned from Edinburgh with two days off.
She spent the first day completely resting.
On the second morning, just after breakfast, her phone rang.
It was Alexander.
She glanced at the screen before answering.
"What is it?"
"Grandmother was discharged from the hospital two days ago. She wants you to come to Whitmore Manor for lunch."
Isabella already knew about Eleanor's discharge.
She had been away on business in Edinburgh and couldn't pick her up personally.
"Understood," she replied.

She was about to hang up when Alexander spoke again.
"I'll come get you now."
"No need, I'll drive myself—"
"Sophia insists on coming with me to pick you up. She's already putting her shoes on."
Isabella paused.
"...Alright."
"We'll be there shortly."
She didn't respond, so Alexander ended the call.

About thirty minutes later, Alexander and Sophia arrived at the Sinclair residence.
The rest of the Sinclair family was out.
When Sophia saw Isabella, she happily jumped out of the car and ran over for a hug.
"Mommy!"
Alexander lowered the window from the driver's seat and turned to look at them.

Once in the car, Sophia clung to Isabella.
She chattered about all the fun things she'd done recently.
She mentioned that the gift she bought was already waiting at Whitmore Manor.
While Isabella talked with Sophia, Alexander focused solely on driving.
When Sophia finished her stories, he glanced back at Isabella.
"Have you been resting these past two days?"
"Yes," she answered.
There wasn't much else to say between them.
So Alexander didn't initiate further conversation during the drive.

Eleanor had always been particularly fond of Isabella.
She was overjoyed to see her arrive at Whitmore Manor.
Seeing how much better Eleanor looked, Isabella felt relieved.
Alexander was quite busy.
While Isabella kept Eleanor company and chatted with her, his phone hardly stopped ringing.

After lunch, Isabella originally planned to stay a bit longer before heading home in the afternoon.
But outside, a heavy downpour began.
It didn't let up for quite some time.
Since Eleanor had only just recovered and was still weak, she went upstairs for her afternoon nap.
Alexander turned to Isabella.
"If you're tired, go upstairs and rest too."
Before she could answer, Sophia tugged her hand and pulled her upstairs.

Instead of going to Alexander's room, Isabella followed Sophia into her room.
When she had cleared out her things from Alexander's house, she had taken almost everything.
But here at Whitmore Manor, she hadn't removed her belongings.
So there were still several sets of her clothes in Sophia's wardrobe.

As Isabella searched for pajamas to change into, there was a knock at the door.
She turned her head.
Before she could speak, Alexander stood at the doorway.
He saw her rifling through Sophia's closet.
Realizing she must be looking for sleepwear, he didn't comment.
His eyes shifted to the bed where Sophia lay.
"Is she asleep?"
He nodded lightly.
"Rest well."
With that, he gently closed the door and walked away.

It had been a long time since Isabella last stayed at Whitmore Manor.
She thought she wouldn't be able to fall asleep.
Yet not long after lying down beside Sophia, she drifted off without realizing.

When she woke, her temples ached slightly from sleeping too long.
Sophia was no longer in the room.
After washing up, she went downstairs.
She didn't see Eleanor or Sophia.
Only Alexander sat in the living room, reading.

He noticed her coming down.
He closed the book in his hand and lifted his gaze to her.
"You're awake."
###Chapter 503

Isabella Sinclair enjoyed two days off after returning from Edinburgh.

She spent the first day completely resting.

On the second morning, just after finishing breakfast.

Her phone rang.

It was Alexander Whitmore calling.

Isabella glanced at the screen before answering. "What is it?"

"Grandma was discharged from the hospital two days ago. She wants you to come to Whitmore Manor for lunch."

Isabella already knew about Eleanor's discharge. She had been away on business in Edinburgh at the time and couldn't personally pick her up from the hospital.

"Understood," Isabella replied.

Just as she was about to hang up, Alexander added, "I'll come pick you up."

"No need, I'll drive myself—"

"Sophia insists on coming with me to get you. She's already putting her shoes on." Alexander interrupted her.

Isabella paused. "...Alright."

"We'll be there shortly."

Isabella remained silent, so Alexander ended the call.

About thirty minutes later, Alexander and Sophia arrived at the Sinclair residence.

The rest of the Sinclair family wasn't home. When Sophia saw Isabella, she happily jumped out of the car, ran over, and hugged her. "Mom!"

From the driver's seat, Alexander lowered the window and turned to look at them.

Once inside the car, Sophia clung to Isabella, chattering about her recent adventures. She mentioned that the gift she bought was already waiting at Whitmore Manor.

While Isabella talked with Sophia, Alexander focused solely on driving. When Sophia finished her stories, he glanced back at Isabella. "You've been resting these past two days?"

"Yes," she answered.

Little else passed between them. Alexander didn't initiate further conversation during the drive.

Eleanor had always been particularly fond of Isabella. Seeing her arrive at Whitmore Manor brought her immense joy.

Noting how much better Eleanor looked, Isabella felt genuinely relieved.

Alexander remained quite busy—while Isabella kept Eleanor company and chatted with her, his phone hardly stopped ringing.

After lunch, Isabella originally planned to stay a bit longer before heading home in the afternoon. But outside, a heavy downpour began and showed no signs of stopping.

Since Eleanor had only just recovered and still felt weak, she went upstairs for her afternoon nap.

Alexander then said to Isabella, "If you're tired, go upstairs and rest too."

Before she could answer, Sophia tugged on her hand and pulled her upstairs.

Instead of going to Alexander's room, Isabella followed Sophia into hers.

When she had cleared out her things from Alexander's house, she had taken almost everything.

But here at Whitmore Manor, she hadn't removed her belongings. Several sets of her clothes still remained in Sophia's wardrobe.

As Isabella searched for pajamas to change into, a knock sounded at the door.

She turned her head. Before she could speak, Alexander, standing in the doorway, saw her rifling through Sophia's closet.

Realizing she must be looking for sleepwear, he made no comment.

His eyes shifted to the bed where Sophia lay. "She's asleep?"

Isabella nodded lightly.

"Rest well," he said.

With that, he gently closed the door and walked away.

It had been a long time since Isabella last stayed at Whitmore Manor. She thought she wouldn't be able to fall asleep, yet shortly after lying down beside Sophia, she drifted off unconsciously.

When she woke, perhaps from sleeping too long, her temples throbbed slightly. Sophia was no longer in the room.

After washing up, she went downstairs but didn't see Eleanor or Sophia—only Alexander sat in the living room, reading.

Noticing her descent, he closed his book and lifted his gaze. "You're awake."
###Chapter 504

The flooding intensified.

Whitmore Manor remained relatively unaffected due to its elevated position.

But as darkness fell, cellular signals became increasingly unreliable.

Based on the severe weather alert Isabella received that afternoon, returning to NovaTech tomorrow seemed unlikely.

After dinner, she informed the Sinclair family of her safety.

She then contacted Nathaniel to explain her situation at Whitmore Manor.

Nathaniel responded, "The conditions are quite severe. NovaTech has authorized remote work for tomorrow. There's no need to rush back. I'll manage any urgent matters. We can reconnect tomorrow."

"Understood."

Isabella settled on the floor with Sophia, engaging with puzzle toys.

Alexander remained on the sofa, immersed in his reading.

Over an hour later, he approached them.

Isabella kept her focus downward, but Sophia glanced up. "Daddy? What is it?"

Alexander's attention remained fixed on Isabella. "Care for a game of chess?"

She did enjoy chess. And he was undoubtedly a skilled opponent.

Normally, she would accept such a challenge.

But with him...

She gave a slight head shake. "Not interested."

Alexander didn't press further. He simply changed topics. "If you're bored, perhaps you'd prefer reading upstairs?"

"Upstairs" clearly meant either his bedroom or study.

Isabella's expression remained neutral. "No, thank you."

He showed no offense, merely offering a light chuckle. "Have you reviewed the latest journals?"

"No." She had purchased the physical copies but hadn't found time to read them.

Without another word, he turned and ascended the staircase.

He returned shortly with several books in his arms.

Placing them before her, he waited.

Isabella hesitated momentarily before finally looking up. "Thank you."

"You're welcome."

She opened one volume and began reading beside Sophia.

Alexander didn't disturb her further.

That night, she stayed in Sophia's room, sleeping with the child.

Alexander made no attempt to interrupt them.

The next morning, she found him on a phone call downstairs.

After breakfast, Nathaniel called to discuss work matters.

Without her computer, Isabella asked Richard if she could borrow one.

Richard explained he rarely used computers, and his had broken down last year without replacement.

Alexander silently went upstairs and returned with a laptop.

He set it before her, entering the password while simultaneously telling it to her.

The device was clearly his work computer.

Her tasks involved confidential company information.

She could verify everything before and after usage to prevent leaks.

But Alexander's technical expertise matched her own.

She didn't fully comprehend his capabilities.

His offer to lend his personal work computer might indicate trust.

But for her...

Isabella pushed the laptop back toward him. "Thank you, but no. I'll use my phone."

Alexander seemed to understand her hesitation.

When she refused the laptop, he simply smiled and nodded.

He didn't insist.

Closing the lid, he picked it up and quietly returned upstairs.
###Chapter 505

Nathaniel's assistance made things manageable even without a laptop.

But that afternoon, an urgent matter arose at NovaTech requiring Isabella's immediate attention.

Without proper equipment, handling it became challenging.

Viewing NovaTech files on her phone, Isabella regretted declining Alexander's laptop offer that morning.

The situation demanded swift action.

She ascended the stairs and paused outside Alexander's study.

After a brief hesitation, she knocked.

"Enter."

Alexander sat at his desk, engrossed in work. He glanced up as she opened the door.

He showed no surprise at her appearance.

Before she spoke, he anticipated her need. "Require the laptop?"

Standing by the doorway, Isabella responded, "...Yes."

Alexander smiled and slid the laptop toward her, gesturing for her to take it.

Isabella stepped inside.

She avoided looking around, moving directly to his desk to retrieve the laptop. "Thank you."

Alexander simply smiled without replying.

Isabella said nothing more. She turned and exited with the laptop.

As she left, she heard him say "Continue" to his screen, realizing he was mid-meeting.

Isabella returned to Sophia's room to work.

Sophia wanted to play, but seeing Isabella too preoccupied to respond, she grew slightly sulky.

Alexander entered then.

Sophia hugged a pillow and sighed. "Dad, Mom's so busy..."

Alexander hummed in acknowledgment. He pulled a chair beside Isabella and sat.

The movement made Isabella glance sideways. Seeing him, she remained silent and resumed work.

Since the screen displayed NovaTech materials, Alexander glimpsing it posed no issue.

He had his own tasks but stayed awhile, watching with interest.

After sufficient time passed, he departed, though regret lingered in his eyes.

Isabella's workload extended late into the evening.

During dinner, she sat beside Alexander. "I have more to finish tonight. Do you need the laptop?"

"No, keep using it."

"Alright."

Their smooth interaction pleased Eleanor. Noting Isabella's slim figure, she urged her to eat more.

After dinner, Isabella returned upstairs to work.

Alexander didn't disturb her, staying downstairs to play with Sophia.

Around 9:00 PM, after Sophia's shower and bedtime preparations, she noticed her mother still working, keyboard tapping softly.

Not complaining about noise, Sophia suddenly recalled past habits. "Mom, why not work in your and Dad's room?"

Previously, Isabella always worked in their shared room, not Sophia's.

Isabella's hands paused on the keyboard. After two seconds, she replied, "Working here is fine." She added, "Apologies for disturbing your rest."

"You're not disturbing me." Sophia yawned. "I'll sleep now. Rest early too, Mom. Good night."

"Mm, good night."

Isabella switched off Sophia's main light.
###Chapter 506

Isabella finished her work well past ten.

Autumn had arrived with a chill.

The recent rains had brought a sharp drop in temperature.

She had been sitting at her desk for hours.

A cold shiver ran through her body.

She sneezed repeatedly as she closed her laptop.

She stood up to take a shower.

After washing up, her nose started running.

Her throat felt dry and burning.

She realized she was catching a cold.

The manor staff were already asleep.

She went downstairs to make some tea.

The warm drink provided slight relief.

She took cold medicine after finishing the tea.

Her body felt warmer and somewhat better.

But exhaustion weighed heavily on her.

She had no energy for conversation.

She heard Alexander's voice. "Still awake?"

She turned her head. "About to sleep."

"I'm going back to sleep," she murmured.

She returned to Sophia's room and fell asleep quickly.

She dreamed of Sophia's voice. "Mom, you're burning up..."

Footsteps entered the room moments later.

She tried to open her eyes but couldn't.

Her head felt unbearably heavy.

She sank back into dazed sleep.

When she woke again, her head throbbed painfully.

Her body felt weak and drained.

Her throat burned with fever.

She tried to get up for water.

Someone came over to support her.

"Want some water?"

She froze and slowly opened her eyes.

Alexander stood before her.

He turned to pour water for her.

He handed her the cup moments later.

She accepted it instinctively.

Her throat hurt too much to speak.

She managed a few sips.

He turned to the room phone. "Bring the soup up."

The water cleared her head slightly.

She set the cup on the nightstand.

Then she froze in realization.

This wasn't Sophia's room.

She was in Alexander's bedroom.

He had been taking care of her.

An open book lay on the nearby table.

She looked away as he hung up the phone.

"Ten minutes ago, your fever was 39.8 degrees."

"I've called Dr. Carter. He should be here soon."

She wanted to respond but looked at the window instead.

The sky remained gloomy outside.

Rain continued to fall steadily.

She remembered her morning meeting.

"What time is it now?"

"8:20 am."

It was still early.

She sighed in relief.

He asked, "Want your phone?"

She hummed in agreement.

Alexander went to Sophia's room to fetch it.

Richard arrived with the soup.

She tried to get up to wash up.

A loud rumbling sound came from outside.

She froze in confusion.

Richard chuckled. "That should be Dr. Carter."

He explained with a smile. "The rain has eased but roads remain blocked."

"Your fever was too high. Alexander arranged a helicopter for Dr. Carter."

He reminded her to rest before leaving.
###Chapter 507

Richard had just turned to leave when Alexander brought Isabella's phone over from Sophia's room.

Taking it from his hand, Isabella didn't lift her head. She only spoke softly. "Thank you."

Alexander said nothing.

Isabella got out of bed. She intended to go to Sophia's room to wash up.

Seeming to read her intention, Alexander stood there watching her. Then he spoke. "There's a toothbrush and cup here too."

Isabella's steps paused. Since she had already rested here, washing up here didn't seem to make much difference.

After a brief hesitation, she turned and went into Alexander's bathroom.

While she was brushing her teeth, Gregory arrived.

After she was done washing up, Gregory examined her. He carefully asked about her condition. Then he set up an IV drip for her. He also gave Alexander detailed instructions on what to watch for in the days ahead.

After Gregory left, Alexander brought over the soup that Richard had prepared.

Isabella hesitated briefly before reaching out to take it. "Thank you."

"It's okay."

She was running a high fever now. She felt utterly awful with no appetite at all. But she still forced herself to eat slowly.

While drinking the soup, she suddenly thought of something. Turning her head slightly, she looked at Alexander sitting not far away watching her. She asked in a hoarse voice. "Where's Sophia?"

"She's downstairs. Both Sophia and Grandma are very worried about you. But children are fragile. Grandma hasn't fully recovered yet either. I was afraid they'd catch it from you. So I didn't let them come up."

Isabella managed half a bowl before she couldn't eat any more.

Seeing how hard it was for her, Alexander didn't insist. He took the bowl from her hand. He pulled a tissue and handed it over for her to wipe her mouth.

"If you're not comfortable, just rest. Once the IV's done, I'll call Dr. Whitmore back up."

"Thank you."

Alexander said nothing.

Even though she was exhausted, before sleeping, Isabella still sent a message to Nathaniel. She let him know about her condition.

Nathaniel learned that she had such a high fever. He was very worried too. He told her to focus on getting her health back. As for work, they would talk about it after she recovered.

Putting her phone down, Isabella was about to drift off. Her gaze unintentionally landed on Alexander sitting not far away. He was still working on his laptop.

She looked at him for a moment before closing her eyes to rest.

It was more than two hours later when she woke up again.

Her whole body was drenched in sweat. Her clothes were soaked through.

At some point, the IV had finished. But Alexander was still there keeping watch.

Seeing her awake, he closed his laptop and walked over.

"How are you feeling?"

"Warm."

More precisely, she felt warm and cold at the same time. But the damp clothes clinging to her were unbearable. So she got up and went to the bathroom to change.

When she came back out, Alexander handed her a thermometer.

"I checked your temperature twice earlier. First it dropped quite a bit. But then it started climbing again. Dr. Whitmore said that's normal. The timing's about right now. Let's test again."

Isabella took it. "Okay."

Though still weak, she felt somewhat better than before.

Glancing at Alexander's laptop on the desk, she spoke. "I can take care of myself now. Go ahead with your work."

At that, Alexander looked at her for a moment but didn't reply.

Just then, his phone rang.

He went over to pick it up. Then he answered the call and stepped out of the room.
