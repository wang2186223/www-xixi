Warning ###This story contains explicit sexual content, coarse language.and potentially provocative scenes. Viewer discretion is advised.###

Ella Rossi sat at the dining table, the bitter taste of the medicine she just took still lingering in her mouth despite the water she drank.

Her long hair flowed down her back, her skin glowing with health, and her silk pajamas hugged her figure perfectly.

It was Valentine's Day. Last month, when she came back to the Smith Villa,Arthur Smith had promised he'd be home to spend it with her.

As the sky outside darkened, Arthurstill hadn't shown up.

After a moment of hesitation, she dialed his number.

It rang for what felt like forever.

Just as she was about to hang up, someone answered.

"Hello? Who is this?" A woman's voice.

Ella stammered, "I must have dialed the wrong number,sorry."


Just as she was about to hang up, she heard Arthur's voice,"Who was that?



"She said she called the wrong number."

And then the call ended.

Staring at the familiar number on the screen, Ella knew she hadn't dialed wrong.

The woman's voice was unmistakable; it was Ava Davis, the woman Arthur had always had a thing for. Ava had just come back to the country last month, and it seemed like she and Arthur had reconnected pretty quickly. No wonder he'd been leaving early and coming home late recently.

Looking at the table full of food. Ella managed a bitter smile.

To be healthier and get pregnant, she'd been taking medicine year after year.

But sadly. Arthur didn't even want to sleep with her. Everytime they had sex. it felt like he was just going through the motions.

For today, she'd gone all out. A month ago,she started learning to cook from the housekeeper.

He probably wouldn't come back today, would he?

Deep down, Ella knew he wouldn't come back even on such an important day,but she still held onto a sliver of hope for Arthur.

"Just wait for him tonight," Ella murmured.

The clock on the wall ticked away, and the hands moved past midnight.

Arthur still hadn't returned, and Ella sat at the dining table all night.

As Valentine's Day passed, she finally went back to the bedroom,disappointed.

All night, Ella couldn't sleep; her mind was filled with thoughts of Arthur.

The Rossi family and the Smith family went way back, and Arthur's grandmother, Sophia Wilson, liked her a lot. It was Sophia who brought Arthur and Ella together.
When she first found out she was going to marry Arthur, she was excited for an entire night. It was all because of this well-kept little secret. When she met Arthur at eighteen,she had fallen for him hard.

She thought marrying Arthur was a dream come true, but didn't expect him to have a thing for Ava.

Back then, because Sophia didn't like Ava, she forced her and Arthur apart by giving Ava money.

In the end, Ava took the money and went abroad, which gave Ella the chance to marry Arthur.

They'd been married for five years, but their relationship was more like that of strangers.

This time, she didn't want to hold on anymore.

She didn't know how long it had been before she fell asleep, and even in her dreams,everything was about Arthur.

In the middle of the night, a large hand touched her shoulder.

Under the dim light, Ella's figure was particularly alluring.

Arthur, reeking of alcohol, leaned in close, kissed her ear, and let his hand wander down, finally stopping at her most intimate spot.

By now, Ella was wide awake.

Arthur knew her body well and could easily ignite her desires.

"If you're awake, don't pretend to be asleep," Arthur said, grabbing Ella and laying her flat on the bed.

He roughly tore off her nightgown and unbuckled his belt with one hand.

He released himself and, without a second thought, thrust into her with reckless force.

Without any foreplay. Ella was dry and unprepared.


She couldn't handle the violent thrust and cried out as he entered her body.

"Arthur, slow down, it hurts," Ella pleaded,pushing against his chest.

Arthur chuckled and leaned over her.

One hand pinned her hands above her head, while the other teased her nipple. which gradually responded to the stimulation.

Ella whimpered,her resistance fading.

Sensing her arousal, Arthur began to thrust harder, each movement hitting her deep.

"Ava..." Arthur mumbled, drunk and unaware.

Ella stiffened,her desire vanishing instantly.

He was treating her like she was Ava.

Feeling Arthur's growing arousal, Ella felt a wave of disgust.

She struggled violently. "Arthur, you bastard, look at who I am!"

Her efforts were futile. Arthur commanded, "Don't move! Turn around and kneel."

She knew Arthur liked this position, and she used to comply willingly.

But now, she just wanted it to be over.

Arthur withdrew,leaving the sheets soaked.

Without waiting for her response, he grabbed her waist and lifted her to the edge of the bed.

Seeing her attempt to escape. Arthur held her slender waist with one hand and guided himself back in with the other.

Then came a series of violent thrusts, the sound of their union echoing in the quiet room.

Ella knew she couldn't escape. Tears welled up in her eyes as she endured it all


Despite Arthur's roughness, she couldn't deny a trace of pleasure.

She bit her lip, trying not to make any more embarrassing sounds.

She didn't know how long it had been before Arthur paused briefly,then began thrusting even more violently.

Ella couldn't help but cry out, her voice soft and low.

If he hadn't been holding her waist, she would have collapsed from exhaustion.

After what felt like an eternity, Arthur finished, releasing himself inside her.

Ella's body trembled, taking a while to calm down.

Afterward,Arthur grabbed some tissues to clean up, while Ella lay weakly on the bed.

It took her a while to gather the strength to walk to the bathroom, her legs shaking, and she cleaned hersel up.
Looking at herself in the mirror, her cheeks were flushed.

Returning to the bedroom, Ella lay back down, and Arthur had already settled in bed.

Seeing her return, he moved closer and fed her the medicine.

Every time after they had sex, Arthur always gave her birth control pills to prevent pregnancy.

This time, Arthur was very drunk. After putting the pilI in her mouth,he lay back down.

Ella hesitated for a moment, then grabbed a tissue and spat it out.


She wanted a child, hoping that maybe this time, she would get pregnant.
###Chapter 2

The next morning. Ella woke up early.

Arthur was still out cold next to her.

The soreness in her body was a constant reminder of what happened yesterday.

She could deal with Arthur not loving her, but hearing him call out another woman's name during sex? That was too much.

Arthur looked so peaceful while he slept. Ella reached out and traced his eyebrows and eyes in the air.

After one last look at him, she made up her mind and walked out of the bedroom.


She had packed her bags last night, thinking Arthur wouldn't come back.

After living here for so long, it was sad that only this small amount of stuff was truly hers.

Taking a deep breath, Ella signed the divorce papers she had prepared and left them on the table.

Leaving the villa area, Ella called a cab to Worry-Free Studio.

She and Lily Martin had started this studio together.

But later, she chose family over her career, leaving Lily to run the studio on her own.

When the cab stopped, Ella paid the fare and got out.

The door to Worry-Free Studio was already open, and she still hadn't figured out how to talk with Lily. She bit her lip, picked up her suitcase, and walked in.

Ella didn't see Lily in the studio.

There was just a young girl cleaning. When she saw Ella, she looked surprised and then asked tentatively, "Ella?"

Ella was caught off guard, not expecting the girl to recognize her. "Yeah, it's me. Do you know me?"


The girI shook her head and pointed to the desk behind her. "There's a photo of you."

Following her gaze, Ella saw a framed photo on the desk.

It was a picture of her and Lily.

"Lily went out for training and won't be back until next week. I'm Emily Lewis, Lily's assistant." Emily stood there, nervously looking at Ella.

Ella frowned; she hadn't heard about this.

Thinking back, she took out her phone and checked her chat history with Lily.


The last message was about Lily going for training, but Ella hadn't replied at the time,probably busy with something else.

Ella guiltily put away her phone. "I see."

Emily smiled and went back to cleaning.

She had known there was another boss at the studio,but had only heard Lily mention her. Today, she finally met her in person.

Ella sat on the sofa, feeling Emily's gaze.

"Did Lily leave any instructions before she left?" Emily nodded and handed her a booklet. "Lily said if you came, to give you this booklet. You'll understand."

Ella took the booklet and started flipping through it, her smile freezing instantly.


'How many orders had she taken on!'

Ella sighed,feeling grateful for Lily's hard work during this time.

It seemed her future lifewouldn't be boring.

"Got it. You can go back to your work." Ella took her suitcase and the booklet into the office.

Looking at the familiar place, Ella smiled.

She hadn't done any design work in a long time.

In college, she was a design genius everyone envied, while Lily had a geat talent for business.


So, they founded Worry-Free Studio together in just a few months.

She didn't ask for anything to divorce Arthur. The divorce papers stated she would leave with nothing.


Arthur probably wouldn't be too keen on sharing assets with her. Luckily,she still had the studio to rely on and make a living.

When Worry-Free Studio first kicked off, she and Lily had their roles down pat: she handled the designing, and Lily took care of production and business.


To put Worry-Free Studio on the map, Lily even made her the star designer,"Worry-Free." As her reputation grew, orders started pouring in.

After she got married, the name Ms. Worry-Free slowly faded from the public eye.

But whenever she had some downtime, she'd still whip up some designs for Lily.

Ella sat in the chair, chuckling at the booklet in front of her.

In the days that followed, she practically lived at the studio and managed to knock out most of the orders in the booklet.

Ella had to admit that Lily had a knack for picking staff. With Emily's help,her workload had lightened up a lot.

One day, Emily had to leave early for some personal stuff.

By the time Ella finished her design, it was already dark outside.

She yawned,covering her mouth, and was about to close up the studio and head home when she saw Arthur at the door.

She froze, almost forgetting she had blocked all his contacts after leaving his villa.

She didn't expect him to come looking for her.

"What are you doing here?" Ella looked him up and down,noticing how disheveled he seemed.

'Didn't he want to be with Ava? He should be happy I left, so why does he look like this?

"Have you had enough fun outside? Come home with me, and I can pretend nothing happened." Ella stared at him for a long time, her eyes filled with bitterness.

After regaining her composure, she raised her chin and said arrogantly,"I'm not going back. Sign the divorce papers as soon as possible."

Arthur frowned. "Haven't you had enough? Is it just because I didn't spend Valentine's Day with you? Besides, didn't we make love that night?"

Hearing this. Ella looked at him in disbelief. "Do you think I wanted you back home just to have sex with you?"

"Isn't that the case?" Arthur shot back.

Ella was furious and sneered, "You really are shameless. Haven't you always wanted a divorce? Now I'm giving you the chance,but you're hesitating like a coward. Do you want to keep me now that you've realized my worth?"


Arthur looked at Ella strangely, not expecting such words from her.

Seeing he had no intention of leaving, Ella shoved her phone in his face,displaying the call log. "Let's get a divorce. So you and Ava can be together. Next time, don't call the wrong name during sex; it's disgusting."

Ella's face was cold. After making sure he saw the call log, she put away her phone.

Seeing his stiff expression, she walked past him and left.

Back at her and Lily's small apartment, the more Ella thought about it, the angrier she got.

Internally,she cursed, 'Arthur,you scumbag!

After a moment of contemplation, Ella changed into a red dress and took out her long-unused makeup. After fiddling with it in front of the mirror for a while, she applied lipstick and nodded in satisfaction to herself.

Half an hour later, Ella showed up at Drunken Dream, the biggest bar in Silverpeak City.

As soon as Ella walked in, most of the men's eyes in the bar were on her.

She didn't care, casually finding a booth to sit in. The number of men trying to hit on her was endless. When Ella was expressionless,she was more charming.
###Chapter 3

Halfway through her drink. Ella started feeling a bit fuzzy.

Right then, her phone buzzed. She saw the name on the screen,immediately hung up, and shot off a text.

[Drunken Dream Bar,get here quick!]

The call was from Lily, who must've just wrapped up her training.

During Lily's training, her phone was taken away, and today,as soon as it ended, she got Ella's message. Finding out about the divorce, she called Ella right away,only to get hung up on.

Seeing the text, Lily grinned, changed clothes, and hurried over. From a distance, she spotted Ella sitting alone.

"Ella!" Lily walked over and plopped down next to her.

After Lily's call. Ella had stopped drinking.

As time passed, the initial buzz had worn off a bit.She knew Ella well; if Arthur hadn't done something awful, she wouldn't have filed for divorce. Ella paused, then slowly said,"Ava came back." Seeing Lily,she smiled. "Training's over?"

Lily nodded and grabbed a glass from the table, downing it in one go.

"You want to get divorced? Did that jerk Arthur mess up?" As her friend, Lily knew who Ava was. She was the woman Arthur had a thing for.

"So what? As long as Arthur doesn't divorce, she's just the side chick." Lily looked puzzled.

Ella chuckled, clinking her glass with Lily's.

After downing her drink, she continued, "He set Ava up in the Waters Bay villa. On Valentine's Day, he promised to be with me but didn't show;even when we were in bed, he called out Ava's name."

Ella gave a bitter smile after saying this.

Years of being together couldn't compare to the return of an old crush.

Hearing this, Lily angrily slammed her glass on the table, spilling the wine.

"That jerk! It's good you to divorce him. I've always told you he is unreliable. Better late than never; you cut your losses in time."

Ella agreed,getting divorced now was better than dragging it out.

Later, both women, one radiant and the other flamboyant, were drunk and disheveled, catching the eyes of nearby men

"Arthur, isn't that Ella?" David Jones pointed to them in the corner.

Arthur followed his gaze and saw the drunken woman,who was indeed Ella. After his fallout with Ella, he had come to Drunken Dream to unwind. He didn't expect to run into her here. Seeing her like this, Arthur felt a surge of anger with no outlet.

He strode over to them, causing the other eager men to back off.

Seeing a man suddenly appear. Lily squinted and pointed at Arthur. "Ella,this guy looks just like your lousy ex-husband."

Hearing how she referred to him. Arthur's eyebrow twitched.

Ella looked over, meeting Arthur's gaze, and nodded seriously.

"You're right. Anyone who looks like Arthur can't be any good."

David,who had come with Arthur, stifled a laugh.

"Stop laughing and help me get them out of here." Arthur stepped forward and picked Ella up.

David hesitated for a moment, unsure what to do, and ended up carrying Lily out of the bar.

"Arthur,where are we going?" David scratched his head.

Ella. in Arthur's arms, was restless, muttering something under her breath.

Leaning in. Arthur heard that most of it was cursing him.

Arthur's face darkened. After thinking for a bit, he decided to take them to a nearby hotel. After getting them settled in, Arthur hesitated before sitting on the edge of the bed. Only then did he notice that Ella was wearing makeup. The present Ella seemed somewhat different from the Ella he once knew. The ringing of his phone interrupted his thoughts.

"Arthur, the pipe at home seems to be leaking. Can you come and take a loo?" Ava's voice came through the phone.

Arthur hesitated briefly before agreeing. "Wait for me at home,I'll be right there."


Before leaving. Arthur glanced at Ella.

He closed the door and left.

The next morning, Ella and Lily woke up in an unfamiliar place.

Instinctively, they lifted the covers to check, then sighed in relief.

Thankfully, their clothes were still on.

"How did we end up here?" Lily was curious.

Ella rubbed her temples; the hangover making her feel awful.

And she didn't remember how they got there.

The two exchanged confused looks. "I vaguely remember seeing Arthur.
Could he have brought us here?"

Hearing Lily mention him, Ela paused.

Thinking about it, she had some vague memories too, But she instinctively denied it, "No way, Arthur isn't the type to meddle." Recalling the events of yesterday, Ella couldn't help but facepalm. They quickly tidied up and left the hotel. On the way back. Lily laughed, "We can't drink like that anymore; it was a bit embarrassing."

Ella stifled a laugh and nodded in agreement.

They bought breakfast on the way and headed to Worry-Free Studio.

Lily walked in and laid out the breakfast on the table.

"Emily, have you eaten? Come join us for breakfast," she called Emily over here.

Emily responded and walked over.

As she approached, she smelled a strong scent of alcohol.

"Lily, did you and Ella drink?"

Lily paused with a sandwich in hand.

Beside her, Ella lifted her clothes upto her nose and sniffed, detecting no hint of alcohol. "Is it that strong?"

Emily nodded. "I smelled it as soon as I got close to you."

"It's fine, let's eat first. Ella and I will go home and shower later."

After breakfast, Lily left Worry-Free Studio to Emily.

She and Ella went home to shower and change clothes. While drying her hair, Ella heard her phone ring. The screen showed an unfamiliar number. Ella hesitated before answering. 
"You're bold,getting so drunk at a bar."

It was Arthur's voice, though she didn't know whose phone he was using.Ella stiffened.


"You've dialed the wrong number."

She quickly hung up and blocked the number.

Lily noticed her call but didn't stop applying her makeup.

"Who was it?"

###Chapter 4

Ella froze for a second before saying, "Wrong number. No idea who it was."

Lily just nodded and didn't push it. But seeing Ella still sitting there,she nudged her. "What are you waiting for? Get a move on! We're heading to the studio. Emily said there are guests there."

Emily was working as an assistant and wasn't great at handling guests yet.

Hearing this, Ella quickly put on some light makeup.

They got ready almost at the same time and drove over to Worry-Free Studio.

As they neared the entrance, Ella spotted a familiar car.

She stopped, looking puzzled. Lily noticed and asked, "What are you staring at?"

Ella pointed to the car parked at the entrance. "That car looks like Arthur's."


Could Arthur be here again? Was it because of what happened at the bar last night?

Thinking about it, Ella hesitated to go in. If she saw Arthur now,she'd definitely be embarrassed! Lily had no clue what Ella was thinking. Seeing her just standing there,she pulled her towards the studio. When Ella saw the two figures inside, she immediately stopped.No matter how hard Lily pulled,she wouldn't budge. Lily turned back, exasperated. "Ella, what's up now?"

"Arthur and Ava are inside," Ella pouted, nodding towards them.

"It really is. I'll teach them a lesson." Lily rolled up her sleeves, ready to charge in.

Worried Lily might dosomething rash, Ella quickly grabbed her. "Don't be impulsive. Didn't Emily say there were clients here? She must mean Arthur and Ava. You go in and entertain them, I'll sneak in through the back door."

Watching Ela walk away, Lily sighed and went in alone.

Luckily, when they chose the spot for Worry-Free Studio, they picked a place where Ella's office was near the back door.

As she walked in, Emily came over, looking relieved. "Lily, you're finally here."

Ava was the most difficult and demnanding client she'd ever met.

"You go ahead, I'll take care of this." Lily patted her arm and walked over to Ava and Arthur.

Arthur looked surprised to see Lily.

"What can I do for you?" Lily asked,watching Ava browse. But Ava didn't answer. Lily was about to ask again when Ava spoke up, "T m looking for a wedding dress. Any recommendations?" Lily's eyes darkened for a moment. 'Damn it, Arthur isn't even divorced yet, and he's already planning a wedding? From a spot out of Ava's sight. Lily shot a fierce glare at Arthur,who noticed but Lily didn't care.

"These are all wedding dresses. See if there's any style you like." Lily led Ava to the wedding dress section.


Ava looked at the dresses but wasn't satisfied with any of them.

"Do you have any other styles?" she asked, turning her head.

Lily shook her head. "No, these are just samples. Most of our orders are custom-made."


Lily's answer clearly didn't sit well with Ava. "I heard all the designs here are by Ms. Worry-Free? Can she make a wedding dress for me? Money's no object."


Fighting the urge to kick her out, Lily replied flatly,"Ms. Worry-Free is really busy right now and isn't taking private orders."

"Is that so? Then let me try this one on," Ava said casually, pointing to a dress and asking Lily to help her.

Remembering Ella's instructions, Lily personally took her to the fitting room.


"Are you close with Ms. Worry-Free?" Ava asked, trying to get some info while Lily helped her. Lily rolled her eyes while adjusting the dress. Of course, they were close. "We're just coworkers. This dress is a bit loose in the waist. If you decide on this dress, we can alter it to fit you."Lily led her to the mirror. Ava checked herself out from different angles but still wasn't happy.

"Can you contact Ms. Worry-Free? What's she busy with? Can she make an exception for me? You saw the guy outside, right? He's the president of the Smith Group. We're getting married, and I want a unique dress.I'll make it worth your while. If you introduce me to Ms. Worry-Free,I'lI bring my friends here."


She added, "Your studio is pretty small. Business must not be great, huh?"

Seeing Ava's snobby attitude. Lily couldn't help but snap, "If you're so rich,why come here?"

With that, Lily started taking the dress off her.

"Out the door, turn left. Bye."

Ava was stunned by Lily's attitude and didn't react right away.

Seeing Lily walk out of the locker room,she bit her lip and followed.

Outside, Arthur was still waiting. When Lily came out, she didn't even look at him and went back to organizing the dresses.

Ava followed and started whining to Arthur, "Arthur, the staff here bullied me."

 
Hearing Ava's whinay voice, Lily almost gagged. Arthur patted her head, "Lily, don't forget, we're your customers. Is this how you treat customers? Apologize to Ava. Get the person in charge out here." Lily put down the dress and sneered, "I am the person in charge. What do you want?" Arthur thought Lily was just an employee and didn't expect her to be in charge.

Seeingthe surprise in Arthur's eyes, Lily didn't care.

If it weren't for Ella, she would've kicked these annoying people out a long time ago.


"Since you're in charge, you must know Ms. Worry-Free, right? Have her designa dress for Ava."

No wonder they were a perfect match, even their tone was the same.

"I already said Ms. Worry-Free is busy and can't take this order. Go find someone else." By now, Lily's patience was wearing thin.

But Arthur, not getting the hint, continued, "You're not Ms. Worry-Free,how do you know she won't take this order?"

Lily sneered internally. Of course,she knew.

Arthur had no idea that Ella, who had been sleeping beside him for years,was actually Ms. Worry-Free.

Lily couldn't wait to see Arthur's face when he found out the truth.
###Chapter 5

"I'm tight with Ms. Worry-Free. It's the third anniversary of her husband's death, so she's not in the mood to work."


Lily felt even more pissed off for Ella after saying that.

She shot a cold look at Arthur and sneered, "Ms. Worry-Free is loyal.unlike those unfaithful guys."

The message was clear, and even Ava, standing nearby,picked up on it.

It seemed like Lily had known Arthur for a long time.

Ava didn't want them to keep talking, so she tugged on Arthur's sleeve and softly asked, "Arthur, do you know her?"

Before Arthur could answer, his phone rang.

He glanced at it and walked out.

Inside Worry-Free Studio, only Lily and Ava were left.

With Arthur gone, Ava dropped her innocent act and stared straight at Lily."What's your deal with Arthur?"

She added,"I already told you, Arthur and I are getting married soon.Stop dreaming;he's not for you."
Lily laughed angrily, leaning on a nearby shelf. "Do you have some kind of persecution complex? Only you would treasure such a jerk." "You and Arthur are perfect for each other: one shameless, the other two-faced. You two should stay together forever and stop bothering others." 
After venting, Lily felt a bit better.

When she looked at Ava again, she found her more tolerable.

But she still felt it was unfair to Ella.

Ava was stunned by the scolding, pointing at Lily. "You..."

She couldn't get a word out.

Arthur walked back in, and Ava's eyes turned red the moment she saw him.

Arthur frowned and looked at the two of them. "What's going on?"

Lily,on the other hand, seemed in a good mood.

"Arthur, I just said a few words to her, and she kept scolding mem"

Ava wanted to repeat what was said, but she couldn't bring herself to say those words, so she gave up and only said, "Arthur, her attitude is terrible.Can you get me someone else?"
"That would be great. I don't want to see you either." Lily showed her disdain openly, walking to the office to call Emily out.
"Go out and explain things to them. If they want to see Ms. Worry-Free,just tell them her husband died, and she's not in the mood to work."
Hearing this, Emily glanced at Ella. Having worked here for so long, she knew that Ms. Worry-Free was Ella.Sensing Emily's gaze, Ella nodded. "Go ahead, just say that. Don't tell them who I am."After Emily left, Lily sat down angrily and gulped down a large glass of water.
Seeing her reaction, Ella found it amusing. "Why are you so mad?"

Seeing her indifferent attitude, Lily shook her head helplessly and tapped her forehead in frustration.

Outside,Emily was still trying to deal with Ava.

"How about this, name a price. What will it take for Ms. Worry-Free to design personally?"
Seeing that he couldn't persuade her, Arthur decided to use money.

Inside.Ella heard the price had been raised to thirty million dollars.

Her heart skipped a beat! Thirty million dollars? That was insane!

Emily was at a loss, not knowing how to handle the situation.

Lily stepped in. "No need to say more, Ms. Worry-Free won't agree.You should leave."

Just seeing them made Lily feel unlucky.


"Fifty million dollars."

Lily's eyes widened. She had to admit, the offer was tempting. But she had principles, and no amount of money could ever outweigh Ella's importance.Just as she was about to refuse, Ella walked out. "Ms. Worry-Free will take this order. Emily, give Mr. Smith the Worry- After Emily left. Lily sat down angrily and gulped down a large glass of water.


Seeing her reaction, Ella found it amusing. "Why ate you so mhad?"


Seeing her indifferent attitude. Lily shook her head helplessly and tapped her forehead in frustration.


Outside. Emily was still trying to deal with Ara.

"How about this, name a price. What will it take for Ms. Worry-Free to design personally?

Seeing that he couldn't persuade her. Arthur decided to use money.

Inside.Ella heard the price hadbeen raised to thirty million dollats.

Her heart skippeda beat! Thirty million dollars? That was insane!

Emily was at a loss, not knowing how to handle the situation.

Lily stepped in. "No need to say more. Ms. Worry-Free won't agree.You should leave."


Just seeing them made Lily feel unlucky.

"Fifty million dollars."

Lily's eyes widened. She had to admit, the offer was tempting.

But she had principles, and no amount of money could ever outweigh Ella s importance.

Just as she was about to refuse. Ella walked out.

"Ms. Worry-Free will take this order. Emily,give Mr. Smith the Worry- Free Studio's account number." Ella said calmly, standing next to Lily.

Ella's sudden appearance shocked both Lily and Arthur.

Especially Arthur, who never expected to see Ella here.

"Can you make decisions for Ms. Worry-Free?" Arthur frowned,clearly doubting Ella's words.


He never imagined that Ella, standing in front of him, was working for the elusive Ms. Worry-Free they had been trying so hard to meet.

Ella nodded. "Of course, just transfer the money."

With Ella's assurance, Arthur had no reason to doubt. He noted the account number and left with Ava.


Ava, having gotten what she wanted, left with a smile on her face.

After sending them off, Lily looked at Ella discontentedly. "Why did you agree to them?"

Seeing the angry Lily, Ella smiled and pulled her inside.

"That's fifty million dollars. Why not take it? Who wouldn't want to make money?"


Ms. Worry-Free's designs were indeed pricey, but a single wedding dress costing fifty million dollars was outrageous.


"But..." Lily wanted to say more, feeling sorry for Ella. Ella's smile faded. "It's okay. We're getting divorced anyway.Consider it Arthur's divorce compensation. Besides, didn't you already teach her a lesson for me today?" She reached out and pinched Lily's cheek, satisfied when she saw her smile.

"Are you planning to keep your identity a secret?" Lily was curious, not understanding why she didn't tell Arthur who she really was.

"We're getting divorced. What difference does it make if Arthur knows or not? I just want to run Worry-Free Studio with you."


She had almost forgotten why she hid it in the first place. It seemed as if she had never hidden anything from Arthur.

He had never truly cared about her, so he naturally wouldn't have noticed these things.

Many times, if Arthur had taken one more step, he would have recognized her.


But every time, Arthur just stopped short.

Now, it didn't matter if he knew or not.

"In a few days, have Emily schedule a fitting for Ava. I won't show up then."


Lily agreed, "Don't worry,Emily can handle this."

"There's a party tonight. I got us two invitations. Let's go and have some fun. Maybe we can get a few orders."

Lily took out the invitations from her bag and handed one to Ella. As night fell, Ella and Lily arrived at the party. Tonight, Ella wore a black fitted gown,highlighting her slender waist. Lily wore an off-shoulder short dress, her slender legs drawing attention.

When they appeared, they attracted most people's attention.

Lily looked around. "Ella, is that Arthur?"

Following Lily's gaze, it really was Arthur.
###Chapter 6

The person standing next to Arthur was none other than Ava.

One couldn't avoid his enemy. Ella didn't expect to come across themn here.

"Let's head over there," Ella said, tugging Lily away. She really didn't want to see those two together.

Even though she had already decided to get a divorce, seeing Arthur and Ava still made her heart ache.


Arthur noticed them from a distance. Even though he only saw a side profile, he recognized Ella immediately.

They had been married for a long time, and it had been a while since he had seen her all dressed up.

The dress perfectly accentuated Ella's figure.

"Arthur, what are you staring at?" Ava asked, noticing Arthur gazing into the distance.


Arthur snapped back to reality. "Nothing."

"Arthur, I see a friend over there; I'm going to say hi."

Arthur nodded, watching Ava walk away.

He started walking in the direction where Ella had gone. The banquet hall was huge, and it took Arthur a while to find Ella. He walked over slowly, intending to ask if she had calmed down and when she would be willing to comeback. But when he spoke, his words took a different turn."Ella, what are you doing here? Did you find out I was here and follow me?"

Lily scoffed, "You really are full of yourself. Do you think you're gold and everyone wants to stick to you?"

"I suggest you go to the hospital and get your brain checked. There might be something wrong," Ella said seriously,looking at Arthur.


"Sign the divorce papers as soon as possible so I can schedule a time to go to court."


Looking into Ella's eyes, Arthur realized she was serious.


After a long pause, Arthur finally spoke, "Are you serious? Are you sure you want to divorce me?"

Ella was tired of hearing these words.

"Of course, do you think I'm just throwing a tantrum with you?"

Arthur was taken aback; that was exactly what he thought.

"Are you reluctant to get a divorce or let me go?" Ella said with a sarcastic smile.

Provoked by her words, Arthur decisively said, "See you in court at 10 AM in three days."


Hearing this, Ella still felt a pang of bitterness in her heart. She had thought Arthur would try to persuade her, but it seemed he was eager to get a divorce. Ava had said they were getting married soon. Composing herself. Ella raised her head. "It's a deal. Whoever doesn't show up is a coward."

With that, she pulled Lily and turned to leave.

The two of them sat in a corner, and seeing Ella's low spirits, Lily asked,"Are you really going to divorce Arthur?"

Ella nodded, "Arthur is probably eager to get a divorce."

She knew their marriage was a mistake, and now she was cutting her losses in time.

"If you get divorced, so be it. With your qualities, you'll find someone better and more considerate. Why waste time on a jerk like Arthur?"

Lily waved her hand, ready to introduce other men to Ella.

Seeing her like this, Ella couldn't help but laugh, and her sadness in her heart disappeared.

"I see there's some red wine over there. Let's go get a glass."

Hearing the word "wine," Ella instinctively thought of what happened at Drunken Dream that day.

Just as she was about to refuse, Lily pulled her over.

As they turned around with their glasses, they didn't notice someone walking up behind them. They looked up and saw it was Ava, as the wine in her glass spilled all over Ella's dress. Seeing it was her, Lily immediately snapped, "Can't you watch where you' re going?"

"I didn't do it on purpose. Couldn't you two watch where you're going?"Ava shot back.


"How ridiculous. Who has eyes on the back of their head? Clearly,you bumped into us, and now you're acting all righteous?"

Their argument quickly drew a crowd,including Arthur.

He walked over and heard Lily's voice.

Pushing through the crowd, he saw Ella in a sorry state; her white dress was stained.


"What happened?" Arthur asked, standing next to Ava but keeping his eyes on Ella.

"Arthur, I just accidentally bumped into them," Ava said, looking all innocent and aggrieved, completely different from moments ago.

Even Lily was surprised by Ava's change in expression.

"I'll pay for the dress," Ava said, looking like she had suffered a great injustice.

Others started pointing and whispering at Lily and Ella. Lily wanted to explain, but Ella stopped her. Then Ella stepped forward."You bumped into me and spilled wine all over my dress, Compensation is expected. Don't act like you're the one who suffered. And you should apologize to us." Ella's tone was calm and composed as she clearly explained the situation. The people who had been pointing fingers at them now turned their criticism towards Ava.
Ava had never endured such humiliation before; she could only cast her gaze upon Arthur for help.
"I'll have the new dress sent to your Worry-Free Studio. Ava didn't do it on purpose," Arthur said, clearly defending Ava.
Ella smiled faintly, "No apology is fine, but I can't guarantee Ms. Worry-Free will still take your orders. After all, your character is..."

She left the sentence unfinished.

Then she looked at them calmly. After a long hesitation,Ava finally stepped forward. "I'm sorry,I accidentally bumped into you."

After the apology, the matter was settled.

As Ella's dress was ruined, Ella and Lily decided to leave.

On the way back, Lily laughed, "Ms. Worry-Free's reputation really comes in handy."

Ella couldn't help but laugh too. She hadn't expected it.

It seemed Ava really cared about her wedding dress.

On the day of the divorce, Ella got up early.

She dressed up carefully before driving to the court. Thinking that after today she would have no ties to Arthur, she still felt a bit reluctant. In her moment of daze, she felt a sudden jolt as the car behind her rear-ended her due to a late brake.
Ella pursed her lips. parked her car, and got out.

The driver of the car behind her, a woman, also got out and walked straight to the front of her own car to check the damage.
Ella stood aside, seeing she was a woman too, she didn't rush her.

After checking, the woman rolled her eyes at Ella. "Hey, can't you pay attention while driving?"
Ella had intended to settle it privately, but seeing the woman's unreasonable attitude, she decided to call the police.
Ella, the driver who rear-ended her, Sophia Brown, and the police officer who arrived all went to the police station.
The police determined it was Sophia's fault, and she compensated Ella with three thousand dollars.

Because of the accident, the divorce had to be postponed.

After leaving the police station, Ella drove straight home.

She charged her phone, turned it on, and removed Arthur's number from the blacklist.
###Chapter 7

In just a few seconds, Arthur called.

"Ella, didn't we agree to go to court today? Where are you?" Arthur's voice came through the phone,clearly pissed off.
Ella knew she was in the wrong and awkwardly explained, "Today was an accident. I got rear-ended on my way to court. The other driver didn't even have a license..."

Before she could finish, Arthur cut her off.

"Ella, are you kidding me? Who drives without a license these days?"Arthur's tone was fully impatient.

Even over the phone,Ella could picture his angry face.

"Making an appointment with me and then breaking it, Ella, are you playing hard to get with me?"
Hearing this, Ella sneered, "Arthur, you're so full of yourself.Anyway,I've told you what happened. Believe it or not."

She wondered why she hadn't noticed before how self-righteous Arthur was.

On the other end, Arthur was silent for a long time. During this time, he felt that Ella had changed somehow from before. But he couldn't pinpoint what was different. "Do you have time tomorrow? We can go to court again."Arthur snorted, "Do you think I'm as free as you? I don't have timetomorrow."
With that. Arthur hung up abruptly, not even giving Ella a chance to speak.
Staring at the disconnected call, Ella was stunned for a moment, then angrily threw her phone onto the bed.

She cursed to herself, 'Arthur, you bastard.'

After charging her phone, Ellawent straight to Worry-Free Studio.

Today, Worry-Free Studio had taken on many orders, and Lily and Emily were a bit overwhelmed.
When she arrived at Worry-Free Studio, it wvas already buzzing with people.
Seeing Ella come in, Lily and Emily looked at her like she was their savior.


With Ella's help, the two of them felt much more at ease.

After the busy period, Ella and Lily sat on the couch chatting.

"I'll take the car in for maintenance tomorrow. You'll have to walk for the next couple of days."

Lily waved her hand. "No big deal. Aren't you planning to buy a car? As orders kept increasing,we realized we might need to work separately, and just one car wasn't going to cut it,"Her words struck a chord with Ella. After the divorce, she left with nothing and couldn't afford to buy a car. "Let's wait a bit." Ella decided to put off buying a car for now. Lily understood her thoughts, turned around, and looked at Ella seriously."Are you seriously planning to divorce with nothing? Arthur's worth a fortune;you'd be losing a lot."
"I just want to get divorced as soon as possible. Besides, Arthur's money has nothing to do with me. It's easier to get a divorce without asking for anything. He wouldn't want to give it to me anyway."
She was eager to divorce Arthur. Besides, she was never with Arthur for the money.

Lily looked at Ella for a while, then sighed heavily.

"Why do you look so miserable? I'm the one getting divorced, and I've already come to terms with it." Ella pinched her cheek playfully.
Lily took Ella's hand away and looked at her wistfully. "You heartless woman, don't you know I'm angry for your sake?"

"Let's not talk about this. What did Arthur say about you missing today?"

Ella shrugged. Just thinking about it made her blood boil, and she repeated Arthur's words verbatim.

"He's so full of himself," Lily finally said after a long pause.

A phone call interrupted their conversation. Ella picked up her phone and glanced at it. It was Arthur calling.

After hesitating for a moment, Ella answered the call."Come back to the Smith Villa with me tonight. Grandpa wants to see you." Hearing Arthur's matter-of-fact tone, Ella rolled her eyes. Did you forget we're about to get divorced?" She had no obligation to go back.
Arthur uncharacteristically paused for a moment before continuing. "We haven't gotten the divorce certificate yet, and I haven't signed the divorce agreement. You're still my wife on paper."
"Grandpa's health is frail. Are you sure you want to tell him about this?Have you forgotten how he usually treats you?"

His words successfully silenced Ella.
She indeed couldn't refuse. Robert Smith was the one who treated her the best in the Smith family.
"If you want me to go back with you, we need to set another time for the divorce." Ella decided to take advantage of the situation.
Trading a meal for reschedulingthe divorce seemed like a good deal.


Unexpectedly, Arthur agreed after a moment of hesitation.

"The Smith Group has some matters these days, and I need to handle them. Schedule a time next week and let me know. I'll pick you up at six tonight."

Ella agreed, "I'm at Worry-Free Studio. Pick me up here."

With that settled, Ella and Arthur hung up without further ado."Was that Arthur?" Ella nodded and put her phone aside. "He wants me to go back to the Smith Villa with him tonight."You agreed?" Lily was incredulous. 'If they were getting divorced,why go back to his family?'
"Mr. Smith has been good to me. I should go back for his sake."

Lily still couldn't understand why Ella agreed. Even if she went back this time, they would still get divorced.
"How do you plan to tell Mr. Smith about the divorce? You can't keep it a secret forever."
"We'll deal with it later. Arthur will figure something out."

She remembered Ava's words about their plans to get married.


Robert would find out eventually.
By then, how to handle it would be Arthur's responsibility and would have nothing to do with her.
"Lily, there's a customer outside," Emily called softly from the door.


"I'll go check." Lily got up and went out.

After chatting forso long, it was almost time for Arthur to pick her up.Ella grabbed her phone and walked out.

At the office door, she could hear Lily introducing herself. Stepping outside, Ella saw a familiar figure. Before she could guess who it was,that figure turned around. It was the woman who rear-ended her car that morning, Sophia. "It's you!" Sophia glanced over and recognized Ella immediately. Thinking about the $3,000 she had to pay, Sophia was furious.

Seeing that Sophia had recognized her, Ella walked over.

Lily looked at her inconfusion. "Do you know this lady?"

Ella nodded helplessly. It was more than just knowing her.
###Chapter 8
"She's the one who rear-ended me this morning," Ella said.

Lily's eyes widened as she finally put two and two together.

Before Lily could say anything, Sophia btted in, "Hurry up and give me my money back."
Lily and Ella had never dealt with someone so unreasonable before.

The police had already investigated the situation, so there was no way she was giving it back.
Plus, it was Sophia who was in the wrong, so Ella had every right to keep the money.
"Sophia, this money is mine. If you keep causing trouble, I'll call the police.

"
Ella didn't waste any more breath on her. Talking to someone like Sophia was pointless; it was better to cut to the chase.
Hearing Ella's words, Sophia, who had been so aggressive, suddenly went quiet.

In the end, she just shot Ella a nasty look, bumped her shoulder,and stormed off.Watching her leave, Lily was still in shock. "That woman is something else.11 Ella smiled helplessly, just as Arthur arrived. After saying goodbye to Lily,she walked out. Sitting in the car, Ella turned to look out the window, not saying a word to Arthur.




As the number of cars on the road dwindled, Ella leaned back in her seat,feeling a bit sleepy.
Arthur suddenly spoke, "When we get to Grandpa's, be careful not to let him see through us."

Ella opened her eyes and responded slowly.

Half an hour later, the car finally came to a stop.

Without waiting for Arthur, Ella walked straight into the Smith Villa. The butler was thrilled to see her. "Mrs. Ella Smith, you're back. Mr. Robert Smith will be so happy to see you."
She smiled at the butler. "Where's Grandpa?"

"Mr. Smith should be in the study. Please wait a moment, I'll call him down.Dinner is almost ready."

Ella nodded and sat down on the sofa.

After a while, Arthur also came over and sat next to her.

During dinner, Robert came downstairs. He wasn't surprised to see the two of them. Robert looked at Arthur and snorted, "If I hadn't messaged you,when were you planning to bring Ella back?" "Grandpa, there are too many things at the company. Besides,I'm back now, aren't I?" Arthur replied calmly.




Saying this,Robert took Ella's hand and led her to the dining table.

The butler, who was serving the dishes, smiled. "No wonder Mr. Robert Smith personally chose the menu today; he must have known that Mr.Arthur Smith and Mrs. Ella Smith were coming back."
Ella felt a lump in her throat. Despite years of marriage to Arthur, she had never been close with him, while Robert had always been genuinely kind to her.

"Then I must eat a lot today." Ella smiled and sat down.

Arthur also came over at this time and naturally sat next to Ella.


During the meal,Robert kept asking about their situation.

Ella responded to Robert's concern as much as she could.

When she didn't know how to answer, she kicked Arthur under the table,signaling him to respond.

The meal dragged on for almost an hour.

After dinner, Ella was ready to head home. "Ella, it's already dark outside. Why don't you stay the night?" Robert suggested. Ella wanted to refuse; the last thing she wanted was to share a room with Arthur.Just as she was thinking of a way to decline, Arthur came over, took her hand, and told Robert, "Grandpa, we'll stay tonight."



Arthur agreed and then pulled Ella aside.
Once they were out of Robert's sight, Ella shook off his hand. "Arthur,what's wrong with you? I didn't agree to stay."
"I've already promised Grandpa. I'll take you back early tomorrow morning."
Ella glared at him. "You promised, not me. I'm going to tell Grandpa now."


She turned to leave but was stopped by him.

"I heard Worry-Free Studio has been taking small orders. If you stay tonight. I can introduce a big client to your studio."

This proposition greatly enticed Ella.
After hesitating for a while, she agreed but warned Arthur, "You'd better keep your word and take me backearly tomorrow morning."

Without waiting for Arthur's response, she turned and went upstairs.


So she didn't see Arthur's smug expression. The Smith Villa was cleaned daily, so their bedroom only needed a quick tídy-upt o be ready. Ella walked in and stared at the bed, lost in thought, until she heard

 footsteps behind her and turned around.
She then picked up a pillow and blanket and placed them on the floor.



"I'll sleep on the floor."
Saying this, she spread the blanket on the floor and lay down.

Arthur, already in his pajamas, walked to the bed and sat down after seeing Ella on the floor.
Seeing that Athur had no intention of giving up the bed for her. Ella was a bit displeased.
"Arthur, are you even a man? Shouldn't you give me the bed?" Ella sat up and glared at him.
Arthur leaned leisurely against the headboard and raised an eyebrow. "I didn't propose that you sleep on the floor. Since you like it,so be it."

'Jerk!' Ella cursed him silently.

In the end, she had no choice but to lie on the floor. The thought of being in the same room with Arthur made her very uncomfortable.

She just hoped the night would pass quickly.

The blanket here was quite comfortable; Ella lay down on it and gradually drifted off to sleep. In the middle of the night, there was a rustling sound outside the door.Arthur opened his eyes in the dark.He heard the door being locked from the outside. At that moment. Ella woke up groggily and heard the noise outside.
"What was that?" Ella asked curiously.
Arthur sat up in bed, already guessing that it was Robert who had locked the door.
"The door is locked," Arthur said calmly.


Hearing this, Ella jumped up.

She walked to the door and tried to open it, but she failed.

"What should we do?" Ella's tone was anxious; she didn't want to stay with Arthur all night.
"Don't worry, Grandpa will unlock it in the morning." Arthur lay back down.
Ella looked at the door, then at Arthur, and finally lay back down.


There was nothing else to do at this point.
###Chapter 9

After lying back down. Ella just couldn't get back to sleep. She felt like she was burning up.





Time dragged on, and she was still roasting.

Arthur noticed something was off too. No wonder Robert locked the door.They must have been drugged with an aphrodisiac.
But Arthur didn't say a word, just lay there toughing it out.

Ella, on the other hand, was having a way harder time. Her hands were all over her body, and everywhere she touched felt like it was on fire.
Arthur finally got out of bed and scooped Ella up, placing her on the bed.

Wherever Arthur touched, it tingled, making Ella's body go all soft. She knew something was up.
"Arthur, there's something wrong with the room," she said.

"Grandpa drugged us with an aphrodisiac," Arthur's voice was rough.


The drug was strong, and he was struggling too.

Ella was still squirming beneath him, trying to break free. Arthur was fighting his own desires and feeling pretty annoyed. In the past, Ella hadn't been like this in bed. All he could think about was her wanting a divorce, and he cursed silently. He moved closer, his big hand roaming over her body.


She decided, screw it, and flipped him over, pressing him down and kissing him hard.




After a long kiss, he let her go when she was almost out of breath.

Under the drug's influence, Ella looked at him with dazed eyes, her waist moving unconsciously against him.
Arthur chuckled, guiding her hand to his crotch.

He was already hard, and when Ella grabbed his dick, he let out a light moan.

He leaned into her ear, whispering, "Baby, move it."

Ella moved her hand up and down, feeling like she was on fire.

Finally, Arthur spread her legs, held himself, and entered her wet warmth.


They both sighed in satisfaction as he entered.

The drug was at its peak, igniting Arthur's desire.

Grabbing her waist, he began to thrust deeply, each one hitting her core. Ella had long forgotten her shyness,moaning passionately. All night long, Arthur didn'tlet up until she passed out from exhaustion. Afterwards, he had a satisfied smile on his face.Seeing Ella too tired to move, he carried her to the bathroom to clean her up.



The next morning,Ella woke up early.

The soreness in her body reminded her of the craziness of last night.


She quietly slipped out of Arthur's embrace.

After getting dressed, she tried to open the door.


Luckily,it was unlocked.
Ella, despite the soreness in her legs, walked downstairs and saw Robert sitting on the sofa.
"Grandpa, why are you up so early?" Ella asked, feeling a bit awkward remembering last night.
Robert smiled, "At my age, I don't need much sleep. Why don't you get some more rest? Where's Arthur?"

"Grandpa. I have something to do later. Arthur's still sleeping. I'll head back first and won't join you for breakfast."

Robert felt a twinge of disappointment but quickly recalled drugging them the night before, and his letdown dissipated. "Tll have the driver take you back." Ella nodded. This place was far from the city, and without the driver, she'd have to ask Lily to pick her up."Thank you, Grandpa. I'll come back to see you when I have time." Ella said obediently,saying goodbye to Robert.




"Judging by the sounds, Mrs. Smith and Mr. Smith slept very late. It seems you'll get your wish soon." The butler grinned, genuinely happy.
"That's good!" Robert said delightedly.

Meanwhile, Ella leaned back tiredly in the car.

"Mrs. Smith, where are we going?" The driver asked, looking in the rearview mirror.

Ella gave the address of Worry-Free Studio to the driver.

The driver acknowledged and started driving slowly.

With the warm light in the car, Ella felt a bit sleepy.

She didn't know how long the car had been moving when the driver woke her up.

Opening her eyes, she saw the car had stopped. Ella thanked the driver and got out. Walking to the entrance of Worry-Free Studio, Ella saw Lily calling her on the phone. She walked in and saw Lily standing there. Ella waved her phone, and then the call was hung up. "You didn't come back last night?" Lily asked, noticing Ella was still wearing the same clothes as yesterday.




She skipped over Arthur threatening her, not wanting to worry Lily.

"By the way, what did you want to tell me when you called earlier?" Ella changed the subject, seeing Lily wanted to ask more.







Ella nodded. "What time is the meeting?"


"Nine-thirty."

Lily checked the time;it was already past eight.

"Go get ready, and we'll head over."

Ella nodded and walked to the bathroom.

Ten minutes later, Ella came out of the bathroom.

Seeing Ella, Lily almost exclaimed in surprise.

Ella was wearing thick black-framed glasses, her face covered in freckles,

and her hair in two pigtails hanging on either side.It took her a while to recognize Ella. "Why did you make yourself look like this?" "Let's go." Ella walked up to Lily.Seeing her standing still. Ella raised an eyebrow. "What's wrong?"




"Yes,let's go."

Seeing her insistence, Lily let her be.

Half an hour later, they arrived at the meeting place.

Before getting out of the car, Ella took a baseball cap and mask from her bag,covering herself completely.
With only her eyes showing, no one would recognize her.
###Chapter 10
"You really don't need to bundle up like that,do you?"Ella gave a faint smile behind her mask. "What do you know? Better safe than sorry. Arthur's got so many business partners, what if he finds out who I really am?"
Lily was momentarily speechless and gave Ella a once-over.


"Suit yourself."
They took the elevator up to the top floor, and the receptionist looked a bit surprised to see them.
Lily walked over and said, "Hi, we're from Worry-Free Studio. We have a 9:30 appointment with Mike Taylor."
"Mr. Taylor is in a meeting right now. Please wait in the meeting room for a bit."
The receptionist led them to the meeting room, set up some tea, and then left.

They sat in the room all morning, with no one coming in or out.

After what felt like forever, the door finally opened.

"Sorry to keep you waiting." Mike walked in with his secretary He glanced at Ella and Lily but ended up extending his hand to Lily. After waiting so long, Lily was already a bit annoyed. But seeing his extended hand, she still shook it politely. "Please, have a seat. So, other studios have already reached out to us.What makes Worry-Free Studio stand out?"
Lily and Ella exchanged a glance.

'Weren't they the ones who contacted us frst?'
"Mr. Taylor, didn't you reach out to us first?" Lily asked, clearly confused.

Mike smiled. "That's true, but I still have to pick the best partner,right?"

"If we sign a contract, you need to prioritize our company. No private orders without our permission. Basically, Worry-Free Studio will exclusively serve us."

He smiled at them.

"Can you agree to that?"

Lily finally got what he was saying.
Suppressing the urge to roll her eyes, she asked, "So, working with you means Worry-Free Studio belongs to you? We have to follow all your orders?"

Mike smiled and nodded.

Ella. standing beside her, was also surprised by the request.

Lily suddenly gave him a mocking smile and stood up. "Mr. Taylor, you're pretty greedy, wanting to own Worry-Free Studio. Are you kidding me?" "Making us wait all morning, and then you talk nonsense?""Do you really think your company is so amazing that every studio wants to work with you? Dream on!"
After her rant. Lily felt much better.

Seeing Ella behind her, she pulled her to leave.
Mike,stunned. quickly stood up. "How dare you talk to me like that?Just you wait! If you mess with me, Worry-Free Studio won't last!"
Lily rolled her eyes and left with Ella without looking back.


Outside, Ella took off her hat and mask.
"Looks like our new collaboration is off," Lily said, looking mournful, a stark contrast to her earlier outburst.
Ella smiled. "Weren't you feeling great while scolding him? Why regret it now?"
"This was a big project, and now it's gone. Can't I be sad for a bit?"


Ella chuckled and pulled Lily along.

"What's there to regret about losing that project? We can't just sell Worry-Free Studio to them."

Lily thought about it and agreed, her mood lifting.

Back at Worry-Free Studio, Lily would occasionally curse Mike. Every time Ella heard it, she found it pretty amusing. Soon enough, they both forgot about the whole thing. But a few days later, Worry-Free Studio started receiving notifications of order cancellations.One or two might be a coincidence, but nearly 80% of their orders were getting canceled.

"Could it really be that Mr. Taylor?" Lily asked, puzzled. "I was so focused on scolding him; I didn't think about the consequences."





"So,what do we do now?"

"Is the loss significant?"
Lily had always handled the studio's affairs, so Ella wasn't too familiar with the details.
"Worry-Free Studio's account has less than three million dollars now. Most of our orders have been canceled, and we still owe suppliers. We might end up with over ten million dollars in debt."
Ella was speechless; she had thought it would be at most a few million dollars.

"Should I go apologize to Mr. Taylor?" Lily suggested. Ella shook her head. "He doesn't seem like a good person. If you go to apologize,he might take the opportunity to make even more outrageous demands." For the next few days, they were both troubled by the situation. Since Ella left the Smith Villa, shehadn't contacted Arthur.








Meanwhile,Worry-Free Studio continued to receive cancellation notices.

Seeing all the cancellations, Lily and Ella were almost pulling their hair out in frustration.

Ella said, "How about I ask Arthur for help?"

She and Arthur were stillmarried; as her husband, he had an obligation to help her,right?

Ella barely finished speaking before Lily refused.

"No,you never wanted to contact Arthur. How can you bow to him over this?"

They exchanged a glance.

Do we just watch Worry-Free Studio go bankrupt?'

Just when they were at their wit's end, they almost simultaneously received calls about previous orders,

Ella glanced at Lily, and they walked a bit further apart to take their calls. After a while, they both hung up,looking bewildered. "You go first." "No,you go first."They spoke at the same time, then Ella paused, "The previous client called to say they won't cancel the order."
Lily waved her phone. "Same here."

The entire afternoon, they were busy with returning orders.


By evening, they finally had a moment to breathe.
"What happened? Is it really resolved? Did Mr. Taylor have a change of heart?"
Lily quickly shook her head, not believing he would have such a conscience.
Ella,however,seemed thoughtful. "Could it be Arthur?"
###Chapter 11

Lily and Ella both went quiet.The only person who could've fixed their problem had to be Arthur,right?


are you gonna thank him for?""If Arthur doesn't bring it up, let's just act like we don't know he helped us."
After what went down that night, Ella really didn't know how to face Arthur.
Lily nodded and happily went to sort out the orders.

Not only did the previous returned orders canceled, but some customers even placed new ones.
What they went through this time could be seen as a blessing in disguise.


Ella was lost in thought when her phone rang.

Seeing the caller ID, Ella was a bit surprised;it was Robert.

On the phone, Robert suggested meeting up with Ella.


After a brief hesitation, Ella agreed. On one hand, she really wanted to cut ties with the Smith family, but on the other hand, she couldn't bear to refuse Robert. After agreeing on a place, Ella hung up the phone. Lily,who was busy, looked up at her. "You won't be back tonight, will you?"Ella nodded, today she was just meeting with Robert.

After leaving Worry-Free Studio, Ella took a cab back to the Smith Villa.

Walking in, she saw Robert sitting on the sofa, with the butler standing beside him.
Ella quickly walked over. "Grandpa."

She sat down opposite Robert.
On the table in front of her was a square box, she had no idea what was inside.

When he saw Ella, Robert opened the box.

Inside was a set of well-preserved sapphire bracelets and earrings,worth almost three years of Worry-Free Studio's income.

"I got this by chance; it's for you."

As he spoke, Robert closed the box and handed it to Ella.

Holding the box, Ella felt uneasy as she was still thinking about divorcing Arthur. "Grandpa,this is too valuable." "Just take it, Arthur is usually busy with work and doesn't have time to be with you." "I'm getting old, and you two don't have time to bewith me. It would be nice to have a grandson or granddaughter."It wasn't until Robert started urging them to have kids that Ella realized his true intention.Just as she was thinking about howto refuse, she heard Robert continue,"Take it easy, if you don't want to, don't force yourself. Everything should be based on your wishes." He was still caring about Ella's well-being.

To be honest, hearing this made Ella feel touched.

In her heart,she had long considered Robert as her family.

If she divorced Arthur, the only person she was concerned about was Robert.
Looking at Robert in front of her, Ella's eyes welled up.

"Don't worry, Grandpa, we'll try our best."

She said this to make Robert happy and to avoid seeing him disappointed.

"Alright, I don't have anything else. If you have things to do, just go ahead.Remember to come back and see me when you can."

Ella nodded, then the same driver from last time took her back  to Worry-Free Studio. She returned to Worry-Free Studio to prevent the driver from telling Robert about her and Arthur living separately, as Robert might get suspicious if he found out. After making sure the driver had left, Ella went out again. Half an hour later, she got back home. She had never wanted a car so badly.
She had to admit, not having a car had been a real pain.

After tidying up. Ella picked up the box and stared at it.

She thought about finding a chance to return it to Robert. Keeping it made her feel uneasy, especially since she was about to divorce Arthur.




The events at the banquet a few days ago had brought a lot of customers to Worry-Free Studio.

In no time,Ella received a bunch of orders.

She finally picked a few and sent them to Lily, asking her to choose one.


After a bit,Lily replied.
[Let's go with the StellarAchievement Group; I've heard good things about them.]
Ella checked it out, and among all the clients, the StellarAchievement Group seemed the most sincere.

She thought,'A company like this shouldn't be a problem.'Ella replied to them, and after confirming their availability,they promptly scheduled a meeting for 3 PM the next day. The next morning, Ella didn't go to Worry-Free Studio but headed straight to the repair shop. Lily's car hadn't been picked up yet. Ella had been so busy these past few days that she almost forgot about it.




When she got there, Lily and Emily were already swamped.


With Ella's help, the two of them felt a lot more at ease.

As the meeting time approached, they told Emily to take care of Worry-Free Studio.

Ella dressed the same as last time.

Seeing her outfit, Lily wasn't surprised anymore.

They arrived at the StellarAchievement Group on time, and unlike with Mike, the receptionist, knowing they were from Worry-Free Studio,was super polite and personally escorted them to the meeting room.
In no time, the CEO of the StellarAchievement Group showed up.

The receptionist introduced, "This is Mr. Sean Gray."

Sean shook hands with both of them. "Please, have a seat. Which one of you is Ms.Worry-Free?"
"That would be me," Ella, wearing a mask and a hat, deliberately lowered her voice when she spoke.Sean looked over, curious about Ella's getup."Why are you dressed like this?" "She has a cold," Lily blurted out. Seeing Sean'sskepticism, Lily could only smile to ease the awkwardness.
Luckily, Sean didn't dwell on it and quickly got down to business with Ella.The conversation went smoothly; Sean offered them substantial profits,showing them a lot of respect.In the end, both Ella and Lily were satisfied, and the collaboration was finalized.
"I'll have my secretary prepare the contract. How about we sign it today?"


Ella nodded. "Mr. Gray, you are very considerate."


"Sean!"
Someone walked in as Ella and Lily looked over.

Lily might not recognize him, but Ella knew him well.

It was Arthur's good friend, Alan Gray.What was he doing here?


Alan Gray...Mr.Gray!
Ella suddenly realized something. How did she not think of this earlier?

She wondered if Alan would recognize her. Luckily, she had disguised herself before coming out today.

"Who are these two?" Sean looked at them. "Ms.Worry-Free and her..." "Assistant..." Lily saw Sean pause and added with a smile.
###Chapter 12
Hearing the name "Ms. Worry-Free," Alan's eyes lit up like a Christmas tree.
He watched the two nod and head out.
Then he grabbed his phone and dialed Arthur, "Arthur, get to Sean's place ASAP. The Ms. Worry-Free you're looking for is at Sean's company right now..." Alan's voice was buzzing with excitement, but before he could finish, Arthur hung up.
Arthur left him with just one line.


"Wait for me."
The receptionist who had previously attended to Ella and Lily walked in and whispered something to Sean.

Ella noticed Sean's face change instantly.

After the receptionist finished, Sean stood up abruptly.

Looking at Ella and Lily, he said, "Sorry, something urgent came up at the company. Can we reschedule the contract signing?"

Ella stood up, seeing that Sean indeed had something pressing.

Since they arrived, Sean had been nothing but polite.

Hearing him say this, Ella nodded. "Mr. Gray, go ahead with your work.We can reschedule."

Sean smiled apologetically."I2mreally sorry. How about we exchange contact information?" Ella was momentarily stunned. If she added Sean as a friend, wouldn't her identity be exposed?





Sean didn't think much of it and exchanged contact information with her before leaving.

Lily and Ella had to cut their visit short.
After walking out of the meeting room. Lily headed for the elevator on the left.
For some reason, Ella felt uneasy and pulled Lily to the elevator on the other side.
Maybe the left elevator was faster, as both elevators arrived almost simultaneously.

As the elevator doors opened, Ella quickly pulled Lily inside.

At the same time, Arthur walked out of the other elevator.

Luckily, the doors had already closed, and Arthur didn't see them.

Lily pointed at the elevator in surprise. "Was that Arthur just now?"

Ella nodded,finally understanding why she had that uneasy feeling earlier.

"How did you know Arthur would comne?" Lily was still curious.

Ella didn't have any prophetic abilities. It was just that Alan's reaction earlier was a bit too much. After knowing their identities, he walked out. It might also be due to her uneasiness and her intuition. "Arthur is well-informed; he even knew that Ms. Worry-Free would come here."Just then, the elevator doors opened. Ella explained as she walked out,"The person who came in later is Alan; he's Arthur's good friend. He must have told Arthur that Ms. Worry-Free was here." Lily's eyes widened. "He won't recognize you, will he?"

"I've disguised myself like this. Even if Arthur stood right in front of me,he might not recognize me." Ella shook her head.
Hearing this, Lily smiled mischievously. "Then why did you pull me to run so fast?"
Ella didn't respond. She was also worried that Arthur might recognize her.It was always better to be cautious.

When Arthur arrived, he saw Alan waiting outside.

Seeing him come over, Alan led him inside.

Looking at the empty meeting room, Alan scratched his head,puzzled.


"Where'd they go? They were just here."

Arthur gave him a look. "Are you kidding me?"
 
Noticing Arthur's expression, Alan instinctively shrank back. He pulled Arthur to sit down and explained, "I swear, I just saw Ms.Worry-Free. But she was wearing a hat and mask, so I couldn't see her face," Recalling the scene of meeting Ella and Lily earlier, Sean couldn't figure out howthey disappeared after he left for a while. Seeing Arthur still skeptical, Alan was about to expl ain furth er when he saw Sean walking by."Sean!" Alan called out, stopping him.

Sean walked in upon hearing his name and was momentarily surprised to see Arthur but still greeted him.
"Sean,was Ms.Worry-Free here just now?"


Sean glanced at him and nodded.

"See, I told you." Alan spread his hands, looking smugly at Arthur.


"But you were just unlucky to miss her."

Seeing Alan's expression, Arthur frowned and ignored him.

Instead, he looked at Sean. "Mr. Gray, are you planning to collaborate with Worry-Free Studio?"

Sean nodded."Yes, but I had something urgent come up, so we have to reschedule the contract signing."

Seeing they had no other business, Sean left. Only Alan and Arthur were left in the meeting room. Seeing Arthur silent, Alan sat down in a carefree and easygoing manner."What do you want with that Ms.Worry-Free?" "Ava wants a wedding dress designed by Ms. Worry-Free," Arthur said coldly. Alan was surprised and leaned forward. "You still have feelings for Ava?"
Hearing this, Arthur irritably looked up.

"If you keep talking nonsense, I'lI send you to the mines to work."


Seeing his serious expression, Alan instantly shut his mouth.

"Let me know in advance when Sean signs the contract with them."Arthur stood up to leave.
He didn't expect Ms. Worry-Free to be so mysterious. He had tried to investigate her but found nothing.
"Got it, just leave it to me." Alan patted his chest in assurance.

Ella and Lily drove back, with Ella stilI lost in thought.

"I was careless. I forgot Alan's cousin's company is the Stellar Achievement Group. Since you have Sean's contact, you can go alone to sign the contract." Ella leaned lazily against the seat.

Lily was driving back, giving Ella a rare chance to relax.

"Are you still worried Alan will recognize you? I think you're overthinking it." Lily glanced at her.

After getting ín the car, Ella had taken off her hat and mask.

Hearing this, she smirked. "Better to be cautious."Lily agreed. A new restaurant had opened near Worry-Free Studio recently, and they were planning to try it out. Walking arm in arm, they passed a man.As they brushed past, the man turned back in confusion and tentatively called out."Ella?"
Seeing Ella turn back, Glenn Cole realized he hadn't mistaken her.

"Didn't expect to run into you here." Glenn smiled as he approached them.

"What are you doing here?" Ella was surprised; she remembered that he had gone abroad a long time ago.
###Chapter 13
 I was just running some errands nearby and happened to see you."




Ella and Lily exchanged a knowing smile at Glenn's comment.

They chatted for a bit and then decided to grab a meal at a nearby restaurant.
Lily had always thought Glenn was a great guy.
Too bad Ella had been head over heels for Arthur back then and hadn't noticed anyone else.
If Ella had picked Glenn,would things have been different?

Glenn gave a small smile. "My family sent me abroad, but after a while, I realized there's no place like home, so I came back."
Once he was back, Glenn wanted to reach ouat to Ella right away.


But knowing she was married,he held back.

Unexpectedly, he bumped into her the very next day.

Glenn looked at Ella and asked, "How have you been? Is Arthur treating you well?" Maybe his gaze was too intense, so Ella looked away. "We're planning to get a divorce." Hearing this.Glenn's heart skipped a beat. He didn't expect such good news.If they were getting a divorce,did that mean he still had a shot with Ella? Trying to keep his excitement in check, Glenn had to drop the subject as the waiter came in.During the meal, he tried to bring it up again, but Ella kept dodging the topic.
After a few tries. Glenn gave up.
After dinner, Ella stood next to Glenn, and a leaf fell on her hair.

Glenn reached out to brush it off, but she instinctively pulled away.

"A leaf fell on your head," Glenn said with a faint smile, standing close to her.
Just then, Alan happened to see them and snapped a photo.


He sent it to Arthur with a voice message.

"Isn't that Glenn, who used to chase after Ella? You better focus on Ella,or you might lose her without even realizing it."
Arthur, who was in a meeting, checked Alan's message and saw the photo of Ella and Glenn standing close together.His mood instantly soured, making the vice president, who was presenting,hesitate. Arthur tapped his fingers on the table, making everyone in the room nervous. After a moment, he coldly said. "That's it for today."Back in his office, Arthur stared at the photo on his phone, lost in thought. After a while, he sneered and felt a surge of irritation.

No wonder Ella was so eager for a divorce; she had found someone new.

Meanwhile, Ella and Lily had just returned to Worry-Free Studio when Lily got a call from Sean."Mr. Gray, I thought you changed your mind about signing with us," Lily joked.




Lily looked at Ella, who nodded, and then replied, "We have time."


They agreed on a time and hung up.

Lily looked at Ella. "Are you really not coming with me?"

Ella shook her head and waved from the sofa. "You go ahead."

Lily didn't push further and touched up her makeup in front of the mirror.She had to look her best representing Worry-Free Studio.
Half an hour later, Lily found herself in the same reception room as last time,facing Sean, Alan, and even Arthur. Seeing the three of them. Lily was glad Ella hadn't come. She glanced at the men in front of her. "Mr. Gray, what's this about?Could you introduce me to the clients?" Sean looked at the other two men. "Mr. Smith wants to talk business with Ms. Worry-Free." Arthur was a bit surprised to see Lily. Despite recalling her unfriendly attitude the last time at Worry-Free Studio, he still didn't mind. Why didn't Ms. Worry-Free come with you?" Arthur asked.

Lily glanced at him and replied indifferently, "She's visiting her late father's grave."
Arthur frowned, feeling a bit uncomfortable.
Seeing he didn't ask further, Lily turned back to Sean. "Mr. Gray, can we sign the contract now?"
Sean nodded and placed the contract in front of Lily.

She picked it up and read it carefully. The profit Sean offered to Worry-Free Studio was quite substantial.
Lily put down the contract. "Have you reviewed this contract?"

"Is there a problem?" Sean frowned, thinking Lily was dissatisfied with the terms.

"No problem, as long as you are okay with it, I'll sign."

Lily understood Sean's intention. It was a win-win situation.

Without hesitation, she signed the contract.Sean took the contract and extended his hand to Lily, "Here's to a successfulcollaboration." After signing the contract, Lily was about to leave when Sean called her back.
"Ms. Martin, have you heard of the Fashion Gala?"

Lily had heard of it, buIt the invitations were hard to come by.


"Of course." Lily looked at Sean,puzzled.
He took out two invitations. "These are for the gala. You and Ms. Worry-Free can attend."
Lily was tempted but knew not to accept benefits without merit.

"Mr. Gray, you're not only offering us more benefits in this collaboration but also extending invitations. Are you trying to buy us off?"
Sean chuckled. "Of course not. Since StellarAchievement Group is partnering with Worry-Free Studio, we're on the same team."
Seeing her still cautious, Sean continued, "Many renowned designers will be there. If Worry-Free Studio wants to make a name, this is a good start."

Lily had to admit, Sean's words were tempting.

"You make a good point. I'll accept the invitations, thank you," Lily said as she thanked him and left.

She didn't give Arthur a glance as she walked out. "Sean,did you specifically get those invitations for them?" Alan asked,watching Lily leave.
###Chapter 14
A few days back, when Sean asked Arthur for the invitations, he was right there with him. Alan was surprised to see Sean give them to Lily.

Sean just nodded, "Yep."He could tell that Ms. Worry-Free's designs were just as good as those big-name designers.
She just needed some recognition. Once people noticed her,Worry-Free Studio would be on the map for sure.

Arthur got up then. "I'm heading out."

On his way back, his phone rang. It was Ava.

Ava sounded super excited. "Arthur, I got an invite to the fashion gala!"

"We'll go together. Maybe we'll get lucky and meet Ms. Worry-Free,"Arthur said softly.

Ava was thrilled to hear Arthur would be with her.

Lily got back to Worry-Free Studio and saw Ella still there. She dropped two invitations in front of her.

Ella's eyes widened when she saw them.

Holding the invitations, she asked, "Where did you get these?"

"Sean gave themn to me," Lily said with a grin and repeated what Sean had told her.

"Who knew Sean was such a nice guy?" Lily raised an eyebrow at Ella's praise. "So, are we going or not?""Of course, we are. We can't pass up such a great chance."This was a big fashion design gala. Without Sean's help, Worry-Free Studio would have struggled to get an invite. This time, how many orders we get all depends on you," Ella said seriously to Lily.
Then she went to the table, sat down, and started sketching intently.

Seeing Ella so focused, Lily didn't want to disturb her and just sat quietly beside her.
An hour later. Ella held up the two invitations, looking pleased.


Hillside Villa, the gala venue.
Lily pulled Ella to the entrance, about to show their invitations when they heard a commotion behind them.
Ella turned and saw Arthur and Ava stepping out of the same Rolls-Royce.

Ava was clinging to Arthur's arm, wearing one of Ella's rush designs.


Ella's eyes stung at the sight.

Lily saw them too.

"Those jerks, watch me tear them apart," Lily said,ready to charge over. Ella quickly grabbed Lily, showed their invitations to the staff,and then pulled her into the villa. "Why'd you stop me?" Lily asked, annoyed. "They're so shameless, and you can just stand it?"Ella laughed, "Come on, don't get mad. Arthur and I are getting divorced anyway. Whoever he brings here is none of my business. Remember why we're here."
Even though she said it didn't matter, Ella's heart still ached.

After all those years of marriage, Arthur had never taken her to any gala.But with Ava, he was willing to break all the rules.
Ella gave a self-mocking laugh. He simply didn't love her.

They stood in a corner, watching Arthur and Ava walk in together.

They looked like the perfect match. Especially the diamond necklace around Ava's neck caught Ella's eye.
If she remembered right, that necklace was a new piece from Kismet Jewelry Creations,a one-of-a-kind, worth over five million bucks.

Ella had casually mentioned it before, but she never thought she'd see it on Ava.

"Let's head over," Ella said, taking a deep breath and smiling at Lily.

She walked past Arthur, feeling his intense gaze on her back. She didn't need to look to know it was him.

Ava noticed Arthur's distraction. "Arthur, what are you looking at
Arthur snapped back. "Nothing, let's go inside."Ava clung to his arm, and they walked in together. Ava shot them a meaningful look. She wasn't about to let anyone take the Mrs. Smith title from her. With a proper smile. Ava followed Arthur, greeting everyone they met.On the other side. Ella adjusted Lily's outfit. "Remember our goal today.Worry-Free Studio's reputation is riding on you."
Lily nodded seriously, and they shared a smile.

Ella had always focused on her family, so she wasn't as experienced in socializing as Lily.

This time, Ella was counting on Lily.

Her main job was to walk around in that dress, letting more people see their company's designs.
When Ava saw Ella, she could've avoided her, but instead, she dumped a whole glass of red wine on Ella's dress.
The dress was instantly stained, and Ella looked up, catching the smug look on Ava's face.

Since Ella showed up, she'd been drawing everyone's attention. Ava didn't want her stealing the spotlight.

Ella frowned and called out to Ava.

"Ms. Davis, you spilled wine on my dress. Shouldn't you apologize?" Ella's voice was calm but clear, and a few people around heard it. The chatter around them died down. The chatter around them died down.She then looked at Ella with disdain.′′Ifyou can't afford it, just say so.Why lie to us?"Daisy and Ava deliberately raised their voices, drawing the attention of those nearby.

###Chapter 15
Noticing everyone staring,Ella frowned.

"Who said her dress wasn't designed by Ms. Worry-Free?"

Lily strutted over in her high heels, the fringe on her dress swaying with each step.
She stepped in front of Ella and pulled her behind her.

She had noticed the commotion earlier but didn't expect Ella to be the one getting bullied.
"This dress was custom-made by Ms. Worry-Free for Ella. It's one of a kind. I heard someone mention compensation?"
"Alright, let's settle this. How much do you think Ms. Davis's dress is worth?"

Lily looked straight at Daisy.

Caught off guard, Daisy stammered, "This dress looks beautiful on Ava."

Lily grinned. "Ms. Lynn, you have good taste. The dress Ava's wearing is also by Ms. Worry-Free, but it's not that pricey, just thirty million dollars."

Thirty million dollars! Daisy's eyes nearly popped out of her head; she thought the dress was only a few million. Seeing Daisy's shock, Lily nodded, satisfied. "Ella's dress is custom-made too,so it's the same price. How do you plan to compensate?" This price was way out of Daisy's league.Hearing Lily's question, she stammered, unable to form a sentence.
Lily glanced at Ella and winked.

Just then, Arthur walked over.
He stood next to Ava and asked softly, "What's going on?"

Before Ava could answer, Daisy spilled the whole story.

Arthur glanced at them, but Ella didn't even look his way.

His gaze lingered on Ella for a moment before he looked away.


Seeing Arthur, Ella felt a pang of bitterness.


He was here just to back up Ava.
"Arthur, maybe I should apologize to Ms. Rossi," Ava said, sounding a bit pitiful.
Ella sneered, "Looks like Ms. Davis isn't planning to apologize,so compensation it is."
"I'll cover it," Arthur said, his face expressionless, still looking coldly at them.
 
"You are a..." Lily was about to curse him out b ut was stopped by Ella.Ella smiled faintly. "Alright, Mr. Smith, you know our Worry-Free Studio's account number, so don't forget to transfer the thirty million dollars."
  Before leaving. Ella glanced at Ava. "Ms. Davis, next time, try a different tactic. Using the same omne over and over is pretty boring, don't you think?" With that. Ella didn't give her a chance to respond, pulling Lily along as they left.Throughout the whole thing. Ella didn't look at Arthur even once. Luckily, the villa had rooms for guests. Ella andI Lily hadn't expected this mess and didn't bring extra clothes.
Sitting in the room, Ella felt a bit down.
"Why'd you stop me? I should've given those bitches a piece of my mind,"Lily fumed.
"If you had, everyone would know about my relationship with Arthur by tomorrow. I don't want us three trending."
Hearing this, Lily paused, then slumped on the sofa,deflated.


"But you can't keep taking this crap every time."

"I'm not taking crap. A dress for thirty million dollars? We won, didn't we?"

Seeing Ella so calm, Lily didn't know what to say and just sighed.

"The gala's not over yet. You should head back out. Come get me when it's done." Ella hadn't forgotten the main event; she was just a companion. Lily still had the main task to handle, and they couldn't both stay here. "Alright, you rest up."Lily's determined expression made Ella chuckle. As she watched Lily open the door and leave, the smile on Ella's face faded.Thinking about how Arthur stood up for Ava earlier, she felt a pang in her heart. She sat on the sofa, the wine stain on her chest looking even more glaring.


Suddenly, there was a knock on the door.
Ella walked over and opened it, her smnile freezing when she saw Arthur's face.
"What are you doing here?" Ella's tone was icy, as if he were a nobody.

Arthur stepped in and pressed Ella against the door, holding her in his arms.
They were close, and Ella was annoyed, trying to break free from Arthur's grip.
"Of course, to have sex with you." His crude words made Ella freeze.


This bastard!'

"Arthur, are you crazy? Ava is still waiting for you outside."

Ella deliberately mentioned Ava,hoping Arthur would calm down. Unexpectedly, Arthur ignored her words, just grabbing her chin and kissing her roughly, as if he wanted to devour her. Ella could only tilt her head back and endure until she felt she was about to suffocate, and Arthur finally let her go.

He had wanted todo this since he saw her at the gala.Seeing Ella's dazed eyes, Arthur held her back, pressing her against the door.




In the next moment, Arthur's hand reached under her skirt.

Realizing what Arthur wanted to do, Ella snapped back to full consciousness instantly.
She reached out to push his hand away. "Arthur, are you crazy? You can't do this here."
Arthur ignored her resistance, pulling her panties aside and inserting his fingers into her vagina.
The earlier kiss had already made her vagina wet, and Arthur's fingers slid in without any resistance.
Arthur added another finger and started thrusting in and out of her.


Ella let out soft sounds.

She was pressed against the door, clearly hearing the sounds outside. The voices outside stimulated Ella's nerves. so that her vagina couldn't help but tighten. Arthur's fingers were already wet with her juices. He pulled his fingers out. unbuckling his belt with one hand. He rubbed his erect penis eagerly against her clitoris before thrusting into her vagina. "No..."
Before Ella could finish her words. Arthur was already thrusting rapidly in her body.
Her dress had long been pushed up to her waist, revealing her slender waist.
Arthur's large hands gripped Ella's waist, thrusting in and out.


"Ava, are you sure Arthur came here?"

Outside,Daisy and Ava's voices came through.

Hearing their voices, Ella snapped back to reality, realizing what they were doing.
"Arthur..." Ella was about to speak, but her voice was drowned out by the thrusting behind her.
###Chapter 16
All the words turned into muffled groans.

Arthur finally stopped after who knows how long.
He carefully fixed Ella's dress and carried her to the sofa. Ella shot him a look full of disgust.
"Happy now? Let's just call that our last time before the divorce."

Arthur froze at her words. "You really can't wait to get divorced, huh? Fine,I'll give you what you want. See you at the courthouse at 9 AM tomorrow.
"
Without another glance, Arthur walked out with a cold expression.


Ella sat there for a bit before slowly getting up and leaving.

The party outside was still in full swing. Ella found Lily and used the excuse of not feeling well to leave early.
She didn't know how long it took, but she walked all the way home from the villa.

That evening, Ella got a call from Lily.

 
"Feeling any better?" Ella's mind was a bit foggy, but she remembered her excuse. "Yeah, much better.How about you?" Lily got excited on the other end. "You wouldn't believe how great tonight was. So many wealthy ladies and heiresses placed orders with me. We're gonna be busy for the next three months." Ella wasn't surprised; she had a lot of faith in Lily's skills. "Oh. and Arthur already transferred thirty million dollars for your dress to your account."Ella was momentarily stunned at the mention of his name. "Okay." Noticing Ella's hoarse voice, Lily asked worriedly, "Should I come over and keep you company tonight? You don't sound well."
Having been friends for so long. Lily quickly sensed something was off.

"I'm just a bit tired. A good night's sleep will fix it. You've had a long day too, so get some rest and don't worry about me."
Lily was silent for a moment before saying, "Alright, but call me if you need anything."

Ella agreed and then hung up the phone.

She lay down on the bed and quickly fell into a deep sleep.

In the middle of the night, she felt really cold and her head was heavy.

She turned on the bedside lamp and fumbled for a thermometer in the drawer.

Sure enough, she had a fever. Ella sighed, found some fever medicine,and took it, hoping this cold wouldn't mess up her divorce proceedings in the morning. After taking the medicine, Ella drifted back to sleep. When Ella opened her eyes, she saw a white ceiling and smelled the scent of disinfectant in the air. She slowly turned her head and saw Lily asleep by the bedside. Recognizing the room's setup, Ella realized she was in the hospital. "You're awake?" Lily rubbed her eyes.
"If I hadn't sensed something was wrongand come to your house in time,you might have developed pneumonia." Lily pointed at Ella,looking at her weak appearance with concern.




Ella drank the water with Lily's help and then lay back down.

"What time is it now?" Ella was most concerned about the divorce.


"It's 9 PM."
Ella was surprised; she hadn't expected it to be so late.

She wondered how Arthur was doing. This was the second time she had missed their appointment.
Meanwhile, Arthur and Alan were hanging out in a private room at Night of Crystal.

Alan hada woman on each arm, clearly having a good time.

Seeing Arthur's gloomy face all night, Alan waved the women away. Once they left, Alan poured himself a drink, clinked glasses with Arthur,and downed it. "You've been sitting here all night, not drinking or messing around. Are you planning to stay faithful to Ella?" Alan teased.
Hearing Ella's name. Arthur felt a wave of irritation.

Noticing his expression, Alan smirked. "Got it. Did you have a fight with Ella? Women are always emotional; just sweet-talk her a bit,and everything will be fine." Seeing no change in Arthur's expression, Alan continued, "If that doesn't work,just buy her something. Don't women love bags and jewelry?" Arthur stayed silent, and Alan fell quiet too.
After a while, he tentatively asked, "Could it be that Ella found out about you and Ava, and now she wants a divorce?"
Arthur's expression turned so dark it seemed like a storm was brewing.


Realizing he had hit the mark, Alan also fell silent.


"Really, Ella wants a divorce?"

Arthur responded flatly, "Yes."

The weight of this statement took Alan a moment to process.

"How far along are you in the divorce process?"

"Ella has scheduled two appointments at the court for the divorce,and each time she didn't show up. This time, she went completely off the grid for a whole day." Arthur was troubled by this."It's not a big deal; you haven't divorced yet, right? If you don't want to divorce, just apologize to Ella. You've been together for so many years." Arthur wasn't the one who wanted the divorce; it was Ella. But he didn't say this out loud."Why didn't Ella contact me all day today? We were supposed to finalize the divorce, but she didn't show up." Arthur frowned.
This had been bothering him all day.
Alan chuckled, "I think Ella did it on purpose. She probably doesn't want to divorce you, so she stood you up. What's that saying?"




Arthur frowned, recalling Ella's resolute tone when she mentioned the divorce. It didn't quite add up.
Calming down, Arthur thought he must be crazy to ask Alan for advice,given how unreliable he was.
But he couldn't help but feel a glimmer of hope. Could Ella really be playing hard to get?
Ella stayed in the hospital for a few days. When the hospital finally allowed her to be discharged, Lily handled the paperwork for her.
This incident had scared Lily. On the day of discharge, she packed her bags and moved in with Ella.

 Seeing the suitcase in Lily's hand, Ella couldn't help but laugh.The fever hit her out of nowhere, and she was surprised by how intense it was.
"Tll be staving here for a while." Lily unpacked her things.


Ella knew Lily was worried about her, so she agreed.
###Chapter 17
Two of them were chilling on the sofa when Ella's phone suddenly buzzed.
Seeing the name on the screen. Ella quickly picked up.

"Ella. I'm almost at your place. Are you home?"

Hearing Sofia's voice, Ella shot up from the sofa.

"Grandma, why didn't you tell me you were coming? I could've picked you up." Ella grabbed her coat, ready to head out.
"I just missed you and wanted to see you."

Ella's nose tingled, and she told Sofia to wait for her after getting out of the car.

After hanging up, Lily asked, "Is your grandma here?"

Ella nodded. "Yeah, she's almost here. I need to get Arthur's home fast.I can't let her know about my divorce with Arthur."

In Sofia's mind, she was really fond of Arthur.

Even though Sofia and Arthur didn't meet often, Arthur always put on a good show in front of Sofia.

The main thing was, she didn't want Sofia to worry about her.After leaving the apartment, Ella pulled out her phone and called Arthur. Almost as soon as she dialed,he picked up. "Arthur, can you come home for a bit? Grandma's coming over, and she doesn't know about our divorce. I don't want her to worry," Ella's voice was a bit anxious, and she spoke with a slight nasal tone.

"I'm really busy."Ella was stunned for a moment, then explained, "Grandma and I will stay over tonight, and I'll take her away early tomorrow morning." On the other end, Arthur was about to speak when he realized the call had been hung up. He stared at his phone in silence for a long time before finally grabbing his coat and leaving the office.
Ella rushed from the apartment to the house she used to share with Arthur, and luckily, Sofia hadn't arrived yet.
After waiting for a bit. Ella saw a car approaching from a distance.


As it got closer, she realized it was Arthur's car.

Seeing him get out, Ella was a bit surprised. "Weren't you busy?"

Arthur awkwardly tugged at his coat. "I can't let Grandma worry."

So it was for Sofia, not her, and the litte bit of hope in Ella's heart was crushed.

"Can you not let Ava come over these two days? I don't want Grandma to see her." Arthur frowned and was about to explain when he saw Sofia getting out of the car. Seeing Sofia, Ella quickly walked over and took her bag. Unexpectedly. Arthur came over, skillfully took her bag, and walked to the other side to support Sofia."Grandma, why didn't you call me when you were coming? I could've driven over to pick you up." Arthur supported Sofia as they walked slowly.On the way home, Arthur and Sofia chatted happily, leaving Ella feeling left out.
Ella watched and felt that Arthur had two faces.
"Grandma, have you eaten?" Ella pulled Sofia to sit on the sofa,holding her hand and looking her over.
This time, when Ella saw Sofia, she noticed that her hair at the temples had turned white.
She was already an adult, yet Sofia still worried about her. If Sofia found out about the divorce, Ella couldn't imagine how heartbroken she'd be.
"Ella, are you feeling unwell? Why does your voice sound muffled?" Sofia looked at Ella with concern.
Unexpectedly, Sofia noticed something was off after just one sentence.


"Grandma. I'm fine. I just had a cold a few days ago."

Arthur, who had been sitting there, frowned but kept quiet since Sofia was still around. "Grandma, it's getting late. Let me take you to your room to rest." Ella figured Sofia must be tired from the journey, so she took her to the guest room. After settling Sofia in, Ella came out.Seeing Arthur still there, she was a bit surprised. "Aren't you going back?"
"This is my home too. Where do you want me to go?"

Ava's name was on the tip of her tongue, but Ella stayed silent.


"When did you catch a cold?"
Hearing Arthur suddenly ask, Ella found it a bit strange but still answered,"The night before we were supposed to go to court, I had a high fever and almost got pneumonia. Lily took me to the hospital. I didn't skip on purpose."
Taking this opportunity, Ella quickly explained.

It wouldn't be good if Arthur misunderstood.

Arthur nodded and walked towards the bedroom.

Turning back, he saw Ella still standing there. "Aren't you coming? Do you want Grandma to find out we're sleeping in separate roomns?"

Of course not!

Ella hesitated briefly before following him.

"There are no extra blankets here." Seeing Ella still looking around, Arthur explained.

'What should I do? We couldn't sleep in the same bed, could we? Ella stood there, indecisive, and saw that Arthur had already changed into his pajamas and was lying on the bed. 'It's not as if we haven't slept together before!' Ella comforted herself,thinking it was just for a few days until Sofia left.
After figuring it out. Ella lay down as well.
She couldn't remember how many times they had slept together since the divorce.
Familiar scents surrounded her, and Ella fell into a deep sleep.

The next morning, when she woke up, Arthur was already gone.


She sat on the sofa for a while before leaving the bedroom.

In the living room,Arthur was talking to Sofia about something, making her laugh heartily.
Watching their interaction, Ella was a bit mesmerized.

"Ella, you're awake. Come and have breakfast. There are all your favorites."Sofia waved her over.
The three of them sat around the dining table. Arthur served porridge to Sofia first, then to Ella, and finally to himself.
During breakfast, Arthur kept putting food on Ella's plate.


Seeing their interaction, Sofia was very pleased.

After breakfast, Arthur left for the office.Only Sofia and Ella were left at home. "Ella, is Arthur good to you?"
###Chapter 18
Ella couldn't answer Sofia's question and just bolted out of there, totally freaked out.

Worry-Free Studio.
Ella dragged herself into the office, collapsed into a chair, looking pale and out of it.
"What happened? Who sucked the soul out of you?"

Lily walked over, lifting Ella's chin with a smirk. "Or did you suck the life out of someone else?"
Ella couldn't help but chuckle. "Cut it out, I have a massive headache!"

She rubbed her temples, exhausted. "I was all set to get a divorce,but now that my Grandma's here, it's onhold for now!"
Thinking about Sofia's question, the truth was something Sofia couldn't handle. And she couldn't come up with a lie either. So she ran.
"There's no other way!" Lily patted her shoulder. "Hang in there! Wait until your grandma leaves to get the divorce! But your grandma's sharp,be careful!"

"Let's just drop it!" Ella opened her laptop. "Forget the worries, let's get to work!" Time flew by as they got busy, and before they knew it, the end of the workday had arrived. Ella checked her phone, but there were no messages.She sighed.She shut down her computer, and as she got on the elevator, her phone rang.Arthur said shortly and clearly, "I'm waiting for you downstairs!" The call ended, and she quickly left the office. As soon as she stepped outside, she saw a Rolls-Royce parked at the entrance.
She hesitated for a moment, then got into the front passenger seat.


"Sit in the back!" A cold voice came from the back.


Ella stiffened. "I like sitting here!"


"Come over!"
Arthur's commanding tone left no room for argument.

Thinking of Sofia, Ella sighed, got out of the car, and sat in the back seat."Thanks for picking me up. Once Grandma leaves, we'll get the divorce papers sorted out immediately."
Hearing her indlifferent tone, Arthur felt a strange irritation; he loosened his tie and noticed Ella sitting as far from him as possible, like there was a galaxy between them.

He irritably opened his laptop and started checking emails.


The car was dead silent. Ella felt awkward, so she pulled out her laptop and continued working on her design drafts. "What are you doing?" Arthur glanced over, puzzled. "Are you drawing fashion sketches?"

His disdainful tone was hard to miss.
Ella was taken aback; she just adjusted her position. "We're about to get divorced. I need to make a living."

"I can..."
Suddenly, his words were cut off by his ringing phone.


Arthur quickly answered.
"Arthur, where are you? I want to invite you to dinner!"


Ava's flirty voice came through the phone.

Ella's body tensed, a flash of pain crossed her eyes, but she quickly composed herself, focusing on her laptop screen.
Arthur instinctively looked at Ella, seeing her calm expression, a strange feeling rose in his chest.

"I'm busy right now!" His voice was cold.


"But I want to be with you!"

"Alright, another time! I'm busy, gotta go now!"


The call ended.

The car fell into an awkward silence, both of them engrossed in their laptops.

Back home, the table was already set with food. Ella was about to help, but Arthur stepped into the kitchen first.
"Grandma. need any help?"
"No. you just wait to eat! It'll be ready soon!"

Sofia cheerfully shooed them both out of the kitchen.

The dishes, though simple, had a comforting, homey taste.

Ella playfully said, "Grandma, it's so good to have you here!"

"You're too old to be acting cute, eat up!" Sofia served them both a portion of the stew. "This isstew,Ella's favorite!"

"Thanks, Grandma! So happy!"

Ella took a bite, grinning from ear to ear.

Sofia suddenly exclaimed, "I forgot to make juice! We need a balanced diet!11

She was about to get up when Arthur stood up first. "I got it!"

Watching his handsome back, Sofia blinked. "There aren't many good men like him, you should cherish him! Have a baby soon!"

She smiled mysteriously.

Ella was stunned. "Grandma, some things..." Before she could finish, Arthur returned with the juice. "Freshly squeezed is too much trouble, I found this semi-finishedproduct in the fridge!" Looking at the apple juice in front of her, Ella's lips curled into a smile,cursing inwardly. I don't eat apples or drink apple juice, a blatant act of revenge, just because I interrupted his date, he used apple juice to annoy me.' Ella couldn't stand it, her eyes sparkled, she picked up a piece of mushroom and put it in Arthur's plate."Try it,your favorite!"
Arthur looked at the mushroom, speechless.


He squinted,a bit confused.
Ella playfully smiled. "What's wrong? Don't you like it? Grandma madeit!""I likeit!"
Seeing Sofia's expectant gaze, Arthur reluctantly put it in his mouth.

"So you like mushrooms! I'll add more next time!" Sofia treated Arthur like her own child.
She picked up the utensils and put all the mushrooms from the stew into Arthur's plate.
Ella kept her head down, afraid to look at him, worried she would laugh out loud.

Arthur's lips tightened, without a word, he ate everything in the plate clean,then looked up to see Ella's shaking shoulders.
Arthur placed a piece of bell pepper in Ella's plate, raising an eyebrow."I know you like this, Grandma made it, eat more!"Ella couldn't laugh anymore. While Arthur's lips curled into a bright smile, "Don't disappoint Grandma!" "Thank you!"
Ella gritted her teeth, angrily eating all the bell peppers.

At the table, they retaliated against each other by giving the food the other disliked the most.


Sofia watched them, smiling broadly. "You two are so loving!"


After dinner, Ella sprinted back to her room.

She was surprised to see Arthur when opening the door.

"Aren't you going back?" Ella asked,puzzled.

Arthur lay on the bed, "Worried Grandma will suspect, let's cooperate!"



"Alright!"
Thinking about sleeping on the floor again tonight, Ella's face scrunched up, she irritably walked into the bathroom.
Returning to the bedroom, she saw the figure by the window, and her movements paused.

The bedroom light was off, moonlight lazily streamed in. Arthur sat lazily on the window seat, wearing a bathrobe, his handsome face hidden in the shadows, just a side profile was enough to make her swoon. Ella found herself once again drawn to him; she nervously swallowed. Arthur in front of her was too handsome. With his handsome face and perfect figure, he wore a bathrobe loosely.revealing firm muscles that radiated charm and seduction.
Thinking about those nights of passionate entanglement with him, and his penis,her cheeks flushed.If she kept looking, she worried she could not resist herself pouncing on him, she picked up her laptop, turned her back to the window,and started working. By the window, Arthur lowered his eyes, withdrew his gaze, and lowered his loose bathrobe, revealing his firm abs.
###Chapter 19

Another design drawing done.
Ella stretched and lay on the floor wrapped in a blanket.

She had barely lain down when she started shivering. She checked the air conditioner and saw it was only 50 degrees Fahrenheit. It was freezing. It was summer, and Ella only had a light blanket. She got up to find the air conditioner remote, but it wasn't in its usual spot. "Did Grandma put it away?" she wondered, continuing her search.

Arthur mumbled, "Rummaging around in the middle of the night might wake Grandma!"
Sofia, being older, was easily disturbed in her sleep.

Ella thought for a moment and lay back down.

The cold air cut through her, making her teeth chatter and her whole body shake.

"Get in bed! Your teeth chattering is driving me nuts!"

Arthur's cold voice sounded, and he moved to make space.

Without thinking. Ella jumped up and got into bed, "I'm doing this for my health!"

"I know," Arthur responded indifferently.

Ella lay in the spot Arthur had just vacated, still warm from his body heat. A warm feelingspread through her heart, and a smile appeared on her lips.In the darkness. Arthur's unique scent lingered around her nose, and she felt the warmth from his body. Shivering. Ella couldn't help but keep moving closer to Arthur.

She comforted herself. saying it was for her health. Besides, they had slept together for years; what was wrong with warming up next to him?
Sleepiness overcame her, and she drifted off.

The sound of steady breathing and warm breath on his ear ignited his desire.
Arthur's body stiffened, and his penis instantly hardened.

He was about to pull her into his arms when he noticed Ella's face contorted in a frown, sweat beading on her forehead. She was having a nightmare.
Seeing this, he whispered in her ear, "Don't be afraid, it's just a nightmare."


Ella relaxed in her sleep, turned over, and hugged Arthur like a pillow.


Their bodies pressed tightlytogether.

Arthur's penis, like a beast, roared incessantly. Arthur would never hold back his desire, especially when the woman in his arms was his wife. He grabbed her slender waist with one hand and lifted her leg with the other,about to enter her vagina.
 Suddenly, he was slapped so hard across the face that his head turned to the side. "What are you doing?" Arthur met her cold eyes, gritting his teeth. "Shouldn't I be asking you that?" Ella's eyes were icy, full of disdain. "Stay away from me, we're about to get divorced!"




She shuddered when she thought this. "Stay away from me!"

Arthur propped himself up on the bed, speaking loftily, "Don't you want a child?"
"Why would I want a child after a divorce?" Ella felt it was absurd and moved aside to keep her distance.

"You are just playing hard to get!"

Arthur pulled something from under the pillow and threw it at her.


It was a rose quartz bracelet symbolizing fertility.

"Isn't this ultimately for the sake of the child?" Arthur's voice was cold,"If you are playing hard to get, you need to know your limits!"

She claimed she wanted a divorce, but she stood him up repeatedly.

In the past, he despised such tricks.
Now, there was a rose quartz bracelet, symbolizing fertility, under her pillow.Ella shook off his arm. "I help you deal with your grandfather, you help me with my Grandma, fair enough. Other than that, no way!" Now he thought having a child wouldn't be so bad!

He looked at Ella's beautiful face and sparkling eyes, his throat tightening.

Ella was stunned, not knowing how to explain. To Arthur,she seemed scared.
He tore off her nightgown and pressed her heavily.

His penis was aligned with her vagina and ready to enter.

Suddenly, he felt a sharp pain on his head. Arthur realized Ella had hit him with her phone.

"You..."

"If you need to have sex, go to your lover!"

Ella wrapped herself in the blanket and moved to the corner. "I really want a divorce; you're not worth me playing hard to get. As for the bracelet..."

She put it in her bag. "Even if I want a child, it won't be with you!"


"Who do you want to have a child with?"

Arthur, naked, grabbed her arm. "Don't overdo it; you need to know when to stop!" She ignored him and went to sleep wrapped in the blanket.

In the morning.
Ella woke up groggily and saw Arthur's handsome face.


What was going on?'
She was tightly wrapped in the blanket, while Arthur clung to her like a koala.

"Awake? Is it warm under the blanket?"

His cold voice had a hint of sarcasm.
Ella woke up instantly and pushed him away. "You're the one who didn't want to cover yourself with the blanket!"
Arthur gave her a cold look, sneezed, and calmly started changing clothes.

Ella then noticed he was wearing several bathrobes. She had forgotten he didn't have a warm blanket last night.

As he took off the bathrobes one by one, Arthur stood naked in front of her.

Ella turned her face away. "Don't you know to change clothes in private!"


She stormed into the bathroom,fuming.

Worry-Free Studio.

Thinking of Arthur sneezing as he left.

Ella took out her phone, wanting to call him to show some concern, but before she could call, Lily walked over."Look.a rare opportunity!"


"What is it?""A designer competition, live broadcast! If we can participate in this competition,Worry-Free Studio's reputation will definitely soar!"
In recent years, live broadcasts had become increasingly popular.


Major competitions had started using live broadcasts.

This designer competition was the highest level in the country.

If they could place, Worry-Free Studio would secure a spot in the fashion industry.
Ella nodded without hesitation. "We should seize such a great opportunity."
"Of course! Thanks to Mr. Gray, he introduced us to this competition!" Lily brought over information on other participants.
Ella saw that they were all famous designers; many of them were even veterans.

"How about it? Are you scared?" Lily raised an eyebrow.

"Of course not!" Ella's eyes sparkled. "This is a great opportunity,I want to see what I'm capable of!"

"Then it's settled!" "Alright! But there's one thing we need to discuss first!"Ella, using Lily's phone, sent a message to Mr. Gray,and his reply came instantly.Lily glanced at it and laughed. "You're really cautious,making an agreement with Mr. Gray not to teIl Arthur about our participation in the competition!"
"No choice, we must take precautions!" Ella shrugged.


Worry-Free Studio downstairs.

A Rolls-Royce was parked at the entrance.

Arthur crossed his legs and glanced at his phone.

The driver in front gathered his courage to ask, "The necklace..."


"Throw it away!"

Arthur closed his eyes, feeling irritated.

Finding the necklace at the office, he suddenly remembered it was originally the Valentine's Day gift for Ella.
Now,it seemed the necklace was unnecessary because she wanted to get a divorce.
###Chapter 20
 The car zoomed away from the Worry-Free Studio like a bat out of hell. In the end, the necklace wasn't thrown away; it was just carelessly tossed aside.Arthur shut his eyes, trying to rest, but his mind was a mess, full of restless thoughts that wouldn't go away.
Back at the office, he made a beeline for his private elevator. Just as he turned a corner, he heard a familiar voice and stopped dead in his tracks,looking towards the sound.
There, in the corner, stood Ava, her back to him, her shoulders shaking uncontrollably.
"Stop pressuring me! I know making it in the entertainment industry is tough, and breaking into fashion is even harder, especially for someone like me with no connections. But I don't want anything to mess up my relationship with Arthur."
Ava's voice was thick with emotion, tears streaming down her face as she spoke.

"Are you nuts? There are tons of pretty girls like you in the entertainment industry. This opportunity was yours, but they took your job because of their connections," Donny Dickson said, noticing a figure nearby and speaking even more harshly on purpose. "I don't care!" Ava cried harder, her voice breaking. "I'd rather be jobless than ask for his help!""No way, if you lose this job. I'll terminate your contract and blacklist you in the industry. You'll never get a chance to become famous!"Donny stepped forward to grab Ava's arm, and they started to struggle. "Stop!" A cold voice cut through the air.
Arthur stepped forward, pushing Donny away and standing protectively in front of Ava. "What's going on?"
"Nothing, you should go back. I was just passing by your company,"Ava said quickly,waving her hand.
Arthur's eyes narrowed as he grabbed her wrist. "What happened to your hand?"
He glared at Donny. "I know you. Did you hurt her hand?"


"So what if I did!"
Donny looked defiant. "I had no choice.I told her to ask you for help, but she refused, so I had to drag her here!"

Arthur's face darkened. "How dare you!"

Donny swallowed hard. "The entertainment industry is just that realistic.No connections,no resources..."

"Enough, I'll terminate the contract. You can blacklist me if you want!"

Ava was shaking with anger, tears streaming down her face."Fin e, but there will be a penalty! It's a significant amount!" ′′Getlog⁡t′′Arthur kicked Donny to the ground.Hearing the commotion, security guards rushed in and dragged Donny out,covering his mouth. Ava hung her head, looking pitiful. "I'm sorry for causing you trouble!""It doesn't matter!" Arthur handed her a tissue. "Leave the contract to me. I'll handle it for you!"
"No need! Maybe I'm just not cut out for the entertainment industry."



"Leave it to me!"
Arthur's phone rang, and he frowned. "You should go back. Don't worry,the job is yours!"
Watching him walk away, Ava wiped her tears, shook her hair, and left the company.
In the limousine, Donny gave a thumbs up. "Great acting! With your skills and resources, it's hard not to become a top actress!"
"Thanks for the compliment!" Ava took out a mirror to touch up her makeup.
Ten minutes later,Donny got a call and laughed happily. "It's done. This competition involves a collaboration between artists and designers; you're destined to become an overnight sensation!" After work, Ella went home as usual, opened the door, and found the place empty.She was worried. "Where are Sofia and Arthur?"
She quickly ran to the bedroom and found the luggage there,but Sofia was gone. She pulled out her phone and made several calls, but no one picked up.She found Arthur's number and dialed, but it was the same story-no answer. Ella was freaking out, dropped her bag, and rushed out the door.



Where could Sofia be?
She didn't know the area well and had no friends around here!


A million bad thoughts raced through her mind.

Her legs felt like jelly as she hurried through the neighborhood. After a short distance,she heard a familiar laugh.

"Grandma!"
In the park, Sofia was playing cards with some other elderly folks, while Arthur sat nearby, looking like a dutiful grandson.

Hearing her voice, both turned to look.

Sofia waved, showing off her cards. "You're back? Arthur was worried I'd be bored, so he brought me here to play! I ran into these folks playing cards and joined in!"
Ella sighed, feeling a mix of relief and frustration. "You should have called me!" "I didn't bring my phone!" Sofia laughed heartily. Ella shot a look at Arthur. "What about your phone?" "Left it at home." Arthur replied nonchalantly.Ten minutes later. Sofia was holding a bunch of money. "Look,I won all this! We can come back tomorrow!"
"As long as you're happy," Ella said, shaking her head.

As it got dark, cooking at home seemed like a hassle,so the three of them went to a restaurant.
After playing cards and enjoying a good meal, Sofia couldn't stop smiling.

Back home, Sofia pulled Ella aside. "Arthur seems great. You need to hold on to him. How's it been these past few days? That bracelet is very effective; I bet you'll have a baby next year!"
"Okay! You should rest now," Ella said, trying to hide her discomfort.


It was clear Sofia genuinely liked Arthur.

Today, as the two played cards in the park, they looked like a loving grandma and grandson.
But Ella still wanted a divorce. Her heart felt heavy with sorrow.

Back in the room, she saw Arthur in a video conference and didn't want to disturb him, so she sat quietly.

When the meeting ended, Arthur's indifferent gaze fel on her."Thanks for these past few days," Ella said, lowering her eyes, her lashes trembling. She clasped her hands tightly, feeling very nervous. Arthur closed his laptop without a word. just staring at her.
The room was eerily silent.Ella looked up. "Actually, you don't have to come back every day.You can go be with..."
Ava's name was on the tip of her tongue, but she didn't say it.

Arthur squinted, a smirk playing on his lips. "Are you kicking me out?"


Ella stood her ground,refusing to say more.
"Good job." Arthur muttered through gritted teeth and walked straight into the bathroom.

The night passed in silence.
In the morning, Ella found the other side of the bed already empty.

The door opened, and Sofia's kind voice called out, "You woke up late.Hurry and have breakfast. Before Arthur left, he reminded me to tell you to eat!"

On the dining table was a lavish breakfast spread.

Ella's eyes grew warm. In all their years together, she had never been treated like this.

"See, how thoughtful!" Sofia said, pulling Ella to sit down. "You need to hurry and have a baby!" "Okay," Ella mumbled, her mind buzzing, mechanically shoveling breakfast into her mouth. Sofia didn't notice anything unusual, continuing to praise Arthur like a broken record. making Ella's head ache. Ella quickly finished breakfast. "Grandma. I'm going to work! If you leave the house, make sure to bring your phone." Leaving that sentence, Ella fled in a hurry.


"You need to hurry and have a baby!"

Even through the door, Sofia's voice was still clearly heard.

###Chapter 21

At Worry-Free Studio, Ella spotted the official announcement for the live TV show they were about to join, "Exquisite Beauty Live."
In no time, Twitter was flooded with fan comments.

[So many gorgeous and cool ladies!]

[Exquisite Beauty Live is here, let's all get fabulous together,go go go!]

[Who's Ms. Worry-Free? Is she a sponsor? I don't know her, but I love Ava!]

Ella couldn't help but smile at the comments.

The Worry-Free Studio was all about high-end, custom services.

They had a solid spot in the fashion world, but their fame was still kinda niche.

Joining Exquisite Beauty Live was their shot at more exposure and getting noticed.


Ella kept scrolling through the comments but didn't see any mention of Ms.Worry-Free.

On the other hand, Ava, the internet celeb, was getting all the love.

Fans were all over her, tagging her on Twitter and everything. "What are you looking at?" Lily walked over and, with just one glance,her face turned red with anger. "This is too much. How is it that this chick is everywhere!" "Just wait, during the live broadcast, I'll make her pay!" Lily rolled up her sleeves. ready to throw down. "She must've known we were gonna be on the show, so she joined too!"
"Forget her, she doesn't matter."

Ella was way calmer than Lily. "Let's focus on the upcomning competition!"

Some big-name designers were attending this competition, and even though she was confident, she knew she couldn't get cocky.
"You're right!"

Lily grabbed the computer. "Let's see what these clueless fans are saying.No taste! Can't believe they like a two-faced person!"

She grumbled while scrolling through the comments, getting more pissed off by the second.

Suddenly,she stopped, "Damn it, you two are still not divorced. How dare that bitch show off with him? Look at this."

Lily turned the computer screen, and a photo came into view.

The photo was clearly taken secretly by Ava, with Arthur in the background.

His side profile was captivating: a high nose bridge, a firm jawline, and deep-set eyes. In the sunlight, Arthur looked focused, slightly frowning, as if in thought.Ava was holding a phone in one hand, resting her chin on the other.winking playfully.They looked like a sweet couple in the photo.

Ella looked up and smiled bitterly. "It'snone of my business!"

"Can't you have some competitive spirit!" Lily said indignantly,knocking on Ella's head. "You're still not divorced, that's your husband!"
"Soon he won't be!"

Ella closed Twitter and went back to drawing. "The photo looks like it was taken secretly, but think about it, if Arthur didn't want it, who would dare to take it! And look closely, which account posted the photo!"
Looking closely, Lily got even angrier. "How bold, actually..."

The photo only showed Arthur's side profile.

Strangers wouldn't recognize hisidentity.

But the photo was posted by his official account.

As the president of the Smith Group, Arthur's Twitter only posted company-related content, but now...

She scrolled through the comments on his account.

[Who stole my husband! Turns out it's my idol. You're forgiven!]

[They're a perfect match!]

[I believe in love again! Wishing you both endless happiness.]Ava and Arthur, being natural attention magnets, quickly shot to the top of the trending searches. Their photo together was going viral online. Lily was about to smash the computer in frustration. "These stupid fans and their stupid comments!"

"Work hard and make money, then we can choose any man we want!"

"Yeah,you're right!"

They quickly got back to work.

After the Exquisite Beauty Live announcement, Ms. Worry-Free's old customers started calling in to place orders.

They wanted to stock up on designs before Ms. Worry-Free became famous,hoping to profit later.
Ella was pleased and got busy with Worry-Free Studio's clients.

Meanwhile, at the Smith Group.

Arthur was staring at the content on the official account, tapping his fingers on the table. Each tap felt like a hammer to his assistant's heart.

The assistant was so scared he barely dared to breathe. "Mr. Smith..."

"Talk."

Arthur's voice was cold as ice.

The assistant shivered. "This has nothing to do with me! I don't know anything about it!"

"What is the PR department doing? Go and..." Before Arthur could finish, his phone rang. He glanced at it and answered, "What's up?" 
"Arthur, I'm sorry!"

Ava's weak voice came through,choked with sobs.

Arthur frowned. "What's the matter?"

"Today Exquisite Beauty Live announced, the show asked me to post on Twitter, so I handed it over to Donny..."

Halfway through, Ava started crying uncontrollably.

The call ended.

Arthur frowned, sensing something was off. "Forget it."

He grabbed his suit and turned to leave.

He drove at top speed, pedal to the metal.

Ten minutes later, Arthur arrived at Ava's door, about to knock when he heard arguing inside.

"What do you want? I have no backing, and you despise me, but you can't post a picture of Arthur and me on his account! Now the netizens misunderstand, what should I do!"

"Don't worry, it's just hype! And Mr. Smith is getting divorced!"

"You're my agent, you should discuss things with me. You're my savior,I m grateful, but you can't make decisions on your own! I'll clarify on Twitter right now, I can't let anyone misunderstand..." "Stop, if you do that, it's over!" The agent was very emotional. "Do you know that many guests on this show have connections? You don't have any backing and will be bullied!" The knocking sounded.

Ava opened the door.

Seeing her swollen eyes, Arthur sighed.

"Sorry, I didn't mean to, I'll clarify right now!"

Ava cried,grabbing the computer.

Donny firmly blocked the computer. "No!"

"Forget it!"

Arthur's voice was firm. "This matter ends here! Go to the live broadcast with peace of mind, with me here, no one will bully you!"

After speaking, he turned and left.

Donny raised an eyebrow proudly. "Ava, impressive,didn't expect you to handle men so well!"

"This is nothing!"

Ava sat down, crossing her legs. "In ten minutes, there will be more good news!"


"What?" Donny looked puzzled.

"Let's wait! Arthur won't let me suffer any grievances!" Five minutes later, a trending topic appeared out of nowhere.#Smith Group President Spends Two Hundred Million Dollars for Love [I love it, when will God give me such a man!] [Domineering president falls in love with the actress,so sweet!]

[Oh my. I also want to spend a fortune like the president,but I can only buy my girlfriend a burger!]
###Chapter 22

"Scumbag and bitch!" Lily yelled, fuming.

She stood up,rubbing her chest. "Ugh. I'm so mad my chest hurts! I need to blow off some steam!"


Ella glanced over and chuckled. "Come on, it's not a big deal! The show's about to start recording any minute now. But we don't have anyone to look after grandma."

"That's easy,we'll just hire a maid!"

"You're right!" Ella's eyes lit up. "Do you know anyone good?"

"Totally! There's a maid in my building who's looking for work.f'll introduce you!"

"Great, let's get on it."

Finding a good maid wasn't always easy.

Ella didn't waste any time and sent someone to bring the maid over.

Sofia eyed the maid with disapproval. "I can handle the housework myself.
Why'd you hire her?"

"Grandma, I have to go on a business trip and won't be back for a while.I hire her to take care of you so I can have peace of mind!"

"What about Arthur?"

"He's swamped with work too!"

"You should be taking better care of your husband!" Sofia scolded."Call Arthur and see if he's coming home for dinner!"

"Grandma, he's usually super busy and doesn't like being disturbed."

"So what? You should care more about him. Hurry up and call him."

Reluctantly, Ella called Arthur, but there was no answer.

Ella shrugged. "See? Can't reach him. He must be on a business trip."

"Then call his assistant!"

Sofia was so insistent that Ella had no choice but to comply.

But both calls went unanswered.

"They're probably on a plane, I can't reach them!"

"Alright then!" Sofia held Ella's hand. "For a marriage to last,you both need to care for each other."


Sofia launched into another round of loving advice.

Ella yawned repeatedly,barely listening.

Sofia pinched her in frustration. "Go to bed! Work hard, don't worry about me!"


Finally relieved, Ella escaped to her room.

The empty room made her feel strangely lonely.

Habit was a terrible thing; even though Arthur didn't come home often.today she felt especially alone.

With a maid at home, Ella could focus on her work without worry. Several dlays passed without any word from Arthur.

Ella didn't bother asking, knowing they were about to get divorced.

Time flew by, and soon Ella got news from the show crew.

The live broadcast was about to start.

Ella and Lily packed their bags and got into the show's car.

As soon as they got in, two camera operators pointed their lenses at them.

"Are you Ms. Worry-Free?" The director looked at Ella, who was bundled up tightly,with wide eyes.


About to go live, everyone was trying to get more exposure, while Ella was all covered up.

Ella nodded and lowered her voice. "Hi, I'm Ms. Worry-Free; happy to be on the show!"


Knowing Ella wasn't great in these situations, Lily stepped in. "Hi, Ms.Worry-Free isn't very talkative and has social anxiety. You can discuss things with me directly!"

"Got it!"

The director sighed in relief. "Will Ms. Worry-Free always be like this?"

Lily nodded. "Yep, like I said, she's introverted!"

An introverted person on a live show.

The director's mouth twitched, "Alright, let's start with a simple interview!
These will be in the promo!"
"Okay! Just ask away, and make sure I look good!"

Ella wanted to keep her identity under wraps, so she was bundled up from head to toe-hat, sunglasses, mask, the whole nine yards.

The chance to show off Worry-Free Studio's clothing went to Lily.

She was decked out in a suit, a sun hat with embroidered roses,pearl jewelry, and high heels with pearls, looking every bit the modern lady.

The director nodded and signaled the cameraman to step back a bit.

Lily appeared on camera, flicking her hair charmingly. "Hey everyone, I'm thrilled to be on this show. I'm Ms. Worry-Free's assistant. She's introverted, and I'm the extrovert, so feel free to talk to me. We'd love to hear your feedback."


In front of the camera, Lily was poised and eye-catching.

The director was pleased. "Great job, you were born for the camera! Ever thought about acting? You've got the looks!"

"Not really, but thanks!" Lily blushed, grabbing Ella's hand. "To be honest,Ella...ouch!"


Lily's arm got pinched.

She quickly corrected herself. "I mean, my good friend is even prettier!"

The director didn't mind the little slip and continued with a few more questions.

The car soon arrived at the filming location.

The estate was stunning, with beautiful and captivating scenery all around.After getting out of the car, Ella and Lily saw the open space was already buzzing with people.

Besides the staff, there were other guests for the show.

Ella looked around excitedly. "Oh my God, my idol is here! What do I do?
I'm so excited!"


"Then go meet them!"

Lily, ever the social butterfly, started dragging Ella towards them.

Ella pulled her back. "Not now, let's wait until the show's over! It's not the right time."

Lily looked at her outfit and nodded. "You're right, let's just hang back for now."


They were about to greet everyone when they saw the crowd moving in another direction.


A luxury car had just pulled up.

Ava, dressed in a sporty and youthful outfit,stepped out.

Her smile was as bright as the sun as she waved to everyone. "Hey everyone, I'm Ava, nice to meet you all! I'm new here, so please take care of me!"

"Ms. Davis, you're too kind! We've been looking forward to meeting you!None of us are as famous as you! And you're even prettier in person!"

"Hi, I'm a designer, Cecilia Thorne! I hope we get a chance to collaborate!"


Everyone gathered around Ava,greeting her warmly. Ava was full of enthusiasm. "Hey everyone, I'm here to take on new challenges; I hope to work with all of you!"

After the greetings,everyone returned to the open space.

Seeing Ava as the center of attention. Lily pouted. "Such a show-off!" She didn't lower her voice.


Ava heard it and bit her lip lightly. "Did I offend you? Why the harsh words? We still have to work together!"

"Who wants to work with you!" Lily shot back. "We dislike fools, so stay away from us! Ms. Worry-Free, let's go, let's not ruin our mood!"

She grabbed Ella's hand and headed towards the villa.

Ava looked pitiful, her eyes filled with confusion as she looked at everyone.
"It's just a small misunderstanding; I didn't expect them to..."
###Chapter 23

"Alright, it's clear they're not good people. Ms. Worry-Free is always covered up. never showing her real face. I bet she's too ugly!" Cecilia,with her big name in the fashion world, didn't hold back her thoughts.

Cecilia's assistant, Magnolia Belle, jumped in, "Yeah, I have a friend at Worry-Free Studio! She said Ms. Worry-Free has a big round face full of freckles, a flat nose,and tiny eyes."

"Really?" Ava gasped in surprise.

Cecilia smiled and held her hand. "Don't worry; Ms. Worry-Free is just scared of scaring people, so she covers up."

Ella had just sat down when she sneezed.

Lily handed her a tissue. "Look, they're still together, probably talking trash about us!"

"Who cares! I just didn't expect my idol to be such a suck-up." Ella took off her mask, looking a bit let down.

Cecilia was a top-notch fashion designer; she had always been Ella's role model.

But just now, Cecilia was being overly nice to Ava, which made Ella feel sad instantly.

Lily spoke sympathetically, "Alright, since we're here, don't let it bother you. Let's hurry and pack our stuff!" The Smith Group.
Arthur had just sat down and asked coldly, "How's the contact with Ms.Worry-Free going?"


"Mr. Smith. Ms. Worry-Free went to participate in a competition!"

The assistant said, placing the computer in front of Arthur.


Arthur glanced at it and then looked away. "Increase the sponsorship and have Ava collaborate with Ms. Worry-Free!"

"Okay!"

The assistant turned to leave.

Arthur spoke again, "How is she doing lately?"

The assistant hesitated. "According to your instructions,we've been sending things to Ms. Moore these past few days. I heard Mrs. Smith went on a business trip!"

"A regular staff member, why go on a business trip?" Arthur felt a surge of irritation. "Forget it, let it be!"

The assistant walked out and closed the door.

Arthur stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, looking at the lights below.He took out his phone, thought for a moment, and then tossed it aside."Ella is so heartless, she hasn't called me at all!"

Ella sneezed again and her laptop nearly slipped fromher hands."How many people are talking about me!"

"No, maybe someone is cursing you!" Lily teased from the side, "Should we go out and get familiar with the environment?" Since they returned to the room, they hadn't gone out, not deliberately avoiding anyone, just too busy.


Ella thought for a moment and nodded. "We'll be living here for a while,so it's good to get familiar with the place!"

"Alright!"


They quickly tidied up and left the room.

The estate was luxuriously decorated, with exquisite details everywhere.

The hallway was filled with famous paintings, and even the carpets were imported.

With just a casual glance, the place was saturated with an air of artistry.

Ella was dazzled,admiring the surrounding artworks.

They soon reached the first floor and were about to walk out the door when they heard laughter not far away.

They originally wanted to leave directly, but when they heard Arthur's name, Ella couldn't help but stop.

"Ms. Davis, you're so enviable. Mr. Smith increased the sponsorship just to have you collaborate with Ms. Worry-Free!"

"Really envious! But are you sure you want to work with that ugly woman?"


Those women chattered non-stop.

They praised Ava while belittling Ms. Worry-Free.Lily,hearing their increasingly nasty comments, rolled up her sleeves,ready to charge over.

Ella shook her head. "Let it go!"

"How can you just let it go? You two aren't even divorced yet, and he's openly using your marital assets to support a mistress! And he's even making you work with her!"

"Alright! I don't care, so why are you so mad?"

"I'm just disappointed in you!" Lily glared at them. "These people look down on you! They even call you ugly. Tomorrow, dress up and blow their minds!"

"Forget it! We'll prove ourselves with our skills! My looks are the least of my talents!" Ella proudly raised her chin. "As for who to work with,it doesn't matter, as long as we achieve our goal!"

Under the moonlight,without her sunglasses, her eyes sparkled like stars,very captivating.

Lily grabbed her arm. "Okay, let's make them wait and see!"

After the interruption, they lost interest in thescenery and went back to their room.

Morning arrived with a commotion downstairs, waking everyone from their sleep.

"Welcome, all our esteemed guests! It's breakfast time, please come downstairs quickly!"

The broadcast echoed far. Lily grumbled and covered her head with the blanket to continue sleeping.

Ella was also still groggy.

The broadcast sounded again.

Ella widened her eyes and sat up. "Hurry up, or we'll miss breakfast and be hungry all morning!"

"No chance!" Lily jumped out of bed. "Quickly, we have to fight for breakfast!"


They quickly washed up and rushed downstairs.

The production team was very considerate.

Last night, they asked everyone about their favorite breakfast.

As soon as they sat down, their favorite breakfast was placed in front of them.

Others also came down one after another, greeting each other warmly,but they all selectively ignored Ella and Lily.

Ella and Lily didn't mind,focusing on their breakfast.

They didn't want to cause trouble, but someone wouldn't let them off.

"Ms. Worry-Free, why are you always so covered up? Let me see!" It was Cecilia speaking,unafraid of anything.

Lily rolled her eyes. "Why don't you take off your clothes and let us see!"

"How dare you speak like that!" Magnolia was furious and immediately stood up. Ella looked up, observing everyone opposite her.

It was her first time carefully looking at all the participants.

Besides her, the designers included Andy Warhol and Cecilia.

Cecilia had been in the industry for years and held a significant position in the fashion world. Her assistant beside her, Magnolia, was somewhat famous, having designed clothes for many celebrities.

Andy was a rising star, having participated in international fashion weeks and won many design awards. Her assistant, Jessa Greer, had just returned from studying abroad and was also a person with a background.

Among celebrities and influencers of this show, besides Ava, there were Blair Ember and Brynn Elise, all with significant backgrounds,though not as powerful as Arthur's.

These were all things Ella had investigated before the show.

Ella adjusted her sunglasses and stood up. "We're all here to compete; let's respect each other. Of course, if we can't get along peacefully, we're not pushovers!"

To prove her point, Ella placed a fork on the table and bent it with force.

Seeing the bent fork, the people opposite her quickly sat down and focused on their breakfast.

Lily happily gavea thumbs up."Good job, acting tough suits you!"
###Chapter 24

"Ms. Worry-Free! I've always loved your designs. Let's try to get along from now on. But seriously, you are out of line!"

Everyone was too scared to say anything.

Ava stood up, clearly annoyed, and said, "Hey, we're all friends here,right?"


"Friends?" Ella scoffed, "You really think so? Who was it that called me ugly yesterday?"

Lily chimed in, "The pot calling the kettle black, huh?We're..."

She dragged out the last word, scoffing, "We're not the same,so keep your distance and just be polite!"

Ella said, "Let's go! We have better things to do!"

After eating. Ella didn't want to waste time on these people. She hooked her arm around Lily's and left.

Watching them walk away, Ava bit her lip. "Did they hear what we said yesterday?"

"So what if they did? We were just being honest!" Jessa pouted, "She's just too ugly, that's why she covers up so much!"

She raised her voice at the end.

Lily,who had walked a bit away, suddenly stopped and looked back.


Their eyes met. Even with sunglasses on, Jessa felt a chill run down her spine.

Lily laughed, waving her fist playfully. "Bunch of cowards!"

Then she turned and left gracefully.

Back in the room, Lily noticed Ella was distracted and asked, "What's up?"

"Look at this!" Ella tossed her phone over. There was a photo on it.

In the photo, there were a bunch of handsome guys and beautiful women.

Arthur was holding a glass of red wine, with a beauty leaning into him,almost sticking to him.

And the other guys were all laughing and joking.

"Damn!" Lily cursed, "Arthur is such a jerk, but he's pretty hot!"

Ella rolled her eyes. "What are you even looking at?"

"Looking at the guys!" Lily wiped her mouth. "Arthur's a jerk, and so are his friends, but I have to admit, they're pretty handsome."

She said regretfully, "If these people had nothing to do with Arthur,I'd be all over them! But going to the bar so early in the morning, are they asking for trouble?"

"You never miss a chance to check out the hotties! As for being at the bar,it's none of our business!"

Ella casually agreed, then deleted the photo and got back to work.

The live broadcast hadn't started yet, so she wanted to draw more designs while she had time. It was all for the money. Half an hour later, the broadcast announcement sounded, and the director downstairs was calling everyone to gather.

Ella wrapped herself up tightly and ran down with Lily. Seeing that the live broadcast hadn't started yet, they relaxed a bit.

The estate's living room was large enough to accommodate dozens of people.

Lily and Ella were clearly being ostracized, but they didn't care. They sat apart from the others.

The director noticed this and a playful look flashed in his eyes.

As a director, he valued the show's effect, and these people not getting along fit perfectly into his vision.

Clearing his throat, he began to explain the competition rules and precautions.

Of course, before that, he had to thank the sponsors.

The biggest sponsor of this live broadcast was Arthur.

Hearing his name, Ella's body trembled slightly.

Opposite her, Ava looked smug, enjoying the attention.

Lily muttered discontentedly, "A mistress dares to show of! I really want to tear her apart!"

"ImpuIse is the devil!" Ella said,gripping Lily's hand tightly.

After the director finished explaining the rules, he dropped a bombshell."The winner of this competition gets to go to International Fashion Week! And also, a diamond necklace, the Queen's Eye!"

Everyone gasped.

The Queen's Eye was the most valuable item at the auction last year,worth a staggering one hundred million dollars.


When the director mentioned that the diamond necklace was sponsored by Arthur, everyone looked at Ava with envy.

"Ms. Davis is so lucky to have such a boyfriend!"

"This is the Queen's Eye! Mr. Smith is so good to you! I'm so envious!"

The guests on the show were all rich, but a billion-dollar diamond was hard to resist.

Ava smiled outwardly, but inside she felt down. How nice it would be if the necklace was given directly to her. The thought of it ending up with someone else made her heart ache.

The room was buzzing with excitement.

No one noticed that Ella's eyes were moist.

She lowered her head, wiping her tears with her mask.

Lily held her hand, heartbroken. "You should have fought him for the property! Look how arrogant his mistress is!"

"It's my own fault for not working hard, it has nothing to do with others!"


Ella spoke again, much more composed.

According to the rules, the next step should be drawing lots. Unexpectedly, the director directly announced the group list.

Ella frowned. "Weren't we supposed to draw lots?"

"Yeah! How can you change the rules like this?" Lily expressed her dissatisfaction.

"This time, the group list was chosen by the audience!" The director didn't waste time, directly posting the list on the bulletin board.

With just one look at the list, Lily was extremely angry and stood up. "We don't want to be with...!"

Halfway through her sentence, her mouth was covered by Ella.

Ella leaned into her ear. "Keep a low profile!"

Lily rolled her eyes and nodded. "You really have no backbone!"

She tapped Ella's head, disappointed.

The audience-chosen groups were as follows: Ella and Ava, Andy and Blair,Cecilia and Brynn.

Each assistant wwas responsible for helping.

With the groups set, everyone started chatting with their partners,bonding and exchanging ideas.

The atmosphere was lively.Ava looked around and took the initiative to come over. "Ms. Worry-Free,hello, I hope we have a pleasant cooperation!"She extended her hand. Ella looked awkward, really not wanting to engage. She raised her hand slightly and then withdrew it.

Lily's disdain was obvious as she turned her face away.

Ava's expression stiffened slightly, but she maintained a proper smile. "The live broadcast officially starts tomorrow. Let me share my thoughts first, I prefer the socialite style..."

Lily couldn't help but gag and interrupt her, "Shut up, don't disgust us!Seriously? Do you really think you look like a socialite?"

She looked Ava up and down. "I think you would look good in shabby-chic clothes.!"

"How can you insult me like this?" Ava's big eyes filled with tears instantly.

The director's team noticed their commotion.

Lily had strong backing.

They rushed over immediately, looking at Ella disdainfully.

"Ms. Davis is a special guest! We don't allow workplace bullying here."


"I..."

Lily wanted to speak, but Ella pulled her arm. "Sorry, we were just discussing!"

Ava nodded. "Yes, we were just sharing our ideas!"
###Chapter 25

To make things smoother, the director set up a meeting room for each group.

Inside the meeting room...

Ella and Lily sat quietly, watching Ava show off.

Ava blushed, talking to herself as she poured out her heart.

"Ms. Worry-Free, I joined this show just for you. I'm getting married soon and I really hope you can design my wedding dress!"

She bit her lip, her face turning as red as a tomato.

Lily could barely hold it in, fighting the urge to kick her.

Ella's fingers dug into her palm as she calmly said, "Sure, as long as the price is right! We can work something out!"

"Really?" Ava's face lit up. "That's awesome! My fiancé and I have been through so much to be together."

Ava's soft voice kept echoing in their ears.

It was a really sweet love story.

For some reason, Ella didn't cut her off, nor did she stop Lily from doing SO. She just listened quietly, almost like she was punishing herself. After a while, Ava stopped, her mouth dry. "Sorry, I talked too much!" Lily nodded. "Yeah, you did! It's better to keep it low-key!"

"Just kidding! Let's get back to work!"

Switching gears, Ella got all professional.

Ava, who grew up with money, had her own take on fashion.

The three of them started bouncing ideas off each other with passion!

Ella was busy and loving it.

Meanwhile, over at Fiery Night Bar...

The music was blasting.

In a private room on the top floor, guys were surrounded by women,their hands all over them, the whole place reeking of decadence.

In the corner, Arthur, dressed in a custom suit, was swirling a glass of red wine. occasionally checking his phone.

As time went by, his mood got darker, and no one dared to get close to him.

In this lively room, he seemed totally cut off from everyone else.

Playing truth or dare, he lost, and a friend grabbed his phone andI sent a message to Ella.

He thought she'd text back soon, asking what was up.

But two hours went by with nothing.

Arthur's grip on the wine glass tightened, his face darkening.
A drunken Alan stumbled over. "So, did she reply?"

Arthur shot him a cold look. "She's probably still asleep!"

"No way! It's already eight o'clock!" Alan laughed. "Ella's on a business trip, maybe she's having some fun?"

"Shut up!"

Arthur got up and left the room.

He found a quiet spot and pulled out his phone. "Find out where she is!"

After hanging up, he was about to head back to the room.

Just then, Alan staggered over. "Let's go check out Ava's set! We can be judges!"

The smell of booze was strong.

Arthur frowned. "You, a judge?"

"Yeah!" Alan hiccupped.

Arthur took a few steps back, and Alan laughed. "I have great fashion sense! Plus, we're sponsors! Going to the set can boost the show's popularity!"

"No...”

Just as he was about to refuse. Arthur changed his mind. "Alright! I'll go with you!"

He was determined to see if, oonce the rumors about him and Ava hit the top of the trending topics again, Ella could still stay calm.They left right away.

Alan dragged Arthur into the car and they headed straight to the set,with Alan rambling the whole way.

An hour later, they arrived at the estate.

As soon as they stepped out of the car, the production team greeted them warmly.

Arthur stayed cool. just giving a slight nod, while Alan was all smiles,chatting it up with the director.

With the sponsors there, the director decided to throw a welcome party so everyone could mingle.

Arthur, who usually hated these social events, was about to decline when he saw Ava running over like an excited kid.

"Arthur!"

"Slow down!"

Seeing her rush over, Arthur quickly spoke.

"No way!" Ava playfully tugged at Arthur's sleeve. "Did you come to see me? I'm so happy!"

"How old are you to still be acting like a kid!"

Arthur patted her head. "Are you having fun?"

"Yes!" Ava laughed heartily. "Do you know who I'm working with?"

She playfully blinked; her lively eyes were charming and cute.
Arthur smiled. "Doesn't matter who you're working with,as long as you're happy!"

Ella came downstairs and heard this.

She lowered her head, adjusting her hat, mask, and sunglasses, making sure she wouldn't be recognized, and quietly approached the crowd,trying to blend in.


Lily grumbled, "Scumbag and bitch should stay together! Trash belongs in the trash can, not out here causing trouble!"

Ella's anger faded completely.

She couldn't help but laugh. "I never knew you had such a sharp tongue!"

"I've never seen such disgusting people!" Lily said, mnaking a gagging motion. "But I don't get it, why shouldn't we hide? And even come out and celebrate with everyone! If we don't see them, we won't be bothered."

"That's not a good idea. It's too attention-grabbing!" Ella patiently explained.

With the sponsors here, everyone came down to greet and network.

If the two of them stood out too much, it would attract attention.

To avoid revealing their identities, they had to endure the disgust and watch Arthur flirt with Ava.

Lily felt sorry for Ella."Poor Ella!"

The two whispered in the crowd, their voices low, but their behavior stood out,attracting attention.
Arthur, looking at Ava's smiling face, heard the whispers and looked over the crowd at the heavily disguised figure in the hat, sunglasses, and mask. Even though he couldn't see her face, she seemed very familiar, and he unconsciously moved in that direction.

Ava followed his gaze and, dissatisfied, grabbed his arm. "Where are you going?"

"Nowhere!"

Realizing his actions, Arthur retracted his steps. "Didn't you want a wedding dress designed? Did you talk to Ms. Worry-Free? I'll handle the money!"

"Of course I did!"

Ava happily waved her hands. "I want to wear the most beautiful wedding dress.and then..."

The two flirted openly, attracting envious glances from those around them.


Ella lowered her head, struggling to endure.

Fortunately, she had already decided to divorce Arthur,otherwise,she would have been infuriated bythis scumbag and bitch.

She was determined to take on the wedding dress design job; no one could take that money from her.

"What are you thinking?"

Lily's voice suddenly brought Ella back to reality."What's wrong?"


In her daze, she had revealed her real voice. She looked up in a panic, seeing Arthur's calm expression, not suspecting anything, she breathed a sigh of relief.

Lily quickly blinked. "Our biggest sponsor wants to thank you for designing a wedding dress for his beloved woman? And he will even pay the deposit!"

Her tone was full of sarcasm.
###Chapter 26

In business, there was no reason to turn down money when it comes your way.

Ella pushed through the crowd and walked up to Arthur. "How much of a deposit can you give?"

"Here you go!"

Arthur handed over a check without a second thought.

Ella glanced at it. That was a lot of money! He was really generous when it came to making a wedding dress for his lover.

Ella gritted her teeth. "Thanks! Don't worry, I'll design a.wedding dress that both of you will love!"

Her voice, unexpectedly low, had a hinit of anger.

Arthur frowned, recalling the recent "What's wrong?" sound.

A playful glint flashed in his eyes."I wonder what ideas you have? Care to share them first?"

'Damn, what's there to say?

Ella suppressed her anger. "We need to discuss it in detail! Let's talk first!"She deliberately lowered her voice.

Arthur smirked. "Ms. Worry-Free, you're quite famous in the industry.Why are you dressed like this?"

"Because I like it!"

Ella,hiding behind her sunglasses, rolled her eyes without hesitation.


"Unique!"

Arthur took a step forward, closing the distance between them.

The sudden movement startled Ella, and she instinctively stepped back.

But as soon as she moved. Arthur grabbed her waist. "Is it you?"


"No.you've got the wrong person!"

Even through her clothing,she could still feel the heat of his hand.

In a panic. Ella forgot to disguise her voice. After speaking,she realized it was a mistake.

Everything happened too quickly.

Ava came to her senses and pulled Arthur's arm. "What are you doing?"

"Yeah! What are you doing? Don't touch her. You are so impolite." Lily,like a cat with its fur standing on end, walked over and shielded Ella.

Arthur rubbed his fingers, recalling the touch. He raised an eyebrow. "It was an accident. I was worried Ms. Worry-Free might fall, so I helped her!"

"No need!"

Lily glanced at the check and pulled Ella back into the crowd.

Arthur's peripheral vision followed Ella closely. Seeing her hide behind someone, he looked away. "Director! There's a banquet tonight.right?"
"Yes! We're hosting a small banquet to welcome you and to pre-celebrate the rising popularity of our live broadcast!"

"Great!"

Arthur headed upstairs.

Alan, still drunk, greeted the celebrities with a smile and followed Arthur.

"Can't do anything about him. He has billions of dollars in business every day. but he insists on checking up on me!" Ava looked troubled.

Jessa,ever her loyal sycophant, chimed in, "That's a sweet trouble! Oh,
please, I really want to handle it for you!"

"We want it too!"

Everyone chimed in, surrounding Ava.

Ella felt a pang of bitterness, but looking at the check in her hand, she kissed it. "Let's go! We'll buy a house and a car when we get back!"

"Okay!" Lily gave a thumbs up. "I admire you!"


"Oh come on, stop teasing me!"

Ella said softly, "I've thought it through. Not making money is foolish!Make as much as I can from that scumbag Arthur!"

"Yes, let's go prepare for tonight's banquet!"

Although it was a small banquet, apart from celebrities, there were fashion designers.

It was inevitable to compete in beauty and talent.

Ella and Lily had long been prepared. Opening the suitcase, each outfit was unique, showcasing Worry-Free Studio's strength.


Considering Arthur was also going to the banquet, Lily was worried because Arthur knew Ella well-they had been pretty intimate. "What should we do? Are you going to disguise yourself again?"

"Of course not! He's just a scumbag! Not worth my effort!"

Ella took out a dress and held it up in front of the mirror. "How about this dress?"

"It's beautiful! You're simply a princess!"

Lily knelt on one knee and extended her right hand. "My dear, marry me."


The two burst into bell-like laughter.

At the door, Alan, with weak legs. walked while holding onto the wall.

Hearing the familiar laughter, he stopped and pressed his ear to the door.


This laughter sounded so familiar.

Unable to recall, he shook his head. "No, my head is dizzy. I need to go back to sleep!"

Muttering, he tried to head back to his room.

But after two steps, he stumbled and fell to the ground.

Ella heard the sound near the door and opened it only to see the scene before her.

A man had fallen to the ground, looking very disheveled.

Recalling their last meeting, she stepped forward and grabbed Alan's arm."If you can't handle much alcohol, just drink less! This time you tripped on

flat ground; next time, you might end up rolling down the stairs!"

"Ella?"

'Damn.'

The event was abrupt, and once again, she forgot to lower her voice. "No, I don't know you!"

"You are Ella! Did you get the photos?" Alan chuckled. "I sent the photos."


"You have the wrong person!"

Drunkards are the worst.'

Ella wanted to turn and leave, but Alan directly reached out and pulled off her mask. "Look, it's Ella. I'm drunk, not stupid...!"

Before he could finish, his mouth was tightly covered, and then Ella and Lily dragged him into the room.

They closed the door.

Ella approached mnenacingly. "Why do you talk so much?"

"Yes! A talkative drunk!" Lily put her hands on her hips.

The two looked down at Alan lying on the ground.

"You're not planning to kill me, are you?" Alan retreated repeatedly.

"What do you think?" Ella's lips curled into a sinister smile.


"Wait!"
Alan's face changed, and he quickly ran into the bathroom and started vomiting.

With the stench spreading. Ella and Lily looked disgusted.

After a while. Alan fet better. "I can't believe you all despise me!"

He staggered to his feet, accidentally hitting the shower switch.


Instantly,Alan was drenched.

"This water is so warm! No. I'm sleepy; I need to sleep!" Before he finished speaking, he fell asleep.

In the blink of an eye, he started snoring.

Lily and Ella looked at each other.

"Is he a pig? How can he sleep like this!" Lilywalked over and kicked him unceremoniously.

Alan slept like a log, not waking up at all.

"What should we do!" Lily, dissatisfied, kicked him again. "Such a troublemaker!"

"Alright, he didn't do it on purpose!" Ella thought for a moment. "Tll go check the way. If no one is around, we'll send him back!"

"Okay!"
They made a decision. Lily stayed in the room watching Alan, while Ella.fully covered, quietly headed to Alan's room.

She had a map on her phone and knew the location of Alan's room.

Her heart pounded as she walked cautiously. Just as she reached the floor,
--

she saw a door ajar.

Peeking through the crack. she saw Alan's suitcase lying on the ground.

She was delighted. "Perfect. I'll get him a change of clothes!"

Muttering, she pushed the door open and was stunned by the scene inside.
###Chapter 27

Arthur's ripped muscles came into view.

Ella instinctively wanted to bolt, but Arthur had a firm grip on her hand.


Next thing she knew, she was pulled into his strong embrace, his unique woody scent filling her nose. She stiffened, barely daring to breathe.

His arm tightened around her waist, like he was trying to fuse he into his body.

She trembled with fear, swallowing hard. Just as she was frantically thinking of how to escape, a deep, hoarse voice sounded above her head.

"You smell so familiar!"


Oh no.'

Ella was freaking out. Then he gripped her waist tighter, and with a spin,they both ended up in the bathroom.

As the door closed, Ella was completely stunned.

Arthur looked down at her in his arms, a smirk forming at the corner of his mouth. "Does this count as throwing yourself at me?"

He said, lifting Ella's chin.

Through her sunglasses, he could still imagine Ella's dazed expression.


His teasing voice had a hint of mockery.

Ella snapped back to reality and pushed hard against his chest. "What are you doing? Let go of me!"
--
"Let go of you? This is my room, you came here yourself!" Arthur took a step forward, pinning Ella against the wall.

His long leg pressed between her thighs.


"Nonsense, this is Alan's room! I came to..."

"Came to throw yourself at Alan?" Arthur's voice turned colder,cutting her off. He gazed intently at the tightly wrapped Ella. "Hat,sunglasses,mask,is your face unpresentable?"

His words made Ella's heart leap into her throat.

She lowered her voice, trying to stay calm. "Nonsense, I just don't want to cause trouble! Just trying to be low-key!"

"Really?"

Arthur doubted. He reached out his fingers, threading them through her hair. His thin lips brushed against her ear.

His hoarse voice was extremely provocative, and his actions made her body go soft.
If it weren't for her body leaning against the wall, Ella would have collapsed to the ground. She tried to push him away with all her strength.However, Arthur's body was like an immovable wall, completely unyielding.
She panted,"Let go of me, this is sexual harassment. If you continue,I'll call the police."
"Sure!" Arthur's voice was filled with pleasure. "I also want to see what you look like."

'What I look like is none of your business.'Ella endured the heat in her body. "Move aside, aren't you afraid Ava will see?"

"So what if she does?" Arthur was fearless, his warm hands wandering up from her waist.

His large hand grabbed her chest, making Ella tremble all over, unable to help but moan, "You..."

Enduring the desire overwhelming her body, tears welled up in her eyes.

A strong sense of humiliation surged in her heart, and she thought, 'So this is the real him. Despite loving Ava, he still messes around with other women.

How many women had his hands touched?

Tears fell uncontrollably, soaking her mask.

Arthur paused, then laughed angrily. "What, can'tbe touched?"


"Get lost! Scumbag!"
Thinking of the youth wasted on him, Ella pushed him aside with an unexpected surge of strength and dashed out immediately.
Arthur swayed slightly, looking at the open door, and sneered, "Your courage has grown!"
He was about to close the door and take a shower when he saw Ella, who had escaped, return and close the bathroom door.
After a moment of surprise, he looked at Ella mockingly. "Back to throw yourself at me again?"


"No!"

Ella spoke nervously, "Someone's coming, I need to hide."

Arthur sneered, grabbing her wrist and dragging her out. "You're not welcome in my room!"

"Let me go."

As Ella struggled, a familiar voice sounded outside.


"Arthur, are you in the bathroom?"

Ella held her breath, extremely nervous, her body pressed tightly against the door.

"Yeah! Do you need something?" Arthur replied nonchalantly.

"I brought you some food! I know you drank a lot last night, so I made some hangover soup! By the way, where's Alan? And why is this door broken? It won't close! How do these workers do their jobs!"

Ava's voice outside chattered on.

Ella kept gesturing for Arthur to go out.

But Arthur seemed not to notice, his arms crossed over his chest, leaning against the wall. "I don't need the hangover soup, I'm fine!"
"You'd better take it, your health is important!" Ava spoke gently,"Since your door is broken, how about resting in my room?"

"No need!"
As Arthur spoke, he pulled Ella into his arms, his large hands wandering


over her body, finally resting on her thigh.

Sensing his intention, Ella struggled hard, but her strength was limited.Her body was turned around, her hands pressed against the wall,her buttocks raised.


"You..." Ella struggled.

Arthur held her waist, lowering his voice. "I'll help you, and you help me!"

Ella knew he liked the rear-entry position. She wanted to refuse, but ultimately couldn't, thinking about Ava outside and the risk of her identity being exposed.

They had done it countless times, one more time didn't matter.

She gritted her teeth and agreed, secretly resolving to get a divorce.

His penis suddenly entered her body, making her tremble all over, and she couldn't help but moan.
As soon as the sound escaped, she covered her mouth with her hand, her heart pounding with tension.

The sneaky feeling seemed to excite Arthur.

His penis became even more vigorous, her waist tightly gripped, her vagina receiving thrust after thrust.
In the quiet bathroom, the sounds of sex were particularly noticeable. To avoid being discovered, Ella mustered her strength to turn on the faucet.
Arthur seemed to know her body well, his hands constantly kneading her chest.

Even though Ella bit her lip hard, not wanting to make any sound,her body was out of control, and she still let out a few moans.

Now she could only hope it would end soon.

Outside, Ava listened to the sounds inside, sensing something was wrong."When are you coming out?"

Her voice trembled slightly.

Her eyes were fixed on the bathroom door, as if trying to see what was happening inside.

Inside, Ella trembled all over.

Arthur seemed dissatisfied with her distraction, thrusting more intensely.

Ella's hands pressed tightly against the wall, tears welling up in her eyes,the intense shame completely overwhelming her.

She wanted to push Arthur away, but knew she couldn't.

After another round of thrusts, Arthur ejaculated, his body trembling.holding Ella tightly, his voice hoarse. "I'm just taking a shower to wash off the smell of alcohol! You can go now."

"But I..." Ava didn't want to leave.

"I'll come find you later!"
"This door is broken, I'll stay here to wait for you! What if a hooligan attacks you!"
Ava laughed coquettishly. "You're the biggest sponsor of our show, many people want to throw themselves at you!"
###Chapter 28
Ella heard Ava's flirty voice, and it made her blood boil. Here she was,Arthur's wife, stuck in the bathroom because of the mistress. What a great joke!

And to top it off, the shameless mistress outside had the nerve to call her a rogue.

Ella glanced at Arthur, who was casually washing up next to her, her face flushed with anger. "I helped you out, now you help me get rid of her!"

"You're really something else," Arthur whispered mockingly in her ear.

"Fair trade!" Ella's clothes were drenched, and she awkwardly turned her head away.
"Fair trade, indeed!" Arthur echoed, then called out to Ava, "I'm naked,you should leave!"

"You're so annoying!" Ava giggled and scampered off.

Ella shivered, her face twisted in sarcasm. They'd done the most intimate things, but now they were worried about being seen naked by each other?Seriously?

She opened the bathroom door. "Go check if she's really gone."

Arthur gave her a knowing look, then peeked into the hallway. "All clear,you can come out now."

"Thanks for today. But about Alan..."

"You're looking for Alan?" Arthur's face darkened instantly.

"I..." Ella stammered, unable to explain.

Clearing her throat, she said, "I'm not really open about sex. This ends here."

She turned to leave, but Arthur grabbed her arm. "It's not up to you.I know your scent. You'll be with me for the next few days!"

His tone was revolting.

Ella felt humiliated. "Don't push it!"

"I'm curious, what do you look like?"


"I am very ugly!" she snapped.

Arthur's lips curled in amusement. "But I like your body!"


"Bastard!" Ella cursed and bolted out of there.

Arthur savored the word. "Not bad."

He looked at the broken door and picked up his phone, but Alan didn't answer.Where the hell was he?
Arthur's face darkened as he gripped the phone. "He better stay away from Ella, or else..."
In the sprawling estate, every room looked the same. Ella was lost,soaking wet, and dripping water. If someone found her like this, it would definitely start some nasty rumors.
She didn't want any scandals before the divorce. Just as she was about to ask for directions, she turned and saw Ava.
"It's really you! You ugly woman, how dare you seduce Arthur," Ava spat.her face twisted with rage.

She lunged forward and grabbed Ella's arm, her eyes filled with venom."You bitch. let's see what you look like!"

Ella quickly grabbed Ava's hand. "I have nothing to do with Arthur!"

"Nothing to do with him? Then why were you in his room?" Ava sneered.

Ella couldn't believe it. She, Arthur's wife, was being accused of cheating with her own husband by his mistress.

She lost her patience and shoved Ava away. "Listen, there's nothing going on. Don't provoke me!"
"Bitch, stay away from Arthur. or I'll ruin your reputation and leave you with nothing!" Ava threatened.
Hearing Ava's angry voice behind her, Ella didn't stop. She felt like she had a lump of cotton in her chest, making her feel all kinds of uncomfortable.
She just wanted to get out of there, so she picked up the pace and eventually broke into a run.
She ran and ran, and by some miracle, she found her way back to her room.
"What happened to you?" Lily asked, looking at Ella, who was soaked and disheveled. "Didn't I ask you to find some clothes? How did you end up like this?"

"I..." "These marks on your body!" Lily pulled open Ella's clothes and saw the red marks on her chest, her eyes widening. "Which jerk did this to you? I'Il go get revenge right now!"

She rolled up her sleeves,ready to storm out.

Ella grabbed her wrist. "It's nothing, just mosquito bites!"

"I'm not a three-year-old. Spill it."

Ella bit her lip, too ashamed to speak. After all, she didn't want to admit she had sex with Arthur.


Lily's eyes lit up as she thought of something. "Did Arthur recognize you?"

Ella shook her head. "No!"

"Did you sleep with some handsome guy?" Lily gave her a thumbs up. "Nice, nice,you're finally making progress!"

She patted Ella's shoulder. "That's how a woman should be. Men can mess around, and so can women. Have sex with a few more guys, and you'Il see, different men have different charms!"

Ella awkwardly smiled and looked towards the bathroom. "How's Alan?”

"Don't mention it, he's like a pig!" Lily urged, "Whatever happened,change your clothes first. We still have a party to attend later."

"Okay!"

Just as Ella was about to change, there was a knock on the door.

Ella and Lily exchanged a glance.

Lily nervously spoke. "Could it be a handsome guy looking for you?"

"No way!" Ella rolled her eyes and then opened the door. "Why is it you?"

"Where's Alan?" Arthur's voice was cold.

He pushed the door open, his sharp eyes scanning the room. When he saw Alan in the bathroom, a mocking smile appeared on his lips.

"Are you trying to bribe the judges?"

"Don't talk nonsense!" Lily stepped forward, hands on her hips."We rely on our strength, not underhanded methods! You're here just in time to take him away. This guy got drunk and collapsed at our door, and we kindly took him in!"

"Kindly took him in!" Arthur spoke playfully. "And you two took him into the bathroom?"

"You're no better than him, get lost! Scumbags should be locked together!"

Lily got angrier as she spoke, walking into the bathroom and trying to drag Alan out.

But with limited strength, she couldn't move him, so she kicked him in frustration.

Arthur's mouth twitched, then he walked in, grabbed Alan's leg, and started to drag him out.

As a result, Alan's head hit the door frame, and it sounded painful.

Alan was in a deep sleep and didn't even wake up.

Ella's face wrinkled, hoping he wouldn't get a concussion and come after

them for compensation.

She wore sunglasses and a mask, making it hard to see her expression,but Arthur noticed her gaze was fixed on Alan.

As they passed each other, he stopped and looked at Ella coldly."Feeling sorry for him?"

His light words inexplicably made her shiver.

Ella,with a strong survival instinct, shook her head. "Not at all! Just worried he might get a concussion and we'd be responsible!"

"Really?" Arthur sneered and left, dragging Alan by the leg.

###Chapter 29

Lily quickly shut the door as soon as they stepped out.

Leaning against it. she let out a big sigh. "Finally, they're gone! I was about to lose it!"

"It's no big deal! Just a minor issue!"

Ella changed into a fresh outfit but felt like she was forgetting something."My brain's a mess. Think hard, did we forget something important?"

Lily suddenly slapped her forehead and screamed, "Oh no, Alan recognized you!"

Ella jumped up. "What do we do? I don't want anydrama before the divorce!"


"I've got an idea!"

Lily quickly grabbed her phone.

Ella's phone buzzed, and she laughed at the photo. "You're a genius!"


"Of course!"

Lily proudly patted her chest. "This is called being prepared. I was worried Alan might spill, so I took an embarrassing photo to keep him in check!"

"Perfect, I have Alan's number. I'll send a threatening message right now."

She quickly found his contact and sent the message.

Almost at the same time, Ella got another message from the director.

Tonight's welcome party had been changed to a pajama party.

Wearing pajamas might not go well with a hat, sunglasses, and a mask.

Ella was frustrated. "So many tricks! It's just a party. Why make such a fuss?"

"The live broadcast hasn't started yet, but some cameras will still follow us for promotional material! We have to make a big splash!" Lily excitedly started rummaging through the wardrobe.

Unfortunately, Lily didn't bring many pajamas, especially not ones with unique designs.

Ella was in the same boat.

She stood in front of the wardrobe, frowning. "Let's modify them! Get the tools,I'll do it myself!"

"Awesome! It's an honor to wear pajamas made by you!"


"Stop joking!"

Ella got busy preparing for the evening party.

Meanwhile, the other room felt like an icebox, as if it had been frozen.

Alan was sleeping like a log on the bed, snoring loudly,with several bumps on his head,completely unaware, just wrapped in a blanket.occasionally muttering about the cold.

Arthur sat on the sofa with his legs crossed, tightly gripping his phone.

[This is our secret. Don't say anything, or I'll post your photos online!!

Looking at the message and photo from Ella.

He gripped the phone even tighter.

'What kind of secret could there be between them? Only those who are close would take such embarrassing photos of each other, right?

His gaze turned cold as he stared at Alan on the bed.

In his sleep. Alan felt a chill all over and tightened the blanket around him.

There was a knock on the door.

Opening it. Arthur saw Ava with tear-streaked cheeks and frowned. "What's wrong?"

"Look at my hand!" Ava raised her red and swollen wrist,tears welling up in her eyes.

"What happened?"

Arthur looked concerned. "I'll take you to the hospital!"

"No need, it's just a small injury. I saw Ms. Worryfree lost on her way back and wanted to guide her, but then..."

Her voice trailed off.

Arthur paused. "Let's go to the hospital anyway!"

"No!" Ava said playfully, "I just want you to take me to the garden!"

Seeing him stay silent, Ava lowered her head, looking disappointed."I'm in a bad mood and want to see the flowers!"


"Alright!" Arthur agreed quickly.

Ava smiled through her tears, holding his arm. "I knew you were the best to me!"


They soon appeared in the garden, standing together like a picture-perfect scene.


Many people saw them and looked on with envy.

Ava thoroughly enjoyed being the center of attention.

She clung tightly to Arthur's armn and raised her voice deliberately, "Ms.Worry-Free agreed to design my wedding dress. Can she also make your suit?"


Arthur's lips curved into a smile, and he nodded lightly.

"I'm so envious of Ava. If I had such backing, I wouldn't have to work so hard!"

"Who wouldn't be? We fashion designers look glamorous, but the competition is fierce! I wish I could marry a rich man and live in luxury!"

"I just heard them talking about suits and wedding dresses. Are they getting married?"

Hearing the chatter outside, Ella's good mood vanished.

Ella paused, a look of sadness crossing her face.

Lily spat, "These people have no taste. Scumbag and bitch should be locked together, not harming others!"

"Ella, once your divorce is finalized, you'll find men who love you! Work hard and we'll date thirty men, one for each day!"

"Please, even i you had the money, could you handle it?"

Thinking of Arthur's stamina, Ella blinked. "Alright, the pajamas are ready.Try them on!"


"Okay!"

Lily dashed into the dressing room like a princess in her new pajamas.


Ella,exhausted,walked to the floor-to-ceiling window, intending to relieve her eyes by looking into the distance, only to see Arthur and Ava sitting in the garden, closely snuggled together.

What a scumbag. He was just entangled with me in the bathroom,and now he's with Ava in the garden.'


She withdrew her gaze and noticed she was crying.

"Useless!" She stubbornly wiped her tears.

Picking up her phone, she saw Alan hadn't replied, and her heart sank.

She dressed and left the room.

Ella wandered upstairs, realizing she forgot where Alan's room was.


A staff member passed by.

She asked, "Excuse me, where is Alan's room?"

"What do you want to do?"

The staff member looked at Ella with disdain. "We're hosting a fair fashion competition. Though you're well-known in the fashion industry,just focus on your work!"

Ella didn't understand at first.

But seeing the staff's expression, she sighed. "Alan and I are friends.We've known each other for a long time!"

"Really?"

The staff clearly didn't believe her. "Regardless, do your job!"

"I..."

"Don't think about taking shortcuts!" Thestaff left with a parting shot.

Ella stomped her foot in frustration and had to search on her own.

The estate was large enough to accommodate hundreds of people. After wandering for a while, Ella still couldn't find Alan's room. She angrily dialed his number.

"What? Want to throw yourself at me again?"###Chapter 30

Arthur's voice cut through the air, cold and mocking.

Ella shivered and snapped back, "What are you talking about? Where's
Alan? Why do you have his phone?"

"Really?" Arthur sneered.

Ella tried to keep her cool. "I need to talk to him.Which room is he in?"


"Fine! I'll show you the way!"

The call ended, and soon after, Ella got a location-sharing request.

She frowned at the map. Directions were never her strong suit, but she followed the blue dot on her screen, hoping it would lead her to Alan.

After a few wrong turns, she finally found the room.

Taking a deep breath, Ella knocked on the door.


It swung open.

Before she could react, her wrist was grabbed, and she was pulled into a firm chest.

Arthur's familiar woody scent filled her nose.

She looked up, eyes glistening. "Why are you here?"

"Who else did you expect?"

Arthur's voice was low as he held her waist tightly. "Meeting your lover?"

"Let go of me!" Ella pushed against his chest, trying to break free.

Arthur held her close like a vise.

Ella asked, "What do you want?"

"I want to see the real you."

He leaned in, his voice seductive.

Ella shivered, forgetting to struggle, and quickly adjusted her mask and sunglasses. "Don't do anything stupid."

"So what if I do? I love a thrill! The face doesn't matter as long as I feel excited."

With that, he grabbed the front of her shirt and yanked it open.

Her chest felt cold, and when she looked down, her shirt was torn,exposing her breasts.

She was mortified and furious, wishing she coud disappear.

Arthur didn't stop there; he grabbed her breast.

Caught off guard, Ella let out a soft gasp.

Her arms instinctively wrapped around his neck, just like before.

Arthur smirked. "Looks like you missed me too!"


"You..."

"Alright! I'll make you feel really good!"

Arthur lifted her and laid her on the bed. "Enjoy it!"

He kissed her neck, chest, and lower abdomen, his hands exploring her

body.

Ella's body went limp, unable to resist, letting him do as he pleased.


When she snapped back to reality, her clothes were gone,except for her mask and sunglasses. Her hat was long gone.

She stayed alert, holding onto her mask and sunglasses tightly.

Arthur noticed but didn't care, focused on her body.

Feeling her wetness, he removed his clothes, revealing his erection, and thrust inside her.


Ella's soft moans filled the room.

Arthur's throat tightened as he grabbed her waist,thrusting deeply.


Another moan escaped her líps.

Through the mask and sunglasses, her expression was hidden.


But her voice made it clear she was aroused.

He leaned closeto her ear and bit gently. "How does it feel? Good?"


"You!"

Ella bit her lip, refusing to speak.

Arthur smirked, pulling out, then teasing her entrance.

The sensation made Ella's mouth dry.

Her body moved on its own, legs wrapping around Arthur's waist as her desire took over.

Arthur chuckled, holding her waist with one hand and supporting her butt with the other, sliding back inside her.

The intense sensation made Ella cry out, her legs tightening around him.

"Still planning to meet Alan?" Arthur's voice was dark, almost sinister.


Ella shuddered, glaring at him through her sunglasses.

"Not behaving,huh?"

Arthur threw her onto the bed, teasing her entrance, driving her wild.


She was on the edge of climax.

If it weren't for keeping her identity a secret, she would've already cursed Arthur loudly. Ella lowered her voice, "Hurry up, or can't you do it?"

Hearing that. Arthur grabbed her, thrusting deep.

The sounds of their lovemaking echoed in the empty room.

Arthur's heavy breathing and Ella's moans mixed together.

At first, Ella tried to keep quiet, not wanting Arthur to hear.

But as the passion grew, she couldn't control herself, her mnoans driving Arthur to thrust even harder.

After what felt like forever, Arthur finally let go of her waist, leaning close to her ear, "Remember, come whenever I call!"

"You..."

Her passion faded, Ella gritted her teeth. "What do you take me for?"

Arthur looked at her angry eyes behind the sunglasses, a smirk on his lips."Guess what?"

Ella stubbornly got up and dressed. "Now can you tell me where Alan is?"

"Still planning to meet your lover?" Arthur stepped forward,caressing her face."Behave and go back! Or face the consequences!"

"Got it!" Ella reluctantly agreed.

Leaving the room, she looked at the empty hallway,feeling uneasy.

Feeling the soreness and pain in her body, she was furious. "What a jerk!"

How dare he have sex with a woman without even seeing her face! How many women has he done this with before?'

The more Ella thought about it, the angrier she got.

Fortunately, the divorce was imminent, and this thought brought her some comfort.

She got lost on the way back again.

With the help of a waiter, she finally returned to her room.

Lily saw her sneaky behavior and her face changed. "What happened, did Alan reveal your identity?"

Ella shook her head. "I didn't see him at all."

"What now? Alan doesn't seem like someone who can keep a secret!"

"Forget it! Let it be!"

If her identity was exposed, it wouId just be a bit more troublesome.

Ella decided to stop hiding, thinking about the pajama party she had to attend that night,frowning.

Lily grumbled, "You do whatever you think of, withouat any plan, but don't worry, no matter what happens,I'm here!"

"Thank you!"

As the time approached, Ella prepared to change clothes.

But thinking about the hickeys on her body, she quietly hid in a corner.

"Hahaha, are you shy now?" Lily teased.

Soon,the two of them were dressed in their modified pajamas, standing in front of the mirror.

"Wow, Ella, you're so hot!" Lily playfully winked, then flirtatiously flipped her hair. "In the next life, let me be a man, and we can be a pair!"
###Chapter 31

"Alright. I'll go along with you!"

"Great, it's a deal then!"

They laughed and chatted as they made their way to the lobby on thefirst floor.


Money made the mare go.

Since the party was in honor of Arthur and Alan, everyone showed up early.Sure, it was a pajama party, but did it have to be this over the top?

Everyone's pajamas were sexy and charming, super alluring, and their makeup was on point.

Lily couldn't help but smirk. "We're still such rookies!"

She had some light makeup on, but Ella was still rocking a hat, sunglasses,and a big mask.

As soon as they walked in, they drew a lot of attention.

Why? Because Ella was still all covered up.

"Ms. Mysterious, this is a party! Isn't it a bit rude to dress like that?" Ava frowned,but her tone was gentle.

Cecilía sneered from the side, "She's just trying to stand out by being different! Just ignore her."

"You're the one always trying to stand out. Don't talk nonsense." Lily shot back, hands on her hips, defending Ella.
"Alright, let's just sit down and grab some food first!"

Ella thought they were here for their careers, not to bicker.


She never cared for such petty stuff.

The party had a ton of fancy food and drinks.

They picked out some of their favorites and settled on the sofa.


A lot of eyes were on them.

Their conservative outfits weren't much to look at, but when they moved,the golden threads on their clothes sparkled, catching everyone's attention.

Seeing all the stares, Lily chuckled, "Awesome, we're making waves. Maybe we should try a pajama line!"

Ella shook her head. "Let's stick to perfecting our dresses and wedding gowns!"

They whispered to each other.

Just then, someone in the crowd shouted, "Our sponsors are here!"


They turned to look.

Arthur, in blacksilk pajamas, with a serious face, walked in surrounded by people.

Behind him was Alan, in striped pajamas, looking laid-back.

Together, Arthur looked like a noble gentleman, while Alan looked like a carefree playboy, a total contrast.

As soon as they showed up, they became the center of attention.

When Ella saw Arthur's pajamas, her eyes widened a bit.

'Oh no. His pajamas look a lot like mine.'

Ella started to sweat, it was too late to go back and change.

Lily noticed too. "It's fine, pajamas all look similar, and we've tweaked ours!"


"You're right!"

Ella said, but she instinctively moved closer to Lily.

Everyone's eyes were on Arthur and Alan, and no one noticed that Arthur and Ella's pajamas looked like they were matching, except for Ava.

Whether it was Ms. Mysterious or Arthur, they were her main focus.


She noticed their similar styles.

But Ella's pajamas had been modified, with a drawstring at the waist to raise the waistline, and lace at the cuffs to add some femininity.

Feeling Ava's gaze, Ella felt frustrated.

Why did she, as Arthur's lawfully wedded wife, have to hide from a mistress and endure her scrutiny?

After some greetings, everyone took their seats.

Coincidentally, Arthur and Alan sat right across from Ella and Lily.


They could see each other with just a glance.

Ella,hiding behind her sunglasses, rolled her eyes without a care.
"Alright, the party officially starts now! And we have decided to start the live broadcast from now!"

"Oh my god, the live broadcast starts now?"

"Isn't it a bit impolite to the audience that we're in pajamas?"

"Even though we're designers, the pajamas we're wearing are just off the rack. If we knew it was a live broadcast, we would've made something ourselves!"


Hearing the director's announcement, everyone voiced their complaints.

Ella was the calmest. She straightened up and adjusted her posture,ready to show her pajamas to the audience.

Lily, always ambitious, caught on quickly and struck a pose too.

Their subtle actions didn't go unnoticed by those paying attention.

Arthur raised an eyebrow, his gaze lingering on Ella's slightly raised chest,

a knowing smile playing on his lips.

He had never realized she could be so charming.

"Alright, since everyone is against it, we'll stick to the original plan and start the broadcast live tomorrow morning!"

With more and more voices of opposition, the director changed the plan again.

'This director is so fickle, really annoying,' Ella thought, slumping down and lazily leaning on the sofa.

"Now, to get everyone familiar with each other, let's play a simple game!

Just spin the bottle, then play truth or dare."

The director continued without waiting for everyone's opinion, explaining the game rules.

Lily raised her hand. "How about I start?"

"Sure! That's fine! Now everyone move to the round table over there!"

As the director finished speaking, Ella and the others got up and moved to the table.

Ella and Lily were like conjoined twins, always sticking together.

At some point, Alan walked over and was about to sit next to Ella.

His collar was yanked, and he turned to see Arthur with a cold expression,pushing him aside.

"You..."

Under Alan's shocked gaze, Arthur had already taken the seat next to Ella.

"If you want to sit, just sit. Why pull my collar?" Alan widened his eyes,curiously looking at Arthur. "Do you have some special fetish?"

After saying that, he covered his mouth in mock horror. "Oh, my god,I discovered a secret, you won't silence me, will you?"

"Annoying!"

Arthur shot him a cold glance.

Alan shrugged.

Having just drunk some water. Alan's mind was clearer than ever.

After sitting down, he kept sneaking glances at Ella and Arthur.

He recalled something from when he was drunk-Ms. Worry-Free.

His eyes lit up. looking at Ella, then at Lily, raising his voice, "Which one of you is Ms.Worry-Free?"

"Shut up!" Lily glared at him. "Of course,it's this one!"

She pointed to Ella, then righteously said, "Ms. Worry-Free is shy and not good at socializing! What do you want to say to her? I'lI pass it on for you!"


"Alright!"

Alan's mind was a bit fuzzy, but he didn't argue anymore.

Ava. sitting across, carefully observed everyone.

She had wanted to sit next to Arthur, but unfortunately, she was a second too late.

Feeling resentful, she lightly bit her lip, her eyes full of grievance,occasionally glancing at Arthur.

But he didn't look back at her even once.

She was visibly unhappy, clutching her phone tightly.


The game officially started.

The director cleared his throat and said to Lily, "Let's begin! You said you wanted to go first,right?"
###Chapter 32

"Yes!"

Lily grabbed the bottle, smirked, and gave it a good spin, aiming right at Arthur.

The bottle whirled around and finally pointed right at Arthur.


Her wish came true.

Lily grinned. "Truth or dare!"

She raised an eyebrow, shot a teasing look at Ava across from her, and her eyes lit up with mischief.

"Dare!" Arthur's lips barely moved.

"Alright, find a lady here and give her a passionate kiss! And it better last a minute, or you'll have to do it again!"

As soon as Lily said it, everyone looked stunned.


It was just a game.

They didn't know each other that well, and this was pushing it.

Just when everyone thought Arthur would back out, he nodded and agreed.

Ava glanced upo, saw Arthur's handsome face, and blushed, quickly looking down.

"Mr.Smith, showing off your love, huh?!"

"Kiss,kiss,kiss!"

Someone started chanting, and soon everyone joined in.

Cecilia,sitting next to Ava, excitedly pulled out her phone. "I'm recording this sweet moment for your wedding!"

Ava softly said, "Stop teasing me," as she shyly pushed the phone away,her face as red as an apple.

The room buzzed with excitement.

But Ella felt like she was in an ice cave, trembling, not daring to face what was coming.

Lily looked annoyed, grabbed her hand, and whispered, "Just enjoy the show! Record it with your phone, and you can get more in the divorce."

Under everyone's gaze, Arthur slowly stood up. Just when they thought he was heading straight for Ava, he extended his hand to Ella instead.

"Would this beautiful lady help me out?"

The room went silent.

Ella looked up, shocked, her eyes wide with disbelief.

Arthur beckoned with his finger."Come on."


"I..."

"What are you waiting for? Stand up!"

Lily, playing wingman, pulled Ella up and pushed her into Arthur's arms.


Caught off guard, Ella stumbled into his firmn chest.
Chap
She panicked for a moment, her clear. watery eyes full of confusion.


Arthur smiled. "A deep kiss for a minute!"

With that, he gently moved Ella's mask down to reveal her sexy red lips,then slowly pressed his lips against hers.

Their lips and breaths mingled, his kiss warm and passionate.

Ella stood there, dazed like a puppet, her mind blank.


It felt strange.

They had done everything a couple could do.

But at this moment, a sweet feeling surged in her heart, making her feel like the happiest woman in the world.

Sensing Ella's distraction, Arthur's hand unconsciously pinched her waist.


The slight pain snapped her back to reality.


Ella's eyes widened.

Arthur gave her a warning look and deepened the kiss.


They kissed passionately, like lovers deeply in love.

Lily smiled and shot a provocative glance at Ava, whose face had turned pale.

Alan was shocked, unable to believe what he was seeing.

Alan thought to himself, 'Oh my god, am I seeing things? Since when did Arthur become so unpicky about women, kissing someone without even knowing what she looks like? He must still be hungover.'
Alan knocked his head hard and looked again, realizing it wasn't a dream.

Alan hurriedly took out his phone to record, only to find it missing.

What a pity to miss the moment that they kissed in such a lively atmosphere.

Ava gritted her teeth in anger, her eyes cold as she watched the kissing couple, wishing she could tear Ella apart.

In her rage, she forgot to manage her expression.

The others looked at Ella, Arthur, and Ava with strange expressions.

Noticing their gazes. Ava forced a smile. "With so many people, he never does this to me in public!"

Kissing in front of everyone's gaze could indeed be quite embarrassing.

Jessa. carefree, looked envious. "How nice, Mr. Smith knows you're shy, so he chose someone else!"

"Yes, it's just a game; it doesn't mean anything! In Mr. Smith's heart,you're the most important, or he wouldn't invest billions in this show and give out expensive jewelry as prizes!"

Everyone chimed in to comfort her.

Ava smiled gracefully. "Alright, let's stick to the rules!"

She looked at the kissing couple, and her hand clenched into a fist, hatred boiling in her chest.

The director, who was timing, shouted, "Alright,time's up!"
Ella, lost in the moment,stiffened.

Just as she was about to push him away, Arthur pulled back without hesitation as if it was just to complete the task, smiling politely. "Thank you for cooperating!"

Before he finished speaking, he had already sat down.

Ella's lips curled into a bitter smile.

Indeed, she shouldn't have expectations; without expectations, there could be no disappointment.

She adjusted her mask and sat down gracefully.

"Alright, a great start! Let's continue!"

Sensing the awkward atmosphere, the director spoke and handed the bottle to Arthur. "Now it's your turn to spin!"

"Alright!"

Arthur glanced meaningfully to the side and gave it a strong spin.

"Oh my, is this fate? It points right at Ms. Worry-Free!" The director exclaimed, full of anticipation.

Ella looked embarrassed."I choose truth!"

"Alright!" Arthur's thin lips moved slightly, "Did you ever cheat?"


′′NO!′′

To prevent Arthur from saying something more outrageous, Ella answered quickly.

Arthur paused, "Very good!"

According to the rules. Ella took the bottle and spun it casually.

Coincidentally, it landed on Ava.

Ava was stunned for a moment, then elegantly said,"I choose truth!"


"Then..."

Before Ella could speak, Lily interrupted, "Have you ever been a homewrecker to break up a family? Have you..."

"That's too much!"

Before Lily couldI finish her words, Arthur interrupted.

He frowned, his sharp gaze on Lily. "It is just a game, no personal attacks!"


"What do you mean by that?"

Ava bit her lip lightly, tearful. "You're insulting me! You're too much."


In her agitation, she fainted.

"Ava!"

###Chapter 33
Everyone was in a frenzy because Ava suddenly passed out.

Cecilia,who was nearby,was about to help her.

But someone beat her to it. Arthur dashed over and caught Ava. "Ava!"


Seeing them hug made Ella feel sad.

Lily muttered, "Is she really that fragile?"

Ella shook her head, signaling her to be quiet.

She quickly walked over and whispered, "Let me try to wake her up."


"But..."

Arthur hesitated for a moment and stepped aside for Ella.

She knelt down and carefully examined Ava, quickly realizing Ava was faking it as her eyelashes fluttered slightly.

Ella's lips curled into a smirk. "My method will hurt a lot. Even if she struggles, you need to hold her down! Otherwise, there could be consequences!"

Arthur frowned and nodded. "Okay, I'll hold her down."


He glanced at Alan. "Come help!"

"Got it!"

Alan rushed over, and he and Arthur held down Ava's arms and shoulders.
Ella leaned close to Ava's ear and whispered, "I know you're faking it.Wake up now, or you'll regret it!"

Ava tried her best to stay still.

Ella grinned. "Hold her tight, I'm starting!"

She slowly moved her hand towards Ava's nose. Seeing Ava was determined to keep up the act, she pressed her thumb hard under Ava's nose.


A scream pierced the air.

Ava's eyes flew open. "What are you trying to do,kill me?"

In her anger, she lost her usual gentle demeanor and looked furious.

Arthur was taken aback, squinting at Ava in his arms. "How do you feel?Any discomfort?"Ava's eyes filled with tears, lightly biting her lower lip."No,I feel better!"

At that moment,everyone remembered why Ava fainted.

"Lily, you went too far. It was just a game, why did you mnake it personal!"

"Yeah. Ava is still young. You should apologize for saying that!"

For a moment, Lily became the target of everyone's criticism.

Some were standing up for justice, while others were just trying to please Ava.


"Shut up!"

Lily wasn't scared at all. "It was just a joke, can't she take it?"
cno

Her expression remained unchanged as she mocked Ava, "So fragile, how will you handle things in the future? If you play a mistress and get scolded,will you faint like this? Your tolerance is too low!"

Though her words were harsh, everyone realized she had a point.

In the entertainment industry, who knew what kind of roles they would play in the future.

Alan admired her and gave a thumbs up.

Being praised didn't make her happy, Lily rolled her eyes. "Alright, it was just a game, but an apology is out of the question!"

"But..."

Ava's eyes filled with tears as she tugged at Arthur's sleeve.

Arthur lowered his head, thinking for a moment, then gently let go of Ava and stood up. "Even if it was a game, personal attacks are not acceptable!Apologize!"

His tone was flat and firm.

Lily was so angry she put her hands on her hips, ready to argue.Ella quickly stepped in front of her. "It was just a game, why take it so seriously! Besides, I was the one who woke her up, doesn't that make us even?"


Arthur didn't respond,frowning slightly.

Ella leaned close to Ava and whispered, "We won't apologize. If you push it,we'll tell the media about Arthur's marriage."

Ava's eyes widened in disbelief. "What nonsense are you talking about?"

"You know exactly what I mean!"

They kept their voices low, so no one else could hear their conversation.

Ava's expression shifted, and she smiled gently. "I overreacted! We still have to work together in thefuture, it's just a small matter!"

Crisis averted.

Arthur glanced at Ella, then at Lily with a puzzled look.

With the game halted, the director had to start the next one.

They drew lots from a box, and the director's face lit up with excitement.


"Today we have three fashion designers who are experts in human measurements. Let's test their professional skills."

The game rules were simple: the three designers would be blindfolded and then find a man to measure his dimensions.

Of course, the measurement would also be done blindfolded.

There would be physical contact during the measurement, adding to the fun of the game.

"As far as we know, no one here is married! Maybe we can even pair up a couple! Now, let's start the game!"

Ella looked embarrassed,clearly not thrilled about this game.

Lily handed her a towel. "Later, you should find Arthur and make Ava mad!"

"You!"
"Am I wrong? She pretended to faint!" Lily was indignant. "He's your husband; you can touch him however you want!"

Ella was stunned for a moment, still processing when her eyes were blindfolded.

The living room was spacious, with a dozen men standing in a row.

The three designers would walk over from the opposte side and choose their targets.

Blindfolded, they could only rely on their senses or smell.

Ella and Arthur had been together for years, very familiar with each other.Even blindfolded, she could easily find Arthur from a few feet away.

But why should she choose him?

Thinking about how he wanted Lily to apologize to Ava earlier, anger bubbled up in Ella, and she felt a mischievous urge.

"Alright, let's start. Designers, please find your models!"


The whistle blew.

Ella followed the scent, her target clear.

Before the other two designers even moved, she was already standing in front of Arthur.

"What's going on, can Ms. Worry-Free see? How did she find him so accurately!"

"Yeah, it's unfair. Is there some kind of trick? Director, did you check the towel on her eyes?"
Seeing Ella standing in front of Arthur, Cecilia's assistant and Andy's assistant both complained.

Ava stood there, watching Arthur and Ella together, feeling indignant. But remembering Ella's words, she didn't dare to say more and lightly bit her lower lip.

The director, sweating from the complaints, insisted, "I am sure there's no trick!"

Lily sat there with her legs crossed. "If you're not capable, practice more.
Why accuse others of cheating!"

She silently praised Ella in her heart. 'WVell done, make that bitch Ava mad.



Just when everyone thought Ella would hold Arthur's hand, she took a step to the left.

Alan's eyes widened, then he suddenly smiled and raised his eyebrows at Arthur. His smug look was really infuriating.

Just as Ella reached out, Arthur made a quick move, pushed Alan away,and replaced him.

Arthur's long fingers reached out, accurately grasping Ella's smooth hand.flipping his wrist, and interlocking their fingers,
###Chapter 34

Arthur's move left everyone in shock.

No one sawit coming that the usually aloof and noble Arthur would pull something like this.

The warmth of his hand felt oddly familiar.

Ella instinctively tried to pull her hand away, but Arthur's grip was like a vice,holding her fingers tight.

He stepped closer, his breath hot against her ear. "You want to touch your lover? No way!"

His deep, raspy voice sent shivers down Ella's spine.

Did he know who she really was?

She tilted her head up, trying to see his handsome face through her blindfold.

Arthur just gave a faint smile, like he hadn't said anything at all, making her wonder if she imagined it.

She let out a reluctant sigh.

It was barely a whisper, but Arthur heard it loud and clear, tightening his grip on her hand in response.

Their little exchange was subtle.

Ava had been watching them closely, and seeing this, she was furious.

She bit her lower lip, wanting to rush over and separate them, but...
Jessa, noticing her distress, quickly tried to comfort her. "It's just a game.Maybe Mr. Smith wants Ms. Worry-Free to design a suit for his wedding!"

Ava's lips curled into a smile. "Don't teasing me!"

The blush on her cheeks gave away her feelings.

Seeing this, Jessa showered her with more praise.

After chatting for a bit, Ava's mood lifted, but her eyes still burned with jealousy as she watched them holding hands.

Alan, who had been pushed aside, crossed his arms and spoke up nonchalantly, "What's the deal? Do you like Ms. Worry-Free?"

He really had the nerve to say it.

As soon as the words left his mouth, everyone turned to look at Arthur and Ella with curious eyes.

Arthur shot him a cold glare. "Get lost!"


"Okay!"

Alan quickly hid behind someone and covered his mouth.

Arthur turned his attention back to their clasped hands, feeling a bit sweaty, a faint smile playing on his lips.

Ella made her choice quickly, and the two of them stood aside, waiting for the others.

Cecilia and Andy each picked two staff members.

Next up was the measurement stage.
Ella held a ruler, ready to start, when Arthur cleared his throat. "Let's go to the room! To avoid any awkwardness."

The director nodded in agreement. "Alright, after all, she's a lady!"


Blindfolded, Ella was led to a room by Arthur.

The door closed behind them.

Ella shivered.

"Ms. Worry-Free,shall we begin?"

Arthur placed his hand on her waist, pulling her into his solid chest. Their bodies pressed together, the moment was charged with tension.

"Start!"

Ella said, trying to wriggle free, but her strength was no match for his. "I can't measure like this!"


"Then use your hands!"

Arthur guided her hand over his body. "This is a basic skill for designers!I'll cooperate with the measurements!"

"Don't push it!"

"Alright!"

Seeing her flare up like an angry kitten, Arthur found himself amused.He let her go and stood still. "Let's start now!"

As she left his embrace, Ella felt a strange sense of loss.

'So pathetic. We are about to get divorced, and I'm still craving Arthur's
chaple

touch.

Ella scolded herself, but her hands kept moving.

She stood in front of Arthur, feeling her way, knowing that measuring the three dimensions was crucial for making clothes, especially custom suits.

To get it just right, the suit had to fit the customer's body perfectly, which meant measuring the chest, shoulders, and arms-every detail had to be spot on.

Even the tiniest mistake could throw everything off.


Ella took a deep breath and got to work.

Arthur was tall, but luckily, Ella was tall and skilled too, so she quickly got some key measurements.

Maybe she was just too tired, but when she was measuring his leg, she kept her head down for too long. When she finally looked up, her vision went black, and she stumbled forward.

Just when she thought she was going to hit the grouand,he caught her,pulling her into his arms.

"Throwing yourself at me again?"

Their bodies were pressed tightly together.

Ella gritted her teeth. "No, just a bit dizzy!"

"Are you sure?" Arthur teased, "I don't think so! You're definitely throwing yourself at me!"

His hand wandered down to her waist, grabbing her butt.
"Behave yourself!"

Ella angrily broke free from his hold.

"Alright! You seem really mad today!" Arthur's fingers lightly brushed his lips, like he was savoring something. "What were you thinking when we kissed?"


"Thinking about ending it quickly!"

Ella replied coldly, then went back to measuring his waist.


She pulled the ruler, arms spread, starting to measure.

Arthur looked down at her hand and the way she was haIf-squatting.

He suddenly got an idea and thrust his hips, his penis bumping into Ella's face.


"You..."

"What's wrong? Looks like my dick missed you."

Arthur pulled her back into his arms. "I really want to see your eyes behind that blindfold!"


"No!"

Ella panicked, covering her blindfold and mnask.

"Then make it up to me another way!"

Not giving her a chance to refuse, Arthur lifted her onto the table. "If you dare refuse, I'll rip off the mask!"

Their bodies were pressed tightly together again.
Ella could clearly feel his penis growing hard against her.

She pushed against his chest with both hands. "We're playing a game;there are people outside."

"We'll be quiet!"

Before he finished his sentence, Ella suddenly felt a chill as her nightgown was torn open.

Arthur stepped forward, biting her breast.


"It hurts!"

Ella tried to push him away, but he grabbed her hands and pinned them above her head.

Arthur moved from her chest up, finally biting her collarbone.


Pain surged, and Ella gasped.

"Be good!" Arthur whispered in her ear, lightly biting her earlobe.

Ella trembled all over, her body soft and burning with desire.

"Seems like you like me too!"

Arthur held her waist with one hand, thrusting his hips, his penis sliding into her.

The intense sensation made Ella almost moan, but at the last second,she covered her mouth.

In the quiet room, the sound of their lovemaking was crystal clear.

Her body endured wave after wave of pleasure, and Ella bit her lip hard,

refusing to make a sound.

A knock on the door.

"Arthur, Ms. Worry-Free, are you two done? The other two teams are finished! Only you two are left!"

It was Ava's voice outside the door.

Ella held her breath, her heart racing, feeling like it would jump out of her chest any second.

But Arthur didn't stop, thruasting again and again.


Ella frowned. 'Isn't he worried about being caught?'

She was distracted, and then she felt Arthur thrust even harder.

A moan escaped her lips, and Ella was shocked, quickly covering her mouth.
###Chapter 35

"Ms. Worry-Free? You alright in there?"

Ava's voice echoed from outside the door.

Ella's blindfold was swapped for sunglasses. She was shaking,glaring at Arthur.

Arthur straightened up, finished his last mnove, and slowly put on his clothes. He said coldly, "She just got a little bump. Go back, we'll be out soon!"

"Alright! Hurry up, you two!"

Ava lowered her eyes, hiding the hatred in them,and left.

As the footsteps faded, Ella collapsed to the ground.

Arthur glanced at her. "Get out, or people will get suspicious!"

"You..."

She had never met anyone as shameless as him.

Ella was still gettingdressed when Arthur, already fully clothed, walked out. "Don't forget to put on your blindfold! Otherwise, it's against therules!



"So annoying!"

Ella quickly got dressed and jogged after him.

Hearing his reminder, she went back to put on her blindfold.

Her vision was blocked, but Arthur didn't care, just striding away.

Ella had no choice but to support herself against the wall to move forward.


"You two are back, now report the data!"

The director smiled, his eyes scanning Arthur and Ella.

Seeing the creases on Ella's pajamas, his eyes flashed.

Cecilia, as the senior designer, started first. She accurately and meticulously recorded the model's measurements, also noting some imperfections and offering suggestions for adjustments.

The second person was Andy, who also had outstanding professional skills.


Ella was the third. She froze, not knowing what to do.

They had just measured halfway when the two of them...

As a couple, she knew all of Arthur's measurements by heart.


If she lost now. wouldn't it expose her identity?

She looked anxiously at Lily through her sunglasses and decided to say."
Mr. Smith, height: 6 feet 4.8 inches, head circumference: 21 inches,chest circumference: 42.8 inches..."

In one breath, Ella recited all the data.

After speaking, she lowered her head guiltily, not daring to look at Arthur.


Lily led the applause. "Amazing!"

Arthur took a step to Ella's side and said mockingly,"So detailed?"

Ella lowered her voice to explain, "I have a talent since I was young; I can tell just by looking! No need to measure!"

"Really?" Arthur responded indifferently.

"All three of you are equally impressive! The prize will be decided by drawing lots!"

The game ended without a winner, and the prize was decided by drawing lots, which seemed quite hasty.

However,it matched the director's style.

Next came the drawving lots session.

As Ella passed by Ava, she suddenly heard an exclamation.

"Ms. Worry-Free, what did you do just now? There's a special smell on you!"

Ava quickly covered her mouth, looking apologetic. "Sorry, I didn't mean anything by it, just speaking my mind!"

Ella took two steps back to keep her distance, a slight smile on her lips."
Then tell me, what kind of smell?"

Ava gritted her teeth. "Never mind, I smelled it wrong!"

"It's great that you're so straightforward! I'm the same way!" Ella linked arms with her. "I forgive you, and you should forgive me in the future!"

Lily ran over, her smile even brighter. "Yes, we're all straightforward people, no one should hold grudges! Let's keep in touch!"

The women smiledon the surface, but inside, they were hiding daggers.

Ella had incredible luck and drew an external aid card.

Lily gave a thumbs up. "Good job, you are the best!"


The two hugged to celebrate.

Arthur's eyes turned cold, his gaze falling on the two of them.

Next came a few more mini-games, mainly to help everyone get familiar with each other.

Ella and Lily kept winning, and Ava also benefited a lot since they were in the same group.

It was late into the night.

The director announced the end of the party, and everyone could go back to their rooms.

Ella and Lily kept chatting, holding hands as they left.


Behind them, Arthur's gaze was dark.

Alan approached. "Do you really like Ms. Worry-Free? You haven't even seen her face clearly!"

Arthur's cold gaze fell on him. "Do you have any problem with that?"


"Of course not!"

Alan quickly stepped back to keep his distance. "But I think you're being a bit too fickle, flirting with someone else while Ava is around!"

Arthur sneered and strode forward.

"Wait for me, Arthur! I need to talk to you."

"It's too late,we'll talk tomorrow!"

Arthur didn't stop; his pace had even quickened.

Arthur and Alan soon disappeared fromn sight.

Ava looked indignant.

When she heard footsteps behind her, she immediately changed her expression. "Arthur, ever so persistent, insists that I come to him under the cover of night!"

"Sweet couple!"

Jessa came over, looking envious. "Are you saying this to make us jealous?"

"Absolutely! It's to make us die of jealousy!" Brynn chimed in.

"Alright, don't laugh at me! By the way, there's a movie starting filming in a few days, are you interested? They need costume designers and actors!"

As soon as Ava spoke, everyone's eyes lit up. Especially Blair and Brynn,who, despite having sponsors, lacked golden opportunities.

So,hearing Ava's words, they quickly gathered around.

"If there's a good opportunity, you must think of us. There's a fashion show coming up, let's go together."

"Yes, and a new store opening, let's go shopping! I'll cover the bill."

Ava thoroughly enjoyed this feeling of being the center of attention.

She felt like a queen, being adored by everyone.

After chatting for a while, someone mentioned Ella.

"What's with that Ms. Worry-Free, always so mysterious, but ends up seducing Mr. Smith! Ava, I know you're a kind woman, but you should be cautious!"

"Yes, don't worry, we'll all keep an eye out for you!"


So they all noticed the issue.

Ava's face turned ugly. "Thank you! Actually, I trust Arthur,but sometimes..."

"Don't worry! We're all good friends!"


"Alright!"

Ava took out her phone and shared an invitation. "Let's go together then."

Using benefits to win friends was her usual tactic.

Though the method was crude, it was extremely effective.

They chatted and laughed, seemingly like real good friends.

The director watched from afar,shaking his head slightly.

The assistant director was puzzled. "What do you mean by that?"

"I just think these people are stupid!" The director commented bluntly, "Be more polite to Ms. Worry-Free in the future."
###Chapter 36

Ella had no clue what those two dlirectors were chatting about.

Back in herroom, she was wiped out and just flopped onto the bed,not wanting to move an inch.

Lily noticed and said, "What do you think that jerk is up to? He's so unpredictable,he actually..."

"Whatever, we're getting divorced! He's not worth our time."

Ella clearly didnI't want to hear Arthur's name and was about to get up for a shower when her phone buzzed.

She glanced at it and got furious. "That bastard!"

"What happened?" Lily leaned over, curious. "What's that idiot thinking now? He wants you to wake up early just to make him breakfast?"

He had the nerve toorder sandwiches, burgers, freshly squeezed juice...

Moreover, Arthur threatened her, saying that if there was no breakfast tomorrow,he'd be so mad he'd expose her hat and mask.

Ela's face turned red with anger. "I'm going to..."

Thinking of Arthur's temper, she stopped. "Forget it, I'll just pretend I didn't see his message!"

Just as she finished speaking, her phone buzzed again.

[Don't pretend you didn't see it.]

"Does he know you that well?" Lily exclaimed.

Ella was speechless, "He's crazy!"


[No cursing.]

Ella lookedI up and scanned the room like a radar.


Lily was puzzled. "What are you doing?"

"I think he might have installed surveillance in our room!"


"That makes sense!"

Then, the two of them searched the entire room thoroughly.

In the end. they were exhausted and found nothing.

"Forget it! Let's just sleep!"


"Okay!"

After a quick wash, the two of them lay down and fell asleep.

In her sleep. Lily turned over and felt like she had forgotten something.


Meanwhile, Arthur sat by the floor-to-ceiling window,gently swirling a wine glass with his slender fingers.

Alan leaned in. "Why did you take my phone? Give it back!"


"Buy another one!"

"What? You're so overbearing!"

As if thinking of something, Alan suddenly smiled. "Tell me, what's going on between you and Ms. Worry-Free!"

"None of your business!"

Arthur's thin lips parted slightly, his sharp gaze falling on him. "Do you really not know what secret Ella was talking about?"

Alan kept shaking his head. "I really don't know. We grew up together,and you know I forget things when I get drunk! I don't remember anything when I wake up!"

"Take care of yourself!"

Arthur downed the wine in one gulp and walked into the bathroom.

Alan pouted, "Not a good friend,keeping secrets!"

Early in the morning,the alarm clock rang.

Ella suppressed her anger, turned off the alarm, and got out of bed.

She entered the bathroom, gazed at her bleary-eyed reflection, and fumed with rage. "You want breakfast, huh? Just wait and see!"

Still groggy and full of anger, she went to the kitchen.


The rich aroma filled her nose.

She sniffed and saw the kitchen full of breakfast, making her swallow her saliva.

"Are you Ms.Worry-Free? Why are you up so early? The show crewsaid you just need to come down for breakfast on time!"

The show crew was generous, with everything arranged for them.

Looking at the people cooking in the kitchen, Ella smiled kindly. "I'm

picky about food,so I cook for myself!"

"Alright, everything is here. If you can't find something,just let us know!"


"Okay!"

After checking out the ingredients. Ella rolled up her sleeves and got to work.

Lost in her cooking, she didn't notice the kitchen staff had quietly left,leaving her alone.

Just as the steak was almost done, she was about to stretch when a pair of long arms wrapped around her waist.

"You..."

Ella was about to scream when a familiar scent hit her.

"Breakfast smells good," Arthur said in a deep, husky voice with seductive charm. He leaned close to her ear and gently bit it.

Ella shivered. "There are people here, you..."

Halfway through her sentence, she looked around and realized she was alone in the kitchen.

"Why are you acting crazy so early in the morning?"

"Just wanted to ask if you have anything to say to me!"

Arthur's long fingers lifted her chin, and they looked at each other through sunglasses.

Ella's eyes dodged, her heart racing.

Did he figure out her identity?

No,apart from their interactions in bed, they were practically strangers.

Silently comforting herself, Ella still nervously clenched her clothes, her fingers turning white from the force.

Arthur noticed her small movemenits and sneered, "You have some habits like my wife!"

With that. Ella's mind went blank.

Just as she didn't know how to respond, a sweet voice rang out.

"Arthur, Ms. Worry-Free, what are you doing here?"

At this moment. Ava wasn't an annoying mistress; she was a savior.

Ella quickly walked to the kitchen door. "I'm picky about food, so I made some breakfast myself!"

Ava nodded lightly, not sure if she believed it or not.

She walked up to Arthur, instinctively wanting to hold his arm.

Arthur stepped back, easily avoiding her approach.

"Arthur, the live broadcast starts today, and I'm quite nervous!"

Ava lowered her head and lightly bit her lip. "What if I say something wrong,or the viewers don't like me?"

"Silly girl!"

Arthur smiled and ruffled her hair.

"Hey,you're messing up my hair!"

Ava appeared displeased on the surface, but her eyes were full of smugness.

Ava swayed her body, glancing at Ella as if declaring Arthur was hers.

Ella stood there watching their interaction, her heart feeling like it was pricked by a needle.

Although she had decided to divorce him, seeing this scene still made her feel sad.

"You two carry on, I'll leave first!"


"Your burger isn't ready yet!"

Arthur's voice was cold, his tone indisputable.

Ella stopped, her hand slowly clenching. "Got it!"

Ava lowered her eyelashes, her gaze sweeping over Arthur and Ella.

She spoke sweetly, "Let's go to the living room and discuss some things,

okay?"

Arthur's thin lips pressed together, he didn't speak, just lifted his eyelids,his gaze sweeping over Ella.

Ava shook his arm, acting cute. "Please, it's my first time participating in such a show, I'm so scared and nervous."

"Alright, I follow whatever you say!"

Arthur responded, then walked out of the kitchen.
Ava followed. and as they passed by, she looked at Ella teasingly. "Don't covet what's not yours!"

Ella was stunned, looking up, meeting Ava's cold eyes.

In everyone's eyes. Ava was sweet and kind, but her eyes were full of calculation and coldness!

Ella laughed at herself. "Then keep your things safe! If it can be taken, it's not yours!"


"You..."
###Chapter 37
Ava, fuming, blurted out. "Only someone as shameless as you would kiss a stranger!"

She leaned in close to Ella's ear. "You're just a designer. Crushing you would be a piece of cake!"

"Is that so? Go ahead and try!"

Ella shot her a cold look, walked into the kitchen, and shut the door,blocking out all the nosy onlookers.

She leaned against the door, slowly sliding down to the floor.

Getting chewed out by her husband's mistress-could she be any more pathetic?

Ava was acting out because she felt threatened.But why?

Ella smirked, eyeing the steak she had just cooked. She used tongs to place it on the bread she had prepared.

A fancy breakfast was ready.

She took a deep breath, put the breakfast on a tray, and walked out of the kitchen.

Arthur and Ava were sitting at the dining table.

Ava was munching on a sandwich, looking pretty pleased with herself.

Arthur's face was blank. When he saw Ella come out, he barely lifted an eyelíd. "I'm picky about food too. Let's eat together!"
Ella didn't say a word and set the breakfast on the table.

"My stomach's feeling off. You can have it all!"

Before Arthur could respond, Ella quickly walked away.

Back in her room, she couldn't hold back her anger and punched the pillow twice.

Lily had just woken up and saw Ella panting when she came back. "What's up with you?"

"Nothing, just really pissed off! Hurry up and get ready,we need to go down for breakfast!"


It was almost time to gather.

Lily sped up, and when they went downstairs again, everyone had already

finished breakfast and was touching up their makeup.

"Oh my God, do we realy have to be this competitive?"

Lily thought she was fast, but compared to the others,she was way behind.


They had no time, so they quickly ate breakfast and joined the others.

After sitting down, Ella looked around carefully and didn't see Arthur,which made her breathe a sigh of relief.

Time was up, and the live broadcast officially began.

The director held a megaphone. "Hello everyone, welcome to our live show.Today is the first live broadcast, so let's have the guests introduce themselves!"

The camera panned from left to right.

"Hey everyone, I'm Cecilia. Super excited to be on this show! Hope to bring you some awesome designs you'll love!"

"Hi everyone, I'm Cecilia's assistant. Just graduated from fashion school..."


Soon the camera turned to Ava.

Ava was in a dress, her makeup flawless, looking like she stepped out of a dream.

The moment her face hit the screen, the comments went nuts.

[Ava is stunning. Whoever works with her is so lucky!]

[Mr. Arthur Smith invested in this show. I wonder if Ava will get a chance to appear with him!]

The number of viewers in the live room shot up.

The director couldn't stop grinning. "Ms. Davis, your turn to introduce yourself!"

“Okay!"

Ava flashed a sweet smile and playfully winked. "Hey everyone, I'm Ava,still a newbie. Please take care of me!"

She ended with a heart gesture in front of her chest.


With just one move, she won over countless viewers.

Her sweet look, paired with a playful expression, sent the comments into overdrive.

The camera then turned to Lily.

Lily flirtatiously brushed her hair back, her neck long and slender, her red lips slightly parted. "Hey everyone, I'm Lily, Ms. Worry-Free's assistant.Our philosophy is all about putting the customer first, and we hope to bring you a unique experience!"

It was her first time on a live broadcast, and though Lily was a bit nervous,she held it together with a strong presence.

Next up was Ella.

Before she could even say a word, the comments started flooding in,and they were nothing like the ones for Ava.

Earlier, it was all praise for Ava, but now it was a different story.

[Who is this? I don't recognize her. She's covered up so tightly, I can't see her face! Is she too ugly?]

[This must be the ugly woman. We demand she take off her hat, mask.and sunglasses!]

[Take it off, take it off, take it off!]

The live room was instantly filled with demands for her to reveal her face.

Ella looked embarrassed. "As a designer, I always advocate for the freedom to dress. How I dress is my choice.Please respect that!"

But the viewers weren't having it. The comments kept demanding she remove her disguise.

Ella had been angry since yesterday, and her tone turned colder. "Does not seeing my face affect your life? Besides, there are plenty of people who don'
Cap

t like me. Get in line to criticize me!"

After speaking, she quickly covered her mouth with her hand, looking to Lily for help.

This was a live broadcast, and one wrong word could be blown out of proportion.

Worried her words might affect their studio.she was trying to think of something to make up for it.

Ava, standing nearby, chimed in sweetly, "Hey, you're being too much. The viewers are just curious. You can explain your reasons, but you can't insult them! That's too rude!"

"Is that so?" Ella didn't even look at her. "The commenters wereextremely rude,just like you!"

"You..."

Ava's chest heaved as she was ready to say more.


A cold voice suddenly cut in.

"Let's continue! The director is getting impatient!"

Looking towards the voice, Arthur was wearing a custom suit,his handsome face, and chiseled features looked as if they were carved from stone.

His expression was cold and unreadable as he walked over with long strides,followed by Alan, who waved in greeting.

The two of them sat in a corner, directly across from Ella, making it easy to see her with a glance.

Ella lowered her head, cursing her bad luck inwardly.

The director. enjoying the drama, had hoped the argument would boost viewership.

But Arthur's interruption changed that.

As the sponsor, his words were orders.

With the guest introductions over, it was time to get to the main topic.

The director handed out prepared documents to them. "As you all know,different eras have different clothing styles. Our first episode's theme is evening gowns!"

Ella looked at the pictures and nodded repeatedly. "Check out these dresses! They're so elegant and classy, really easy on the eyes!"

"Yes, especially in terms of material and design. They used to be custom-made.highlighting the body's strengths and covering its flaws!"

Before it even started, Ella and Lily were already deep in discussion.

Arthur sipped his coffee, his finger gently tracing the rim of the cup,his peripheral vision on the opposite side.

Alan, standing nearby, noticed this. "No wonder no one has been able to tempt you all these years. You like this type of woman!"
###Chapter 38
Alan meant the kind of woman who was wrapped up so tightly you could barely see her face.

"You have weird taste," Alan commented.

Before he knew it, he got smacked on the head.

"Hey, I wasn't wrong! You can have my phone, just give me back the SIM card!" Alan whined, feeling pretty annoyed that Arthur had taken his phone for no reason.

Arthur quickly removed the SIM card and tossed it to Alan. "Here,stop complaining!"

"Alright, alright, I'll do whatever you say," Alan grumbled.

Meanwhile, the director gave a quick rundown of the history of evening gowns and then announced the task.

For the first competition, designers had to create a unique evening gown for their model. The results would be decided by online votes.

Since measuring the models' sizes was a bit personal, the camera focused on the director, who was hosting, instead of on the models.

Once everyone understood the rules, they got to work.

Ella,brimming with confidence, walked over to Ava. "Let me measure you first!"

"Okay!" Ava replied with a sweet smile, acting like nothing had happened.

Ella gave her a quick glance and then headed straight to their studio.
"Wow, this place is huge for a live show!" Lily exclaimed, looking at all the equipment.

Ella almost laughed at Lily's over-the-top reaction.

Ava, on the other hand, looked unimpressed and a bit disgusted.

"Let's start measuring!" Ella said, ready to begin, but Lily stepped forward.
"How about I do it instead?"

"No need! Just record the measurements," Ella replied, then started measuring seriously.

She thought Ava might cause trouble, but surprisingly, Ava cooperated.

Ella was thorough, not missing any details. But when she got to Ava's waist and hips, she noticed Ava had tucked in her pelvis.

"Relax a bit. or the measurements won't be accurate," Ella said, frowning.

"I'm already very relaxed!" Ava insisted with a smile.

Ella measured again,but Ava did the same thing.

It would make the dress too big at the waist.

Ella's face darkened. "If we win this competition, it's a win for all three of us!"

"Can you measure or not?" Ava snapped.

Ella took a deep breath, trying to keep her cool, and bent down to measure again.

"Ava!" a loud voice suddenly shouted.

Ella jumped, feeling a sharp pain on her scalp.

Lily's angry voice followed. "Ava, that's too much! You tangled Ella's hair in your clothes on purpose!"

Ella's anger flared. She couldn't stand up straight because her hair was caught. She grabbed Ava's clothes and pulled hard.

The sound of fabric tearing and a scream filled the room.

Ella looked up, her hat falling off in the process. She quickly picked it up and put it back on to avoid being seen.

"You guys are too much, tearing my clothes! This is a limited edition!"Ava fumed, her chest heaving with anger.

The delicate dress Ava was wearing now had a piece missing from the front.

Ella looked at the fabric in her hand and tossed it back. "Here you go!There's even a piece of diamond on it, take it back!"

"I don't care, you tore my dress, you have to pay for it!" Ava demanded.

"Fine, then you owe me for the hair you yanked out! My hair's valuable too!"

"Your hair's worthless! My dress costs a fortune!"

Ava lost it, lunging at Ella with her nails aimed right at her face.

Ella dodged and didn't hold back, kicking her straight on.

Everything happened so fast that by the time Lily realized it, the two were already brawling.
Lily jumped in. grabbing Ava's hair and pulling her away. "How dare you,I'll teach you a lesson today."

Just as she raised her hand to strike, the door flew open.

Arthur stormed in, looking furious. He quickly stepped between Ella and Ava.

His face was dark, his eyres locked on Ella. "What the hell is going on?"

"Arthur, look at my dress!" Ava cried,tears streaming down her face. She tugged at Arthur's sleeve, looking pitiful. "You bought me this dress; I'm so heartbroken!"

"What happened?" Arthur's voice was cold.

Ella looked up, stubbornly meeting his gaze. "What do you think?"

Lily,feeling indignant, rolled up her sleeves. "What do you mean, blaming us without knowing the cause,you..."

"Enough!" Ella stepped forward, shielding Lily. "Ava tangled my hair in her clothes on purpose."

Ava choked out, "You're framing me, it wasn't on purpose!"

"Seriously? You're such a liar!" Lily shot back, pointing at her eyes. "I saw it with my own eyes, and you still dare to deny it!"

"You two are in cahoots, framing me together!" Ava looked extremely aggrieved, her eyes red and constantly sniffing.

That pitiful look, like a wounded little animal, made people want to sympathize.
Ella's face was cold. "You seem to have forgotten something important!"

"What?" Ava was momentarily stunned.

Ella didn't speak, just pointed to the upper right corner.

Although the measurements weren't broadcasted live, each room had cameras to record everything for the promotional video.

Ava's expression froze as she looked at the camera.

Arthur's indifferent gaze swept over the two of them. He grabbed Ella's wrist and started walking out.

"Let go of me,what are you doing!"

Ella struggled, but with limited strength, she was dragged out of the studio.

Ava's face changed. "Arthur, what are you doing!"

Lily, who had come to her senses, also tried to stop him. "We're in the middle of recording, you can't just..."

"Shut up! No one is allowed to follow."

Arthur turned back, his gaze icy, and after speaking, he didn't look back,dragging Ella out.

"What do you want!"

"You're so noisy!"

Arthur wrapped one arm around her waist, the other under her legs,lifting her into his arms. "If you keep talking. I'll have sex with you right now!"

"You..."
Worried about being noticed, Ella buried her head in his chest. "What do you want!"

"I just want to make love to you!" Arthur's words were explicit.

Ella's heart skipped a beat, instinctively retorting. "Aren't you worried about Ava getting jealous?"

A cold sneer sounded above her head.

Ella's anger flared up, she twisted her small hand hard on his strong waist.


"So eager?"
###Chapter 39

"Put me down!"

Arthur's breath brushed against her face, making Ella feel weak all over.She pushed against his chest with all her might, desperate to get out of his grip.

But Arthur just tightened his hold on her waist.

He carried her into a room and kicked the door shut behind them.


"You!"

Arthur loosened his arm, and Ella tried to break free and run, but he yanked her back and pinned her against the door.

"Is this mask glued to your face orsomething?"

Arthur teased. hooking her chin with his finger.

Ella's eyes widened in fear, and she quickly covered her face with her hands. "What do you want? It wasAva who started it!"

"This has nothing to do with her!"

Arthur's voice was cold as he held her waist tightly, their bodies pressed together. "I'm just curious about the face under the mask."

"No!"

Ella realized what he was about to do and started trembling.′′I2m hideous;you'll be scared!"

"But what if I want to kiss those lips?"
He leaned in close to her ear, his voice low and seductive.

Arthur's presence was overwhelming.

Ella whispered, "I..."

"Ill give you a chance to make it up to me! I'll forget about what happened today."

"So you brought me here just to get back at me for Ava?"

Ella laughed bitterly, her anger rising. "I told you, it wasn't our fault!"

Arthur didn't respond. Instead, he sat on the sofa, crossed his legs, and touched his lips with his slender fingers, clearly waiting.

Ella swallowed her anger. "Then close your eyes!"

"Alright."

Arthur replied softly, leaning back on the sofa and closing his eyes.

Ella knew he wouldn't break his promise. So she took off her mask and slowly approached him.

"Hurry up! You know I don't have much patience!"

Hearing those familiar words, Ella's heart pounded,her eyes locked on Arthur's handsome face.

'Does he know who I am? Maybe he's just messing with me?

A million thoughts raced through her mind, slowing her down.

Seeing Arthur's impatient expression, she quickly walked over,bent down.and kissed his lips, then tried to pull away.
But a strong hand wrapped around her waist.

The next moment, she was pulled into a firm embrace.


"You..."

"Don't worry, I won't open my eyes!"

Arthur's voice was rough and undeniable. He held her waist with one hand and her head with the other, kissing her deeply.

Their lips and breaths mingled.

Arthur's kiss was intense and passionate,like he wanted to consume her.

Ella's body went weak, but she kept her hand over Arthur's eyes.

Her slight movement made Arthur angry, and he bit her lip.


The sharp pain made Ella gasp.

The taste of blood filled her mouth, and Ella glared at Arthur, not understanding what had gotten into him.

Feeling Ella's resistance, Arthur got even angrier and pinched her waist."Focus on me!"


"You..."

In her fury, Ella bit his lip hard.

They hurt each other.

Ten minutes later, they walked out of the room with swollen lips.

Ella wore a hat and mask, making it less noticeable.
Arthur shot Ella a teasing look and held out his hand.

Ella blinked, confused. "What do you want?"
"The mask! Do you want me to show up in front of everyone looking like this?"

His lips were clearly injured, and it would be obvious to everyone what had happened.

Ella didn't want any gossip with him, so she tossed a mask at him."If you're that worried. stay away from mne next time."

Arthur smirked and walked off in the opposite direction without another word.

Ella headed back to the small studio.

Lily and Ava's eyes were on her the moment she walked in.

Lily looked worried. "What happened? Did that jerk..."

"Who are you calling a jerk?" Ava snapped, quickly moving closer to Ella and sniffing her.

The familiar scent hit her, and her expression changed. "Why do you have..



She stopped mid-sentence and reached out to pull Ella's mask off.

Ella stepped back and grabbed her wrist. "Cut it out. We're partners. If we can't work together, I'll ask the director for a new partner!"

"You..."
Ava was fuming and about to say something when there was a knock on the door.

"Ms. Worry-Free, the other groups are done. The director wants to know how you're doing."

"We're finished!"

With the measurements taken, Ella and her team retürned to the hall.

The director's team seemed impressed. "Alright, all three groups have completed their measurements. Next, our designers will draw their designs live and interact with the audience during the process."

To avoid any interference, they went back to the studio for the live broadcast.

Ella had had some rough interactions with viewers earlier, so Lily took over the task of engaging with them.

Ava,being cute and petite, had a lot of fans tuning in just for her.

On the way back to their studio, the comments were full of praise for Ava.


Lily rolled her eyes, which sparked a flurry of comments.

[Who is this? Why is she rolling her eyes when we're praising Ava?Jealous much!]

[Look at her face, all that makeup. Her foundation must be as thick as a wall! She would look absolutely ugly without it.]

Reading the comments, Lily felt her anger rising.

She was about to clap back when Ella grabbed her hand and spoke to the
camera. "Don't say that. Lily is really beautiful! She'll do a live makeup removal for you."

Then she turned to Ava. "Our group has the least popularity. How about giving the fans some benefits?"

Ava smiled awkwardly and changed the subject. "Of course, I have a fan meeting coming up. I'll give out some benefits then. I hope everyone can join!"

Ella thought, 'So shameless.'

The benefit was supposed to be makeup removal.'

But Ava took the chance to promote herself.

Ella pursed her lips, not planning to let her off that easily. The grudge of having her hair pulled was still fresh.

After all,staying up late every day made her lose a lot of hair. Having her carefully nurtured hair yanked out was unacceptable.

She warmly linked arms with Ava. "You always call your fans babies. How about this, show them your bare face?"
###Chapter 40
[Hey, it's all good, Ava. You're stunning even without makeup!]

[Totally! Remember when Ava used to livestream herself sleeping? Her skin was flawless. So jealous!]

Ava blushed at the compliments in the comments.

She tried to brush it off, but Lily and Ella kept hyping her up, making it impossible for her to decline.

Laughing and chatting, they strolled into the studio.

Ella took a seat at the desk, looking serious. "So, we were just talking.Ava is gorgeous, like a flower, and in an eyening gown, she's the perfect lady!So we..."

Ella spoke slowly and softly, laying out the design concept and her creative ideas in detail.

The viewers, who were initially just there to praise Ava, soon got hooked on Ella's explanation.

[Ms.Worry-Free is a rising star in design. I've heard of her.She only does high-end custom work, super impressive!]

[We haven't even seen the sketches or samples yet, but her description sounds amazing! Can't wait to see Ava in that dress!]

II'm placing an order now before Ms. Worry-Free gets to0 popular and l can't get a spot!]

Lily couldn't stop smiling when she saw these comments, clasping her
hands together in gratitude. "Thank you, everyone. Your support means the world to us."

After explaining the concept, it was time to draw the design.

The livestream camera zoomed in on Ella's computer.

Ella had prepped everything, hiding anything unnecessary,leaving the interface clean and tidy.

She started with the collar.

Ava had a long neck, so the collar design was classic, but she filled it with small roses.

The roses looked so real, almost lifelike.

The viewers in the livestream went wild.


[So beautiful!]

The comments were flooded with praise.

Lily smiled and explained, "Hey everyone, these flowers absolutely will highlight Ava's beauty."

The exquisite design and the brilliant explanation were a perfect match.

Ava felt a bit sidelined and unsatisfied. She stepped back and sent a message to someone on her phone.

Ella's livestream was buzzing, with many people amazed by her design.

Meanwhile, in the other two livestreams...

Cecilia, a veteran in the industry, had a lot of professionals watchingher

from the start.

Seeing her smooth design process, they showered her with praise.

Andy took a different approach. Even though the theme was evening gowns, she believed the gown should be people-oriented.

So,she designed a unique gown.

Everyone had their own ideas.

Many viewers switched between the three livestreams.

The designers' assistants also kept an eye on the comments, providing timely feedback.

Amidst the admiration for the designers' creativity, a lot of viewers started commenting, [Ms. Worry-Free is bullying Ava.]

At the same time, several hashtags quickly trended.


#Ms. Worry-Free Bullying Ava#

#Ava Being Bullied On The Show#

#Ms. Worry-Free And Assistant Bullying Ava#

Below these topics was a complete video.

In the video, Ella and Lily were seen ganging up on Ava.

Even though their faces were censored, everyone could still tell who was in the video.

Cecilia and Andy's livestreams were cruising along just fine.
But over on Ella's side, things were getting heated. She was deep into her design when a scream broke her concentration.

She turned around to see Lily, red-faced and furious, confronting Ava."Did you do this?"

Ava stepped into the camera's view, looking down and biting her lip."What are you talking about? I don't understand."

"Don't play dumb! You must've uploaded that video online!"

Lily was livid, shoving her phone in Ava's face, playing the incriminating video.

Ava looked terrified, backing into a corner.

Sensing the drama, the cameraman zoomed in on Ava.

In the corner. Ava curled up,tears streaming down her pale face. "What are you talking about? It wasn't me!"

"Stop acting all innocent."

Lily,still fuming, waved her phone around.

Ava squatted down, hugging her head. "Don't hit me, I know I was wrong!



She was playing the victim, trying to get sympathy, and it was obvious to anyone watching.

As Lily got more agitated, Ella pulled her back. "We know the truth,why get so worked up?"

"Yeah! It's just a video, we have one too!"
Lily turned to the cameraman. "We need a copy of the surveillance video from this room to show the truth to everyone."

The cameraman hesitated, then shook his head. "I don't have the authority,you need to ask the director!"

"Then let's go ask!"

Lily stormed out of the room.

Ella didn't stop her. She crossed her arms and looked at Ava. "Enough,you're overacting. It looks ridiculous."

The point of this livestream was the competition.

Knowing Lily's capabilities, Ella wasn't too worried.

She went back to her desk to continue her work.

Before she could finish drawing a flower, the door burst open.

Lily came back, even more furious. "It was you, wasn't it? All the videos are gone!"

"Don't accuse me!" Ava cried, tears streaming down her face.

[This is workplace bullying,how dare they bully Ava!]

[Boycott Ms. Worry-Free, get Ms. Worry-Free off the show!]


[Get out,how dare they bully Ava.]

In no time, the comments were filled with demands for them to leave.

Ella glanced at the comments, her mouth twitching.
She spoke seriously to the camera. "Please be rational, this isn't what it seems. Let's continue the livestream, and we'll explain everything afterwards."

[Get out,you even want to continue the livestream!]

[We disagree, we need justice for Ava! Get out!]


[Get out!]

Seeing the screen filled with sharp words, Ella felt a lumnp in her throat."Please,everyone..."

The door opened.

The director rushed in, bowing deeply in front of the camera. "We apologize for this incident. On behalf of the production team,I apologize.This livestream is paused, we will provide an explanation later!"

Ella was stunned. "What do you mean?"

"Yeah, director, this is unreasonable. Your production team allowed this video to defame us, and now you say it was deleted. Who are you trying to fool?"

After finally getting on the show, they were completely defamed. Ella's previously good reputation was now in tatters.

The more she thought about it, the angrier Lily got. She got closer to the director. "If we don't get an explanation for today's incident, we won't back down, even if it means going to court!"
###Chapter 41
Their argument grew louder as Arthur paused outside the door, his masked face betraying no emotion.

Alan, standing nearby, chimed in, "Not gonna play the hero? This is your chance!"

"All yours," Arthur replied, sounding bored.

"She's your woman."

Alan patted Arthur's shoulder. "Moments like this don't come often. If you rush in now and hold her tight, she'll definitely fall for you."

He gestured as he spoke.

Arthur glanced at Alan's hand. "You want to keep that hand?"


His voice was cold as ice.

Alan quickly pulled his hand back, stepping away. "Just kidding!"


"Annoying!"

Arthur turned and walked off.

Behind him, Alan pouted.

'He rushed over when he found out Ella's live stream was down. Then,at the door, he said nothing and just left. Men are so confusing.

Alan grumbled to himseIf but didn't dare say another word, trailing behind.

Hearing the footsteps behind him, Arthur ignored them, heading back to

his room and opening his laptop.

Looking at the trending topics, his fingers tapped the table, and he made a call, "Send me the video!"

A few minutes later.

Arthur watched the video, squinting his eyes, giving off an aloof vibe.

Alan shrank back. "Ava framing Ms. Worry-Free, it's definitely out of jealousy..."

Halfway through his sentence, he felt a chill on his neck.

Turning around, he met Arthur's icy gaze and immediately shut up.

Arthur looked away, continuing to work on his computer, and irritably tore off his mask.


"Who bit your lip?"

"Get out!"

Unable to take it anymore, Arthur pushed him away. "Out!"


"Okay!"

Alan left the room, looking back frequently as he went.

Finally alone, Arthur took out his phone and looked at the call log."Stubborn woman, I'll wait for you to come to me!"

Ella was emotional and suddenly sneezed.

She looked at the director's troubled face and shook her head."Let's leave it for now, I need some peace!"
"Okay! We'll leave it for now and come up with a solution. The online reaction is too intense, so please understand."

After another round of apologies, the director turned and left.

With no outsiders around, Ava raised her head proudly, full of smugness."So, have you seen how powerful I am? Dare to compete with me for Arthur, ths is the consequence you have to bear!"

"So,you admit..."

Ella hadn't finished her sentence when Ava's face changed. "You didn't secretly record this with your phone, did you?"

Ella held out her hands to prove her innocence. "I'm not shameless like you. Don't get too smug, the truth will come out!"

She walked out. holding Lily's hand.

Back in the room, Lily punched the pillow, exclaiming, "Damn it, so unlucky!"

"Alright! She can find experts,so can we!"

Ella took out her phone, found a number, hesitated for a moment, and then dialed it, but quickly hung up before the other side answered.

Lily leaned over, curious. "Who was that?"


"Nothing!"

Ella lay on the bed, full of worry. "The only thing that can prove our innocence now is the video."

But clearly, the video had been tampered with.

She buried her head in the blanket. "So unlucky!"

"Alright, there's always a way. Don't be scared!" Lily walked over,hugging her to comfort her. "Arthur's a jerk too. Even if you're getting divorced, he should help!"

"Forget it!"

Ella allowed herself only a few seconds of sadness.

She opened her computer and phone, simultaneously watching the live stream of Andy and Cecilia. "Knowing the opponent's info is key to winning. Let's see how the other two are doing!"

Seeing her so focused, Lily stayed by her side.

An expert's skill was evident from the start.

Although the live stream had just begun and Andy and Cecilia had only designed a small part, Ella could already foresee how beautiful the dresses would be when they were finished.

"Andy has great ideas. She plans to use silk for the dress, and if the hem is painted with birds or butterflies, it'll look like they're flying when the model moves. Very beautiful!"

Lily watched for a while, learning a lot. "Working with seniors is great,I can learn so much!"

But thinking about their current situation, she was so worried-would they be kicked out of the show?

Seeing Ella so focused, she quietly left the room.

Coincidentally, Alan was at the end of the hallwway.
Their gazes met, and Lily swayed her hips as she walked over. "Hey, we're here for the show and collaborating with you. Now that something's gone wrong,shouldn't you help?"

Alan nodded heavily. "Indeed, you have a shortcut, why not take it? Ms.
Worry-Free and Arthur have a great relationship!"

Thinking of Arthur's bitten lip, he lowered his voice, "If Ms. Worry-Free asks Arthur for help, he'll definitely agree!"

"Get lost!"

Lily's face changed, full of disdain. "You really don't remember anything when you're drunk?"

"Yes! It's been like this since I was a kid!" Alan's eyes were clear. "You've asked me this several times, what do you mean?"

"Nothing! Just saying that since our companies are collaborating,you should help us! Call Sean now."

Alan was speechless.

Seeing her fierce face, he reluctantly made the call and explained their situation.

Sean only told him to wait.

After hanging up, Lily was furious. "What do you mean, wait? This is urgent!"

She couldn't hold back her temper anymore.

She tried to grab the phone, but Alan, with his height advantage,held it high. "Don't be anxious, didn't I say,go find Arthur!"
As their argument grew louder, Ella couldn't ignore it.

She opened the door. "Alright.come back!"

"Ms. Worry-Free,go find Arthur, he'll definitely help!"


"Get lost. allyou jerks! You're no good either!"

In her anger, Lily spoke without thinking. Ella was worried her friend would cause trouble, she quickly pulled her back into the room.

Alan was left outside.

He looked innocent, but when it came to the term "jerk," he couldn't argue.

After all, Arthur had a wife, was still tangled up with his first love, and now he was messing around with Ms. Worry-Free.

As time passed, the bullying issue escalated.

Irrational fans had online bullied Ella, inundating her with vitriolic comments that quickly spread across the internet.

The omnipotent netizens even found Ella's private phone number.

Ella frowned,opening the door to see who it was, her face darkened."

What are you doing here?"

###Chapter 42

"Of course, I'm here to see you!" Ava grinned, slipping through the door before Ella could say a word, and plopped down on the sofa.

She lifted her chin, looking around with a smirk. "Now you see how powerful I am!"

Ella rolled her eyes. "Not really!"

"Stop bragging, this was just a small lesson," Ava said, waving her hand dismissively. "I don't care what you think, announce your withdrawal from the show immediately, or I'll make sure you regret it..."

"Really?"

Ella raised an eyebrow, cutting Ava off. "Go ahead and try, I want to see what you can do!"

"Are you sure you won't leave?"

Ava frowned. "You guys are just here for the money!"

She pulled a check from her bag and tossed it over. "You won't make this much in your lifetime..."

Before she could finish, the door swung open.

Lily stormed in, her eyes blazing when she saw Ava. "What are you doing here,trying to mess with us again?"

Getting angrier, she was about to drag Ava out when she noticed the check on the table. Her fury intensified. "How dare you, a mistress, throw a check at..."
Ella stood up and covered Lily's mouth. "Alright, don't get mad!"

As their eyes met, Ella pinched Lily's waist andLily nodded.Lily nodded.


Ava, watching them, sensed something was off.

"What? Not happy with the amount on the check? Just take it and leave now, or I'll send you abroad right this second!"

"How dare you? If you have the guts, send us to the moon!" Lily snapped,picking up the check and throwing it in Ava's face. "Get out, don't embarrass yourself here!"

She shoved Ava all the way to the door, about to close it when she saw Arthur nearby,sneering. "Scumbag and slut, don't come out to bother us!"

The door slammed shut.

Lily pulled out a wet wipe and scrubbed her hands, as if she'd touched something filthy.

"Such a woman should be thrown out, you're just too nice!"

Lily sneered, "Who does she think she is? A mistress dares to throw a check at us! Tomorrow I'll get some coins and throw money at her!"

Getting angrier, she rolled up her sleeves, ready to rush out.

Seeing Lily so worked up. Ella felt her own frustration ease. "Alright, don't be mad, she's not worth it!"

"Right, if that matter remains unresolved, we will go back! I just talked to Alan, but he can't handle anything."

Listening to the complaints, Ella opened her laptop and got back to work,

as if it was the only thing that could calm her down.

Outside the door, Ava, who had been kicked out, was fuming,her eyes red.

Footsteps approached, she turned around, her anger vanishing, replaced by a sweet smile.

"Arthur, are you here to see me?" She walked over, trying to link arms with Arthur.

Arthur stepped back to avoid her. "I'm just walking around!"


"But..."

In such a large estate, how could he have arrived here by mere chance?

Ava didn't buy it, but she let it go. "Let's go for a walk. The other groups are still live streaming, it's a pity the first live stream turned out like this!"

As she spoke, she kept an eye on Arthur's expression.

Unfortunately, his face was calm, showing no emotion.

They walked and chatted, soon arriving at the first floor.

The live stream was still rolling, and everyone was super busy. Wherever they went, they were the center of attention.

Ava smiled warmly, greeting everyone and introducing them to Arthur.

She was soaking up the spotlight, totally enjoying herself.

She didn't notice that Arthur's expression stayed indifferent,his eyes glued to his phone.

After the live stream wrapped up, everyone gathered for a review.
Arthur, being a sponsor, joined in. He scanned the room but didn't see Ella,then cleared his throat.

"Where is Ms. Worry-Free's group?"


His voice was cold as ice.

Alan, who had been laughing, suddenly felt a chill down his spine and sat up straight. "Although today's live stream was interrupted, Ava has already clarified it,tomorrow..."

"Cut the crap!" Arthur cut him off. "Since it's a meeting, call them down!"

The director, sweating bullets, nodded quickly. "Okay, I'll call them right away!"

The room fell silent, tension thick in the air.

Arthur's slender fingers tapped the table rhythmically. Soon, footsteps approached.

He looked up to see Ella and Lily hurrying over.

Ella was bundled up, showing no emotion, while Lily had anger written all over her face. She glared at Ava as she walked by, and when her gaze landed on Arthur, she rolled her eyes in disdain.

Someone was stunned when a small assistant dared to roll her eyes,unsure if it was directed at Arthur.

"Everyone's here, let's review!" The director took control. "Today's live stream had great popularity, everyone was innovative in their designs,unique in their thinking..."

"Let's talk about the bullying incident!"
Arthur interrupted bluntly. "Workplace bullying is absolutely intolerable.Any explanations?"

Scumbag.

Ella looked over her sunglasses and decided not to hold back anymore."We also want an explanation! It was clearly Ava who deliberately pulled my hair..."

"I already posted that it was a misunderstanding!"

Ava lowered her head, lightly biting her lip, looking all innocent and aggrieved.

Lily. with her hot temper, was about to speak, but Ella grabbed her hand.

"We just want the truth! Being online bullied for no reason, if the show can't provide the video, we won't compromise!"

Ella, wearing sunglasses and a mask, her face was unclear, but her tone revealed her anger.

The director was in a tough spot, his gaze fell on Arthur.


The room went silent again.

After a while, Arthur spoke softly, "The surveillance equipment had issues,we need an expert to fix it!"

He sent a message on his phone.

Ella's phone buzzed, and she just glanced at it, raised an eyebrow,and put her phone down. "So, what do you plan to do next? A vague statement won't calm the public's anger!"

"This..." The director lowered his head,glancing at Arthur.

"During tomorrow's live stream, you two should act friendly, that will dispel the rumors!" Alan, thinking he was smart, suddenly smiled. "We're all partners, don't make it like this!"

"Shut up!" Lily threw a file at him.

Alan was startled. "Calm down, don't be angry!"

The situation was at a standstill.

The only one who could resolve it, Arthur, remained sílent,his cold eyes on Ella, showing no emotion.
###Chapter 43

Time ticked by slowly.

After a bit, Arthur finally said, "Alright, meeting's over!"

Nothing got sorted out, and the meeting just ended like that.

Ella stayed put, watching Arthur walk away, and let out a sigh.


Lily clenched her teeth. "He's just pushing us around!"

Ella smirked, "Well, the show must go on. We'll fight back with everything we've got!"

"Absolutely!"

Lily was fired up. "When our Worry-Free Studio goes global, let's see who dares to look down on us then!"

"I'm going for a walk. You head back first."

With that, Ella stepped outside.

The breeze blew, and she felt a bit lighter.

She wandered around the estate, not really paying attention to where she was going, and ended up in the garden.

The garden was in full bloom, the air filled with sweet scents.She bent down, took a deep breath, and a smile spread across her face.

Suddenly,a dog barked.

Ella's eyes widened as she saw a dog charging at her.
She tried to run, but there was no way she could outrun it.

Just as the dog was about to knock her over, a voice shouted, "Stay still!"


The dog stopped in its tracks and stood there obediently.

Ella, still catching her breath, clutched her chest. "Whose dog is this? Why isn't it on a leash?"

"Sorry about that, Ms. Worry-Free. I'm Leo Schmidt, an intern with the show."


"Hi,Leo."

Ella gave him a once-over.

Leo was in sportswear, with neat, short hair and big, kind eyes. He looked like a genuinely nice guy.

Seeing such a handsome guy made Ella feel a bit better.

"It's not safe to wander around here alone at night. I'll walk with you1. It's easy to get lost."

"No need," Ella said quickly.

There were cameras everywhere, and she didn't want any trouble.

Leo scratched his head. "Actually, I wanted to ask you something. I'm getting married soon, and I was wondering if you could..."

He trailed off,looking unsure.

Ella's eyes lit up. "You want me to design a wedding dress for you?"


"Could you?" Leo's eyes sparkled.
Under the moonlight, his handsome face was full of hope.

Ella nodded. "You two seem really happy together. I'd love to help!Consider it a wedding gift."

"Awesome!"

Leo excitedly pulled out his phone to show pictures of his girlfriend. "This is her. I can give you her measurements. I want it to be a surprise! She's a big fan of yours, watches your live broadcasts all the time... sorry about the interruption earlier."

Ella shook her head. "No need to apologize, it happens. Do you have more photos? I want to get a sense of her style and hair."

"Sure, let's sit over there."

"Okay."

They sat on a bench, and Ella carefully looked through the photos of Leo's fiancée.

From her outfits, it was clear she loved fashion and had a youthful, lively vibe.

Ella quickly got inspired. "I'Il design a lively, beautiful wedding dress full of youth."

"Perfect! Wearing your design at our wedding would be amazing."

"You really knew how to make me happy! Let me tell you about the details..."

Ella pulled out her phone and started sketching right there.
Leo was blown away by her design, craning his neck to get a better look.

As they both leaned in to see the phone, they ended up getting closer and closer without even realizing it.

A gust of wind blew, making them shiver and adjust their clothes. Little did they know, it wasn't just the wind that was cold-it was Arthur's icy stare.

Up on the top floor balcony, Arthur leaned against the railing, his slender fingers gripping a wine glass, gently swirling it. "Getting cozy, huh?"

"What are you talking about?" Alan, who was nearsighted, squinted and smiled. enjoying the view. "You're so idle. Why don't you hang out with Ava?"

"Shut up!" Arthur snapped, shooting him a cold glare.

Alan covered his mouth, grinning. "Then let's talk about Ms. Worry-Free..."


His annoying voice kept ringing in Arthur's ears.

Arthur wished he could kick him off the balcony, his eyes fixed on the scene below wwithout blinking.

"The dress is too short!" Arthur suddenly muttered.

Alan was puzzled. "What's wrong with you? Saying weird stuff at night!"

"Nothing!" Arthur shot him another cold look, then tightened his grip on the glass.

The sound of glass breaking echoed as the wine glass shattered in his hand.
Alan jumped. "I gotta go; I have something to do!"

Before he finished speaking, he hurriedly left.

Staring at the broken glass, Arthur's face was tense. "Ella,you're playing with fire!"

The night breeze blew.

In less than 10 minutes, Ella had finished the initial sketch. "You can show this to your girlfriend, see if she likes it!"

"It's gorgeous! She'l definitely love it!"

"Glad to hear that!"

Ella stretched her limbs. "Let's exchange contact info, so we can stay in touch if there are any issues."

"Sure."

"No!"

Just as Leo was about to nod, a cold voice interrupted.

Turning around, he saw a tall figure standing not far away.


"Mr.Smith!"

Realizing who it was, Leo quickly stood up to greet him.

Arthur responded indifferently, then looked at Ella. "What are you two doing out here at night?"

Leo replied, "I wanted to ask Ms. Worry-Free.,."

"It's rest time now, does it concern you?"

Thinking about the check Ava had thrown her earlier, Ella was full of anger when she saw Arthur, her tone impatient.

Arthur raised an eyebrow, took a cigarette from his pocket, lit it, and took a deep drag. "What do you think?"

His tone was indifferent, with a hint of coldness.


Leo shivered, wanting to explain.

Ella shook her head at him. "I don't want others to know this thing!"

Leo nodded. "Don't worry, I won't tell anyone! It's our secret."


Leo,fresh out of school,was simple-minded.

As he spoke, he extended his hand for a high-five.

Seeing him like this, Ella extended her hand.

As their hands touched, the surrounding air seemed to get much colder.

Leo rubbed his arms. "It's getting chilly out here, let's head back!"

Arthur raised an eyebrow, repeating the word, and walked over,standing between them. "You two are close?"


"Well..."

The two men stood together.

Leo wasn't short, but next to Arthur, he seemed small and insignificant.


He nervously swallowed. "I..."
"You're busy, you should go!" Arthur said indifferently.


Leo looked at Ella, unsure of what to do.

Ella didn't want to involve others, so she nodded. "We have each other's contact info; we can talk on the phone later!"
###Chapter 44

The night was pitch black.

Leo kept glancing back with every step until he vanished into the darkness.


Arthur let out a cold snort, sat down, and pulled Ella onto his lap.

His slender fingers brushed over her leg. "That skirt's way too short! Don't wear it again."

"Who are you to tell me what to do?"

Ella tried to break free, but she couldn't; she had no choice but to sit on his lap.

Hearing her defiant tone, Arthur's face darkened. He yanked down her collar. exposing her smooth skin. "You've got guts, daring to defy me!"

With that, he grabbed her chin and bit her neck.


Ella's body instantly went limp.

Arthur's kiss was different this time, more intense and passionate, likehe wanted to devour her.

Feeling his change in emotion, Ella felt only bitterness.

The air was thick with tension, and Arthur's breathing grew heavier and more urgent.

His large hand started to wander over her body. Ella felt a chill below and realized what he was about to do. She quickly grabbed his hand.′′N!′′

They were outside.

What if someone saw them?
After being rejected. Arthur's breath turned cold. He grabbed her hand forcefully, his tone leaving no room for doubt. "If I want you,you have to give!"

His hot breath sprayed on her neck.

Ella felt like she was falling into an ice cave. She tried to struggle, but Arthur's strength was too overwhelming, and she could only let him do as he pleased.

A flurry of kisses fell upon her ceaselessly, while the hands around her waist felt like a vice. Yet, the physical pain she endured was nothing compared to the ache in her heart.

A gentle breeze blew, and she feIt her clothes being gradually lifted. Ella began to have sexual desire.

The surroundings were silent, so quiet that the sound of a pin drop could be heard.

Arthur's breathing grew heavier, and Ella could clearly feel him getting aroused.

"To the car!"

At the last moment, Arthur stopped his actions. He picked her up in his arms.

Ella, worried about being seen, buried her head in his chest.

Once in the car, Arthur couldn't wait to start undressing.

Soon,his solid,well-defined muscles were exposed.
Even through sunglasses, his sexy, hormone-filled body attracted her.

Ella shrank into a corner, wanting to refuse, but before she could speak,
she felt a chill as her clothes were stripped off.

Her smooth skin and full breasts were exposed to the air.

The next moment. she fell into a warm embrace, lying on top of Arthur.

Kisses fell densely on her neck. Arthur was excellent in arousing her desire,

and in no time, she surrendered.

At one point, she found herself kneeling on the seat, her hands pressed against the car door. Through the glass, she gazed at her own lustful reflection.

Her body was utterly limp, and had it not been for Arthur's steady arm around her waist, she would have collapsed long ago.

"How is it, enjoying yourself?"

His deep.hoarse voice suddenly sounded.

Reason returned. and Ella turned her head, speaking mockingly,"Do you think this is..."

Before she could finish her sentence, Arthur took off his pants, revealing his penis. He aimed it at her vagina. "I guarantee you'll have a wonderful night!"

With that, his penis thrust in, hitting deep inside her.

Feeling the impact on her body, Ella couldn't help but moan.

Her sweet voice was the best aphrodisiac for him.
He moved more vigorously, one hand gripping her waist, the other on her breast.

With the change in movements, Ella's moans grew louder.


Ella felt like a small boat, drifting with the waves.

After what felt like forever, Arthur let out a final roar, stopped his movements, and held her,panting heavily.

Ella lay in his arms, her hand naturally resting on his waist.


It was an old habit, hard to break.

Looking at the obedient person in his arms, Arthur's lips curled into a smile, and he held her tighter. "Why didn't you come to me about today's matter?"

Ella didn't respond to his question.

Arthur, dissatisfied, pinched her waist harder. "Beg me, and I'll help you!"


'Beg! What a pathetic word.'

Ella's voice was cold, "No need, I can handle it myself! Besides, even if I'm boycotted by netizens, I can still..."

"Are you sure you can handle it? You take everything to heart, including ther harsh comments."

Arthur interrupted her words, his broad hand wandering over her body.


Wherever it went, it felt like ahot iron.

Ella trembled all over, slapped his hand away, and began to dress.
After the intense sex, her clothes were wrinkled and looked terrible.
Arthur glanced at her. "Want me to arrange for someone to bring you some clothes?"

"No need!"

"Don't you have anything to say to me?"


"No!"

Her answer was crisp and clear.

Arthur raised an eyebrow, pulled her into his arms, and bit her chest hard.

Ella gasped in pain, looking at the marks on her body, full of anger. "What do you want?"

"I want to remind you at aIl times! You belong to me!"


As he finished speaking, his phone rang.

Arthur answered without hesitation.

"Where are you, Arthur? I'm playing a game and getting beaten. Can you come back and help me?"

"Okay!"

Arthur responded, hung up the phone, quickly dressed, and left.


His series of actions was smooth,without any hesitation.

Ella looked at the empty car and cursed, "Just consider it a one-night stand!"
After speaking, she saw no one around and quietly got out of the car.

After the intense exercise, her walking posture was very unnatural.

She walked carefully, afraid of seeing someone she knew, but unexpectedly ran into Leo at the corner.

Leo asked with concern, "Are you okay? You seem to be walking strangely.Did you fall?"

Ella smiled. "It's nothing, just a fall!"

"It's not safe for you to go back alone at night. I'll walk you."


"Okay!"

The night was indeed a bit scary.

Ella didn't think much and walked back with him.

In the corner, a figure appeared, took out a phone, and quickly snapped multiple photos of them.

Looking at the photos on the phone, her gaze was cold. "You slut! You should be ruined!"

The cold voice echoed in the night, particularly eerie.

On the way, Leo kept talking about his past with his girlfriend.

Listening to the sweet love story, Ella's lips curved into a smile. "You two are so sweet. I hope you stay happy forever!"

Leo laughed. "Of course, we've known each other since we were kids..."

It was clear that Leo really liked his fiancée.
When he talked about her, his smile was sincere and affectionate.


Unknowingly, they entered the hall.

Seeing the figure approaching. Ella paused.

"Damn it! Can't stay idle for a minute!"
###Chapter 45

His voice was cold and sharp. dripping with anger.


Arthur stood there, his deep eyes full of mockery.

His clenched jaw made it look like he had just caught his wife cheating.


What was his problem?

Ella was confused, exhausted, and just wanted to go back to sleep.

But as they brushed past each other, he grabbed her wrist tightly. "What do you want?"

"I want..." Arthur leaned close to her ear. "to make love to you!"

He pulled her close by the waist. "I didn't satisfy you,so you found someone else!"

"Shut up!" Her voice was cold and filled with deep humiliation.

Tears welled up in Ella's eyes.11Iyour eyes..."

Her voice cut off abruptly.

Thinking about their current relationship, she felt so aggrieved that she wanted to hit him. "What I wish to do and whom I choose to be with are none of your business!"

"You're really not picky, are you? To have chosen such a man!" Arthur's contemptuous gaze fell on Leo, full of disdain.

"You!" Ella was trembling with anger.

"Alright, tonight..."

To stop him from saying something worse. Ella stepped forward and covered his mouth. looking at Leo. "We have some work matters to discuss.so...”

"Alright. you two talk!"

At this point. even a fool would understand that their relationship was not ordinary.

Though Leo was a small character. his mind worked quickly,and he ran off immediately.

Ella questioned. "What do you really want?"


"Why didn't you wait for me in the car?"

"How ridiculous, why should I wait for you?"

Just because he played games all night, did she have to wait in the car all night? The thought was laughable.
Ella forcefully broke free from his arm. "Be careful, someone might seeus!′′

"Areyou≅cared?n

"Yes, I'm very scared!"

She was scared of being kicked out of the show by Ava


Ella rolled her eyes impatiently.

"Stay away from all men! Or Ill take off your glasses and mak."


"Got it!"
Seeing someone approaching. Ella ran directly to the stairs.


"You really won't beg me for help!"

"No!" she said, her voice crisp and resolute.

Arthur watched her fleeing back, squinting his eyes, his expression dark and unclear.

Returning to the room with red marks all over her body, Ella hadn't spoken yet when Lily rushed over and hugged her.

"Look there, we're in the clear! The director's team issued a statement saying it was a misunderstanding."

"What?"

Ella's eyes lit up. and she quickly grabbed the phone.

Sure enough, the director's team had issued a statement.

Although they didn't release the original video, they stated that the video circulating onlne had been edited.

At the same time, several team members came forward to clarify that it was a misunderstanding.

Her worries eased, she lay on the bed with a relaxed face."We can record normally tomorrow!"

"Yes! The director's team is so nice! I guess it was Alan's call that worked!"


"Really?" Ella was skeptical.

"Otherwise, it wouldn't be that scumbag! The scumbag would do anything

for Ava, even delete the show's video!"

In Lily's eyes. Arthur was already a complete scumbag. She didn't even call him by name anymore.

Ella nodded. "Yes, he's only busy caring about Ava, how would he have the time to care about other things!"

After a few days in the show, he completely ignored her and never called her, despite being her husband. Ella's heart was already riddled with wounds.

"By the way, Alan said Arthur took his phone. Here's Alan's new contact info, you should save it too!"

"Okay!"

Ella pulled out her phone to save the number.

While scrolling through her phone, Lily noticed Ella's chat history and her eyes lit up.

"Isn't it funny? You and Arthur barely texted before, but now, with Arthur holding Alan's phone, you two are in contact more!"

It was ironic.

Married for years, she and Arthur had barely spoken.

But since joining the show, with Alan's phone in Arthur's hands,they had been in contact more.

Looking at thenote on her phone, Ella hesitated but didn't change it.

Lily raised an eyebrow. "Maybe you shouldn't get divorced. Let Ava
always be the mistress, and when you're in a bad mood, you can beat her up."

"Forget it!"

Ella tossed the phone aside. "I want a broader world!"

"Whatever you do, I support you! Now that the truth is out, I'm going to post on Twitter!"

Lily opened her computer and started typing.

Not only did she clearly write about their grievances, but she also subtly mocked Ava for doing anything to become famous.

If calling her a mistress wasn't allowed, describing her as two-faced should be fine.

After finishing everything, Lily closed the computer with a smile. "The boomerang will hit her sooner or later!"

Ella gave her a deep look and didn't say much.

Ella was looking at the chat records, and so was Arthur.

He tightly held the phone he had taken from Alan,his eyes falling on their chat history.

Eight out of ten messages were from him, and Ella's responses were cold,with only a few words.

He opened his own phone and felt much better as he looked at their previous call records.

There was a knock on the door.

Before Arthur could speak, Alan rushed in.

"Tell me, did you do the online thing? Well done. It feels good to be the hero,huh?How did Ms. Worry-Free respond? Did she throw herself into your arms?"

Arthur rubbed his fingers, still lingering with Ella's scent,his thin lips curling into a smile. "What's it to you?"

"Of course! I'm happy to see you win her back!"


"Get lost!"

Arthur shot him a look.

"It's no big deal that you took my phone, but could you return it for a moment? I need to retrieve some contact information!"

"Your phone is full of friends for entertaining, are they important?"

Alan shrank his neck. "Alright, all yours! Back then, I think I heard some secret when I was drunk, but I forgot when I woke up! It was related to Ms.Worry-Free."

The drunken memory was fragmented, he racked his brain trying to recall.

Arthur slapped him on the head. "Your brain is small, think less, or you'll get dementia! Go to sleep!"

"Got it!" Alan left.

Arthur poured a glass of red wine and made a call, "Find out everything about Leo. I'll give you 10 minutes!"

Hanging up the phone, he swirled the wine glass, his eyes filled with

ruthlessness.

Soon, his assistant's call came.

Opening the computer, looking at Leo's information, his eyes turned cold.

"He has a girlfriend he's known since childhood,yet he dares to flirt with another woman!"

Thinking about the two of them chatting and laughing in the pavilion,getting closer and closer, he even felt their smiles were very glaring.

His slender fingers tapped the table, and those who knew him well recognized this as a sign that he was angry.

In her sleep. Ella suddenly sneezed, feeling a chill from her feet. She pulled the blanket tightly around herself.
###Chapter 46

Just when everyone was about to hit the sack, a post blew up on the trending searches.

#Ms. Worry-Free Dating a Hottie#

The title was a real attention-grabber, and it came with a bunch of photos.

The pics only showed Ella from the back, but you could totally tell what was going on just by her walk.

There were also a few shots of Ella and Leo from behind. Thanks to the angle, it looked like they were hugging, super close.

The next morning, Ella had just opened her eyes when her phone started blowing up.

At the same time, Lily's phone was buzzing like crazy too.

They exchanged a look, knowing something was up, and quickly answered their phones.

"What?"

They both exclaimed in surprise after hearing what was on the other end.

After hanging up, Ella quickly opened her laptop and saw the trending topic,looking speechless. "These netizens are nuts, jumping to conclusions from a few pics!"

"Ella, I swear you have a talent for making headlines out of nowhere!"

Otherwise,how could Ella be trending just two days after joining the show?
During the live broadcast, sure, with Ava's fame, but at night?


Just a few speculative photos and boom, trending?

Ella shrugged helplessly. "I can't help it!"

But she did feel a bit sorry for that intern yesterday.


What was his name again? She forgot.

But since it already happened, no point dwelling on it. Ella quickly changed her clothes. "We gotta hurry, or we'll be late!"

Hearing this, Lily got ready in record time.

When they walked back into the hall, all eyes were on them, just like yesterday.

"It's really weird, how much did you pay to get on the trending list?"


The first to throw shade was Blair.

She hadn't been in the industry long, but she was already tangled up in a bunch of scandals-almost one for every film she did. She clearly wanted to be famous.

But she had never made it to the trending list.

So,when Blair saw Ella trending again, she was both envious and jealous.


Ella glanced at her and said, "It's not hard to trend, just pay me tuition,and I'll teach you."

"How ridiculous! I'm not interested!"

Blair turned away in disgust, shifting her chair like sitting with Ella was

beneath her.

Lily pouted, "With that attitude, you'll never make it big."

"Hurry up and eat breakfast, we have a live broadcast later!"

Yesterday's live stream got messed up by Ava, so today they had to work extra hard for the ratings and their careers.

Footsteps approached.

Ella turned to see Arthur and Alan walking over.

Arthur was in a suit, looking all serious with his high nose bridge,giving off an intimidating vibe.

Beside him, Alan shrugged,shadowing Arthur like a devoted sidekick.


Ella looked away and kept eating.

Arthur stopped next to Ella, patted Lily's shoulder, and signaled her to move.

Lily didn't buddge. "What's your deal? There are plenty of chairs, why do you have to sit here?" Her disdain was clear.

Arthur's patience wore thin. "Move!"

"Why should I?" Lily met his icy stare, a bit scared but standing her ground to protect Ella.

The tension in the room skyrocketed.

Lily and Arthur were locked in a standoff,

Across from them, Ava bit her lower lip and softly said,"Arthur, sit here
with me! I have something to discuss with you!"


"Tll sit here!"

Arthur's cold gaze stayed on Lily.

After a moment, seeing she still didn't move, he grabbed her collar and yanked her aside.

"What the hell? Why are you using force?"

Lily struggled, but with her limited strength,she was still pulled aside.

She wanted to fight back, but Arthuir quickly sat down, picked up a knife and fork, and coldly said, "I want fried eggs tomorrow!"

Hearing his words, Ella shuddered, then continued eating breakfast like nothing happened.

Across from her. Ava looked hurt. "I'll get up early tomorrow to buy them for you!"

Seeing Ella not respond, Arthur didn't hesitate to make demands. "Ms.Worry-Free is picky about food, she'll make breakfast herself, and make mine too!"

Ella was speechless.

Without getting her response, Arthur wasn't mad, just kept eating breakfast slowly.

His peripheral vision caught Ella's slender legs, and he felt a surge of irritation. "Women should wear longer skirts!"

'Why show off her legs? To meet her lover?
Arthur's complaint was loud enough for everyone to hear.

Ella awkwardly adjusted her skirt, while across from her, Ava gently said,"You always liked me wearing skirts like this!"

"Right!"

Arthur glanced at Ava briefly, then continued eating.

Listening to Arthur's words, Ella felt annoyed.

She sped up her eating, and just as she was about to put down her knife and fork, she suddenly felt a hand moving up from her ankle, then gradually higher.

Ella's eyes widened, looking down at Arthur's hand under her skirt,wishing she could chop it off.

'Damn it.

The hand reached her inner thigh, and she almost lost it.

She put down her utensils, grabbed Arthur's wrist, and gritted her teeth."What are you doing?"

"It's not what I want to do but my..."

Arthur's gaze fell on his crotch.

Ella tensed up when she saw it."Don't push it!"

"Then let's go somewhere else! I helped you a lot last night,you should reward me! Shouldn't you?"

"How did you help me?"
Ella was confused, and in that moment, the hand touched her again.


She bit her lower lip hard to avoid making a sound.

"You're so ungrateful, huh? Whatever. But you have to help me with this!"

Taking advantage of the blind spot, Arthur grabbed her soft hand and placed it on his crotch.

Feeling the constant swelling and heat.

Ella blushed, thankful for her sunglasses and mask; without them, she would have died of embarrassment.

"I'll wait for you in the studio!"

Arthur got up and left.

Watching his back, Ella gritted her teeth. "What a jerk." She never expected Arthur to mess around with other women; her heart felt heavy.like it was stuffed with cotton.
###Chapter 47

A guy's sexual drive was off the charts in the morning.

Arthur was chilling by the big window, lighting up a cigarette.

Through the haze of smoke, his good-looking face was full of desire,his eyes darting to the door now and then.

He glanced down at his growing erection, feeling a wave of frustration.


"Is she too scared to show up?"

Just as he was about to text her to hurry up, the door creaked open.


"You're late!"

He flicked the cigarette to the floor, stomped it out, and in a few quick steps,had Ella in his arms.

His hands moved expertly, unbuttoning her shirt before biting down on her breast.

"Are you a dog?"

"Don't want me to bite? Fine, I'll kiss you instead!"

Arthur whispered in her ear, nibbling on her earlobe as if to punish her.

Ella felt a surge of anger, wishing she could rip off her mask and sunglasses to reveal she was his most hated wife.

Lost in thought, she barely noticed Arthur's hand roaming over her chest.

Soon,he had her aroused.
His kisses rained down, making her body go limp, letting Arthur do whatever he wanted.

His hands traveled from her chest down to her pussy.

He unbuckled his belt, revealing his erection, and placed Ella on the desk,thrusting into her.

With each thrust, his other hand pressed hard on her chest.

She felt filled, her vagina stretching, her body enduring wave after wave until she climaxed.

Ella felt like a small boat, tossed by the wind.

After what felt like forever, Arthur's movements slowed, ending with one final thrust.

Ella couldn't help but moan, her voice breaking with a hint of tears.

She clung to Arthur, resting her head on his chest, and bit him hard in revenge.

Even through the mask, she bit down, leaving clear teeth marks on his chest.

Arthur held her, breathing heavily, feeling the pain but staying silent.


They held each other tightly for a while.

Eventually, Arthur pushed her away and quickly got dressed.

In just a few minutes, the wild, unrestrained man had transformed back into the commanding CEO, noble and arrogant.

"Use and discard, that's your style, right?"

Ella's voice was hoarse, dripping with sarcasm.

Arthur paused, then said thoughtfully, "Your voice sounds a bit like my wife's."

Ella was shocked he might recognize her.

She lowered her voice on purpose, "After sleeping with a guy,everyone's voice gets a bit hoarse!"

"Is that so?" Arthur looked up.

After their intense sex, Ella's clothes were a mess, her skin exposed.

Seeing her nipples, his throattightened.

Even though he had just finished, his erection hadn't gone down, and his desire was still burning.

He strode over, pulling Ella into his arms, pressing his face against her breasts.

"Ill make you come in a whole new way!"


His words were firm.

Ella, caught off guard, let out a moan.

Her sultry voice was like an open invitation. Arthur's hand was on her round butt, the other on her chest.

Meanwhile, he kept licking her chest, occasionally biting down.

Half an hour later, Ella was completely spent, lying on the desk, unable to

move.

"Tll help you get dressed!"

Arthur,now fully dressed, quickly picked Ella up and carefully helped her put on her clothes.

Seeing her weak state, Arthur pondered. "Your stamina is terrible, you need to work out!"

"None of your business!"

Ella stubbornly turned her face away.

"Such a temper, just like my wife!"


That line again.

Ella shrank back. "You promised me, as long as I pleased you,you wouldn't take off my hat and mask."

"Don't worry, I'll keep my promise!"

Arthur said, his hand grabbing her chest, "I'll be waiting for you tonight!"


"What?"

Ella was shocked, ready to refuse, but Arthur had already walkedl out.

In the empty studio, Ella panted heavily, walking to the mirror. She removed her sunglasses and mask, thinking about what had just happened.Her face flushed, her eyes still filled with lingering desire.

Married for years, they barely communicated, but they were incredibly compatible in bed.
And Arthur had a strong libido; every time they made love, it lasted forever.

Since coming to the show, she hadn't received any messages from Arthur.

She took out her phone, looking at the chat history between her and Arthur.

That jerk.'

Coming to the show, he had a lover to sleep with and a woman to secretly admire,yet he didn't even ask about his wife.

Thinking of Sofia at home. Ella seized the opportunity before the live broadcast started and dialed her number.

The call connected, Ella's voice excited, "Grandma, how have you been these days, do you miss me?"

"How are you, have you been wronged?"

Sofia's voice was choked with sobs as she spoke.

Although she tried hardI to endure, Ella still heard it. "Grandma, what's wrong? Have you been wronged? Or is the maid at home not good?Whatever it is, you have to tell me, or I'll come back now!"

"I'm fine, but I'm sorry for you. How can they scold you like this!"

After chatting for a while, Ella found out that Sofia knew she was participating in this show and had been watching the live broadcast on the computer.

Unexpectedly, just as the live broadcast started, it was stopped because of trending topics.
Sofia, being old, didn't know how to use the computer, but she asked the maid to help her.

Seeing the nasty comments from netizens about Ella, Sofia felt really sad for her.

Ella's tears kept falling. "Grandma, don't worry, thematter has been resolved."

"But what about you and that man?"

It was great that Sofia could go online, but it was bad when she saw the gossip about Ella.

Ella spoke gently, "Grandma, don't worry, it's a small matter, all misunderstandings, the show is deliberately hyping it up."

The two engaged in conversation for a while longer.

After hanging up the phone, Ella made sure her clothes were in order and walked to the hall.

The moment Ella appeared, she noticed a venomous gaze from Ava.

Thinking of the next few days when everyone would have to work together,Ella felt a headache and walked quickly to Lily.
###Chapter 48

"What's up?"

Lily caught a whiff of smoke on Ella and knew something was off. She gave Ella a hard look.

Ella leaned in and whispered what had just gone down.


"What!" Lily practically shouted.

Noticing everyone staring. Lily waved them off. "Mind your own business,everyone!"


The crowd dispersed.

Lily could barely contain her excitement. "You know, this might actually be a good thing. If you can handle him in bed, that's a talent too!"

She grabbed Ella's hand. "Show him your charm. Don't let him get the upper hand! If you end up divorced, you could get more money or at least some perks!"

Thinking about the billions Arthur had thrown into the show, she fumed."How dare he throw billions at a mistress? You better get your share, strike while the iron's hot!"

Ella knew Lily meant well, but she shook her head. "I don't need that, I can make my own money! We'll play with men later!"

"Men?"

A cold voice suddenly cut in.

Ella froze, turning to see an awkward sight.
She was sitting, and Arthur was standing, so her face was right in front of his crotch.

One look and Ella knew it was Arthur.

She slowly looked up, guilt flashing in her eyes, but luckily she had on sunglasses.

Just as she was about to look away, Arthur grabbed her chin, bending down to stare at her through the shades.

"What were you saying? Say it again."

His voice was icy.

Ella swallowed nervously, pressing her lips together, not saying a word.

Seeing this, Lily slapped his hand away. "Don't touch her! What do you think you're doing? Take your hands off her!"

"Hands off?"

Arthur mocked, thrusting his hips so his crotch bumped Ella's forehead.


Feeling the heat, Ella quickly pulled back.

But Arthur grabbed the back of her head, pressing. "What's this about playing with men?"

"You heard it!"

Ella,fed up with his questioning and the recent humiliation, snapped. She pushed his hand away and spat, "What's wrong with playing with men?You can have a mistress, but I can't have men?"
Arthur sneered, a cold aura around him. "You've got guts!"

He stepped closer, about to say more when Ava, in high heels, ran over and grabbed his arm. "Arthur, what are you doing?"

"Nothing!"

Arthur glanced at Ella with a knowing look, then grabbed Lily's clothes and dragged her away, sitting next to Ella.

Their bodies were pressed together, and even through the layers of fabric,the heat was palpable.

Ella shifted uncomfortably.

As soon as she created some space. Arthur closed the gap again.

By now, everyone was watching, and even a fool could see something was up between them.

Ava stood off to the side, her face darkening as she noticed the subtle glances around. She gritted her teeth in anger but forced a smile and returned to her seat, trying to maintain her composure.

The director hurried over, holding a megaphone and beaming with happiness. "Hey everyone, welcome to our live show! We're kicking things off now. We have cleared up any misunderstandings from yesterday, and now we want to apologize to Ms. Worry-Free officially."

He walked up to Ella and gave her a deep and sincere bow.

This action set off a storm of comments.

[Why apologize? Ms. Worry-Free is just a troublemaker, always bullying Ava or seducing men. Last night she got close to a guy who's engaged!]
[Engaged? What a terrible person! Get her off the show!]

[What kind of pull does she have to make the show bow down? We need to unite and kick her out!]

The comments were soon filled with anger.

Lily sat in the corner, hands on her hips. "These people are too much!"

The director,sweating bullets, carefully watched Arthur's expression.Seeing he wasn't angry, he quietly sighed in relief. "AIright, the apology is over,let's continue..."

He pulled out cue cards to explain today's task.

Ella listened closely, but Arthur suddenly leaned in, his breath hot on her neck. "Need my help? I can help you win."

Ella stiffened,glaring at him. "No, just mind your own business!"


"Okay!"

Arthur obediently stopped talking and pulled out his laptop to work.

'What a weirdo, he has his own office but comes here to work.'


Ella shot him a look and focused on the rules.

Yesterday's task was about measuring and sketching; today was about cutting.

As soon as the director finished, Ella eagerly got up and headed to the studio.

Lily followed closely, and Ava, who was last. looked at Arthur working

intently.

She bit her lip, unwilling. "Arthur, everyone is suspecting something between you and Ms. Worry-Free..."

"That's right!" Arthur responded lightly, then picked up his laptop and left.

Watching his cold back, Ava's face turned red with anger. "No way, I won't let anyone take you away. You're mine!"

In her fury, her face twisted slightly. "Bitch, I'll definitely kick you out!"


Just entering the studio. Ella sneezed.

Lily screamed. "How wild was your sex? The desk has moved!"

Ella blushed. "Sorry, if you're uncomfortable, we can ask for a different desk!"

"It's fine. you're the one using this desk anyway!"

Lily wanted to say more, but the live broadcast had started.


And today, there was a famíliar face in the studio.


It was Leo.

Seeing him again. Leo waved enthusiastically."Itraded places with a classmate to learn from this director!"

"Young people eager to learn is a good thing, happy cooperation!"


Ella extended her hand.

In front of the camera, their hands clasped together.

The audience buzzed with comments.

(We came to this live stream for Ava. but look what we got. How shameless, she's even shaking hands with a guy who's engaged!!
###Chapter 49
[What are you jealous of? I know you like Ava, but you shouldn't badmouth others. It's just a handshake!]

[Yeah. Ava's fans are all clueless. It's just a handshake, a basic courtesy.I have no idea what nonsense you're talking about!]

Where there were people, there was always drama.

Ava's fans were fiercely defending her, spitting venom with every word.

Ms. Worry-Free's fan base, though small, was scrappy and ready to brawl.

Seeing some fans' dumb comments, they didn't hold back and clapped back hard.


The debate was on.

Ella hadn't even started her work yet, and seeing the comments, she was already feeling overwhelmed.

She was here for a fashion competition, not a brawl, and the fans' behavior would reflect on her.

Ella cleared her throat and waved at the camera. "Hey everyone, I'm Ms.Worry-Free. As a designer, my only goal is to create clothes that everyone loves. Today, I'm gonna show you how to cut fabric."

She pulled out the prepped fabric and showed it to everyone.

"Honestly, tailoring is pretty simple; our grandparents' generation could even do it. First..."

Whether anyone was listening or not, Ella's voice was calm and patient as

she explained the cutting process detailedly.

She spoke while her hands kept cutting.

Soon, the outline of a piece of clothing was almost done.

Lily, standing beside her, kept giving her a thumbs up,showing her appreciation, and handed tools to Ella.

The two worked in perfect sync, creating a realy warm vibe.

The netizens. who were initially arguing,unknowingly stopped and started listening to Ella's explanation.

[Is this the charm of a top designer? Even though I'm not into cutting fabric. I'm willing to listen!]

[Yeah. especially when she talks about the origin and history of the fabric.She's so knowledgeable, a truly intellectual woman. It's a pity we can't see her face!]

[Many of Ava's dumb fans say Ms. Worry-Free is ugly, but just by listeníng to her voice, you can tell she'sdefinitely a beauty!]

Ella didn't care about the comments.

She was just completely lost in her own world.

The door opened, and Ava quietly walked in.

She had changed into a high-end outfit, thinking she would get instant praise from the netizens as soon as she appeared.

Unexpectedly,her arrival was like a drop of water in a lake, not causing any ripples.
The director's team was entirely focused on Ella, not noticing Ava at all.

Anger surged within her, and she quietly approached Ella. Seeing the praised comments only intensified her anger.

"Ms. Worry-Free, you're so fast. Didn't you finish this last night..."

Ava's voice abruptly stopped, as if she had said something wrong, covering her mouth with her hand.

Her fans finally found an opportunity to fight back,and the malicious comments instantly filled the screen.

[I knew it, how could she do it so fast? It's fake. Not only is she ugly, but she's also a cheater!]

[Get out,you disgust me!]

[Ugly woman, get out! Deceiving the audience, ban Ms.Worry-Free!]


The comments quickly scrolled and trended again.

Meanwhile, Arthur was in a video conference when he heard Alan scream beside him.

He shot a cold glance over, and Alan, covering his mouth, handed his phone to Arthur.

#Ms.Worry-Free Cheating

Arthur frowned, "The video conference is over, we'll talk another day!"


He shut down the computer, grabbed Alan's phone. "These people..."

Seeing the abusive comments, he exuded a chilling aura.
Alan chuckled. "Thinking about avenging your girl? Just send a lawyer's letter already!"

Before he could finish. Arthur gave him a light knock on the head.

Luckily, Alan was used to it anad dodged in time, so it didn't hurt. "So,what's the plan now? I'm ready to execute!"

"Mind your own business!"

Arthur turned on his computer and joined to the live stream, watching that determined figure, a smile unconsciously forming on his lips.

In the live stream, the director, knowing how to keep the viewers hooked,made sure both Ava and Ella were in the frame.

Ella. holding the cut fabric, sneered, "You think I finished this last night?"


"Of course not!"

Ava, looking guilty, faced the camera. "Everyone, don't get it twisted. The fabric from last night looks similar to this one, but it's not the same piece!"

Her explanation was even worse than saying nothing.

Lily,furious,jumped up. "Don't talk nonsense. You weren't with us,so how do youa know what happened last night!"

Ava said, "You're righat, I know nothing. Let's continue and not affect our normal work!"


Lily laughed in anger.

Clearly, Ava was the one causing trouble, leading to them being criticized by netizens, and she was still blaming them for affecting the work.
Lily rolled up her sleeves, ready to confront Ava.

Ella grabbed her wrist and shook her head. "All schemes and tricks are powerless in the face of true skill!"

She casually picked up a piece of fabric and stood in front of the camera."
I dislike being misunderstood, so I'll demonstrate it myself. Everyone,see here, this piece of fabric may be small. but it can still be tailored; I just need to adjust the scale."

To make it clear, Ella stood there, letting Lily hold the fabric.

She held scissors in one hand and a ruler in the other. "Just like before,cutting while explaining."

Half an hour later, the new piece of fabric was cut.

Ella placed the two cut pieces together, smiling. "Everyone,see,scaled down. If you don't believe it, we can have the director's team measure it."

Ella shook the two pieces of fabric, making her point clear.

The director's team looked at each other, unwilling to offend Ava.

At this moment, Leo jumped out. "I'll do it, I believe in Ms.Worry-Free!"


He took out a ruler and started measuring,recording as he went.

Ten minutes later, he showed the results to everyone. "Everyone, take a look! Ms. Worry-Free is a true design master. How extraordinary her work is!"

This statement received unanimous praise from the netizens.

Seeing the praise, Ella smiled and bowed.′′It2s my greatest honor to be recognized by everyone!"

With the misunderstanding cleared. Ella didn't dwell on it and continued her work.

After cutting, the next steps were detailing anad sewing.

The show had all the tools. Seeing the pearls, Ella came up with a good idea.

She found a gold thread, strung the pearls, and sewed them onto the neckline.

Lily, in sync with her, saw comments asking questions about Ella's action and answered directly, "Compared to diamonds, this evening gown looks even more elegant with pearl embellishments."

[Watching the live stream is rewarding, enhancing my taste!]


[Thank you for teaching me how to match1,I love it!]

Ava's fans still disagreed, but their insulting comments were quickly replaced by the praise.

For a moment, Ava was furious but helpless, and to let the netizens forget her words, she could only shrink into a corner.
###Chapter 50

Netizens were all about Ella's design, and more folks started tuning into her live stream.
Everything was smooth sailing in Ella's stream, with everyone singing her praises.

But the other two streams? Not so much.

First up was Andy. She'd studied abroad, had a solid grip on theory, and could draw like a pro, but her hands-on skills? Not so great.

Even with basic cutting, she messed up several pieces of fabric and got nowhere.

So.she had to pass the job to her assistant, Jessa.

Jessa had just peeked at Ella's live stream and saw that her cutting with explanations was getting a lot of love, so she tried to copy it.

But not everyone could do two things at once.

When Jessa talked, her hands fumbled; when she focused on cutting,her words got all jumbled. In the end, sweating bullets, she had to ditch the talking and just cut.

Andy,seeing this, forgot she was on camera and made a scary face.


Netizens saw it and freaked out.

Meanwhile,Cecilia's stream was pretty ordinary.

Cecilia had been in the game for years and was well-known. When she saw the task, she handed it all over to Tessa.
"You've worked with me forever. This should be a breeze for you! Do your best, I believe in you!"

Tessa, who graduated from a top school and was pretty skilled, tended to get nervous easily.

Usually, she could cut fabric like a pro in the studio, but in front of the camera,she kept messing up.

After ruining several pieces of fabric, Cecilia smoothly took the scissors from her. "Sorry about my assistant's nerves. I'll take it from here!"

Cecilia didn't explain anything, just got to work.

Soon enough, she had a piece of fabric cut perfectly.

Each of the three streams had its own vibe, and with some entertainment stars thrown in, they were buzzing.

The morning flew by.

During the lunch break, Ella stretched out, feeling beat.

With the cameras off, Lily let loose, "Some people just talk crap and lie.
We didn't call them out, or someone would be really embarrassed!"

If Lily and Ella had gone after Ava during the stream, it would've definitely made headlines. But they weren't that petty.

Ava, feeling left out, stood in the corner looking pissed. "What do you mean? I was just talking!"

"Besides,you should thank me for boosting your popularity!"

No sane person would say that.
"So ridiculous!" Lily rolled up her sleeves. "You screwed us over and still want us to thank you!"

"We're partners. I was helping you, believe it or not!"

Fuming,Ava stormed off.

Seeing this, Lily mocked, "Arthur has terrible taste, picking a woman like that! No good character, no good looks, no round butt, not even a full chest."

With just a few words, Lily totally trashed Ava.

Ella didn't join in on mocking Ava. "I'm heading out for some fresh air,looking for inspiration, and thinking about what flowers to embroider on the skirt hem!"

"Go ahead, I'll take care of the rest!"

They always had a clear division of labor.

Ella agreed, tidied up her clothes, and walked out of the studio.

The estate was full of beautiful spots, but Ella didn't get far from the office before she got lost in the maze of corridors.

"A house this big is more trouble than it's worth!"

She pulled out her phone and used the navigation to find her way back to the studio.

Walking with her head down, she suddenly bumped into a solid chest at the corner.

The collision made her dizzy, her legs wobbled, and she almost hit the
ground. Luckily, a strong hand caught her waist and steadied her.

"Sorry for bumping into you, and thanks for catching me!"


"No problem!"

Arthur's familiar voice made her freeze. "Why is it you?"

"My room's nearby. Thought you came to throw yourself into my arms!"


"I need to go!"

Seeing Arthur's knowing look, Ella just wanted to bolt.

But after two steps, he grabbed her wrist and pulled her into his arms.

"Come on,since you're here, how can I let you leave?"

"Let go of me, I didn't come here on purpose!"

Arthur put a finger to his lips. "Shh, someone might hear!"


"You..."

Ella tried to break free, but she wasn't strong enough. He dragged her into
his room and tossed her onto the bed.

The mattress was soft, so she wasn't hurt.

Ella got up to leave, but Arthur blocked her way, taking off his jacket.


"Why the rush? We haven't even started yet!"

"What do you want? It's still noon!"

"Of course..."
Arthur unbuttoned his shirt, revealing his sexy Adam's apple,solid chest.and well-defined abs.

Ella swallowed. "I need to go back, I have things to do!"


"No way! You're already here."

In a flash, Arthur's shirt was off, and he was shirtless.

He grabbed her hand and slowly moved it down his waist.

Ella felt the heat in her hand and tried to pull away, but she couldn't.


"How does it feel? Feels good to touch, right?"

Arthur pressed her hand down with a wicked smile, and seeing her body tremble, he placed her hand on his penis.

"Let go of me!"

"What has this hand touched today?"

Thinking of Ella shaking hands with Leo during the live stream, Arthur's face turned cold, and he pressed her hand harder against his penis,rubbing it.

"You..."

"If you touch another man again, I'll chop your hand off!"


Arthur's final warning was filled with menace.

Ella knew he was serious and had the power to do it.

Thinking of Leo, Ella patiently explained, "There's nothing between us."

"Afraid T'Il make things difficult for him?"


"No,it's true."

"I don't care what you say; I only care about what you do!"

As Arthur spoke, his large hand covered her chest, kneading it forcefully,and then he bit down hard.

The intense pain made Ella gasp, and in her anger, she slapped him hard across the face.

The sound of the slap echoed in the silent room.

Ella froze, looking at her reddened hand.

She looked up at his handsome face, where a bright red handprint was clearly visible.

Facing his deep eyes, Ella trembled. "You bit me first!"

Arthur smiled, pointing to the mark on his chest. "Are you sure? You bit me first, I was just returning the favor!"

Ella's eyes flickered. "If you're not satisfied, you can hit me back!"


"I'm a man! I can't hit a woman!"

Arthur gritted his teeth, tearing off Ella's clothes, and his thin lips pressed down her body, leaving a trail of kisses.

This time, Arthur didn't bite but kept sucking.
 
###Chapter 51

Ella went limp and collapsed onto the bed.

Her hair was all over the place, and even with sunglasses and a mask on.Arthur could picture her flushed little face.

His big hand wandered over her chest and gave it a pinch. "Remember,don't touch any other man from now on!"

"You..."

Ella slapped his hand away. "Stay away from me!"


His phone rang.

Arthur glanced at it and answered, "What's up?"

A sweet voice came through. "Arthur!"

Arthur's expression changed, and he walked to the balcony with the phone.

Ella looked at his indifferent back and sneered, "Heartless man!"

She got dressed, glanced at Arthur's back, and turned to leave.

On the balcony, Arthur was unaware she had left. On the phone, he frowned."You can buy whatever you want."

After saying that, he hung up the phone, turned back to look at the bed,and froze.

The bed was empty, and Ella had snuck awvay.

He curled his lips into a playful smile. "You think you can disobey me.

huh?"
Just as Ella walked out of the room, she got lost again and suddenly sneezed.

She touched her nose, annoyed. "Was this house designed just to make me get lost? Everything looks the same!"

In the vast estate, each corridor was adorned with different paintings, but they all looked the same.

She wandered for a long time but couldn't find the studio.

Just as she was hesitating whether to call for help, she heard a familiar voice.

Around the corner in the lounge, Ava, who had just hung up the phone with Arthur, crossed her legs and raised her chin arrogantly. "You heard what Arthur said just now, right?"

Blair, sitting on the opposite sofa, flattered her. "Of course, Mr. Smith is incredibly generous to you; he even bought a multimillion-dollar necklace for you without a second thought!"

"Of course!" Ava smiled charmingly. "As soon as he knew I came to this show, he invested billions just to make me comfortable in the crew!"

She sighed as she picked up her coffee. "Unfortunately, some woman is shameless and seduces him!"

"Don't worry, leave her to me!" Blair vowed. "I'll make sure she's ruined and never bounces back!"

Ava smiled lightly and handed over a box to Blair, "I really liked you the

moment I saw you; this is for you!"

There were limited edition earrings worth six figures in the box.

Blair accepted them with a smile. "Thanks. As for the film festival..."


Her implication was clear.

Ava nodded confidently. "Leave it to me. I receive several invitations every year anyway!"

"Alright,I'll leave first!"

Blair left with the earrings, smiling.

Ella stood in the corner watching this scene, feeling only irony.

'Who did they call shameless? Could it be her? They are so absurd.

She originally wanted to leave quietly, but suddenly her foot slipped, and she stumbled.

Her body hit the wall, making a sound.

Ava,who was about to leave, heard the noise and walked over to Ella.

As their gazes met, Ava sneered, "What are you doing? Eavesdropping on our conversation!"

"I was listening openly!" Ella stood her ground. "Besides, if you were discussing secrets, you should have found a secluded corner, not the lounge!"

"Where did you go just now?" Ava asked, catching a familiar scent.

She suddenly stepped forward, grabbed Ella's clothes, and tore them,

revealing fresh bite marks on her skin.

Ava's face turned ugly. "What's going on? You're really shameless,having sex with someone during lunch break?"

"Let go of me!" Ella pushed her away and tidied her clothes.

Then she thought of something and deliberately pointed at the exposed bite marks. "Do you know where these marks came from?"

Ava asked nervously, "What do you want to say?"

"They were bitten by a dog!" Ella stepped closer to Ava, forcing her into a corner. "And it was your favorite dog that bit me!"

Could the dog be Arthur? When he was on the phone just now, he seemed impatient, his breathing was a bit rapid, and she even carries his scent. There is something between them.'

Various thoughts intertwined in Ava's mind, making her furious.She raised her hand to hit Ella only to find Ella had already left.

"Bitch!" She stomped her foot in anger, but she did it too hard, and her shoe accidentally hit the wall.

Hearing the curses from around the corner, Ella kept walking and accidentally found her way back to the studio.

"Where did you go? Something seems off?" Lily looked at Ella,who seemed furious, and sniffed her carefully. "Oh, my god, did you two have sex again in such a short time?"

"Stop joking!" Ella lay on the sofa, exhausted. "I was just bitten by a dog!"

"Alright, don't be mad!" Lily playfully pressed Ella's body a couple of
times. "You might consider my suggestion, conquering him through sex is also a skill!"
"Please,give me a break!" Ella said, closing her eyes, planning to take a nap.

In the afternoon, the live broadcast continued.

In front of the camera, Ava was gentle, proper, and playful, interacting with the viewers through comments, while Ella and Lily were busy working.

The initial cutting was completed in the morning, and in the afternoon,they had to make the clothes.

Students who graduated in fashion design would use related tools to make clothes, Ella was no exception.

She wore sunglasses and a mask, although her vision was obstructed,her movements were swift.

In front of the camera, though her face was obscured, her graceful movements garnered acclaim from many viewers.

[You're so beautiful, even though we can't see your face, your movements are elegant!]

[It's been an hour since the broadcast started, and you've been working non-stop,amazing!]

[Ms. Worry-Free, you're great, you don't rely on looks to succeed. I asked around yesterday, and many of my friends like you!]

Seeing the viewers' praise, Ava's face stiffened, and she finally handed a
cup of coffee to Ella. "Ms. Worry-Free, how about taking a break?"

"Thank you, but no need!" It was a critical stage to make the clothes, and Ella couldn't be distracted. She calmly replied and continued working.

Ava still stood there with the coffee. "Have a sip, it's my treat!"


"No, thank you!" Ella politely replied again.

Seeing Ava standing there motionless, Lily came over. "The clothes are almost done, don't cause trouble here,go away!"
###Chapter 52
"How can you say that about me!" Ava's voice trembled as she looked hurt,her lower lip quivering and tears brimming in her eyes.

The cameraman, sensing drama, quickly zoomed in on Ava.

Forget fancy clothes; two pretty girls arguing was pure gold for the viewers.

He knew exactly what the audience wanted.

Sure enough, Ava's teary-eyed look had the viewers riled up.

[Why are they picking on Ava? She just tried to be nice by offering her a coffee!]

[Don't cry, Ava. They're just being mean!]

[Who does Ms. Worry-Free think she is? She's always too busy to care about anyone. Even if her designs are good, I wouldn't want them.]

The viewers were all on Ava's side.

Ava had a bigger fan base compared to Ella, after all.

Lily was fuming. "What are you doing? Trying to cause trouble? Get lost!"


The more she thought about it, the angrier she got. She shoved Ava. "Can you stop crying every day? You're bringing us bad luck!"

"Don't push..."

Before Ava could finish, she stumbled forward, spilling the coffee she was holding.

A sharp scream echoed.

Ava hit the ground hard, tears streaming down her face.


Lily glanced at her, then turned to Ella.


"What do we do now?"

They had to finish the clothes and get them on the model today,according to the rules.

But Ava had spilled coffee all over the unfinished clothes.

The fabric was special; once wet, it wrinkled and couldn't be fixed.


Remaking it wasn't an option; there wasn't enough time.

Lily was frantic. "Ava is such a pain!"

Ella panicked for a second but quickly regained her composure. "Alright,don't worry, I've got this."

She glared at the camera aimed at Ava, feeling a surge of anger.

But now wasn't the time for that; the priority was finishing the clothes.

Without wasting a second, she dashed out of the studio and returned with a hairdryerto dry the fabric.

Ava watched her every move.

She slowly got up and bowed deeply to the camera. "I'm so sorry for messing up again. I even spilled coffee on the clothes! What are we going to do? It's all my fault."

Ava looked pitiful, her tears making her even more heart-wrenching.
As soon as she spoke, the viewers rushed to comfort her.

The cameraman, hearing her words, quickly shifted the focus to Ella and Lily,who were frantically drying the fabric.

They were too busy to notice anything else.

The cameraman wanted some dramatic footage, but there wasn't any, so he turned the camera back to Ava.

Seeing the comforting comments, Ava smiled through her tears. "Thank you all for your concern. I'm just a bit hurt from the fall. We're a team,and we have to face the problem together!"
She wiped her tears, her eyes filled with determination. "No matter what, I will help our team win!"

[Ava is amazing, she fell and got hurt but still wants to help. So kind!]

[She was just crying, and now she's thinking about helping. Ava is amazing!]

Amid the praise. Ava walked up to Ella.

"I'm sorry, it was all my fault..."

"Stop pretending. You know I didn't push you that hard. You fell on purpose and now you're acting. Get lost."

Usually, Lily was very tactful. But every time she faced Ava, she lost her cool.

She hadn't pushed hard, but Ava fell anyway.

She was angry about that, and even though she knew it was inappropriate
to say these things in front of the camera, she couldn't help it.

Ella shook her head, gently comforting, "Alright, no matter what the problem is, we can find a solution!"

"You're too kind, that's why people bully you!"

They pulled the fabric and used the hairdryer to dry it.

Ava stood aside like a child who had done something wrong, looking uneasy.

The studio was divided into two camps.

Lily and Ella were busy, while Ava seemed isolated.


Seeing this, the viewers were upset.

Many criticized Ella and Lily for workplace bullying, demanding an apology.

Ella was unaware of their comments, worried about what to do next.

The fabric was ruined. Even if dried, it couldn't be used as designed and needed changes.

Soon, the fabric was dry. Ella looked at the design draft, deep in thought.


The live room was filled with angry comments.

Lily,tired and sore, saw the harsh comments and was furious.

She glared at Ava.

Ava, like a scared child, shivered and hid in a corner.
After several deep breaths, Lily suppressed her anger and spat out through clenched teeth, "Ava, you're really something!"

At that moment, the assistant director walked in.

He politely looked at the camera. "Everyone is about to finish. The live stream will pause briefly to showcase the models wearing the clothing.Please stay tuned, see you in half an hour!"

The live stream was cut off.

Ella looked up at the director, then continued working.

The director had seen everything that happened in the live stream.

Seeing the ruined fabric, he sighed. "Ms. Worry-Free, don't worry. This is just the first live stream, no eliminations!"

In other words, even if they failed, it didn't matter, just a loss of reputation.

Hearing the director's comfort, Ella smiled. "As a designer, I have imagination and creativity. I can handle it. Trust me!"

"Good, you're truly the most promising designer. We look forward to your performance!"

The director, seeing Ella calm, patted her shoulder in appreciation and left.


With the live stream over, there were no outsiders.

Leo, worried, came over."Are you okay? Luckily, there's no elimination this time. Even if the final product is a bit off, no one will mind!"

"That's not the same!" Lily glared at Ava. "We're here to boost our reputation and career, unlike her,just to win fans!"
Reputation was crucial for designers.

Ms.Worry-Free hadn't designed many clothes, but each one was famous.

Having such an incident in the first show, she would definitely be criticized.

The more she thought about it, the angrier she got. Lily slammed her fist

on the table. "I want to strangle her!"
###Chapter 53

Ava wasn't scared at all without the live camera rolling.

She sat there, legs crossed. "You talking about me? Go ahead, I kinda wanna know what it's like to get beat up."

"You sure?" Lily stepped closer, grabbing Ava's shirt.

"Yeah, hit me, right in the face if you want." Ava didn't flinch, even sticking her face out. "Do it however you like."

"If I hit you, you'll just say I'm bullying you at work! I'm not falling for that!"

Lily calmed down, looking at Ava with disdain. "You only know these dirty tricks. Watch out! Keep walking in the dark, and you'll run into trouble eventually!"

Ella was totally unfazed by the commotion around her.

She pulled out an iron and created wrinklesin the wet fabric.

Everyone watched in surprise as she grabbed some watercolor pens and started drawing.

"Ms.Worry-Free,you're amazing!"

With just a few strokes, she created a lifelike painting.

Leo couldn't help but give a thumbs up. "Ms. Worry-Free,you're incredible; you're my idol from now on!"

Hearing his open praise, Ava pouted. "Stop pretending. I'm heading out.See you when the show starts!"
As Ava left, the air felt a bit fresher.

Lily, knowing Ella's skills, walked over to compliment her.


"You're as good as ever, your skills haven't slipped!"

"Quit teasing! Hurry up and sew! We've only got 10 minutes left!"


"Okay!"

The designers got back to work, focused and intense.

Meanwhile, the bored models wandered into the hall.

Everyone started chatting, and when they heard Ella's fabric got soaked in coffee,they were concerned.

"Ava, did Ms. Worry-Free do it out of jealousy, not wanting you to look good?"

"Yeah, you're too nice. A friend of mine saw someone push you on the live stream. If it were me, I'd push back right away!"

"That's workplace bullying. If you're not happy,fight back!"

Surrounded by comforting words, Ava's eyes got a bit teary. "It's okay. I'm used to it. They've known each other for years, I'm just an outsider!"

The director was setting up the live video and noticed them talking. He smirked.

Anyone who didn't know better would think Ava was being bullied. She was a great actress.

She was the one doing the bullying, yet she acted like the victim.
The director shot Ava an annoyed look.

The assistant director chuckled, "Who should we help? Which one does Mr.Smith prefer?"
The show was a fashion competition with celebrities to boost the buzz.


With sponsors involved, they had to take care of the people the sponsors supported.
However, after a few days, they still weren't sure whether to help Ava or Ella.

The director knocked on his head. "Stop talking nonsense, get to work!"


"Got it!"

Time flew by, and it was time to go live again.

The director spoke to the viewers through a megaphone. "Hey everyone,after a busy day, the clothes are almost ready. Now it's time to show off the results. Let's start the countdown, and the three models will come out together. Let's welcome Ava, Blair, and Brynn!"

After the director finished talking, the curtain in the middle of the stage opened, and the models strutted out.

[These three beauties are stunning!]

[Blair's dress is gorgeous, and Brynn's skirt is so unique.But Ava's...l]

[Am I seeing things? Wasn't that fabric ruined? What's going on now?There's a painting on the dress!l

|The painting looks so real! Did Ms. Worry-Free paint this? It's amazing!l
Everyone thought Ella's fabric was ruined and her dress would be a disaster.

No one expected Ella to paint directly on the dress.

Now all eyes were on that painting.

On stage, the three models could see the comments clearly.

Seeing all the viewers' attention on Ava, Blair and Brynn's faces turned sour,but they kept their professional smiles.

As for Ava, the main character, her smile was a bit forced.

She thought she'd wear a ruined dress and act pitiful to gain viewers'sympathy.

Unexpectedly,despite the fabric being ruined, the dress was still loved by viewers.

She looked down at her dress, gritting her teeth in frustration.

After the models showcased the dresses, it was time for the designers to explain their works on stage.

First up was Cecilia, then Andy, and finally Ella.

The first two were humorous, making the viewers laugh while explaining their design concepts.

When Ella took the stage, she held the microphone and smiled."As everyone knows, there was an accident with my dress today. Actually, this design is a failure because the final product doesn't match the design!"

She bowed deeply to the camera.
Chaptel
"Although this dress is liked by everyone, it's not perfect to me because I think Ms. Davis might not like it!"

"No!"
Ava's face changed, and she quickly waved her hand. "I like it very much!The painting is so beautiful!"

As soon as she spoke, she realized her mistake.


Next was the scoring session.

She originally planned to give a low score because the dress didn't match the design.

But now that she had praised it, how could she deliberately give a low score?

Damn, I fell for it.'

Ella achieved her goal and smiled slightly."I'm glad you like it."

"Next. I'll explain the design concept of this dress..." Ella was humorous and used simple words, including some internet slang, making even many staff members laugh.

The audience applauded thunderously.

Ella bowed to express her gratitude and then stepped off the stage.

Lily hugged her excitedly. "Good job,you're getting better and better!"

"Thanks for the compliment!"

"I bet Ava is furious now, wanting to give us a lowv score,but no chance!"
They high-fived and couldn't help but laugh.


Next was the scoring session.

Ava was forced to give a perfect score.

The first episode of the fashion competition officially ended, and under the deliberate arrangement of the production team, the three tied.

Ella wasn't surprised by this result.

Lily was unhappy. "Our dress clearly had more design sense!"

"Alright, they're all seniors! Let's go back and prepare for the second episode! Starting from the second episode, there will be rankings and scores,and from the third episode, there will be eliminations!"

"Okay, we have to work hard, and next time, we must not be grouped with Ava again!"
###Chapter 54
With the live stream over, the crowd started to break up.

Ella, looking for some inspiration, grabbed her laptop and began wandering around the estate.

It was her first time checking out the estate during the day. The scenery was stunning everywhere she looked.
Today, she felt like painting on a whim. It had been years since she last picked up a brush. She was a bit rusty, but her basic skills were still there.
Spotting the roses nearby, her eyes lit up, and she quickly ran over to snap a picture with her phone.

"These fowers are gorgeous!"

The estate owner must be loaded or something because every flower was top-notch and super valuable.

Ella was busy taking pictures with her phone.

But her good mood didn't last long.

A sweet voice reached her ears, and Ella looked over, suddenly wishing she could never see what she saw.

Not far away, in the gazebo.

Ava was wearing a cool spaghetti-strap dress, showing off a lot of skin on her back.

She gently tugged on Arthur's arm and pouted, "I'm having a bad day.Someone even pushed me down. You have to get back at them for me!"
"What do you want to do?" Arthur's voice was cold, showing no emotion.

Ava felt a bit nervous for some reason. "I don't mean anything else, juIst that they should apologize for bullying me!"

"I thought you would kick her out of the show."

"How could I? Lily is usually arrogant, but she's not a bad person!"


"Alright. I'll make her apologize to you."


"I knew you were the best!"

Ava said as she tried to throw herself into Arthur's armns.

Arthur's eyes flashed, and he sidestepped slightly. "Alright,go back quickly. You're wearing too little; be careful not to get sick!"

"No! I want to stay with you!"

"Be good!"

Arthur affectionately ruffled her hair. "I stilI have work at the company.You go back first!"

"Okay!"

Ava reluctantly turned and left, looking back every few steps.

Watching her disappear from sight, Arthur curled his lips and said in a cold voice, "How does it feel to eavesdrop?"

His icy voice carried a hint of mockery.

From the corner, Ella slowly walked out, looking displeased. "I wasn't eavesdropping; you disturbed me!"
She pointed to the direction where Ava left.

Arthur smiled faintly and walked towards her. "What do you think about the apology?"

"Does my opinion matter?"

Ava was too important to him to be bullied by anyone-not even his legal wife Ella, let alone Lily.

Knowing it was useless to argue, Ella spoke coldly, "Go ahead, what are your conditions? I won't make Lily apologize."

"Really?"

As he spoke. Arthur took a big step forward and hooked her chin. "That depends on your skills!"

Ella stood there,stunned.

"Please me?"

Arthur's deep, husky voice sounded in her ear.

Ella blushed, wishing she could find a holeto crawl into.

She hurriedly looked around. "Don't do anything rash."


"We can go somewhere else."

"I..."

Before she could refuse, Ella was lifted off the ground. "What are you doing?"


"Guess!"
She struggled to break free from his arms. "Let me go!"

"If you struggle again, I'll have sex with you right here!"

Hearing this, Ella immediately covered her mouth.

Arthur walked quickly, opened the car door, and threwher inside.

Ella was thrown to the leather seat, and just as she was about to getup,

Arthur pressed down heavily on her.

Their breaths mingled, bodies pressed tightly together.

Ella's heart raced with nerves, and she kept swallowing. "What do you want?"


"You know."

Arthur's hand brushed Ella's cheek, finally resting on her chest.

Her clothes were torn open, revealing smooth skin.

Seeing the fresh bite marks, his throat tightened, and he kissed her gently.

As his hot lips touched her skin, Ella trembled all over, her body going soft. Feeling the changes within her, she was mortified.

Their bodies pressed tightly together. After a kiss, he sat up straight and even adjusted his clothes.

"If you don't want Lily to apologize, fine,please me."

Hearing this, Ella was furious, glaring at Arthur. "Lily is stubborn. She'd rather drop out of the show than apologize,right?"

Ella thought, 'What a blatant threat!' Ella's chest heaved violently,

extremely alluring.

"You only get one chance!"

"Fine, you'd better keep your word!"

Having been friends with Lily for years, Ellaknew her well.

Lily might apologize for her career or money, but never to Ava.

Ella took a deep breath and then ran her fingers over Arthur's firm chest.


Even through his clothes, she could feel the heat of his skin.

Her slender fingers drew a circle on his chest as she realized Arthur's body subtly changed.

Men were often driven by their baser instincts.

A deep sense of humiliation surged in her heart, and in an instant,she changed her mind. After years of marriage, she knew his body well.
Knowing Arthur's sensitive spots, she slowly unbuttoned his shirt, her gaze traveling downward.

She admired his sexy Adam's apple, firm chest muscles, and well-defined abs. As her gaze traveled further, she noticed his arousal.

Her hand brushed Arthur's cheek, then covered his eyes with the other.


"Close your eyes and enjoy!"

"Alright!"

Arthur smiled and obediently closed his eyes.
His long eyelashes brushed against her palm, making Ella's heart tremble.


She moved her mask up, revealing her red lips.

She kissed his Addam's apple and moved downward, her kisses trailing over his chest and abs. She stuck out her tongue and lightly licked his dick through his trousers.
Arthur's body stiffened, muscles tensed, and his long fingers clenched into fists,veins bulging.

It was clear he was trying hard to endure his desire.

Ella smiled and leaned close to his ear, her breath hot on his sensitive ear."Satisfied?"

Her coquettish voice was an invisible seduction, like an invitation.


It completely ignited Arthur's suppressed desire.

His throat tightened, his breathing grew heavier, and he grabbed Ella's waist. "Very satisfied, what's next?"

Though his eyes were covered, it didn't affect his actions.

His long fingers quickly unbuckled his belt, revealing his dick.


"Next,enjoy!"

Ella stuck out her tongue and lightly licked his Adam's apple.

The sound of clothes tearing was heard.

Feeling a chill below, Arthur's bodytensed,and he forcefully pinched her slender waist. "You're torturing me on purpose!"
"How could I? This is foreplay! Didn't you ask me to please you? Enjoy!"As she spoke, the sound of clothes tearing echoed once more.

With his eyes closed, the sensation was even clearer.

Arthur could clearly feel his clothes being torn apart.


"Isn't it time to get into it?"

###Chapter 55

The car was getting hotter by the minute.


Things were getting steamy.

Arthur's heavy breathing mixed with Ella's playful moans.

His desire was growing, his dick like a wild animal ready to break free.


"Alright!"

Ella's slender fingers wrapped around his dick, her red lips pressed against his chest.

Arthur closed his eyes, savoring the moment, thinking they were about to get it on.

But then, he heard the car door open.

Ella's mocking voice cut through the air, "You scumbag,how dare you threaten me!"

Arthur opened his eyes to see Ella standing by the car door, holding something and waving it around.

It was his clothes. He looked down and realized he was completely naked.

His face darkened, and he squinted. He didn't move, but his presence was intimidating.

Ella looked at Arthur, then at his dick, and sneered, "Still want Lily to apologize to Ava? Call Ava and say Lily doesn't need to apologize, or else...
11

Her threat was crystal clear.
Arthur's lips curled into a cold smile. "You think you can threaten me?I hate being threatened."

"Really? Do you want to streak?"

Ella laughed and waved his clothes.


"Damn!"

Arthur glanced at her and instinctively reached for his phone, only to realize she had taken it too.

"You have no choice now! I'll dial Ava's number, and you talk."

Without giving Arthur a chance to refuse, Ella dialed the number.

The call connected, and seeing Ava's name on the screen, Ella's lips curled with coldness.

Ava's sweet voice came through. "Arthur, what's up? Miss me?"


Ella shivered,feeling uncomfortable.

She held the phone near Arthur, keeping it just out of his reach.


Arthur spoke coldly, "Nothing,go to bed early tonight."


"What's wrong? You sound strange."

"Good night! Bye,"

Ella's eyes widened in disbelief,

She waved her fist and mouthed a warning to Arthur, but he ignored her.
'Fine! You deserve it. Just wait and see.'

Ella stared into his deep eyes, realizing he still hadn't compromised. She was about to speak sweetly when Arthur's cold voice rang out.
"Don't make Lily apologize anymore, this matter ends here."

Just a moment ago, he was unyielding. Now, to keep his image with Ava,he changed his tune.
Ella's face turned cold. She threw the phone inside and turned to leave.


The night was dark.

Even though it was a hot summer, Ella felt cold all over.

She wandered aimlessly and, to her dismay, found herself lost again,which annoyed her.

She took out her phone to navigate back to her room, but unexpectedly,she saw Alan standing not far away.

Not wanting to cause trouble, she turned to leave, but he stopped her.


"Hello, Ms. Worry-Free!"

"We kind of know each other, right?Why so distant? And why do I feel you look so familiar?"

Hearing this, Ella felt nervous.

She quickly took a couple of steps back to keep her distance. "Your pick-up lines are a bit outdated, don'tyou think?"

"Really?"
Alan scratched his head. "I swear you look familiar, and your voice too."

Noticing his intense gaze, Ella immediately changed her posture, hunching her back. "You hang around women all the time, everyone looks the same to you!"

"That's not right! But..."

Alan suddenly touched his chin and circled around Ella. "I remember now!You..."


"Shut up!"

Ella was startled, she stepped forward and covered his mouth. "Curiosity killed the cat, be good and don't talk nonsense! Got it?"

Alan was startled and struggled frantically.

Ella, however, kept her hand over his mouth. "We're partners, if you dare to talk nonsense..."

"What are you two doing?" Arthur's angry voice suddenly rang out.

Ella shivered and turned around to see Arthur not far away,dressed in a suit, looking grim, his deep eyes like a cold abyss.

Ella instinctively wanted to run.

But thinking of Alan, she pressed harder and lowered her voice. "Keep your mouth shut, or the partnership is off!"

"Let go of him!"

Seeing the two whispering, Arthur took a few big steps forward,his tall figure casting a shadow over her, and grabbed her wrist, squeezing hard.
Cidp
"You are asking for trouble."
Ella felt her hand was about to be crushed by his force, struggling hard."Let go of me!"

"Come with me!"

Arthur, in a fit of rage,seized her arm like a vice.

Ella struggled desperately as she was dragged forward, but to no avail,her strength was limited.

Alan was speechless.

What is going on? What happened?'

He stood there in a daze, thinking of Arthur's murderous look just now,and immediately ran away in fear.

A breeze blew, and her hair fluttered in the wind.

Dragged all the way, Ella was thrown into the car again.

This time it was even rougher than before, her head hit the car door with a loud bang.

Just as she was about to get up. Arthur's tall body pressed down on her.his eyes staring at her. "What exactly do you want?"

"I..

She was just afraid Alan would reveal her identity.

She thought, 'Why should I explain to him?

Ella turned her face to the side in a huff. "What I do has nothing to do
chap

with you!"
Arthur laughed in anger, the veins on his forehead throbbing.

He directly grabbed Ella's chin. "Do you believe I'll take off your sunglasses and mask right now!"

"No!"
Ella instinctively wanted to cover her face, but Arthur was faster,grabbing her hands and holding them above her head.
His handsome face kept getting closer, his hot breath on her face and gradually near her ear.

Ella trembled all over, her body going soft. "What do you want? I already pleased you just now!"
"Really? Who took my clothes just now? I've changed my mind,let's play a different game!"

His thin lipspressed against her, lightly biting the edge of her mask.


"What do you think if I tear off the mask?"

"No! Please!"

She couldn't reveal her identity, that was the only thought in her mind now.

She put on a flattering face. "This game is no fun, let's change to another way?"

"Little liar, you still want to deceive mel"
Arthur's deep, hoarse voice carried a hint of seduction.

Ella shivered all over, wanting to speak, but the mask was bitten and torn open at one corner.

###Chapter 56

'It's over!'

Ella shut he eyes, thinking her cover was blown.

They'd shared a bed for years and knew each other inside out.


Arthur's raspy voice broke the silence.


"Your lips look familiar!"

Ella's anxiety finally eased.

She opened her eyes, a smirk playing on her lips. "All women's lips look similar!"

"Really? You have such a sharp tongue. Maybe your mouth needs to be taught a lesson!"

Before she could react, he swallowed her words with a fierce kiss.


Their lips and tongues tangled.

Ella had no choice but to endure his aggressive kiss. He started off somewhat gently, but soon his kiss became deeper and more passionate.

The metallic taste of blood filled her senses.

As time dragged on, Ella felt the air in her lungs dwindling.

Just when she thought she'd pass out, Arthur stopped kissing her."Scared yet?"

Gasping for air, Ella looked into his deep, lustful eyes through her
sunglasses, feeling a whirlwind of emotions.


"You..."
"The punishment's just getting sarted," Arthur's cold voice whispered in her ear.

The next moment, the sound of ripping fabric filled the air.

Ella shivered as her clothes were torn to shreds and tossed aside.

Before she could react, he pulled her close, and his penis thrust into her vagina, reaching deep inside.

Moans escaped Ella's lips.

Pain shot through her as she clung to his back, her legs wrapping tightly around his waist.

Inside the car, Ella's moans and Arthur's heavy breathing mingled.

Those sounds were like fuel to the fire, making Arthur's movements even more intense. He pounded into her while his hand kneaded her breast.

As Arthur's actions grew rougher, Ella trembled, sensing his revenge. She didn't hold back, digging her nails into his flesh.

In an instant, Arthur's back was marked with scratches.

The pain didn't slow him down; it only made him more intense.

He thrust violently, over and over.

Despite the pain, Ella also felt waves of pleasure.

After what felt like forever, Arthur let out a low groan and stopped. He lay
on top of her, his hand still squeezing her breast.


Ella winced in pain, pinching his waist hard.

After a moment of mutual revenge,they finally stopped.

Afterward. Ella quickly checked her sunglasses and mask.


"Your identity secrecy is impressive!"

Thinking about their intense moment. Ella adjusted her sunglasses and mask. Arthur's voice was laced with displeasure.

"Is the punishment over? Can I go now?"

Ignoring his sour expression, Ella tried to dress herself, but was stunned to see the shredded pieces of her clothes in the car.
She grabbed the suit next to her and put it on. "This suit is my compensation!"

"Are you sure you want to go out wearing that?"

Arthur was tall and imposing; Ella wore his coat,which was so oversized that it reached down to her knees.

But in the dead of night, being seen like this would only cause trouble.


Ella's face flushed with anger. "Then wwhat do you suggest?"


"Beg me?"

Arthur's slender fingers tore open the suit, eyeing the clear bite marks on her chest. He couldn't resist biting again.

Ella,caught off guard,slapped his face. "Are you a dog?"
"If you don't like it, then bite back!"

Arthur, unfazed by the slap, extended his solidly muscular arm towards her mouth.

Ella retorted, "I'm not like you!"
Overwhelmed by his scent. Ella kicked him away with her leg and reached for her phone.

Just as she was about to dial, her phone rang.


It was Lily!

Ella answered without hesitation.

"Ella.guess who I just saw? Ava's here."

"Alright. don't say anymore, I need your help here..."

Before she could finish, Arthur snatched the phone away and tossed it out of the car.

Ella clenched her fist and punched his chest. "Why did you throw my phone?"

"Now,you can only beg me."

"You..."

'What a jerk.'

Seeing his teasing gaze,Ella was furious.

"I'll give you a chance for revenge. Bite me back, and I'll have someone bring you clothes!"

"Fine!"
Ella slowly approached his chest, opened her mouth,and bit down hard.


In an instant, the strong taste of blood filled her mouth.

Ella awkwardly let go, seeing the bright red blood flowing down his solid chest,finally reaching his penis.

"Feeling better?"

Arthur's restrained voice sounded above her.

Ella glanced at his clenched fist and nodded lightly. "Now we're even!"


"Remember, don't get too close to other men, or else..."

Arthur said, grabbing Ella's head and biting her slender neck.


'Is Arthur a dog?

Just as Ella was about to get angry, his threatening voice sounded in her ear.

"If I see it again, I'll leave marks all over your body!"


Oh my God.

Ella shivered all over, fear spreading in her heart.

Sensing Ella trembling in his arms, Arthur's mood improved, a smile tugging at his lips, "Scared now? Try it again, and see what happens!"

Ten minutes later.

Arthur slowly dressed and stepped out of the car.
One cigarette after another was lit. Amidst the smoke, his face still looked very handsome.
Ella's mouth twitched, and she looked at the marks on her body, wiping the sweat from her forehead.

Ella sighed inwardly. 'Who knows if Alan has been talking nonsense!

The car door opened, and a limited edition Chanel suit was thrown in.


Ella glanced at it and quickly put it on.

After getting out of the car and walking a few steps, Ella found the clothes fit perfectly.

It was a rare moment; she finally had the opportunity to wear clothes purchased by her lawful husband.

"I'll take you back!"

Ella refused. "No. I don't want to be misunderstood!"


"Alright,suit yourself!"

With that, Arthur walked away with his slender legs, disappearing into the night.

Watching his disappearing figure, Ella had a bitter smile on her lips.

Despite being a married couple, he was completely unaware that she had a terrible sense of direction.

At the same place, Ella got lost again.

Ella felt completely lost, and to make matters worse, her phone was broken.
She looked down at the shattered phone, pressing it, but it was dead.


'What to do?'
"Didn't you tell me you saw Ms. Worry-Free and Arthur come here together? Where are they?"
###Chapter 57


Ava's voice burst out.

Ella jumped,her eyes darting around before she ducked into a pavilion.


"Are you guys lying to me?"

"Ava, come on, why would we lie? A gardener saw it. If you don't believe us, we can go ask him right now!"

"Yeah, the gardener said they were all over each other! It must be Ms.Worry-Free making moves on Mr.Smith."

"Jessa, Blair, I know you mean well, but we've been searching forever and still haven't found them!"

Ava's face was a mix of frustration and hurt. "I don't know what to do. If I knew it would be like this, I wouldn't have joined this show!"

"That's not the point. It's all Ms. Worry-Free's fault, that bitch, always covered up and still trying to seduce Mr. Smith!"

"Yeah. Ava, she's always wrapped up. Who knows how ugly she might be?Tomorrow, let's find a way to show her real face and ruin her face!"

Ella listened to their scheme from behind a pillar, feeling like she was plunged into an ice bath.

Who would've thought these seemingly sweet and innocent women would actually plan to ruin her face?

Her hand slowly clenched into a fist, a cold smile spreading across her lips.

Not far away, Ava and her two minions finished their plotting and walked

off.
Ella stepped out from behind the pillar, sneering, "Let's see who outsmarts who!"
She found it ridiculous that she was Arthur's wife but had to hide from a mistress.

Even more absurd was that she had to follow them to find her way back to the room.

But it didn't matter; knowing how to endure was the hallmark of a true successor.

So. Ella trailed them back to her room.

As soon as she opened the door, she saw Lily furiously typing away at her computer.

"These netizens are insane; even kindergarteners wouldn't say such nonsense.Damn them all!"

Ella asked, puzzled, "What are you doing?"

Lily clenched her fist. "I'm arguing with netizens!"


She was clearly bored.

Ella glanced at the screen and saw the harsh insults flying, and Lily was losing the battle.

She put her arm around Lily's neck."Alright, don't waste your time on them! Let's talk about something serious!"

"What is it?"
Cnap
"Someone's trying to set me up, and I want to get back at them tomorrow!"


"It wouldn't be Ava, would it?"

Ella nodded and then recounted what she had overheard.

Lily jumped up, fuming. "These people will do anything to ingratiate themselves with Ava, even trying to ruin your face!"

She started pacing around the room.

"Damn it, anyone in the fashion industry knows that kind of dye shouldn'
t touch the skin, or it will cause an allergic reaction. They're so despicable!"


"Don't worry. We don't know who will win yet!"


"Right, we can't give in!"

Lily's eyes lit up, and she whispered something to Ella.


Just then, there was a knock on the door.

'Who would come over so late at night?'

Ella opened the door with a puzzled look, and a familiar face appeared.

"Ms. Worry-Free, Mr. Smith asked me to deliver this to you!"

The person quickly left after handing over the item.

Ella stood there, rolling her eyes.

Lily curiously ran over. "Arthur sent it?"

She took the bag from Ella's hand, opened it, and saw a phone, pouting.
"Is this the difference between true love and you? He buys jewelry and invests billions for his true love, but for you, just a lousy phone!"

"Do you have to stab me in the heart?"


"No, just kidding!"
Ella's phone had been broken by Arthur, and now he compensated her with a new one. They were even.
Ella had just inserted the SIM card when a message from an unknown number popped up.

[I want fried sausages tomorrow morning!]

Arthur really knew how to trouble Ella.

Ella angrily tossed the phone aside.

Lily laughed. "This scumbag is really something. Does he think you're his lover and maid?"

"Get out!"

"Alright, my bad. Let's hit the sack early. We have a big day tomorrow!"

Early the next morning, Ella was woken up by the alarm clock.

There was no choice; to keep her identity hidden, she had to swallow her pride and cook for him.

But she didn't expect that just as she went downstairs, she saw Arthur hurriedly leaving.

'Does it mean I don't have to cook?
Ella was hesitating whether to go back to sleep when the door was rudely kicked open.

Arthur rushed in, carrying Ava.

"Quick,get some medicine!"

His tone was commanding, just like always.

Noticing Ella standing still. Arthur looked up, his eyes deep and cold."

Hurry up, Ava twisted her ankle while running!"


"Why should I..."

Before she could finish her sentence, she met Arthur's fiery gaze and suddenly lost the will to argue. She quickly ran to the storage room on the first floor.

Ava sat on the sofa, glaring at Ella's back with an ugly expression.

"Arthur, why are you so harsh? You'll scare her! And Ms. Worry-Free isn't obligated to get me medicine!"

"Was I harsh?"

Arthur stood there,confused.

Ava nodded. "You're too disrespectful!"

Her delicate voice carried far to Ella's ears.

Ella walked over with the medicine, a sarcastic smile on her face. "Here's the medicine. I'm going back to sleep!"

As she turned to leave,her wrist was tightly grasped.

"You help her apply it!"

"Say that again?" Ella was almost laughing in anger.


'Does he really think I'm a servant?'

Was there anything more ridiculous in this world? The husband held the lover and even asked his wife to apply the medicine to the lover.

Ella stood there,trembling with anger, her chest heaving.

Arthur stood there, his voice cold. "If you don't help her,do you want me to do it?"

"Of course! Everyone knows about your relationship, there's nothing to hide! And it's early, no one's here!"

With that,Ella shook off his hand and ran.


"Come back here!"

Arthur's angry voice echoed behind her.


Ella didn't stop. running even faster.

In the blink of an eye, she had disappeared around the corner of the stairs.


Arthur clenched his fists in anger.

Ava bit her lip, looking pitiful. "What should we do? Maybe you should take me to the hospital. But if we go to the hospital, we'll miss the live broadcast. It would be such a shame!"

"I'll find someone to help!"

Under Ava's surprised gaze, Arthur made a phone call.
Within ten minutes, a staff member from the director's team. still half-asleep.came running down.

"Ava hurt her foot. Help her apply the medicine!"

Arthur's voice was cold, his whole demeanor exuding an unapproachable aura.

The staff member was startled and quickly nodded. "Got it."
###Chapter 58

"It's up to you!"
Arthur spat out those icy words and stormed off, his tall frame practically vibrating with anger.

Ava watched him go, her cheeks burning with frustration.

She'd faked twisting her ankle just to get closer to him, and now he was gone.

It was all Ms. Worry-Free's fault. If she hadn't shown up, none of this would have happened.
Back in the room. Ella was about to flop onto the bed when she suddenly sneezed.

Lily, half-asleep, peeked at the clock. "Weren't you gonna make breakfast?Why are you back?"

"I'm too mad to cook, go back to sleep!"

Ella grumbled, pulling the covers over her head and drifting off.


She'd barely gotten any rest when the alarm blared.

Thinking about today's competition, Ella and Lily quickly got ready and headed downstairs.

As soon as they got there, they saw Alan leisurely munching on breakfast.

Remembering last night, Ella plopped down next to him and whispered,"You know what to do,right?"
Alan paused mid-bite and looked at her. "You've been acting weird since last night, what are you talking about?"

Ella was at a loss for words.

"By the way,you..."

"Shut up!"

Ella quickly covered his mouth, her eyes flashing a warning.

Alan's eyes widened, feeling a sudden chill, like he was being watched by a predator.

He removed her hand. "I just thought you looked like my ex-girlfriend,why'd you cover my mouth?"

What a huge misunderstanding.

Ella awkwardly pulled her arm back. "Sorry about that! Next time,be clear with your words!"

"Did you even give me a chance to speak?"

Since last night, she hadn't let him get a word in, and when he did, she shut him up.

Alan rolled hís eyes dramatically. "And besides, I'm not into my friend's girl,stay away from me!"

Feeling the chill intensify, he grabbed his breakfast and moved to the corner of the table.

Ella was speechless again.
Before she could figure out what was going on, Arthur sat down in Alan's original spot.

Ella turned and met his cold gaze.

Their eyes locked, and Ella instinctively looked away, then casually continued eating.

"Causing trouble so early in the morning!"

Who is he mocking?

Without looking up. Ella retorted, "Is Ava's leg better?"


"She twisted her ankle."

"You remember it so clearly!"

Quickly stuffing an egg into her mouth, Ella stood up. "You guys take your time eating, I'll head to the studio first!"

"Okay!"

Lily quickly glanced at the two of them and nodded rapidly.

Then, to everyone's surprise, as soon as Ella left, Arthur leisurely got up and followed her.

With the two main characters gone, everyone's eyes turned to Ava.

Ava sat there, eating her breakfast like nothing happened, but big tears fell into her plate,looking pitiful.

Jessa,sitting next to her, was indignant. "Ava, don't be sad, we'll stand up for you."
"Alright, everyone, finish your breakfast! We have important things todo today!"

Ava looked up and forced a smile, trying to look understanding.

"Right, today's theme is couple outfits. Let Ms. Worry-Free design something nice for you and Mr. Smith!" Blair said arrogantly, "Let's show everyone how well you match!"

Lily was speechless.

'A bunch of crazy people.'

Ella walked ahead, hearing footsteps behind her, she quickened her pace and entered the studio. Just as she was about to close the door,a slender hand suddenly grabbed her wrist.

Without seeing the face, she knew who it was.

Ella impatiently tried to shake it off, but her strength was limited.

Arthur slipped through the door and cornered Ella against the wall."What do you want?"

"If you can hold her, why can't I get close to another man?"

Thinking about the scene of Arthur carrying Ava this morning, Ella was filled with anger, pushing against his chest with all her might.

"Jealous?"

Arthur whispered in her ear, his voice teasing.

His slender fingers played with her golden hair, bringing it to his nose and sniffing lightly. "Changed your shampoo?"
Ella's faint scent lingered at his nose.

His Adam's apple bobbed involuntarily, as he leaned closer to her ear."This scent is nice!"

"What does it have to do with you,move!"

Ella turned her head,clearly rejecting his touch.

Instead,he wrapped his arm around her waist, their bodies pressed tightly together, feeling each other's heartbeat and warmth through the thin fabric.

"Stay away from other men! Or else..."

Arthur's large hand lifted her skirt, his slender fingers pressing against her vagina.

The sudden touch made Ella tremble all over, her body went limp,collapsing against him.

Arthur's unique scent was intoxicating.

But thinking about the morning scene, she immediately pulled away from his embrace,leaning against the wall. "What do you want?"

"What do you think?"

Arthur's gentle fingertips lightly brushed the bite mark on her neck. "Be good."

"You..."

She wanted to curse, but just as she opened her mouth, there was a knock on the studio door.
Ella held her breath, not daring to make a sound.
Arthur chuckled softly, speaking without restraint, "Who is it?" His cold voice carried a chill.
Outside the door, Ava paused. then spoke gently, "Arthur, are you inside as well? The live broadcast is about to start. I came to get you!"

"Alright,coming!"

Arthur slowly tidied his clothes, then adjusted Ella's skirt, and without looking back, turned and walked out.
"Arthur, why are you here? We're supposed to design couple outfits today,are you here to give her your measurements?"

"Let's go! Don't keep them waiting!"

With their voices growing fainter, Ella's heart grew colder.


'Couple outfits? How ironic.'

Ella composed herself and quickly walked out.


In the hall, everyone was ready.

When Ella appeared, she noticed everyone's gazes on her,but she nonchalantly walked over to Lily and sat down.

Coincidentally, Arthur and Ava were sitting directly across from Ella, so they could see each other with a glance.

Ella, feeling restless, kept her head down, her eyes fixed on the computer.

The live broadcast began, and the director cheerfully explained the rules to

the camera.
The theme of previous days had been about designing an evening gown for the model, and today's task was to design matching evening gowns for couples.
As soon as the director finished speaking. Arthur's cold voice rang out."This isn't a dating show, it's a fashion design competition. let's just design a men's suit."
###Chapter 59

"This..."
The director was caught off guard by his words. Changed the theme? But the rules were already set.

Arthur's eyes were icy. "Is there a problem?"

"Of course not. no problem at all!"

The director forced a smile. "Alright then, we'll go with your suggestion.Today, we'll design a men's suit. As for the model..."
Arthur cut him off again, "I've worked with Ms. Worry-Free before. I'll be her model!"

[What the heck? How can he just change the rules like that?]

[Why would the Mr. Smith work with Ms. Worry-Free? He's with Ava,how can he just ditch her?]

[Poor Ava, just left like that. I feel so bad for her!]

[Ms. Worry-Free is so manipulative, acting all mysterious to lure men. She doesn't deserve to be a designer.J

The comments section was flooded with insults.

The atmosphere in thehall got a bit tense.

Arthur glanced at the comments, then looked away and pulled out his phone,doing who knows what.

The show had to go on, so the director quickly pulled himself together

and nodded. "Alright!"
Ava, standing nearby, lowered her head, gripping her sleeve tightly to hide her anger.
Ella. on the other hand, kept her head down, focused on her computer,as if none of this concerned her.

After the director went over all the rules, the competition officially began.

"Alright, today's main task is to draw the design sketches. Now, please head back to your studios, and we'll see you this afternoon!"
As soon as the director finished speaking, Ella got up, grabbed her computer,and left.
Arthur raisedan eyebrow, watching her storm off, a smirk playing on his lips.

Lily glanced between Ella and Arthur, giving him a thumbs up. "You're something else!"

'What a jerk.'

The theme this time was suits, and the female celebrity guests invited by the director's team had some free time.

Not wanting their appearance fees to go to waste, the directorassigned them a mysterious task, which would be revealed later.

In the studio, thedirector's team had already set up the equipment, and the live broadcast was rolling.
After a while of awkward silence, the assistant director cleared his throat."Ms. Worry-Free, the live broadcast has started!"
"Thanks for the heads-up!" Ella sat at her desk, looking at Arthur in front of her, frowning,clearly conflicted.

She kept an eye on the live comments and was surprised.

[Ms. Worry-Free, you are the best. I support you!]

[Ms. Worry-Free, go for it, they're just jealous. You'll win with your skills!]


There were only praises,no insults.

Where are Ava's fans? Were they kicked out of the live room?


Thinking of this, she glanced at Arthur.


Something was definitely off.

"Ms.Worry-Free, don't you need to take measurements?" Arthur sat across from her,legs crossed, with a teasing look.

Ella raised an eyebrow. "I already measured you during the game a few days ago."

"The food's been terrible these past two days; I've lost weight!"


Arthur spread his arms to her, the meaning clear.


Ella was speechless.

'How much weight can he lose in two days?"

She instinctively wanted to snap back, but Lily stepped in, handing her a measuring tape. "Come on, as designers, we need to be professional!"

"Alright!"
Ella rolled her eyes, took the measuring tape. and walked over to Arthur."Please stand up. it's hard to measure while you're sitting!"

"Alright!"
Arthur responded with a smile, standing up and stretching his arms,looking very compliant.

'He's being oddly well-behaved today.'

That thought flashed through Ella's mind.


She sneered.

Arthur was well-behaved? What a great joke!

Just as she was about to start measuring, Arthur had his back to the sofa.Ella, being petite, stood beside him, completely blocked from view.

Even if they made any small movements, it wouldn't be visible.

Ava came over, her eyes like radars, fixed on Ella. "Ms. Worry-Free,maybe I should do it. After all, it's inconvenient for you to measure Arthur.



"I'm a professional!"

Ella ignored her and started measuring.

sofa.
Ella noticed Lily's actions and couldn't help but laugh.


"Happy?" Arthur's cold voice rang out.

Ella's smile instantly vanished.′′No!′′

The first step in making clothes was to take measurements.

She held the measuring tape professionally, starting with the arms and shoulders,then the chest.

With her professional skills, she focused on her work, ensuring there was no physical contact between them.

But Ella's unique fragrance lingered at the tip of his nose.

Arthur kept swallowing, and when measuring the chest, he moved slightly,
his firm chest muscles brushing against her face, making close contact.


At that moment, the cameraman aimed his lens at them.

This scene was captured by the live audience, sparking instant discussion.


[Look,what just happened!]

[That was an indirect kiss!]

[Mr. Smith justflirted with Ms. Worry-Free, using his sexy chest muscles to seduce her!]

The audience's eyes were sharp.

Although Ella wore sunglasses and a mask, they seemed like a perfect match.
The audience had already started discussing.

Arthur glanced at the comments and gave a bright smile to the camera.


"Do you also think we make a good match?"

Arthur's deep, husky voice carried a hint of allure, and his smile to the camera instantly captured countless women's hearts.

[Yes,you must like Ms. Worry-Free,you two look perfect together!]

[Who understands our feeling, a billionaire CEO smiled at us and even spoke to us!]

The comments scrolled crazily.

All were discussing the inexplicable sweetness between the two.

'Perfect match? Are these people blind?'

Ava, holding her phone, watched the rapidly scrolling comments,gritting her teeth in anger.

Unable to see Arthur and Ella's interaction clearly, she specifically opened the live stream.

She looked up, her face twisted, thinking of the intimate contact between the two,gritting her teeth.

She quickly posted a nasty comment on her phone. But she received an error message: [Due to a system malfunction, negative comments cannot be posted!]"System malfunction, negative comments can't be posted!"

Ava suddenly thought of something, continuing to watch the live stream.and saw Arthur's bright smile, her face darkened.
What malfunction. it was clearly Arthur's doing.

She had spent millions of dollars to smear Ella online, to get her off the show.

Unexpectedly, Arthur directly used technology to block all negative comments.

Her hand slowly clenched, nails digging into her palm. Her venomous gaze felt like daggers, aimed at Ella. "You forced me!"
###Chapter 60
Comments were blowing up the screen, and everyone glued to their close interaction.

Ella had no clue, her cheeks burning under the mask, and she could totally feel Arthur's erection.
'This jerk.' Ella thought about the recent touch, clenching her fist,her face full of anger. "Just stand still and don't move!"

"Alright, today I'm a perfect model!"

Arthur chuckled and then grabbed Ella's wrist with such force it felt more like a threat.

She felt like her wrist was about to snap and almost cried out in pain.


Trying to yank it back, she slipped and fell forward heavily.


So painful.'

Ella's face smacked right into Arthur's solid chest.

As she struggled to get up, he reached out and held her waist.

Feeling the warmth from his dry palm, her heart raced and her body trembled so much that she nearly collapsed.

Luckily,he supported her waist, and she barely managed to stand up.

[OMG, so intense! Look,their bodies are pressed together!]

[Dominant CEO's possessive love. Look at his hand on her waist,how sweet!]
[Oh,sorry. I didn't stand still. I did it on purpose! Hahaha!]

Ella was super embarrassed seeing the comments go wild.

The scene of them hugging was full of impact.

Netizens were screaming for them to get together, feeling like the whole room was filled with an intense vibe, as if everyone else was just air.

"What are you two doing?" A questioning voice shattered the moment.

Ava stormed over, glaring at Ella in Arthur's arms. "Is this how you designers measure? Measuring right into Arthur's arms!"

She angrily yanked Ella's wrist, pulling her out of Arthur's arms. "This is a fashion competition, not a dating show!"

Thinking of the atmosphere when Ella and Arthur were hugging just now,she was about to explode with anger.

Lily rushed over, annoyed. "It's none of your business! Don't mess with their work."

She didn't care whether Ava was willing or not, directly pulling her back to the sofa.

Being interrupted, the intense vibe between them was gone.


Ella cleared her throat. "Let's continue!"

"When measuring my legs just now, I moved a bit, let's measure again!"


Arthur's deep, hoarse voice sounded serious.

Ella rolled her eyes and slowly squatted down to start measuring his leg

length.
His long legs were tightly wrapped in a suit; Arthur always pretended to move unintentionally during the measurement.
With Ella's soft hands rubbing against his legs, Arthur's face was tense,a hint of desire flashing in his eyes. He looked down at her as she twisted her waist, consumed by an overwhelming urge to envelop her in his arms and intimately caress her.

The burning gaze above Ella was impossible to ignore.

Ella gradually looked up, the hot breath spraying over, the pheromones from his body tightly enveloping her.

Ella held her breath, not daring to breathe, afraid that Arthur might do something intimate in public.

"Don't worry, I'm not a beast!"

Noticing her caution, Arthur spoke discontentedly.


"It's already measured!"

Ella said and returned to the desk.

The two separating disappointed the viewers in the live stream.

Arthur glanced at the comments, dissatisfied, and turned to leave.


The door slammed shut.

Ella kept her cool, fingers flying over the keyboard.

Ava pouted, "Arthur seems pissed, I'll go check on him!"

Then she walked out of the studio.

Ella's expression didn't change. Lily ran over and whispered something in her ear, making them both burst into laughter.

Meanwhile, Arthur stormed into the break room.

He grabbed a cup of coffee and took a sip, but it didn't help his frustration.

Thinking about Ella's distant look, his grip tightened around the coffee cup.

"Who ticked off you!"

Alan strolled in, teasing, "I saw it, you really like Ms. Worry-Free,even getting physical with her!"

"That's my..."

Arthur didn't finish, just glared at Alan, "You seem very idle!"

"I'm different from you. It was just a quick measurement, and it ended quickly! But Ava's still there, you even dare to..."

"Shut up!" Arthur, annoyed,kicked him.

Alan jumped back. "Come on, you don't have to be like this,you already have a lover, and still flirt with women here! If Ella finds out..."

His voice stopped abruptly, feeling a chill on his neck.

"Alright, let's not dwell on those unhappy things! Hey, spending a lot of money to help her deal with bad reviews is no small feat!"

Arthur tilted his head and glanced at him. "She's so clueless, even you

figured it out!"
Alan, carefree and nonchalant. even someone as oblivious as him noticed,yet Ella dlidn't knew nothing about it and show any gratitude.

He irritably lit a cigarette and took a deep drag.

"Calm down, you're too jealous. You transferred Leo and managed negative comments, What's your plan?"

"Annoying!"

Arthur lifted his eyelids. "Ill talk to Sean another day, and send you to Emberlyn!"

Watching him leave, Alan wailed, "No!"


Wails echoed behind Arthur.

He didn't stop, seeing Leo not far away, his eyes narrowed, his expression unclear.

The live stream ended at noon.

Ella reviewed the playback, seeing that the viewers were focusing on her and Arthur's relationship. She was speechless.

Lily was excited, "It means you two are a perfect match, look, everyone likes you!"

"Forget it! What are we having for lunch?"

As soon as she finished speaking, the studio door opened.

Ava walked in with takeout. "Hey everyone, Arthur was worried I wouldn'
t like the lunch here, so he ordered from a fancy restaurant, let's all eat together!"

Hearing this, everyone gathered around the desk.

Lily snorted, full of disdain. "Let's check the kitchen."

Ella was about to go with Lily when Ava walked over, holding two cups of juice. "I know you like grapes, I specially bought these for you!"

She placed two cups of juice in front of them.

Ella raised an eyebrow, feeling she had ulterior motives.

Lily, straightforward, pushed them back. "Oh, no need. You keep it.seriously."

"We're a team! I want to mend our relationship, could you forgive me?"

Ava lightly bit her lip, her delicately made-up face showing grievance.


"Alright, it's just a small matter, we'll drink!"

To avoid unnecessary trouble, Ella opened the juice and took a sip in front of everyone. "Is this okay? I'm a bit tired, I'll go rest in my room!"

"Okay!"

Watching Ella and Lily leave, Ava's mouith curved into a sinister smile.


The staff nearby noticed, looking puzzled.
###Chapter 61

"So hot!"

Ella felt waves of heat crashing over her.


She was sitting at her computer, watching the screen blur, the dense text looking like a swarm of ants.


At the same time, it felt like her body was being devoured by those ants,the heat unbearable.


She could feel the changes in her body-her limbs weak, her whole body soft, and an unbearable itch below.


Especially her vagina, where sticky fluid kept flowing out.

"Am I drugged?" She moaned involuntarily, her mouth open.

Lily, who was dozing off beside her, heard the sound and joked, "What's up with you? Missing a man? Want me to find one for you?"

Ella struggled to say, "Help me!"

Lily sensed something was off and got up from the bed.

"What's going on?"

Ella sat in the chair, her face flushed, sweating profusely, her long hair sticking to her face, and her hands constantly tugging at her clothes,her body writhing.

In no time, her clothes were torn to shreds, exposing large areas of skin.

Lily immediately wrapped her in a sheet. "What's happening? Should we

go to the hospital?"

"Tve been drugged! I need to take a cold shower now!"

She staggered towards the bathroom, using her remaining willpower to turn on the faucet.

The cold water poured over her, reducing the heat in her body a bit.

Lily exclaimed. "I need to find some medicine for you!"

There was a live stream this afternoon!

Lily ran out, and just as she opened the door, she saw Leo standing there.

His face was flushed, his body hot, his eyes bloodshot, like a beast.

Lily sensed something was wrong and closed the door, angrily scolding Leo, "What do you want? Taking advantage of someonie? Get out now, or I'Il deal with you..."


"Sorry!"

Leo pushed the door open forcefully, grabbing Lily and starting to kiss her wildly.

Leo and Ella had been drugged, and he had even come to the door.


Without thinking. Lily picked up her phone and hit Leo on the head.

Leo's eyes rolled back, and he fell to the ground.

Lily, weak and panting, sent out a message.

Arthur's phone vibrated, and he glanced at the message.

[Your wife will be taken away!]

Arthur's face darkened, his jaw clenched, and he dialed Ella's number but got no answer after several rings.

Just as he was about to hang up, he heard a moaning sound on the other end.


"Help me!"

Ella's voice was seductive and breathy, full of endless allure, more like a bold invitation.


"What's wrong?" Arthur sensed something was off, his voice cold,"Where are you?"


"In my room!"

Ella's moaning voice squeezed out through her teeth.

"Wait for me!"

Hanging up, Arthur strode out quickly.

"Arthur,where are you going?"

Just as he stepped out, he saw Ava walking towards him.

Arthur's eyes flickered. "Something urgent!"

With cold words, he quickly walked away.

Ava stood there, her face cold. "Go ahead, see how lewd that bitch woman is!"

With a moan suddenly sounding, Ella covered her mouth tightly with her

hand.

The heat grew more intense, her mind becoming more and more blurred,her face flushed, her watery eyes covered with a layer of mist, her red lips incredibly alluring.


Arthur stepped in and saw the scene.

Ella's whole body was flushed, even though she kept pouring cold water on herself. she was out of control, her clothes already torn off,completely naked.


Ella's delicate face was flushed, her red lips pouting, seemingly inviting him to kiss her.


His eyes flashed with a burning light, and he strode forward, holding her in his arms. "Who did this?"


"Help me!"

Ella's familiar voice sounded in his ear.

She raised her head, her beautiful eyes filled with intense desire, wrapping her arms around his firm waist.

Her hands kept tugging at his shirt.

"I'll do it!"

Arthur's voice was low and hoarse, tearing off his shirt and holding Ella tightly in his arms.

He bent down and kissed her ear.

Ella felt a tingling sensation, her body trembling, her desire growing.

She wrapped herself around Arthur like a snake, her soft red lips kissing every part of his body, while her hands roamed over his chiseled chest.

Unable to contain his desire, Arthur held Ella in his arms and quickly took off his pants.


His erect penis emerged, and his long fingers pressed into her soaking wet vagina before he entered her deeply.

Ella's moans were like an aphrodisiac.

Arthur's jaw clenched, his throat tightening, holding her slender waist and thrusting deeply.

Her moans grew louder and louder.

In her dazed state, Ella fully enjoyed the moment, and at the climax, her legs tightly wrapped around Arthur's waist, her long nails embedded in his flesh.

Ella's moans and Arthur's heavy breathing intertwined.

Arthur straightened his back, thrusting continuously, seeing Ella's flushed face and lustful eyes, losing control even more; his movements grew more intense.

Unconsciously, his entire penis was inside her.

As the drug's effect wore off, Ella's eyes filled with tears, herlong hair soaked with sweat stickingto her flushed cheeks.

"Enough! Stop!"

Ella's pleading voice sounded.

She turned her head, pressing Arthur's hand, "Let me go. I'm fine!" Her pleading voice was like a kitten scratching at his heart.

"Heartless woman! I'm not done yet!"

Arthur, excited, thrust forcefully again.

Ella's moans sounded again.

Arthur held her in his arms, looking at her wet eyes, her eyelashes trembling, feeling like they were scratching at his heart, he lifted her legs onto his shoulders and thrust again.


"You, enough... let...me..."

Ella's feet arched, her hands gripping Arthur's arm tightly, her nails embedded in his flesh, red blood flowing down his arm.

Her moans were broken and intermittent.

Even so, Arthur grew more excited, not letting her go.

His penis kept thrusting into her vagina, creating wave after wave of sensation. After reaching climax, she felt endless pleasure.

Arthur's body moved rhythmically against hers; they entwined in passionate lovemaking.

Ella could no longer moan, her voice growing lower.

After a long time, another clímax, Arthur, panting heavily, lay on her shoulder.

His hot breath hit her face, Ella's body limp, completely exhausted, she tried to push him away, but failed.
###Chapter 62

"Did you already know who I am?" Ella asked, her voice raspy and breathless.


Arthur looked up, locking eyes with her. "What do you think?"

"You've been messing with me these past few days!"


"Yep." Arthur leaned in close, his voice dripping with seduction. "I was messing with you."

His tone was drawn out, full of amusement.

Ella's face flushed with anger. "Don't forget, we're about to get divorced."

"Divorce?" Arthur's voice rose as he played with her hair, his other hand gripping her waist. "Can you really go through with it?"

"Let go of me!" Ella, sumamoning all her strength, shoved him away.

Caught off guard, Arthur crashed to the ground. "Enough! Even playing hard to get has its limits!"

Ella sneered, quickly getting dressed. She glared at him. "Don't you want to know who drugged me?"

"I'll look into it."

His phone rang. When he answered, Ava's tearful voice came through.

"Arthur, the live broadcast is about to start, but I fell."

"I'll send an assistant over," he replied, ending the call.

Arthur got up and dressed quickly. Moments ago, he was a wild beast;now, he was a polished socialite.

Ella glanced at him, mocking, "Ava called, why didn't you go?"

For the first time, he didn't drop everything for Ava.

Arthur raised an eyebrow, teasing, "Do you want me to go?”

"Who cares about you! I just want to find out the truth. I only ended up like this after drinking the juice Ava brought!"


"Impossible!"

"Right, Ava is the sweetest and kindest! How could she harm me?"

"Don't be so sarcastic. Leo in the next room was also drugged. Maybe it was his plan! After all..."

Thinking of their intimate actions, Arthur's face darkened. "Stay away from other men in the future. Don't forget who you are!"

"And who am I?"

"My wife!"

Ella was about to retort when there was a knock on the door.

"Ms. Worry-Free, the live broadcast is about to start!"


"Coming!"

The fashion event was crucial. Ella couldn't delay, so she got dressed and headed out.

Just as she reached the door, Arthur grabbed her wrist.

She turned back, meeting his intense gaze. "What do you want? Don't mess with my work!"

"What's your relationship with Ms. Worry-Free?"

"I'll explain later!"

In a hurry, Ella shook off his hand and walked out.


Around the corner, Lily appeared, lifting a corner of Ella's mask to reveal swollen and red lips, and laughed.

"Ella, thank me!"

"It was you? You drugged me?"

"What nonsense! I didn't drug you, but I sent the message to Arthur!"


Lily kept talking as they walked.

Ella felt helpless. "I don't know how to explain my identity now!"

Lily shrugged. "Forget it. It's done. Don't overthink it."


Ella could come up with an excuse later.

Soon,they arrived at the studio. As they opened the door, they wished they could unsee what was in front of them.

The entire production team was there, and on the sofa, Ava was clinging to Arthur's arm,pouting.

"What were you busy with? I got hurt, and you didn't even come!"

"Alright, it's just a mínor issue! If you're in pain, I'll send you to the hospital!"
"It still hurts!"

"Fine," Arthur said, picking up the phone. "Ava's foot hurts, send her to the hospoital immediately!"

The call ended, and Ava looked shocked. "You're not taking me?"

"Im working," Arthur replied flatly.

She pouted, tears welling up. "Forget it, I can handle it. I want to stay and work with you!"

Her whiny voice made Lily shiver, goosebumps rising. "It's work time now;stop flirting here."

Ava lowered her head, looking hurt, hoping Arthur would defend her.

But there was no scolding, making her feel even more upset, tears streaming down her face.

"Alright, our live broadcast is starting now!" The assistant director,sensing the tension and seeing it was time, turned on the camera.

Ella, not great with words, left the audience greeting to Lily.

Lily, in sportswear with a high ponytail, looked fresh and energetic.

She waved at the camera. "Hey everyone, the afternoon might be a bit dull as the designers are cutting fabric, so I'll explain..."

Ella and Lily worked together seamlessly.

Ava and Arthur, like decorative pieces, sat on the sofa, occasionally chatting.
Many viewers loved watching the dynamic between Arthur and Ella,so the director's team kept the camera on them,pleasing the audience.

Ella wasn't thrilled about this but kept quiet.

She focused on cutting fabric all afternoon, while Lily explained, the two working perfectlytogether.

The other two live streams weren't as successful.

Their explanations were too technical, leaving many viewers confused.

Even worse, in Andy and Jessa's live stream, the two started arguing.

No one expected the argument to be over a bracelet Ava gave.

"Your bracelet is getting in the way, please take it off!" After Jessa's bracelet touched the fabric multiple times, Andy couldn't take it anymore and spoke up.

Jessa stood there, looking hurt. "My bracelet doesn't affect my work!"

"Your bracelet has diamonds, it will scratch the fabric!" Andy, disliking Jessa's meekness, explained patiently.

"This was a gift from Ava, representing our friendship."

[Who is this prissy woman? She can just design clothes. Why is she so mean to Jessa?]

[Yeah, this old hag, ugly and mean, Jessa and Ava are friends, so what if she wears it?]

[Poor thing,being bullied by an old hag! Workplace bullying!!
Seeing these comments. Andy was furious.

She lost her cool and snapped, "Know your place, you're my assistant, you should listen to me, don't try to use Ava to pressure me!"

"You're so mean, I'm scared!"

Ava liked to act weak and pitiful. Jessa had learned it well, curling up in a corner,looking bullied.

Seeing this, the viewers couldn't stay calm.

They originally went to Ella's live stream to complain, but many comments were blocked, and they couldn't vent.

Finding an outlet, the viewers lashed out.

Andy's live stream was instantly flooded with "Get out" comments.

Andy was so angry that her heart hurt, wanting to end the live stream, but for her career, she had to continue.
###Chapter 63

The afternoon flew by.

Cecilia's live stream was pretty meh, nothing special going on.

Andy, on the other hand, got roasted by netizens all afternoon. She was fuming, veins popping on her forehead, with no way to vent her anger.

The most heartwarming live stream was Ella's.

Arthur and Ella didIn't interact much all afternoon, but the netizens were obsessed with watching their relationship unfold.

With Ella's sunglasses and masks, it was a mystery how they could see the flirty glances.

Finally, the live stream ended.

Ella gazed at the cut fabric, let out a big sigh, and flopped into a chair.

Lily rushed over to give her a back massage. "You've worked hard,I know it's been tough on you!"

Making clothes for a jerk was really hard on Ella.

Arthur, who was heading to the door, stopped and turned back. "Is it tough on you to make clothes for me?"

"Of course...not" Ella raised an eyebrow and took a deep breath.

Arthur sneered, got up close to Ella's face, and said with a smirk, "We still have serious business to attend to!"

"Indeed! I also want to see who is trying to harm me!"
As Ella spoke, her gaze shifted past Arthur and locked onto Ava.

Ava's breath hitched, then she walked up to Ella. "I have so much to say to you, but I haven't had the chance!"

She pretended to unintentionally tug at Ella's clothes.

In the summer, her clothes were thin, and a light tug exposed a large area of skin, with a bright red mark particularly noticeable.

She seemed startled, covered her mouth with her hand, and exclaimed,"Oh my God, Ms. Worry-Free, what happened to you! Are you allergic?"

As she spoke, she glanced at Arthur from the corner of her eye.

Seeing his jaw tighten and his face displeased, she smirked.

Ava stepped forward and pulled Ella's clothes a bit more. "This doesn't look like an allergy, more like a hickey. Ms. Worry-Free,who were you with at noon? Could it be Leo? I think you two are quite a match."

She covered her mouth and laughed.

Lily was speechless.

'Is she out of her mind? Even if she drugged Ella, shouldn't she have someone watch to see if it worked? Talking nonsense.'

Lily's face showed disdain.

Ella. on the other hand, watched Ava perform with amusement,while raising an eyebrow at Arthur.

Ava's laughter echoed in the empty room.
After a while, she finally realized something was off; she was the only one laughing while everyone else looked like they were waiting for the drama to unfold.

'Are they treating her like a clown?'

This thought flashed through her mind, and she tugged on Arthur's arm. "Did I say something wrong?"

"No! But you should be careful with your words!"

Arthur's eyes focused on Ella, and he grabbed her wrist. "Let's go solve this!"


"Okay!"

The two of them tugged at each other as they stumbled out of the studio.

Ava wanted to follow them, but Lily grabbed her hand and smiled brightly.
"We won't follow, let's have a private chat!"

In the basement.

Leo was tied up and thrown on the ground.

At this moment, his face was flushed, his handsome eyes full of desire.and he kept making beast-like growls.

When the door opened and they saw the scene inside, Ella's pupils shrank suddenly.

She said coldly, "He was drugged too, you can't treat him like this!"

"How do you know he was drugged and not the one drugging you?"
Seeing her defend Leo in front of him. Arthur's face darkened, and he kicked Leo in the stomach.

Leo screamed, trying hard to open his eyes. Unfortunately, his vision was blurry, and he couldn't see anything clearly, his mouth continuously making desperate sounds. The sound of desire echoed in the basement.

Ella was so embarrassed she wanted to find a hole to crawl into. Just when she didn't know what to do, a pair of hands covered her ears, and then she saw several doctors come in and give Leo a few injections.

Time passed bit by bit. The desire in Leo's eyes faded completely as he returned to normal.

Ella pushed Arthur's hand away and walked over to Leo. "What exactly happened today?"

"I was drugged!" Leo, a man, started crying loudly after regaining his senses.

Ella patted his shoulder, but as soon as she did, her wrist was tightly grasped,and she was pulled into a firm embrace. Her face hit Arthur's muscle, and it hurt a lot.

Ella felt her eyes fill with tears, and she pushed him away forcefully. "Don't mess around!"

"You don't mess around; don't touch him. What were you trying to do just now?" Arthur pressed her against the wall, his tall body enveloping her.His long legs were between her legs.

In a shameful position, Ella's face turned red, her beautiful eyes watery."Move aside!"
"You need some punishment to remember what I had said!" Arthur leaned close to her ear, kissing her slender neck, breathing hot air. His broad hand slowly slid down her waist and finally squeezed her buttocks firmly.

A tingling sensation instantly surged through Ella's heart. Ella shivered all over, her face turning as red as a ripened cherry. "Let's handle this serious matter first!"

"Being with me is a serious matter too!" His hand lingered on her full chest for a moment, and his threatening voice sounded, "Remember to keep your distance from other men!"

"Got it!" Ella used a lot of effort to push him away, took a few deep breaths to calm her emotions, and then walked to Leo again. Seeing he still crying, irritation surged in her heart, Ella could not bear to cry out, "Stop crying.you are a man!"

The crying stopped abruptly. Leo's eyes were filled with tears,looking like a wounded deer,pitiful.

"Alright,stay strong!"

"I was drugged! If I slept with someone else, my fiancée would abandon me!" Leo looked like an innocent young man who had just entered society.

Ella sighed, "Now tell me what happened."

"Okay!" As soon as he started,Leo hiccuped.

Arthur looked disgusted and kicked him. Leo,who was kicked to the ground, looked aggrieved. "I'm the victim, today the director told me to rest, I was bored and wandered around the living room,then I chatted with the delivery guy, and he gave me a glass of juice."
Leo cried a lot, but his explained clearly. After drinking a glass of juice, he felt something was wrong.

At this moment, a staff member told Leo that Ms. Worry-Free was looking for him. So Leo appeared at Ella's door.

After learning the details. Arthur's face was as dark as a thundercloud.exuding an intimidating arua. He clenched his fist tightly.

"You're not lying?" Arthur asked.

Leo shook his head. "Of course not, everyone knows that you and Ms.
Worry-Free have an unusual relationship."
###Chapter 64

Leo's last words made Arthur smirk.

Arthur chuckled. "You better hope it has nothing to do with you, or else..."

He kicked the chair, and it shattered into pieces.

Leo gulped. trembling. "I wouldn't dare, I have a fiancée!"


The interrogation wrapped up.

Ella stood there, looking annoyed, waiting for Arthur to explain.

After a bit, the phone rang, and Arthur hit the speaker button.

"Mr. Smith, a lot of the surveillance cameras are busted, and we checked the takeout but found nothing weird! And the takeout was ordered by Ms.Davis..."

The person on the other end trailed off, knowing Arthur would protect Ava.

Sure enough, under Ella's mocking gaze, Arthur said, "No need to investigate Ava! Keep looking into that restaurant!"

'Letting the real culprit go, what's the point of investigating?' Ella thought,rolling her eyes and turning to leave.

Arthur grabbed her wrist. "What do you mean? Are you suspecting Ava?"


"Not suspecting, I'm sure she did it!"

Ella ignored his angry glare. "Forget it, you wouldn't believe me anyway."
"You don't suspect Leo but suspect Ava? You're clearly targeting her!"

"I'm really annoyed; I want to go back and rest now!"

Not wanting to argue anymore, she struggled to get free.

The phone rang again, and Arthur answered.

"Mr. Smith, we found some clues and are heading to the basement right away. Please wait a moment."


"Okay!"

The call ended, and Arthur held onto Ella's wrist, not letting her go. "Just wait a bit longer!"

"Do I have another choice?"

Ella glanced at him, then looked at the tied-up Leo. "Shouldn't you untie him first?"

"You really know how to care for him!"

Arthur said sarcasticaly, then roughly untied the ropes.

Once free, Leo instinctively stood beside Ella. "Ms. Worry-Free,you have to protect me!"

Ella rolled her eyes. "Can you, as a man, be a bi stronger?"

"It's not that I'm not strong, it's that they are too scary!"

Footsteps approached, and it sounded like quite a few people.

Sure enough, Alan, Arthur's assistant, and Lily all walked in.
Lily ran to Ella's side. "How is it? Did you find anything?"

Ella shook her head. "Let's wait for the results!"

"That's all we can do!" Lily glanced at Leo beside her, dissatisfied."Why are you standing here? Stay away from us, it's not certain if you're innocent yet!"

Leo felt so wronged.

Arthur's assistant came over, showing a bag to everyone.

"This is the aphrodisiac, found in Leo's room! And we also found the purchase records!"

"What?" Leo screamed in fear, "Impossible, I'm young and strong,why would I buy this stuff!"

Ella's voice carried sarcasm, "Yes, could it be a mistake? The surveillance is gone, you can't fix the surveillance but even can find his purchase records!"

Alan's gaze swept over Arthur and Ella, and he cleared his throat,"This was investigated by professionals, there can be no mistake!"

"It really has nothing to do with me!" Leo was almost in tears.

He had just graduated from college and finally found the job, but didn't expect to get involved in these things.

Leo pleaded, tugging at Ella's sleeve.

But before he could beg, he felt a chill on his back.

Turning around, he met Arthur's icy cold eyes, and he trembled all over,letting go of his hand.
-

Ella sighed. "Don't worry, I believe you!"

"Thank you. Ms. Worry-Free!"

Arthur shot a cold glance. "Why do you believe him and not Ava?"


"What about you?"

The tension was thick.

Arthur sneered, "Fine, I'll find the evidence myself!"


With that, he stormed out.

Ella rolled her eyes. "The evidence is long gone!"

The broken surveillance was the best evidence.

She gave Leo a cold look. "Be more careful next time!"


'How can you be so easily framed?

Back in the room, Lily couldn't wait to ask, "How did you explain the Ms.Worry-Free thing? Should we get our stories straight?"

Ella sighed. "I haven't said anything yet! Help me come up with something?"

Lily scratched her head. "Arthur's too smart, we need to think this through.




Ella's phone rang.

Seeing the number, she answered.

"Come home, I don't know why you're willing to be Ms. Worry-Free's
stand-in, but you won't make much money. I'll give you a secondary card,use it as you please!"

Ella laughed angrily at this.

Maybe in Arthur's mind, she was always insignificant, just a decoration at home.

She shouted, "I want to be a stand-in, what's it to you!"

She hung up, fuming. "No need for us to think of a reason,he came up with one himself!"

Lily burst into laughter. "Arthur has a really peculiar way of thinking!"

They had made love once at noon, and Ella hadn't showered yet. Feeling annoyed,she went into the bathroom.

Arthur's face was gloomy as he listened to the laughter in his ear. He shot a cold glance. "Is it funny?"

Alan covered his mouth, stifling his laughter. "Of course not! It's just that.Ella would rather be a stand-in for someone else to make money than be your wife."

Arthur sneered, "You, a single man, wouldn't understand!"


"Yeah, I don't get it!"

Alan leaned closer. "So you've been cozying up to Ms. Worry-Free because you know she's Ella. No, wait-Ella is Ms. Worry-Free's stand-in,so where did the real Ms. Worry-Free go?"

With Alan's chattering voice in his ear, Arthur felt annoyed. "They must have a special way of contacting each other!"
Thinking of Ella usually wearing a hat and mask, it wasn't a problem to put on earphones to contact Ms. Worry-Free either.

His long fingers tapped the table irritably. "If Ms. Worry-Free's fans find out Ella is a stand-in, who knows how much trouble it will cause!"

"But, are you sure Ella is Ms. Worry-Free's stand-in, and not Ms. Worry-Free herself?"


"What do you think?"

Arthur lit a cigarette. "She's been a housewife since graduation,long forgotten her profession!"

"Alright!"

Alan stretched. "I'm going back to play games!"

With the door closed, the room returned to silence.

Arthur thought of the lovemaking at noon, savoring the memory,he lightly licked his lips.

He took out his phone, his fingers quickly tapping on the screen.


[Come see me tonight!]

Just as the message was sent, a call from Robert's butler came in.

"Mr. Arthur Smith, something's wrong, Mr. Robert Smith is unconscious and on the way to the hospital!"
###Chapter 65

Robert was in a coma.

Arthur suddenly jumped up, dashed downstairs, and took a sharp turn past the second floor.

There was a loud knock on the door.

The door swung open, and there stood Ella, her wet hair clinging to her body,looking absolutely stunning.

Seeing Arthur at the door, she froze for a second. "What's going on this late?"

"Grandpa's in the hospital!"


"Tll get changed!"

Ten minutes later, they were on their way to the hospital.

Ella was worried. "Grandpa's always been so healthy, how did he end up in the hospital?"

"He got really upset!"

Arthur turned to the driver, "Step on it!"

The driver nodded and floored it, the car zooming down the road like a rocket.

Ella's heart was racing, she quickly buckled her seatbelt and glanced at Arthur's stern face beside her.

In the dim light, his face looked like it was carved from ice, sending chills
down her spine.

Feeling uneasy, she shifted in her seat, then shifted again.

In the spacious car, it felt like there was a wholegalaxy between them.

Arthur's eyes darkened, and without looking at her, he coldly said, "Sit closer!"

His tone was icy and commanding.

Ella stubbornly stayed put. "We're about to get divorced,you can't boss me around!"


"Sit closer!"

His voice was filled with irritation.

Ella ignored him and stared out the window at the passing scenery.


"You..."

Arthur grabbed her slender waist and pulled her tightly into his arms.his unique scent enveloping her.

Ella was stunned for a moment, feeling Arthur's body trembling.

Thinking about the news she saw online, she gently patted his back. "Grandpa's strong,he'll be okay!"

"Yeah."

Arthur replied, his arms tightening around her as if he wanted to merge her into his body.

The car soon screeched to a halt at the hospital entrance.
Arthur and Ella quickly ran into the ward.

Robert's face looked pale as he lay on the hospital bed. When he saw Arthur, he glared at himn with dissatisfaction, then looked at Ella with an apologetic expression.

"Ella, you've been through a lot!"

"Grandpa, don't worry. I'm fine!"

Ella stepped forward and held Robert's hand.

His hand was dry and warm, like a comforting stream flowing into her heart.

Robert smiled. "I know you're understanding. It's Arthur who can't see your worth!"

Having just woken up from a coma, he looked haggard but his spirit was strong.

He stared at Arthur with sharp eyes. "You actually invested billions of dollars just for..."

"Grandpa, it's not what you think!"

Seeing Robert finally talking to him, Arthur immediately leaned forward.

"You have to drive Ella away to be at peace!" Robert said angrily, poking Arthur's head hard.

"Grandpa, I'm not a kid anymore!"

Arthur's eyes softened as he held Ella's hand. "Besides, the fact that we came to the hospital together should prove something aboutour
relationship,right?"

"Alright, it's late, you both must be tired. Eat something and get some rest!



As soon as Robert finished speaking, the butler brought in two bowls of soup.

"This is specially prepared for you by Mr. Smith!"


The aroma of the soup instantly filled the air.

But remembering the last time she was drugged, Ella felt uneasy and instinctively wanted to refuse.

Arthur raised an eyebrow, picked up the soup, and drank it. "Grandpa.your soup is still the best!"

He glanced at Ella. "This is Grandpa's way of showing he cares."

Ella's face tightened a bit, but she picked up the bowl and slowly drank the soup.

Both bowls were soon empty.

Robert laughed heartily. "Alright, the room next door is ready, go get some rest!"

Private hospitals had large suites that included rooms for both patients and caregivers.

"Grandpa, you rest up! Call us if you need anything!”

Arthur held Ella's hand and led her out of the ward.
Robert couldn't stop smiling. "I hope this works, then I'll have a great-grandchild soon!"

The butler stepped forward to help him with the quilt. "You've put in a lot of effort for Mr. Smith and Mrs. Smith. They will understand."

"You're right!"

Robert took out his computer and started browsing baby products.


The butler was speechless.

There was no need to be in such a hurry.

Next door room.

The suite was like a hotel, with everything you could need.

Ella closed the door, her expression wary, her body trembling slightly as she shrank into a corner.

Arthur's gaze darkened, his face full of dissatisfaction. "I'm not a monster!"


"I just..."

Seeing her avoiding him like the plague, Arthur took a big step forward and cornered Ella against the wall. "We haven't divorced yet, even if I ask you to fulfill your duties as my wife, it's only fair!"

"But..."

She was flustered.

Their recent interactions were more than in all their years of marriage.

Ella's face scrunched up. "We're getting divorced!"
"We haven't yet!"

Arthur turned and sat on the sofa, crossing his legs.

He irritably tugged at his tie, revealing the red marks on his body.

Ella turned her face away. "I suspect that bowI of soup..."

"Alright, stop overthinking! I've already informed the show crew,they'll find someone to guest star temporarily!"

"You..."

Once again, he acted on his own accord without telling her.


Ella stormed into the bathroom.

She had already showered before coming, but now she just wanted to avoid Arthur.

The sound of running water filled the bathroom.

Hot water washed over her body, Ella quietly felt the changes in her body.

After a while, nothing happened, maybe she was overthinking.

Ella glanced at the towel beside her, they had come in a hurry, and didn't prepare any change of clothes, so she could just wrap herself with it.

The bathroom door opened.

After the shower, Ella's hair was casually draped, her skin smooth, her slender waist, and alluring long legs.

Her unique scent filled the room.
Arthur's throat tightened, and when he looked up, his deep eyes were full of desire.

"In such a hurry?"

His voice was low and hoarse, with a hint of teasing.

Ella was stunned for a moment, shaking her head. "That soup was fine.I'm all right. Let's sleep early!"

She quickly got into bed, wrapping herself tightly, only her head exposed.


Arthur's deep gaze fell on the bed.

Seeing Ella wrapped like a cocoon, her face flushed, her hair not completely dry, spread out like seaweed on the pillow, with a unique allure.

"You want to sleep now?"

Arthur was suddenly seized by a mischievous whim.

He pounced on the bed, pressing Ella tightly beneath him. "Don't play dumb. Grandpa might be agitated, but he's not bad enough to need hospitalization. He's calling us back for a reason, we can't disappoint him!"

"But we are about to..."

Before she could finish, Arthur's hand slípped under the covers,wrapping around her slender waist.

"Tonight, let's try something different."
###Chapter 66

"You..."

Arthur yanked the blanket off and saw her naked. Without a second thought, he grabbed her slim waist and swung open the bathroom door.
With one hand on her waist and the other on her firm butt, he set her down on the sink.

His big hand slid up her slender leg, all the way to her vagina, and he yanked the towel off.

It fell away,leaving Ella's curvy body exposed to the cool air.

Feeling the chill, Ella instinctively covered her chest. "You..."


"You've put on some weight lately!"

Arthur's eyes locked onto her chest, and he kissed it hard.

His lips were cool, and the moment they touched her, it felt like a jolt of electricity. Ella shivered, her body went weak, and she started to slide down.

Just as she was about to fall off the sink, Arthur grabbed her slim waist.

His lips left her chest and found her red lips. Their mouths locked,breaths mingling.

Ella had to tilt her head back, enduring his intense kiss.

Her body grew weaker, unable to hold herself up, relying on his strong hand at her waist to keep from falling.
After what felt like forever, Arthur pulled away from her lips and undid his belt, revealing his penis.

His long fingers rubbed her pussy, whispering in her ear, "You can't wait,can you?"

His voice was husky, like a lover's murmur.

Ella shivered all over. Her cheeks were flushed, eyes full of desire, and she instinctively wrapped her arms around his neck, "I want it!"

Her body was already soft, craving more.


"Alright then!"

Arthur thrust his hips, and his penis entered her vagina,moving rhythmically.

With each intense thrust, Ella kept moaning, worried about disturbing Robert next door, she covered her mouth.


"Be gentle!"

After climaxing, Ella's moans seemedto drive Arthur wild.


He straightened up and thrust deep.

Ella winced, her nails digging into his flesh, and she couldn't help but speak.

"It hurts!"

As she spoke, Arthur held her slim waist, pulled out his penis, and gently rubbed her pussy.
It was like a wave of heat, leaving her breathless and her mouth dry.

Ella kept squirming, her legs wrapped tightly around his firm waist. "Fuck me!"

"As you wish."

Arthur chuckled,grabbed her slim waist with both hands, and thrust his penis back into her.

Feeling her body tremble, Ella gasped, her legs instinctively tightening around his firm waist.

Arthur groaned, then started another round of intense thrusting.

Time seemed to blur, and in the bathroom, Arthur's heavy breathing and Ella's moans mixed together.

After what felt like ages, Ella lay weakly on Arthur's chest, her head nestled in the crook of his neck, breathing heavily.

Arthur turned on the shower after their passion.

The sound of water filled the room.

Ella was cradled in his arms, letting him do as he pleased.

Steam filled the air, water droplets covered the glass door, and Ella lay weakly in his arms. Looking up, she saw their hazy reflections on the glass door,his strong physique and her graceful figure.

The heat surged, their bodies tightly entwined, making a scene that would make anyone blush.

Warm water washed over their bodies, and Ella, exhausted, felt her mind
growing hazy.

Just as she was about to drift off, his big hands started roaming over her body, her slim waist, her full butt, and her round breasts.

Ten minutes later, Ella lay in the bathtub.

Her body was covered in hickeys, making anyone's blood boil at the sight.

Arthur held her tightly in his arms, looking satisfied, his penis still inside her.

They were close, tightly embracing each other.

"I'm exhausted!"

Ella, after enduring wave after wave of his passion, now curled up in his arms like a wounded fawn.

"Alright, I'll take you back to bed!"

Arthur, completely naked, slowly got up and gently placed Ella on the bed.carefully covering her with the blanket. "Sleep well!"

The worn-out Ella quickly fell asleep on the bed.

Arthur's phone rang; Ella irritably turned over.

Then she heard Ava's sweet voice from the other end of the phone.

"Arthur, where are you? I had a nightmare, I'm scared." Her voice was pitiful.

Ella irritably pulled the blanket over her head.

Even so, Ava's voice seemed to grow wings and flew into her ears.
The usually cold Arthur now spoke with unprecedented gentleness,"Alright, don't be afraid. I'm just outside. YouI can ask a colleague to stay with you."

"But..."

So annoying.

Ella didn't want to listen anymore and covered her ears with her hands.

Time passed slowly, and after what felt like forever, Ella cautiously released her hands.


The room was silent.

Had he left?'

A sense of loss surged in her heart, and Ella angrily threw off the blanket.


Arthur's handsome face appeared before her.

His features were rugged, his nose high, and his thin lips tightly pressed together.

He looked unhappy.

Ella stretched her leg out from under the blanket and kicked him.

Caught off guard, Arthur was kicked off the bed and fell heavily.


It sounded painful.

Ella frowned, wanting to get up and check on him, but in the end, she awkwardly lay down and turned her face to the side.

"What are you doing?"
Arthur, climbing up from the floor, rubbed his sore butt.

He climbed back into bed, his hand naturally falling on her slim waist."Jealous?"

"I am about to become yourex-wife, do I have the right to be jealous?"


Ella didn't turn her head, answering coldly.

"Then why did you kick me off the bed!"

Arthur, as if punishing her, pinched her waist.

The pain made Ella tremble all over, and she slapped his hand. "Don't mess around!"

"Mess around?" Arthur leaned forward, pressing her tightly beneath him."

Like just now?"

"You..."

Just now, they had wild sex.

Thinking of his gentle voice just now, her face tightened,and she lowered her voice, "I was just fulfilling my duty. Now, behave yourself!"

"Fulfilling your duty!" Arthur repeated through gritted teeth, his hand passing through her waist, tightly holding Ella in his arms. "You're such a smooth talker!"

Just when Ella thought he would get angry, he simply pulled her closer.

Their bodies were tightly pressed together; her head rested on his chest.

Listening to Arthur's strong heartbeat, Ella blushed, feeling very
uncomfortable.wanting to push him away. but Arthur's arms were like clamps,immovable.

"Suit yourself!"

After a long day and a half night of tossing. Ella nestled in his arms.soon breathing evenly.
###Chapter 67

Early morning.

The sun was just starting to peek through the curtains.

Ella opened her eyes and saw Arthur's sharp jawline.

She reached out and traced his outline in the air.

Asleep, Arthur didn't have his usual cold and ruthless look. His eyes were shut tight. missing that scary depth they had when open.

He looked so peaceful when he was asleep, with a light smile curling up his thin lips, as if he were having a sweet dream.

Arthur's long eyelashes fluttered a bit; he was about to wake up.

Ella quickly closed her eyes and pretended to sleep.

The next second, she heard a light chuckle above her head.

"Why are you pretending to sleep? Get up, we need to get ready.We're taking Grandpa home!"

Robert wasjust faking being sick in the hospital and could be discharged the next day.

Arthur and Ella were playing the part of a loving couple, helping Robert pack his things.

Just as they were leaving the hospital, Robert made a request.

"You both have work, and no one to keep Sofia company.She gets bored staying at home. Let's have a family dinner tonight!"
It was pointless; they were about to get divorced.

Seeing Robert's firm stance, Ella could only reluctantly nod.

They quickly headed back to the villa.

Fortunately, things haven't changed much at home. Ella helped Robert inside.

"Ella's back!"

Sophia heard the door open and ran over, looking surprised. When she saw Robert, her smile grew even bigger. "You came back together, why didn't you say so earlier!"

"Grandma, we wanted to surprise you!"

Ella helped Robert sit down and then sat beside Sophia.

After a few days apart, Sophia missed Ella a lot. "It's only been a few days,and you've lost so much weight!"

"Grandma, only you say that I've lost weight. Actually, I've gained some!"


"Now that you're home, I'll cook some big meals for you these days!"

Sophia looked at Robert as she spoke, "Robert, I'm sorry, Ella's been married for a few years now, but she hasn't had a child!"

Robert's eyes lit up. "No rush, they're still young. Spending more time together will surely lead to a child!"

Talking about great-grandchildren, the two of them went on and on.

Robert shared many nutritious recipes, and Sophia decided to cook
delicious food for them every day to nourish their bodies.

It was unbearable to listen to, so Ella quietly walked into the kitchen and breathed a sigh of relief.

The maid beside her couldn't stop laughing. "Scared? Old folks are like that. If you go along with them and have a child early, everything will be fine!"

Footsteps approached; it was Arthur.

"With you two here, I'll leave you alone," The maid teased and quickly left the kitchen.

Arthuar asked. "Are you happy being urged to have a child?"


"What?"

Ella turned around, looking puzzled.

Arthur impatiently tugged at his tie. "Whether it's Grandma or Grandpa.they both have this idea. What about you? Why don't you oppose it?"

"Why don't you oppose it!"

Ella almost laughed in anger. She glared at Arthur. "If you find it annoying, let's go get a divorce certificate right now!"

No one liked being urged to get married or have children.'


But with two elders, what could she,as a junior,say?

Feeling wronged for no reason, her anger kept rising.

"Let's go!"
Ella grabbed his arm and started to walk out.

Arthur forcefully shook her off, frowning. "Enough! Stop throwing a tantrum!"

After all that, this was the only response she got.

A deep sense of helplessness washed over Ella. She took a few deep breaths and then spoke calmly, "Everyone's here today; I plan to cook myself! I'm going to buy groceries!"

Without looking at him, she walked out.

In the car. Ella looked at Arthur in confusion. "Where are you going?"

"To buy groceries! Grandpa asked me to follow you," Arthur said as he stepped on the gas pedal.

The two of them went on a big shopping spree, buying all of Robert and Sophia's favorite foods. By the time they got home, it was almost noon.

Time was tight. and there was a lot to do.

Ella and the maid were super busy in the kitchen.

Robert glanced at Arthur, who was sitting by the computer replying to emails, and his eyes turned cold. "Arthur, you jerk, can't you see they're busy in the kitchen? Go help!"

"No need, this is Ella's duty, no need to trouble Arthur," Sophia quickly spoke to stop him.

Arthur looked up and gently closed the computer. "T'll go help."

In the kitchen, Ella was washing vegetables and cooking at the same time.
feeling lke she could use an extra pair of hands.

The maid beside her was making soup.

Seeing Arthur come in. Ella looked up in surprise. "What are you doing here? Get out!"

He couldn't help and would only cause trouble.

Arthur, feeling rejected, paused for a moment, then turned and grabbed the spatula from Ella's hand. "I can cook!"

"Fine. then you do it!" Ella didn't say much and continued washing vegetables.

Soon, the kitchen was filled with thick smoke, making everyone cough.

Ella turned around and saw the beef in the pot burning. "Quick, the food is burning!"

The perfectly good steak was now charred and inedible.

Arthur stood there with the spatula, stunned. "What do we do now?"

"Of course, turn off the heat!" Ella was anxious, quickly turning off the heat and opening the window.

The kitchen was filled with smoke, and everyone started coughing simultaneously.

"I told you to get out, but you insisted on showing off!" Robert loved steak the most.

Ella had planned to show off her cooking skills, but now, it wasall ruined.
Ella, with a sullen face, threw the steak into the trash can and put the pot under the faucet.

"It's just a steak, no need to get angry!" Arthur looked at the oil stains on his white shirt, his face dark and displeased.

Usually. Ella would have gone to comfort him.

But now, there was nothing left to say between them.

They were getting divorced; who would want to comfort their ex?

Ella continued to scrub the pot, busy and relentless.

Arthur stepped forward and grabbed the pot from her hand. "Can't you see? I got burned!"

Oil had splattered, not only on his clothes but also on his wrist.

He extended his arm in front of Ella, the burn marks on it particularly noticeable.

Ella glanced at it. "Go take a shower and change your clothes, I'll clean up the kitchen!"

There was no concern in her words.

Arthur gritted his teeth. "You're something else!"


With that,he turned and left.

The maid, who had been scared and hiding in the corner, finally spoke up after Arthur left, "Mr. Smith is terrifying when he's angry!"

"It's nothing," Ella didn't say much and continued cleaning up.
With the steak gone. she had to use other ingredients.

Fortunately. Ella was a good cook, and with the maid's help. they quickly prepared a table full of delicious dishes.

At the dining table, looking at the spread. Robert praised repeatedly,"Ella's cooking is excellent!"

"Of course, Ella is the best. She has been great since she was a child. The children she has in the future will surely be smart and beautiful."
###Chapter 68
Sofia and Robert were daydreaming about their great-grandchild again.

Ella grinned and said, "Arthur hasn't come down yet, I'll go check on him!"


With that, she hurried upstairs like she was making a quick escape.


The two downstairs couldn't help but chuckle.

Hearing their laughter, Ella picked up her pace. She opened the door and heard Arthur's noise from the bathroom.


"Ella!"

Ella asked, puzzled, "What's up?"

"Bring me my clothes and towel!"


He said in a bossy tone.

Ella didn't reply. She grabbed the clothes and towel and tossed them through the door crack.

Ella sneered, "Be polite when asking for help!"

Arthur missed catching the clothes,and they fell to the wet floor.

He pushed open the bathroom door, standing there stark naked.

Ella turned her face away. "Hurry up and get dressed!"

"How can I wear wet clothes!" Arthur walked naked to the closet and threw on some clothes.

"Feeling shy? Last night, you couldn't get enough of me!" The limited edition Rolls-Royce attracted a lot of attention as soon as it stopped.

Ella quickly put on her hat, glasses, and mask.

Arthur sneered, "I don't know what you're trying to prove. If you need money. I can give you more each month! No need to put yourself through this!"

Though his words were meant to be caring, Arthur's tone made it sound like a scolding.

Ella rolled her eyes. "Relying on myself is the most dependable! So please,don't interfere with my work."

With that, she got out of the car.

Watching her stubborn back, Arthur's mouth twitched. 'What the hell is this job? Being a stand-in? And who's the real Ms. Worry-Free?'

Ella had no idea what Arthur was thinking. At that moment, her vision went black, her stomach churned, and she stumbled.

She barely made it into the hall.

The cold air from the air conditioner hit her, and her legs gave out,causing her to collapse to the ground.

Something was wrong.

She feIt like her stomach was being squeezed, causing sharp pain.

Despite the summer heat, she felt waves of cold.

"Lily!" she murmured, reaching for her phone.
A scream came from a distance. "Ms. Worry-Free, what's wrong?"

Ava, in high heels, ran over and grabbed Ella's arm. "Are you feeling unwell? Do you need to go to the hospital?"

Pain shot through Ella's arm.

She gasped, shivering, speaking weakly, "Find Lily!"


"Who are you looking for?"

Whether intentionally or not, Ava kept asking while hitting Ella's abdomen.


The pain intensified.

Using her last bit of strength, Ella pushed her away. "Get away from me!"

With blurred vision, she dialed a number on her phone by feel.


Before it connected, Ava rushed over and hung up.

"No need to call for help, I'll take care of you!"

Ava kicked Ella's phone away. "Let's go upstairs!"

She grabbed Ella's arm and dragged her upstairs.

During the process, she repeatedly tried to pull off Ella's mask and glasses.

Despite her weakness, Ella clung to them, preventing Ava from removing them.

"Let go of me!"

In excruciating pain, Ella struggled. She wanted to call for help, but the hall was empty.
A warm flow came from below.

Her period had started.

Dragged along, bright red bloodstained the floor.

Footsteps approached, and Ava's face changed. She ran away.

Ella was thrown to the ground hard, nearly causing her to pass out.

With her remaining strength, she called for help, "Help!"


Her voice was barely audible.

A few people nearby, chatting and laughing, didn't notice Ella at the staircase and walked away.

Blood continued to flow.

Just as Ella was about to lose hope, a familiar figure appeared.


"Ella!"

At the staircase, Ella lay curled up in a pool of blood.

Arthur's pupils contracted, and he ran over. "What happened? I'll take you to the hospital now!"

"My period!" she managed to explain with her last bit of strength before passing out.

Panicked, Arthur held Ella and called, "Quick, Ella fainted,get the medical team to the first floor!"

In the corner, Ava watched them, seething with jealousy.
She wanted to rush over and slap Ella.

She seemed to hear Arthur call her Ella.

'What is the connection between Ms. Worry-Free and Ella?

Covered in blood, Ava quickly went to her room. When she returned, the medical team had arrived.

Too far to hear Arthur's words. Ava adjusted her clothes and walked over in high heels.

"She's covered in blood, how terrifying!"

Before Ava finished speaking, she fainted, her body collapsing towards Arthur.
###Chapter 69
Ava hit the ground with a thud, the sound echoing through the room.Everyone froze.

"Oh my God."

What just happened? Ava had fallen towards Arthur, and he actually dodged.

Ava, sprawled on the floor, looked up in shock. "Arthur!"

"Get up, the floor's dirty," Arthur said coldly, not even sparing her a glance.


He was too busy holding Ella, fanning her gently.

A medic nearby suggested, "This isn't good for her breathing. Maybe we should take off the mask?"

Arthur thought for a second, then barked, "Everyone, except the medical staff,leave now."

The director's team quickly exited, sensing the urgency.

Now, it was just the medical staff, Arthur, and Ella in the room.


And,of course,Ava.

Despite her fall, Ava stood up, looking hurt, "Let me help!"

"No need. Go back<," Arthur said, his tone leaving no room for argument.


Reluctantly, Ava left, knowing Arthur wouldn't budge.

With the room cleared, Arthur removed Ella's mask. "Help her, now!"
"Got it," the medic said, examining Ella closely. He frowned. "She's on her period and took some medicine that caused this. She can't just take any medicine. If she'd taken more, she could've bled out!"

Arthur was stunned. "How could this happen? It was just some tonic."

The doctor was firm. "It's definitely the medlicine."

Arthur pointed to a nearby box. "Could you please check the medicine inside?"

The doctor opened the box, inspecting the contents. He got angry. "These quacks! How can they give this to women?"

He explained the harmful properties of the mnedicine.

Arthur, though not a doctor, could tel1 something was wrong. His fist clenched. "How do we treat her? Whatever it costs, just do it."

The doctor shook his head. "She needs the right medicine for the next few days."

After some treatment, Ella slowly woke up, looking confused. She managed a weak smile. "Thanks for today."

If it weren't for Arthur, who knows what would've happened.

She noticed his clothes on her and blushed. "I'll wash these for you."

"Don't worry about it,"Arthur said, holding her close, his eyes full of concern. "The doctor said your grandma's medicine is harmful. Don't drink it anymore. He'll prescribe something safe."

"No way!" Ella protested. "Grandma wouldn't hurt me!"
"I'll look into it," Arthur said, his voice hard. "You need to think for yourself. You can't just do whatever you're told."
Thinking about the medicine she was forced to drink, Arthur's anger flared.

The room was warm, but Ella felt a chill. She shivered. "Grandma was just misled."

Sofia definitely didn't mean to mess things up.

Arthur's eyes were blazing as he stared at her. "Do you really need to have a kid?"

Ella awkwardly turned her face away, her long lashes trembling. "No!"


It was clearly a sulking remark.

Arthur hugged her tightly. "I've already talked to the director's team and got you a room right next to mine!"

After thanking the doctors profusely, he carried Ella back to the room.


The door closed behind them.

Ella was gently placed on the bed and covered with a blanket.


"I..."

That was when she noticed there was already a sanitary pad under her.


'Who did that?'

Arthur, sitting beside her, sensed her confusion and spoke softly,"Guess who did it?"

"You..."
"You were out cold. Don't worry, no one knows."

Arthur lowered his head,trying to hide his embarrassment.

He had been so nervous when he had to place the sanitary pad for her.The doctor hadn't arrived yet, and it was just him and a small assistant from the show in theroom.

Even though the assistant was a girl, he didn't want anyone else touching Ella.

So he did it himself.

The room fell into an awkward silence.

Even though they had been through so much together,talking about this was still embarrassing.

After a while, Ella broke the silence. "My clothes are dirty, I need to change."

"The doctor said you should lie down for an hour before moving."

Seeing her try to get up, Arthur gently pressed her back onto the bed. "It's okay if the sheets get dirty; I'll change them later."

"Okay."

Ella obediently lay back down, only her head peeking out from the blanket.


Silence fell again.

Arthur quíckly got up. "I'll get you some hot milk."

Watching Arthur flee in panic, Ella curled her lips into a smile.
Maybe it was because of her fragile state, but at that moment, Arthur seemed like a god descending from heaven.

There was a knock on the door.

Before she could answer, the door opened, and a head peeked in.

"Oh my God, are you okay? I just woke up from a nap and heard about this. I'm sorry I didn't help you in time!"

Seeing Ella's pale face on the bed, Lily rushed over, tears in her eyes.


"Alright, don't cry, it's nothing! It's just..."

There was nothing to hide between them, so Ella explained the situation.

Lily was indignant, stomping her feet in anger. "Damn it, how could they prescribe medicine so carelessly! We have to find them!"

"Alright, keep your voice down. I don't want Grandma to worry about this.




"I heard Arthur carried you up just now?"


"News travels fast!"

Ella's face tuarned red, wishing she could hide under the blanket.

"Oh come on, you can hear people talking about you two everywhere.I heard that when you fainted, Arthur's face was so dark it scared everyone."

Ava fell, and he didn't help her up. He even cleared the room and kicked Ava out. Was that true?

Listening to Lily, Ella looked confused. "You're not lying to me?"
"Why would I lie to you? I heard Ava's pissed off. she started throwing things when she got back to her room."

Lily laughed heartily, not caring at all.


The door opened.

A gloomy face appeared at the door.

Arthur exuded a strong sense of oppression. his gaze cold as it fell on Lily."You should go back."
###Chapter 70

The room was dead quiet.
After a bit. Lily shot up, her face twisted with anger. "What the hell do you mean by this?"

"Get out!" Arthur repeated, his eyes dark and full of obvious disgust.


Disgusted by what? Well, it was all about Ava.

Thinking about what Lily had just said, Ella grabbed her hand. "Alright,you should head back now."

"But..."

"It's fine. I'm feeling a lot better!" Ella forced a smile.

As Lily walked past Arthur. she shot him a glare. "Take good care of your wife!"

She really stressed the word "wife" to remind Arthur he was a married man.

The door clicked shut.

Arthur's expression softened a bit, and he sat down by the bed and handed her a cup of warm milk. "Drink this."

Ella's stomach was still a bit queasy, and her face showed it.

"I saw you drink that medicine prettyfast!" Arthur brought the bowl to her mouth. "Drink it up!"

His tone was all business.
Ella was taken aback for a moment, then took the cup and drank it.

After the milk, she felt a warm sensation spread through her.

She looked down, her face turning red. "I need to take a shower."


She was on her period and felt sticky and gross.


Arthur nodded. "Ill help you."

He bent down to pick her up, but Ella freaked out and stopped him."What are you doing?"

She crossed her arms over her chest,looking defensive.

Arthur was at a loss for words. "Can you really shower by yourself in your condition?"

With all the blood loss, she was weak and could pass out in the shower.

Ella's face turned even redder, and she stubbornly said, "I can do it myself!11


"Fine,go ahead then."

Arthur sat on the sofa, legs crossed, watching Ella on the bed with a smirk.

Feeling like she was being watched like a hawk, Ella glared at him angrily.

She pulled the blanket off, her face turning red at the sight of the bloodstains, and struggled to get out of bed.

As soon as her feet hit the floor, she wobbled.

With all the blood loss, she didn't even have the strength to stand.
But she refused to give in.

She leaned against the wall, stumbling towards the bathroom.

Arthur watched her weak form, gritting his teeth. "Go ahead, if you faint in there. I won't care!"

"None of your business!"

Hearing Ella's stubborn words. Arthur's chest heaved with anger. He instinctively reached for a cigarette, but then tossed it on the table.
He half-leaned on the sofa, eyes closed, but he listened intently to the sounds coming from the bathroom.

Soon. the sound of running water came from the bathroom.

Arthur focused, quietly approaching the door.

Inside, there was only the sound of water, and he sensed something was off. He pushed the door open.

In the bathtub. Ella was sitting with her clothes still on.

Her long eyelashes were dotted with water droplets, her clothes clinging to her body, showing off her curves,especially her full breasts.

Arthur's throat tightened, and he felt himself getting hard.

He glanced at Ella, cursed under his breath, and stepped forward to support her arm. "Still being stubborn? You can't even take off your clothes!"

"I'll take them off after I rest for a bit!"
"Fine, I'll watch you take them off!"

Arthur sat nearby, arms crossed, watching Ella with a lazy smirk.

Under his gaze. Ella felt both embarrassed and angry, slowly unbuttoning her clothes.
As the jacket came off, her smooth skin, full breasts,and slender waist were revealed.

Arthur's eyes burned, his body heating up, and he kept swallowing hard.

Feeling his intense gaze, Ella lowered her head, her face flushed with embarrassment.

"Hurry up, there's nothing on your body I haven't seen before!" Arthur's voice was low and hoarse as he struggled to control his desire.

Ella lookedI up, meeting his deep eyes, and quickly looked away.


Time seemed to drag on.
A few minutes later, Ella looked at the dress clinging to her body,unable to take it off.

"Don't be stubborn!" Arthur bent down, his warm fingers brushing her skin,and tore off the dress.

With Arthur's help, Ella lay naked in the bathtub.

Hot water flowed over her body, and she stretched her limbs, instinctively saying,"You can leave now!"

"Heartless woman!" Arthur suddenly leaned in, grabbed the back of her head,and kissed her. Her heart raced.

Ella pushed against his chest, trying to push him away.

Arthur, dissatisfied,grabbed her hands and held them above her head."Focus!"

His hoarse voice sounded both threatening and warning.

Ella paused, her body softening, her face full of grievance,tears silently falling.

Her lips tasted salty.
Arthur felt her tears, let go of her, and said irritably, "I didn't mean to; I'll help you shower!"
He said, lifting Ella onto his lap.′′Iyour condition, you can't take a bath,only a shower!"

One hand around her waist, the other holding the showerhead.


Warm water flowed over both of them.

Ella,completely naked, sat on his lap, her face red, trying to struggle,but Arthur's strength was too great, and she couldn't break free.
Their bodies pressed tightly together, and seeing the fresh blood flowing over them, she buried her head in his chest in embarrassment. "Do you know what you're doing!"

They were about to get divorced, yet they were getting more intimate.

After a thorough shower,she felt refreshed.
Arthur placed the naked Ella on the bed and changed the prepared clean clothes for her.

Having seen each other naked, there was no embarrassment.

Ella dressed in front of him, and put on a sanitary pad.

After everything was done, she buried herself in the blanket like an ostrich.

Arthur stood by the bed, taking off his wet clothes, revealing a sexy Adam's apple, eight-pack abs, a perfect V-line, slender legs and...
Ella saw his erect penis and turned her face away. "I'm still weak!"

"I'm not a beast!" Arthur, dissatisfied, grabbed her arm and pulled her out of the blanket.

"What are you doing!"

"Dry your hair, or you'll get a headache!"

Ella then noticed he was holding a hairdryer.

He turned it on, warm air blowing on her head.

Arthur's long fingers ran through her hair, gently drying it.

At that moment, they seemed like an ordinary couple, warm and peaceful.


But such happiness was fleeting.

Ella lay in his arms obediently.

Soon, her hair was dry, and she quickly hid back under the  blanket.
###Chapter 71
Ella was all wrapped up, only her head sticking out.

"You don't wanna help me, huh?" Arthur lunged at her, pinning her down.
"Even if we can't have sex, there are other ways to make me feel good!"


He leaned in, nipping at her earlobe like a punishment.


"What are you talking about?"

Fresh out of the bath, her face was flushed, and her big eyes were all watery, making her look super tempting.

Her seductive eyes and charming vibe were totally drew him in.

Arthur's throat tightened, and he kissed her hard.

Their lips and tongues tangled together.

Ella's whole body went limp, and she felt a warm rush from below.


She put her hand between them. "Don't mess around."


"Fine, then use your hands!"

Arthur grabbed her hand, guiding it down from his chest to his abs,and then to his penis.

"I know your body's not up for it, so help me out this way!"

His big hand held her small one, making her grasp his penis.


The heat shot straight to her heart.

Ella's face turned bright red, and she tried to pull her hand back, but she
wasn't strong enough.
Feeling him harden in her palm, she had no choice but togo along with it.


Soon, the room was filled with the sounds of desire.

Arthur's breathing got heavier andI faster, his penis thrusting, and Ella's hand moving in sync.

Arthur quickly reached his climax, letting out a muffled groan.

He collapsed on top of Ella, still holding her hand. "Not bad, very soft!"

Arthur looked satisfied, while Ella blushed and buried her head in the blanket.


"Shy?"

Arthur's big hand started roaming over her body, and when he touched her breasts, he laughed. "You're turned on! You help me, and I'll help you!


As he spoke, he covered her body with kisses, starting from her neck and moving down to her chest, belly, and beyond.

Arthur's lips were burning hot.

Ella's body went completely limp, and warm rushes kept coming from below.
She pushed the blanket off and shoved Arthur hard. "Stop it, I don't need your help!"

"Are you sure?"
Arthut loiked up. his eyes foll of destre and anusement.

Ella nodded frmty. T'm eore! I firer want to reer now! And I need to find Y时 计 打 snc sn srcident ie i somaohe did rhie to mer

She looked at Anthur. I don't ueenfly make enenties. on..."


"You think I got you involved?"

Arthur got up and stared into her eyes. "Don't worry.I'll find out the truth!



They were doing the most intimate thing, yet talking about such serious stufl.

What a heartless woman.


He quckly got dressed andleft.

The door siammed showing his displeasure.

Elle pouted not caring and went to sleep under the blanket.

in the morning. Ella opened her eyes to see Arthur in front of her surling her. Why are you here ao carly?

) came sosee if you famied?

Arthur gieno at her annoyed. You slsys pray weilt

Last night, he left angry. mssed and suroed all night yer klla sispe like a baby.
"What else?"
After a night's sleep. Ella felt a lot better. She got up and looked at Arthur."What's up?"
"The results of the last incident investigation are in! It's connected to Leo,and we've decided to fire him!"


"Why?"

Ella's face changed. "I can guarantee this has nothing to do with Leo. Leo has a fiancée, and he's about to get married."

"Getting married?"

Arthur's face was full of sarcasm. "Then why are you two always talking so intimately?"

"You..."

Ella's face turned red with anger. "I'm not. Anyway, you can't ruin his job!Even if you found his purchase records, how can you be sure it's not a setup?"
And thinking of Ava, her face changed. "Ava has caused trouble several times, but she hasn't left."

"Don't involve her! She's innocent!"


"Leo is innocent,too!"

They stared at each other in silence.

Arthur sneered, his eyes cold. "You're arguing with me over an intern?"
"Same to you!"

"Then let's see who's more capable!"


Arthur said, leaving in anger.

Watching his back, Ella lowered her eyes and punched the blanket. "You always side with your mistress!"

A knock on the door.

Lily poked her head in, relieved to see Arthur gone. "How are you feeling?”


"Terrible,actually!"

Ella told her about Leo.

Lily was indignant. "They're really messing around! Let's go find Alan!"

Alan and Arthur were both sponsors of the show, so they had considerable influence.

Ella changed clothes and went to Alan's room.

"You want Leo to stay?" Alan stood up abruptly, backing away as if he didn't want to be involved. "Don't get me in trouble, he's just an intern,not important at all!"
"How can it not be important when it concerns his future?" Ella got angrier. "The job market is tough, and Leo worked hard to get this job!"

Thinking that Leo was implicated because of her, she felt very guilty.


Ella looked sincere. "You know my status, so..."

"Ella, Leo also begged me yesterday, but I really can't decide. Don't make
it hard for me. If you really want him to stay, you know who to ask for help!"

Who was that? It was obvious Arthur.

Ella refused. "I don't want to!"

"Then think it over. I really can't help!"


Alan ran away.

Lily pouted. "Both are sponsors, but the difference is huge!"

Because of Robert's matter. Ella couldn't livestream on time, and the show invited a guest to replace her.
The guest started recording, and Ella could only watch and join the next livestream.

Just as well. she wasn't feeling well and needed a break.

She stayed in her room, opened her laptop, and watched the livestream.


This time the guest was a male designer.

He studied abroad and returned to start his own studio.

Now he was somewhat famous, designing custom pieces for many celebrities.

His clothes were the highlight of major award shows.

Ella watched his livestream, taking notes, and in just an hour, she learned a lot.

In the meantime, Ava ran into trouble.
During a break. Ava called her family, and her brother Terry Davis answered.
"Ava, didn't you always want to teach Arthur's wife a lesson? I helped you this time. I gave a bunch of problematic medicine to her, guaranteed to hurt for a while!"

Ava listened. puzzled, and asked again.
###Chapter 72
Terry accidentally ran into an elderly woman who was looking for fertility medication for her granddaughter. After chatting with her. Terry discovered that she was Arthur's grandmother-in-law.
Without a second thought, he handed over a sketchy prescription.


Once taken, this med would cause some serious pain.

Ava heard everything clearly, but her mind was a mess.

After hanging up. she just sat there, stunned. 'What's the deal between Ms.Worry-Free and Arthur? Could it be just a coincidence?'
Terry had prescribed the meds for Arthur's wife, but now Ms. Worry-Free was in agony and bleeding.
She shivered, her eyes determined. "Connection or not, I'm gonna find out by testing it!"

Footsteps echoed.
She turned and her eyes brightened. "Lily, what are you doing here? How

s Ms.Worry-Free?"

"None of your business!"

Lily shot her a look and started to leave.

Seeing this, Ava quickly followed. "What are you talking about? We're on the same team. I heard she took some meds. What kind? She was covered in blood yesterday, it was horrifying!"

"Not your concern! Stop prying!" Lily snapped.
"You..."

Lily was surprisingly stubborn.

Watching Lily walk away. Ava fumed and headed upstairs.


A knock on the door.
Ella quickly threw on a hat. sunglasses, and a mask, opened the door, and frowned. "What do you want?"

"Just checking on you!"

Ava strolled in, looking around. "Guess you got lucky,moving close to Arthur because of your health!"

Ella asked again. "What do you want?"

"Come on. we're friends. Can't I visit without a reason?" Ava grabbed Ella's hand. "Your statement yesterday was scary, what happened?"

"None of your business!"

Ava was speechless hearing that again.

'No wonder you and Lily are friends. Both so annoying.

She forced a smile. "I'm just worried about you. I heard you took some harmful meds. You're so young, why take meds?"

"Get out, I'm busy!"

Ella shook off her hand and sat by the computer, focusing on the screen.


The live broadcast was still going.
Ella glanced at her. "Don't you need to join the live broadcast?"

"Of course not! With Arthur's support. I can do whatever I want!" Ava studied Ella closely.

But her face was covered,showing no expression.

The room was super quiet, only the live broadcast playing.


Then,the door opened.

Both looked towards the door.

Arthur, in a custom suit, with a stern face, frowned at Ava. "What are you doing here?"

"I'm here to see Ms. Worry-Free! What about you?"

Ava quickly moved to grab Arthur's arm.

Arthur stepped back, his gaze shifting to Ella. "Alright, you've seen her,now go back. I need to talk to Ms. Worry-Free!"

"I..."
Arthur didn't give Ava a chance to speak, pushing her out and closing the door.

Ava was too mad to speak.

Arthur had kicked her out.

What did they want to talk about?

Panic surged in her, and she pressed her ear to the door.
Inside. Ella looked up at Arthur. "Do you need something?"

"It's settled. I'vre told HR. Leo's out tomorrow!" Arthur's words were blunt.

Ella was shocked and snapped, "How could you? You know he's innocent.yet you..."
"Innocent? Who said that? I'm done talking about this. I'm here to give you this!" He pulled a box of medicine from his pocket and set it on the table. "Take it on time!"

Ella glanced at the label and sighed. "Can't we talk this out?"

"What do you think?" Arthur smirked and then took off her hat and mask."No need to hide."

He leaned in, locking eyes with her. "Why do you want to be a stand-in?Go home. I'll take care of you!"

He placed a no-limit credit card on the table.

Ella didn't even glance at it. "I'm a person, not a pet. I don't need you to take care of me, and we're getting divorced soon!"

The word "divorce" seemed to hit a nerve.

Arthur stood up, a cold smile on his face. "I also wanted to tell you the investigation results. It was your grandmother who found the doctor! Do you really need the child?"

Same old topic.
Ella lowered her eyesand shook her head.′′No!′′

Talking about kids was pointless when they were getting divorced.
For a moment, they both fel into an awkward silence.


Then, a warm flow came from under Ella.

Her forehead broke out in cold sweat, and she curled up in pain.

Arthur stepped forward. looking grim. "You're in pain again, maybe you should go to the hospital!"
"No need! Don't you trust your medical team?" Ella staggered back to bed and pulled the blanket over herself. "You should go. I need to rest!"

"Tll stay with you."

He lifted the blanket to get on the bed.

Just then, there was a knock on the door.

Before they could say anything. Ava pushed the door open and walked in.

Arthur quickly tidied up the blanket. "Ms. Worry-Free is a guest on our show,we need to take good care of her. or it'll hurt our repuItation!"

It sounded more like a forced excuse.
Ava smiled. "I know, let's go grab some food, someone prepared afternoon tea!"


"This..."

Arthur was about to refuse.

Ella spoke first, "You two go, I need to rest!"

"Arthur, Ms. Worry-Free needs to rest during her period, let's not disturb her!"
They left the room.

Ella's eyes dimmed. "He really only cares about Ava!"


She shouldn't have had any illusions.

She covered her head with the blanket, took a few deep breaths,and tried to calm down.


The phone rang.
Ella saw it was Sofia calling and answered, "What's up, Grandma?"


"Nothing. Arthur called me asking about the doctor, is something wrong?"

"Don't worry, nothing's wrong. It was just a colleague asking about that medicine. so I inquired with you."

"I see."

Sofia was a kind soul.

She went on and on about the doctor.

Ella's stomach pain was unbearable, cold sweat on her forehead, but when she heard the doctor's last name was Davis, her face changed.

"Are you sure it's Davis?"
"Yes, he's good-looking. I even said Arthur looks as handsome as him and showed him a photo!"
Everything clicked now, no wonder the medicine was harmful, there was a connection.
Thinking of Ava's odd behavior, Ella's face turned cold. "Grandma, I have
###Chapter 73
Even on a blazing summer day. Ella felt like she was trapped in an ice cave, her hand resting on her stomach.

The panic from yesterday still clung to her heart.

Ava had kept attacking her, not letting her call for help.

If Arthur hadn't happened to pass by,she might have bled out.

She clenched her fist, her knuckles turning white. "I'm still too weak. Even if I know who hurt me, I can't get revenge!"

Ava was Arthur's lover.

Even if she messed up, he'd cover for her.

That was why she didn't tell anyone about Ava hurting her.


No one would believe her anyway.

After a night's sleep, Ella felt a bit better and headed to the living room.


Everyone was still live streaming.

Ella saw Alan sitting nearby and walked over. "You seem pretty chill?"


"Not too bad!"
Alan crossed his legs and scooted over. "Don't drag me into trouble. And why do you always cover up so much every day?"
If it was to hide her identity before, now that Arthur knew,why bother?


His face was full of curiosity.
Ella tapped him on the head. "None of your business! Let's talk about Ava.Why does she want to get into the entertainment industry? Isn't her family loaded?"
"You don't get it. She's chasing her dreams. The Davis family is into all sorts of stuff..."
Alan was a chatterbox; once you got him started, he could go on forever.

Ella patiently listened, and after a while, she finally got the info she wanted.

Someone in the Davis family really studied medicine.

Even though it was a branch family, the Davis family was small andI close-knit, with all family members gathering every year.
"Is the Davis family good at medicine?" Ella suddenly asked.

Alan grinned. "You asked the right guy. Back then, when Arthur was in poor health. the Davis family even helped him."

Another long-winded story.

Hearing about the past between Ava and Arthur, her face stayed blank."Let's talk about work."

She joined the show to gain fame and open up the market.

A few days had passed, and while Worry-Free Studio's fame hadn't increased much, Ms. Worry-Free had already become famous.
Especially notable was the growing number of fans of both Ms. Worry-Free and Arthur, many of whom hoped they would be together.
Alan patted Ella's shoulder. "If you really want to get famous,you two could join variety shows, like dating shows or adventure shows."
Ella looked at the hand on her shoulder, about to speak when a shadow loomed over her.

Looking up. she saw Arthur's stern face.

"What are you talking about? Having fun?"

Arthur glanced at Alan's hand. "If you don't want it, I can chop it off!"

Alan shivered and quickly pulled his hand back. "Even though this hand doesn't do much. I still like it!"

"Stop talking nonsense!"
Arthur pulled Alan aside and sat down himself. "There's a bonfire party tonight! There's going to be an elimination round soon, so we want everyone to get to know each other better!"

Ella stood up. "Got it!"

She turned to leave.
Arthur's face darkened, staring at her back. "Great, giving me the cold shoulder for a guy!"
With no one around, he spoke freely, even with a tone of reprimand.

"Think whatever you want; I'm exhausted!" With that, Ella quickened her pace and left.

Alan shivered,glancing between Arthur and Ella.
"Man. you care about Ella. but you act all cold. And everyone knows Leo's innocent, so why are you still hung up on it?"

This couple was really something.

They kept their feelings bottled up, almost driving him nuts.

Alan patted Arthur's shoulder, but seeing the cold look in his eyes, he quickly pulled his hand back.

"If you keep this up, you'll really end up divorced!"


"You think I'm scared?"

Arthur lazily sprawled on the sofa, lighting a cigarette.

Amidst the swirling smoke, his handsome face looked frosty.


Alan was speechless.

"If you're not scared, why worry?"

Arthur kicked him. "Stop talking nonsense!"

"Fine, think about it yourself! Anyway, if Leo leaves, your problems will only get worse!"

With that. Alan turned and left.

Arthur took a deep drag on his cigarette, exhaling. "So stubborn!"

His jaw tightened, his face cold, eyes narrowed for a while, then he sighed and headed upstairs.
When the door opened again, Ella looked impatient. "What do you want?If you don't want others to know about our relationship, stay away from me!"

"Just because of Leo?"

"So what if it is!"
As she spoke. Ella suddenly felt a sharp pain in her stomach,sweat streaming down her forehead.
She tried to get to bed to rest. but her legs gave out, and she fell forward.

Just when she thought she would fall embarrassingly,his hand wrapped around her waist. holding her in his arms.

The sound of a pounding heart echoed.

Ella hit his solid chest, her nose tingling, and a warm flow trickled from her nose.

Touching it, she saw a bright red stain.


She had a nosebleed.

Ella. feeling weak, leaned against him. "Take me to the bathroom!"


"Okay!"

Arthur picked her up gently, treating her like a rare treasure.

Ella suppressed the strange feeling in her heart, entered the bathroom, and turned on the faucet to splash water on her face.

The bright red blood quickly washed away.

Arthur's hand began to roam restlessly over her body.
His long fingers moved from her calf up to her thigh, finally resting pussy.


The scenes from last night flashed through his mind.

Ella pushed him away with all her strength. "Don't mess around, it's daytime!"

"I can't help it! You're too tempting!"

The two were tightly embraced.

Arthur kept swvallowing, a wave of heat spreading from his heart, his grip tightening.holding her in his arms.
His thin lips pressed against her face, leaving a light kiss, then slowly moved to her earlobe.

Though they hadn't had much contact since getting married, they were very familiar with each other's bodies.

Arthur's hot breath sprayed in Ella's ear.

She trembled all over, her body going weak, almost collapsíng to the ground.
Arthur held her hips, placing her on the sink. Then, as if thinking of something, he quickly laid a towel under her.

"Not cold now,right?"

Arthur's deep,hoarse voice was full of desire.

Ella's cheeks turned red, lightly biting her lower lip, her soft body seemingly devoid of strength, hanging onto Arthur.
d-
"Today you don't have to move.I'll take care of you!

With that, his passionate kisses trailed from her red lips,down her slender neck. and over her full chest.continuing their descent.
###Chapter 74
When Arthur's lips brushed against her stomach. Ella shivered and shoved his head away. "No!"
"Relax. I won't go too far," Arthur's voice was rough, his eyes filled with desire as he looked at her flushed face. "You're getting more and more irresistible!"

"You!"
Arthur's voice was tempting, but his eyes, filled with lust, were even more SO.
Ella's cheeks turned crimson, and she clung tightly to Arthur's shirt."I don't need this!"

"But I do," Arthur's hands moved expertly over her body, finally resting on her full breasts.

He squeezed them firmly.

Ella trembled, her body melting, her limbs wrapping around Arthur like an octopus. "I don'tfeel well!"
At that moment, a warm flow emerged;blood stained the towel.

Arthur's gaze froze, and he chuckled. "I'll come to youtonight,get some rest first!"

Gaining her freedom, Ella dashed back to bed, wrapping herself up tightly.

Seeing Ella's frightened look, he lowered his eyes. "I'm looking into that doctor.Don't worry!"
Cer With Arthur's abilities, could he really not find out about that Dr. Davis?He just wanted to hide the truth.
Having made up her mind. Ella weakly waved her hand. "I just want to rest now."

After taking two pills and a nap. Ella felt refreshed.

She looked satisfied, as if she had been nourished by Arthur.

Lily came over, poking her face. "Come on, did you two sleep together again? How dare you during your period..."
"Don't talk nonsense!" Ella covered her mouth. "If this gets out, how will I face anyone!"
"You two are legally married, what's there to be afraid of! If it gets out, it's that mistress who should be ashamed!"
Seeing Lily wouldn't stop, Ella put her finger on her lips. "Be careful not to be heard!"

Arthur's angry look from last time was still vivid in her mind.

Lily pouted, "I suggest you conquer him in bed, then see who can compete with you?"
Saying this, she took out her phone. "I follow a blogger who gives all kinds of relationship advice, teaching women how to handle men! If you want to help Leo and become famous through this show, you should prepare!"

She added, "Even if you don't want special treatment, just asking for fairness is good."
Ella's eyes lit up. "Yes, asking forfairness is easy!"

Her mind was already filled with countless ideas.

At that moment, a warm sensation from her lower body brought her back to reality.

"I'm not feeling well right now!"

"How silly, who said you have to make love with him! You can use your hands!"

Hearing Lily's suggestive words, Ella blushed. Thinking of their actions last night, she lowered her head.

Lily kept talking, not noticing her change.


Time flew by.

The bonfire party was about to start.

Seeing Ella still wanting to wear sportswear, Lily grabbed her clothes. "You have to be sexy today! Even if you don't show your faces, you need to show off your good figures!"

"But my..."
"Don't be afraid, and don't be ashamed because of your period, just listen to me!"

Lily quickly walked over and took out a spaghetti strap dress.

Two minutes later, Ella stood in front of the mirror, looking at her graceful figure,feelíng uncomfortable.
"Is it really okay to wear this?"

"You're stunningly beautiful! Come on, you designed this dress yourself.You really don't want to wear it? I swear, you'll definitely outshine everyone!"

The bonfire party was held in the garden of the estate.

The open space was filled with flowers, red wine, and colorful lights,dreamy and romantic.

Everyone dressed up for the party, with exquisite makeup and various dresses. while the men wore casual clothes.

Handsome men and beautiful women gathered, making a pleasing sight.

As everyone held their glasses and chatted, two figures entered their view.

"She's so beautiful! That woman's figure is so curvy, especially that waist,so slender!"

"What are you talking about, I think her long legs wrapped around my waist would be amazing!"

The men's eyes were already drawn to Ella.

Ava looked up and saw Ella in the distance, gritting her teeth in anger.

Today,she had specially dressed in a fishtail dress with tassels at the hem.sparkling as she moved, attracting attention.

When she first appeared, everyone praised her.

But with Ella's appearance, she instantly became a backdrop.
Her face changed. and she glanced at Arthur, seeing the infatuation in his eyes,her heart filled with worry.

Feeling many gazes on her, Ella fet a bit uneasy.

She held Lily's hand nervously. "Is it really okay to wear this?"

"Of course, can't you see? They're all mesmerized, you've successfully attracted everyone! You're the most beautiful woman!"

The two beauties standing together were particularly eye-catching.

Ella wore a red spaghetti strap dress, uniquely designed with a low neckline, high slit, and an open back.
Her smooth skin glowed under the lights, highlighting her long neck and full chest. Moreover, her slender waist and long legs were equally captivating.

The dress highlighted her curves perfectly.

Her long hair flowed, and as a breeze blew, it swayed gently.

Ella casually brushed her hair, her movements seductive and charming.causing gasps from the crowd even though her face was not visible.
Next to her, Lily wore a sleeveless dress, exuding a strong career woman vibe.
The two stood together, each exuding a distinct aura, with their own unique style.

"Let's go! Dazzle them! And see if Arthur will get jealous!"

Lily linked arms with Ella and walked forward, glancing at Arthur in the
distance.
Seeing him staring at Ella without blinking, she smirked, "Arthur is indeed jealous tonight!"

"Really?"

Ella tilted her head in doubt.

But when she sensed a cold gaze, she calmly walked towards the crowd."

Hello everyone,are we late?"

"No! The live broadcast is about to start, everyone watch your words!"


The director knew how to attract viewers, always thinking about giving fans benefits.

The live broadcast started, and the camera panned over all the guests.


When the viewers saw everyone's attire, they screamed.

With handsome men and beautiful women, each one was unbeatable.

[I need to do more good deeds in this life, so I can be a handsome man or beautiful woman in the next!]
[So beautiful. Ava is glowing! Ava is the best! Tonight she has to be with Mr. Smith! They must show off their love and make others jealous!]
###Chapter 75
[Ms. Worry-Free needs to keep it up too! Let's see whose love is sweeter!]


The netizens were initially just admiring their looks tonight.

But then, fans of Ms. Worry-Free and Ava started bickering.

On one side, you had Ava, the rising star in the entertainment world,known for her beauty and kind heart, which earned her a massive fanbase.To fans. Ava and Arthur were the perfect couple.
On the other side, Ella didn't have a huge following, but her fans were fierce with their words.

Both sides quickly flooded the screen with snarky comments.

The director stood off to the side, grinning like a Cheshire cat.

The more they argued, the more popular the live stream got.


He couldn't stop smiling at the sight.

Ella was oblivious to all this. She wandered into the crowd, grabbed a piece of cake, and took a bite. "This is really good, so delicious!"

She didn't even glance in Arthur's direction.

Ava's eyes darted around, and she cozied up to Arthuar. "Do you think Ms.Worry-Free looks good? It's a shame we can't see her face."

As she spoke, she kept sneaking peeks at his expression.

Seeing no change, she let out a quiet sigh of relief. She had been suspecting that Ms. Worry-Free and Arthur's wife were the same person.

Now it seemed she was overthinking it.

Realizing this, she laughed heartily. "Arthur, let's go barbecue!"


"Okay! You go ahead."

Arthur said casually, then walked in the other direction towards Ella.

Ava looked annoyed and wanted to follow, but someone blocked her way.

Everything was perfect: tasty food, fine wine, and dazzling lights.

Ella held a glass of juice, looking a bit regretful. "It's a pity I can't drink today. otherwise, I'd definitely drink to my heart's content!"

"With your body, you still want to get drunk!"

Seeing someone approaching, Lily raised an eyebrow. "The opportunity is right in front of you. don't miss it!"

"What?"
Ella hadn't figured out what was going on when Lily turned and left.

She was still standing there blinking when a coat with a familiar scent was draped over her shoulders.

The coat still had Arthur's warmth.

She was stunned, and just as she was about to turn around, Arthur's solid chest pressed against her.

Even through two layers of fabric, she could feel his burning body."Dressed like this, what are you trying to do? Meeting another man?"

Arthur's last words were slow and hoarse, with a hint of threat.

His breath enveloped her tightly. Ella trembled all over and hadn't yet explained when his other hand grabbed her waist under the cover of the wide coat.

"I didn't! And there's nothing wrong with my outfit!"

Clearly, everyone was dressed provocatively,so why single her out alone?

Ella felt indignant and wanted to say more, but the hand on her waist tightened, holding her firmly in his arms.

"Long legs, high slit, and an open back."

With each word, the surrounding air grew colder.

In the scorching summer, Ella even felt like she was falling into an ice cave.her hair standing on end. She subtly shifted, attempting to distance herself from him.

But Arthur's hand was lke a clamp on her waist.


"Don't move,or else..."

The threat was clear.

Even without turning around, Ella could imagine Arthur's cold gaze.

She stood there obediently. "If you don't like it, I'll change next time!"


"These clothes are only for me to see!"

As he spoke, his hand wandered over her smooth back and slender waist,
finally resting on her long, beautiful legs. Wherever his hand touched, it left a burning sensation.
The two stood there in an close posture, and the photographer immediately focused the camera on them.
From a distance, their conversation couldn't be heard clearly, but their posture was suggestive.
In the dim light. Ella was wrapped up tightly, her face obscured,but she leaned weakly against Arthur.

Arthur, on the other hand, held her in his embrace.

He tilted his head close to her ear, whispering like lovers.

The viewers in the live stream couldn't stay calm after seeing this.

[They're clearly not doing anything, but it feels like they're doing everything! Where is Mr. Smith hand? What's he doing!]

[This is too suggestive; I am even watching this for free!]


[Some people are going to cry!]
[Those people always hype up Ava and Mr. Smith being together.What a joke! Ms. Worry-Free and he are the perfect couple!]

Ella and Arthur's fans kept screaming.

Meanwhile, Ava's fans immediately started to call Arthur a scumbag in the comments,

The screen was extremely lively. In the corner. Ava watched all this.
Seeing the two in an intimate posture, her eyes were full of resentment."Bitch,how dare you steal my man!"

A cold laugh echoed behind her.

Ava was startled and turned to see Lily after she said this.
Ava looked disdainful. "What are you doing here? Did your boss abandon you!"
"Stop talking nonsense! I'm here to enjoy your jealous look! Jealousy makes you ugly, look at your face, so ugly..."

"You're talking nonsense!"

Every woman cared about her appearance.

Ava was so angry that she raised her hand high, about to hit Lily.


"Think you can hit me? Dream on!"

Lily had been waiting for this moment for a long time. Seeing Ava make the first move, she rushed forward.

In the corner, they started fighting.

Women fighting usually involved slapping and pulling hair.

In the blink of an eye, with her height advantage, Lily only got a few scratches on her arm, while Ava was in a bad state, with disheveled hair and messy clothes.

The director quickly called the cameraman seeing this. [What are they doing? Workplace bullying. Ms. Worry-Free stealing Ava's man. Lily bullying Ava, neither of them is a good person!]
[It is workplace bullying, you two get out of the show.] Ava's fans, full of anger with nowhere to vent, finally found an outlet.
The director was very pleased and walked over with a smile. "We're all colleagues.why are you two fighting?"
He thought. 'Come on, speak up, boost the ratings.

Meanwhile, Ella was trembling all over. Just as Arthur was about to kiss her earlobe, her body went weak, almost falling to the ground.
Fortunately, Arthur quickly held her waist. "You're too sensitive!"


"You!"
Ella. angry like a ruffled cat, pushed him away forcefully,but caught a glimpse of Lily's situation, her face changing.

"You'd better not protect Ava in everything."

Leaving a sentence, she quickly ran away in high heels.

In her haste, the coat on her shoulder fell to the ground.

Arthur stood rooted to the spot, gazing at the smooth expanse of her back.His throat tightened, his jaw clenched, and a look of displeasure crossed his face.
###Chapter 76
"Lily, what's the deal between us? Why are you always gunning for me?I just want to get along with everyone!"
Ava's eyes welled up as she bit her lip, looking all innocent in front of the camera.
Lily scoffed,hands on her hips, oozing confidence. "Cut the act. If you love drama so much.go to Hollywood. Why stay here pretending?"

Lily was fierce, while Ava played the victim.

And naturally. some folks felt sorry for the underdog.


Soon enough. a guy stepped up to defend Ava.

"You're too much, always picking on Ava. Apologize now, or else..."


"Or else what!"
Ella rushed over, cutting him off. She quickly checked Lily for any injuries and sighed in relief. "When will you learn to stop throwing punches so easily!"
"I can't help it, she just asks for it!" Lily blinked innocently. "I can't stand her bullying you!"
Ava was clearly the one causing trouble, but she always acted like someone was stealing her man, which wvas just gross.

"How can you treat me like this? Look at me, I might be scarred for life!"


Looks were everything to Ava.
She suddenly sat down, covering her face and crying.

Her face was hidden. but her shaking shoulders made a lot of guys feel bad for her.

Just then, the crowd parted.

Arthur strode in. looking aloof. He first went to Ella, draped a coat over her. then walked to Ava. "Ava, are you okay?"

Everyone watched with knowing looks.

"Arthur. I'm so scared!"

Ava raised her tear-streaked face and threw herself into Arthur's arms,clinging to his waist.

Lily was about to charge over in anger.

Ella grabbed her arm and shook her head. "Don't make a scene, there are cameras!"

The director was too thrilled to speak.

'The more drama, the better,' he thought, hoping for more conflict.


But things didn't go his way.
Ella shielded Lily behind her and coughed, "As you said,we're all colleagues. If you're hurt,go to the hospital!"

"You're bullying me too much! Arthur, I'm scared!"


Ava cried,clinging to Arthur.

The scene got awkward, Arthur's cold gaze landing on Lily. "You're causing trouble, and people like you don't belong here..."


"Wait!"
Ella wasn't fazed by his cold stare, looking him straight in the eye. "How do you know it's Lily causing trouble?"

The place went silent.

Arthur raised an eyebrow, full of disdain.

He sneered, his eyes cold. "What do you think?"


"I don't know!"
Ella's gaze shifted to Alan. "Say something. Lily means a lot to me. If she goes.we go too!"

Alan thought, 'Oh come on. what am I supposed to say?

He wiped the sweat from his forehead, forcing a smile. "It's just a small issue, not a big deal! Let's all calm down!"

"You're biased! I'm almost disfigured!"

Ava stubbornly showed her face, wiping her tears to reveal red marks.

Thinking of the slaps, Lily sneered, "Disfigured? With that face, if it scars,you should thank me for giving you a reason for plastic surgery! And..."
Lily didn't want to drag Ella into this mess, so she stepped out from behind her and faced the camera. "You better hit the hospital ASAP, or those marks will fade!"

[Lily's got a way with words!] [Totally, it's just some red marks. Disfigurement? That's a stretch!]

[Without knowing the full story, no comment! But yeah, it does seem over the top.]

Comments started pouring in again.
Alan glanced between Ella and Arthur. internally groaning, 'What are these two up to? It is still unknown whether Leo will be fired, and now Lily's causing more drama.
He tried to smooth things over. "Today's supposed to be a happy day, let's keep it going and deal with this later!"

"Fine!"
Alan thought Arthur would push back, but surprisingly, he agreed. Giving Ella and the crowd a long look, Arthur said, "Get Ava some medicine!"

"Got it!"
Arthur's assistant came over, respectfully addressing Ava. "Ms. Davis,please!"

Ava was speechless.

She was slapped a few times, and that's it?'

She looked pitifully at Arthur."Arthur,I..."

Arthur's voice dropped, eyes complicated, "Finish tonight's recording first!"


Work came first.

Ava reluctantly left.
Passing by Ella, she shot her a disdainful look but said nothing.


The drama ended, and everyone dispersed.
Lily proudly raised her chin. "Not bad, that jerk actually showed some improvement today."

At least she wasn't fired on the spot.

Ella's mouth twitched. "You caused this mess for me again?"

"Of course! That mistress needs to know you're not to be messed with!"

"Right. I'm not to be messed with. Now, can I eat some meat?"


Arthur,who had just walked a short distance, stopped.

Hearing Ella's words, he smiled, eyes twinkling with amusement, and turned back.

"Let's go have a barbecue!"

He didn't wait for Ella to respond, grabbing her wrist and leading her to the bonfire.

Lily smiled at the sight.

At the bonfire party, several small grills were set up for barbecuing.


Ella was dragged to one.

She looked reluctant. "What do you want to do?"

"Just barbecuing! Didn't you say you wanted meat?"

Arthur said it matter-of-factly, then sat down,rolling up his sleeves,and started skewering meat.
Even with his noble demeanor, he made everything look good.

Ella glanced at him, and despite knowing Arthur was a scumbag,she had to admit he was really handsome.

Every move exuded grace.
When skewering meat, he was so focused, like he was handling a billion-dollar project.
Under the firelight, his usually cold face softened, with strong features,a high nose. and a firm jawline.

She couldn't get enough of looking at him.

Unconsciously, her eyes seemed glued to him.

Arthur, sensing her intense gaze, smiled and turned back.


Their eyes met.
Arthur's deep eyes sparkled, his smile warm like spring sunshine, while Ella tilted her head, her expression unclear, but her actions showed deep affection.

The fire crackled, illuminating the two.

They were so close, everything around seemed to disappear, leaving only the two of them.
Heartbeats quickened, as if her heart were about to leap out of her chest.


Ella moved her lips, her body heating up,feeling restless.
###Chapter 77


when everyone thought Ms. Worry-Free's hat would fly off, she casually reached up and held it down, much to the disappointment of the live stream eors.
[For once, I wisn the wind was stronger so we could see their eyes meet!]

[That scene was so beautiful. Mr. Smith's gaze was so tender and affectionate,but we missed Ms. Worry-Free's expression!]

The viewers and the director were bummed out.

He even told the cameraman to keep a close watch on Arthur and Ella.

The camera seemed glued to Ella and Arthur, leaving the other guests feeling ignored and annoyed.
They were part of the show too. after all. Could they get some screen time?


The beef on the grill soon started to smell amazing.


Ella couldn't help but swallow.

Arthur noticed and handed her a piece. "Try it!"

'The meat's cooked, but it needs some flavor,' she thought.

Ella hesitated for a moment. Arthur, thinking she was shy, put a skewer right in her hand. "Come on, eat up, or you'll get too hungry!" Ella whispered, "Arthur, this needs seasoning!"

She sprinkled some barbecue seasoning on the meat.

The aroma filled the air. and the meat sizzled, getting even tastier.

Ella lifted her mask, took a bite, and nodded in satisfaction. "Now this is real barbecue. You should try it too!"

They'd been married for years and had their little habits.

She was so into the food she forgot they were on camera and brought the skewer to Arthur's mouth.

Arthur was surprised but took a bite.

A look of surprise crossed his face, followed by a smile. "Not bad, it's really good! Eat more..."
He leaned in close and whispered, "How about we work off those calories later with something a bit more... intimate?"

His words were teasing.
Ella rolled her eyes and took the skewer back,eating it all out of spite.

Their interaction didn't go unnoticed, especially by the live stream viewers.

The fact that they shared a skewer made it clear their relationship was special.

Soon, the skewer-sharing moment was trending.

Arthur and Ella were too busy enjoying their food to notice.

Before long, they were stuffed. Ella's tight dress felt even tighter, and evenwith Arthur's jacket over her, her full belly was obvious.

She leaned back in her chair, closing her eyes to rest.

Meanwhile. Arthur grabbed his laptop and started working.

They interacted like a couple married for years, not talking much but in perfect sync.
[They totally look like a married couple. They don't need to talk much to get each other!]

|Yeah, they seem like a perfect couple!]

The viewers were puzzled by their dynamic.


Ava was even more confused.
She had gone to apply some medicine, but when she looked in the mirror,the red marks on her body had disappeared, making her so mad she smashed a cup.
The show was still rolling, and she was worried about Arthur and Ella spending too much tíme together, so she rushed back, only to find them getting along perfectly.

Her eyes turned red, and she clenched her teeth.

"Ava, what's up? You look so upset!" Andy and Jessa walked over.

They were all dressed to the nines today and looked stunning, but they didn't expect Ella to steal the spotlight.

Seeing Ava standing alone, they quickly surrounded her. 
"Come on, cheer up and have some fun!"

"Yeah! Their being together is probably just a publicity stunt for the show.As Arthur's partner, you should be more generous and not let it get to you!11

They seemed to be comforting her, but they were actually stirring the pot.

Ava quickly composed herself and said calmly, "Even though I know it's just for the show. I'm still a bit worried! Ms. Worry-Free is still on her period.eating too much isn't good for her health!"

"Yeah!"

Andy's eyes lit up.

In two days, it would be the elimination round.

She wasn't as popular as Ms. Worry-Free, and compared to Cecília, she was even less notable.

Thinking about the upcoming elimination, she was so worried that she couldn't sleep.
Now the opportunity to eliminate a competitor was right in front of her.

She rolled her eyes and lowered her voice, "Should we do something to punish the mistress?"

"Don't do anything rash!"

Ava pretended to be scared. "I have a family member who studies medicine, and in such cases, the intake of certain prohibited drugs can not only harm her body but also lead to infertility!"
"What kind of drugs? Tell me. it's always good to learn more knowledge."


They understood each other's hidden meaning.


They chatted for a long time.

Jessa stood by,trembling with fear.

What are they planning? Are they going to drug Ms. Worry-Free? I'm just an assistant and don't want to get involved in such things.
Halfway through the live broadcast, the director took out a megaphone. "After spending a few days together, everyone has gotten to know each other well. Now let's play some music and dance! I hope everyone has a pleasant evening!"
The lights around them dimmed instantly, and a spotlight was set up in the center of the stage.
The director took a lady's hand and walked onto the stage first. As the melodious music played, they began to dance gracefully.
Ella heard the music and opened her eyes, contemplating whether to go back and rest early when a strong arm appeared in front of her.

"You..."
Arthur was dressed casually, with his sleeves rolled up, revealing his toned forearms.

As Ella was thinking, Arthur bent down and leaned close to her face.

His deep eyes stared straight at her, his tone leaving no room for refusal,"Give me your hand!"
The romantic atmosphere vanished in an instant.


Ella reluctantly gave her hand to him.
They walked onto the stage hand in hand, their fingers interlocked.dancing gracefully to the music.
While dancing, they were very close, their foreheads gently touching,their breaths mingling. Sometimes, when they turned, Arthur would deliberately brush his nose against her head.
At first. Ella's movements were a bit stiff, but she quickly adapted to the rhythm.

Her dance was light and graceful, her body flexible.

Even through his sunglasses, Arthur could feel her joy.

During a music change, he pulled her into his arms and whispered in her ear. "Do you like dancing?"

"No!"

"You're lying!"
Ella's fragrance lingered at his nose, and Arthur's throat tightened. His hand wandered over her body under the cover of his broad clothes.

Ella felt weak from his touch and angrily said,"Stop!"


"I can't help it! You're too sexy!"

"You!"
###Chapter 78
On stage, with the crowd's eyes glued to them, a cameraman trailed Ella and Arthur.
Arthur's hands roamed all over her, and Ella felt a wave of weakness wash over her. Her face turned red, and she almost let out a moan.
Good thing she had on sunglasses and a mask, so no one could see her face. Otherwise, she'd be dying of embarrassment.

Ella felt herself getting weaker and weaker.

When the music changed, she wrapped her arms around Arthur's neck."Cut it out. I can't handle this anymore!"
Right after she said that, Arthur's hand slipped under her skirt.


Ella shivered and let out a moan she couldn't hold back.

Luckily, the music was loud enough to cover it.

But Arthur heard it loud and clear, and he smirked as he held her close.


They were pressed together like lovers.

[I swear, these two are a thing!]

[Anyone tries to break them up, and I'll fight them!]


[They look like a married couple! So cute!]

Arthur was lost in the music, while Ella was praying for it to end and save her from this awkwardness. Maybe the director heard her prayers because the music stopped.


Everyone on stage went back to their spots.

Ella was totally drained, and Arthur held her close.

She was so embarrassed, she buried her face in his chest and pinched his waist. "You're making me look so bad!"

'Isn't he worried Ava will get jealous?'

Just as she thought that, she felt someone glaring at her.


She turned and saw Ava's twisted face.


'How ridiculous.'

She ignored it and pinched Arthur's waist again.


To Arthur, it was just a tickle.

He wasn't mad at all; he just laughed.

Back at their seats, Arthur gently helped her sit down. "Eat something to get your strength back! We're not done yet tonight!"

Thinking about last night's embarrassing scene, Ella blushed.

With her sunglasses and mask on, Arthur couldn't see her face.

Ella took a few deep breaths, got some strength back, and sipped some juíce.

"This juice tastes weird," she said.

"I'll get you another one!"
Arthur got up, but Ella grabbed his hand. "Maybe it's just been sitting out too long. It's fine."
The staff was really attentive; the juice was just warm.

Ella, super thirsty, drank the whole glass.


"I need to hit the restroom!"

Ella wanted to change her pad, but found she didn't need to.

What's going on? It's only the second day, and it's gone.'

Sitting on the toilet, she checked her body. It seemed impossible, but it was true.

Could it be a side effect of the meds?

Since her period was over, she decided not to worry about it.


She'd see the doctor after the show.


Ella washed up her hands.

When she got back to her seat, Arthur sniffed. "It's gone?"


Ella froze,not getting it at first.

Arthur wrapped his arm around her waist and whispered in her ear."Your period's over?"

Jerk.'

They'd been married for years, but he still didn't really know her.

Thinking about their upcoming divorce, Ella didn't dwell on it and just nodded.

"Tll come to you tonight!"

"What! But there's still the thing with Leo and Lily."

"Do you have to ruin my good mood? Let's see how you do tonight."

Ella was already stressing about the evening when Leo rushed over.

He held a glass of juice. "The director talked to me, thanks for speaking up for me! This job means a lot to me!"
He glanced at Arthur. "I tried to be nice to Ms. Worry-Free because of what the director said. If I cause any trouble, I'm sorry!"

He sounded sincere.
Ella waved it off. "It's no big deal, just do your job well! If there are any issues with your fiancee's wedding dress, let's talk it out!"

"Thanks,Ms.Worry-Free!"

Leo quickly left, sensing Arthur's dislike.

The vibe between Ella and Arthur got awkward, losing the earlier sweetness.

It felt like they were in a weird silence.

The director noticed the viewer count dropping and kept scratching his head.

As night fell, the live stream was about to end,and the director gathered everyone for a chat.
Ella finally got a chance to escape Arthur and went to Lily.


They had so much to talk about.
Lily couldn't stop. "How's it going? Did you win him over? Perform well tonight! Convince him in bed, and everything will be easier!"

Ella felt the pressure.
She just smiled. "What about you? Did you get anything tonight? I saw you with Cecilia and the others."

"No choice, they're seniors! We have to grow slowly!"


They quickly started discussing work.

Then a shadow loomed over them.

They looked up to see Andy, smiling.

"Hello, we have an elimination round in two days, hope to exchange more with you!"

She was fishing for information.

Ella smiled. "Sure, we can chat! I heard you're going abroad for Fashion Week soon?"

Talking about work, Andy was in her element.

While talking, she kept watching Ella's face, trying to read something.

Maybe it was her first time attempting something shady,as Andy's expression appeared uneasy.
Ella just thought she was testing her abilities and didn't think much of it. On the other side.
Hearing occasional laughter, Arthur's fingers gripped his wine glass. "So happy,huh?"

Alan was speechless.
What's going on? It's just three women talking, what's he jealous about?


Rolling his eyes, he said, "Are you two together tonight?"

Arthur downed his drink. "Mind your own business!"

"Okay, but tonight a lot of people are watching your relationship with Ella.
which is good. If you go public, your images will improve!"


Of course, if they broke up. they'd get criticized.

The internet was a double-edged sword.

Arthur sneered. "Leo can stay, but keep him away from Ella!"


"Alright! Whatever you say!"

As they were talking, someone approached.

Alan immediately stood up. "Ava's here, I'm out!"
###Chapter 79
As the night wore on. Ella kept yawning, one after another.

But Andy just wouldn't leave, talking non-stop.

Whether it was for the camera or not, she kept getting close to Ella,either on purpose or by accident.
Ella was super annoyed, worried that in her excitement. Andy might yank off her hat.

Half an hour went by.
Ella couldn't take it anymore and finally said, "We're here to chill, let's not talk about work, okay?"

"Fine! You two have fun!"

Andy got up and left in a hurry, no hesitation at all.

As she walked away, Ella and Lily exchanged a look.

"Strange things happen every year, but this year is just off the charts. Why does she act like she's on a mission?" Lily frowned. "We don't want to hurt anyone, but we still need to be careful!"
"Don't worry, you heard the convo just now, we didn't mention anything about the design drawings!"
Ella had missed a round of the competition because of Robert, believing that hard work could compensate for it.
Seeing that the program team didn't have any major activities and the live broadcast was about to end, Ella leaned close to Lily's ear."I'll head back Cen
to the studio to check on things, hit me up il anything happens!"

After saying goodbye. Ella quietly slipped away and returned to the studio.

Compared to others. Ella was a novice, so she had to work harder to keep up.
She looked at the design drawings on the table with regret. "What a shame,

I can't turn them into actual clothing!"

This was her first time making clothes for Arthur, but in the end,it never got done.
She gently brushed her fingers over the design drawings, feeling regret.


The door opened.

Arthur walked in with a smile, closing the door behind him.


"Waiting here for me alone? You're eager,huh?"

As he got closer, the smell of alcohol hit her.

Ella moved to the other side of the table, keeping her distance. "Don't mess around, I don't want anything to happen here, let's go back!"

"Okay, I'll listen to you!"

Drunk Arthur, with a blush on his face, was surprisingly agreeable.

He staggered to the desk, his eyes lighting up when he saw the design drawings. "Is this your work? What's your deal with Ms.Worry-Free?"

'Let me come up with something.'

Ella's eyes shifted, and she smiled. "Ms. Worry-Free and I are good friends, she drew these. I just redrew them. She's a bit introverted and doesn't want to be on camera!"
"Then why didn't Ms. Worry-Free come to the show? She could be dressed like you!"
Ella hesitated for a moment. "I don't know. She simply paid me to impersonate her!"

"Fine! Just think you're working too hard."

Arthur looked at Ella's scared expression, dissatisfied. "Go home, I'Il support you!"
"No need! You should leave; we're different, I'm just a contestant, but you're an investor. If you're not in your original seat, someone will look for you!"

"Alright!"
Arthur raised an eyebrow, his tone suggestive, "I'll take you somewhere later!"

"Okay!"

Arthur turned and left, and Ella let out a sigh of relief.

She carefully put away the design drafts. "I was careless, I forgot about this!"

'But should I keep hiding it? Forget it, I'm getting divorced anyway.'


She sat by the computer and started working seriously.

In another quiet room. Andy rushed over to Ava, her phone in hand, excitement all over her face.

"Quick, listen to this! I managed to plant a tiny bug on Ms. Worry-Free's clothes while we were chatting. Check out what I recorded!"

She played the recording.
Ava's eyes widened in shock when she heard Arthur's cold, familiar voice.


Tears welled up in her eyes. "She's trying to seduce Arthur!"

But from the conversation, it was clear Arthur was the one making moves on Ella.

Andy. however, didn't mention that. She was too eager. "This is our golden chance. Ms. Worry-Free used a stand-in for the competition. That isn't allowed."

The contract clearly stated that participants had to attend in person.

Ms.Worry-Free only drew the designs but didn't make the clothes.


Did that mean she's not qualified to compete?

Thinking about Ms. Worry-Free getting disqualified, Andy couldn't help but grin. "We need to use this to our advantage. I'll pull some more tricks and get both Ms. Worry-Free and her stand-in kicked out of the competition for good!"

Ava's eyes lit up. "Yes! That's a brilliant idea!"

If they could expose Ella's true identity, Arthur would definitely come back to her.

The two quickly agreed on their plan. Meanwhile. Ella, who was revising her design drawings, suddenly sneezed.



Her phone rang.

"Get to the garden, now!"

Arthur's tone was commanding.
Ella didn't want to go, but for Leo and Lily's sake, she braced herself and left the studio.

The live broadcast had ended. leaving the place a mess.

When Ella got to the garden and saw no one around,fear crept in.

Just as she pulled out her phone, a hand suddenly grabbed her and pulled her into an embrace.

Ella instinctively yelped.
But when she recognized the familiar scent, she quickly covered her mouth."You scared me. What are you doing?"
"Giving you a surprise, of course! You've been wronged. I'm taking you somewhere."


"I..."

Before Ella could finish her protest, she was shoved into a car.


The car sped off, the scenery outside blurring past.


They stopped in front of a villa.

The door opened to reveal a warmly decorated house. Ella was stunned and confused. "What's all this?"

"I know the person you care about most is your grandmother.She doesn't have to go back; she can stay here. The house has a garden and a vegetable plot. perfect for her!"

"You..."
Why the sudden change? He even arranged everything for my grandmother.'
Words stuck in her throat, Ella couldn't say a thing.

She lowered her eyes. hiding her mixed emotions.

"You're touched, so let's have a wonderful night together! Anyway, your period is over!"

Arthur pulled her into his arms and kissed her deeply.

Their lips and tongues intertwined, breaths mingling.


Ella's heart raced, her cheeks flushed.

Feeling Arthur's dominant kiss, she didn't want to back down. One hand hooked around his shoulder, the other gripped his waist tightly.

They were evenly matched, neither willing to give in.

Arthur's kiss was forceful, while Ella gently bit his lip, as if venting something.
Arthur paused for a moment, then tightened his grip on her waist, as if trying to merge her into his body.
Their bodies pressed tightly together, kissing all the way,stumbling to the sofa.
###Chapter 80
Ella was sprawled out on the couch, and Arthur was all over her, one hand gripping her waist while the other hiked up her skirt.

The sound of fabric tearing filled the room.

Ella's stunning figure was revealed, her ample chest, slender waist, and long, gorgeous legs all on display.
Arthur's throat tightened, and he started kissing her everywhere, his hands wandering freely.
In the heat of the moment, Ella let out a seductive moan, her long legs naturally wrapping around his waist.
In the throes of passion, she remembered Arthur mentioning Ava's name last time.
Ella covered his mouth and leaned up, her red lips brushing his ear as she whispered seductively, "Today, you are not allowed to call out anyone else's name!"

"Don't talk nonsense!"

Arthur looked annoyed and then touched her pussy.

He quickly stripped off his shirt and pants, revealing his penis, and made sure Ella's period was over before enteing her.

They had just been kissing passionately.

Ella's body was burning hot, and her pussy was soaking wet so that his penis reached the deepest part instantly.As he thrust into her. Ella's body convulsed violently, and her legs clamped tightly around him.

"How does it feel? Good?"
Arthur asked as he thrust, watching Ella's passionate expression,his eyes filled with desire.
Ella lay on the couch with her eyes half-closed, the intense pleasure making her cheeks flush, her lips slightly parted, and her throat occasionally emitting enchanting moans.
Her seductive voice was like the strongest aphrodisiac which spurred Arthur on.

His thrusts became more vigorous.

Moments later, Ella climaxed, her fingers digging into Arthur's back.


Her legs clamped even tighter around Arthur's waist.

Seeing Ella's flushed face and dazed expression, Arthur felt a surge of desire. his penis continuing to thrust.
After countless orgasms, when Ella was completely exhausted, Arthur finally stopped and lay on top of her, breathing heavily.
Hot breaths sprayed over her with his unique scent lingered at hernose.


Ella turned over and lay on his chest.

Her soft hands wandered over his hot body, and finally, she smirked,"Aren't you worried Ava might find out?"
With those words, theintimate atmosphere between them dissipated completely.
Arthur propped himself up on his arm and stared into her eyes.


Ella's face was still flushed, her eyes full of desire.

Thinking of how she had just been passionately entwined beneath him.and now looking at her current state.

Her expression hadn't changed.

But deep in her eyes, there was a coldness.

'When does she start looking at me with such indifference?


This realization made him feel uneasy.

He punished her by squeezing her breast hard.


Pain surged through her.
Ella curled up. punching his chest. "What are you doing? That hurts!"


"I should be asking you that!"

Arthur grabbed her chin, forcing her to look up. "We just had sex, and you're asking me such question."

"What else?"

Ella retorted coldly.

She sat up and looked at the shredded clothes on the floor. "I don't care if you answer or not! How's the investigation going with the doctor?"

"Still investigating!"Seeing Ella's indifferent attitude, Arthur lit a cigarette and took a deep drag.
Through the hazy smoke. Arthur looked at her, clearly puzzled. "I really don't get what you're thinking."
Instead of staying home as a rich wife, she was out here playing someone else's stand-in.

"None of your business!"
Ella snapped,hearing the disdain in Arthur's voice. "My clothes are ruined,you need to get me a new one!"

"Wait here!"

Arthur grabbed his phone and sent a quick message.

In less than ten minutes, the doorbell rang.

Arthur walked to the door naked and returned with a bag of new clothes.


Ella glanced at it and quickly put them on.

"I'll wait for you in the car," Arthur said.

'A jerk is always a jerk,' she thought.

They had just been doing the most intimate thing, and now he acted like he didn't even know her.
But today's passion was for him to protect Ava, and for her to protect Lily,so they were even.

Ella felt a bit better thinking about it. After changing into new clothes, Ella looked at the clothes she had designed,feeling reluctant.

"Jerk, tore up my perfect clothes!"

She squatted down, trying to gather the pieces.

But when she saw a red dot in the corner, her face changed.

Arthur had been very rough when tearing the clothes, and the pieces were scattered everywhere.

So that red dot had ended up near the door.

She quickly ran over and found it was a bug.

Her heart sank, and she felt a surge of worry.

When was it placed upon me? Where? Clothes, shoes, bags, or hair accessories?

She had no clue.

On the way back, Ella was silent, clutching the bug tightly.

Arthur glanced at her and was about to speak when Ella shot him a cold look.

She didn't know who had placed the bug, and she didn't want the other party to get any useful information.

Getting an inexplicable glare, Arthur touched his nose.


The two remained silent the entire way.

After getting out of the car, Ella left without waiting for him.
The night was deep, and many people were already asleep.


Ella hesitated but made the call.

Lily was still awake and welcomed Ella as soon as she arrived.


"What's going on? Why did you have to come to me?"


"Look at this!"

She opened her palm. revealing the bug.

Lily's eyes widened. "Can it still hear us now?"


Ella shook her head. "Not sure!"

She spoke with her hand over her mouth, then placed the bug in the sink and turned on the faucet.

Lily and Ella sat on the bed, looking at each other.

"Who could it be? What's their purpose? Do they wantto steal our designs?



"But if they wanted to steal designs, shouldn't they use a camera? That way,they could see more clearly!"
Despite ruining their brains, they couldn't figure it out.


They both agreed that Ava was the mastermind.


"I'ye got it!"

Lily ran to the bathroom and brought back the bug.

"Do you think Ava is a bitch?" she winked, her meaning clear to curse Ava

together.
Ella got the hint and nodded. "Ava is indeed a bitch, two-faced and not a decent person."

Her insult was too mild.
Lily glared at her. "You're too easy to bully! I think Arthur treats you well,you should rely on him and live in luxury, no need to be a designer, just go home and enjoy life."
She added, "I heard wealthy families have private jets, private pools, and if you have a child, you won't have to work for the rest of your life."
###Chapter 81

Lily sure knew how to push people's buttons.

First, she went on and on about how amazing life was in a rich family,then she tore Ava apart from head to toe.

Andy was glued to her phone.

She thought the day was over, but nope, she still got hit with some major news.


Andy thought to herself, 'Such an ugly woman still wants to marry into a wealthy family.Dream on!'

Andy knew all about Ava and Arthur's history.

In her eyes, Ava and Arthur were the perfect couple, and anyone else was just a fling. After all, Arthur invited Ella out late at night surely only to sleep with her.

To Ava, Ella was just Arthur's side piece, no real threat.

If Andy could help Ava marry Arthur, that would be a big win.


She had an idea and quiety approached Ava.

Ella and Lily were still trash-talking at the bug.

Ava's face got darker and darker as she listened, her hand clenched into a fist, nails digging into her flesh without her even noticing. Andy leaned in, looking serious. "We needto teach her a lesson this time!That bitch can't have kids. let's expose that too!" When they drugged her, they already had a plan to create a scandal.

Infertility in women was either due to congenitaI reasons or had resulted from multiple abortions.


Thinking about Ella's massive bleeding last time in front of everyone,they could definitely use that.


Ava hesitated, lightly biting her lower lip. "Isn't this too much? Can we give her a chance?"

"If you're going to marry Mr. Smith, you can't be soft-hearted!"

Andy looked determined. "Strike when you need to, otherwise, even if you marry Mr. Smith, you'll have to deal wvith these side chicks."

She looked like a sincere friend. "I'm doing this for your own good! And Leo, we don't know how they investigated last time,now he's still working well! We can let him and Ella have more interactions! Let Mr. Smith know she's a promiscuous woman!"

Ava was hesitating, and Lily's words were getting nastier.

They even started attacking Ava's looks.

"She looks pure, but she's actually ugly! She must've had plastic surgery.and the more she had, the worse she got. Look at her nose, one punch could knock it crooked."

From her nose to her skin, her figure, even her hair wasn't spared. Hearing these vicious words, Ava's face hardened. "You're right, I can't be soft-hearted!" Tonight was going to be a sleepless night. Many people went to bed with heavy hearts.

In the morning, Ella stood in front of the mirror, looking at the red marks all over her body, fuming. "Damn it! So many hickeys. I need to find a way to cover them up."


She rummaged through her wardrobe for a long time before finding a dress with a collar.


Ella and Lily headed to the living room together.

Seeing the camera on, they were obviously stunned.

"Is the live broadcast starting now?" Lily asked bluntly.

The cameraman nodded. "Yep, the director wants the audience to see your casual state!"

Ella nodded, then they went tothe dining table.

Maybe because of the live broadcast, today's breakfast was especially lavish.


All kinds of breakfast were laid out.

Ella grabbed a piece of toast and some milk,eating slowly.

At that moment, Ava walked over,smiling.′′Isit comnfortable eating with a mask on every day?"

Thinking about last night when Arthur went out with Ella, Ava was fuming inside, but she kept that smile plastered on her face. Ella raised an eyebrow, about to say something, when Lily giggled. "You look good today! Did you get another injection?"She was hinting at plastic surgery.

Ava's face stiffened. "You're joking!"

"If you think you don't look well, I can help you!" Lily rolled up her sleeves and flexed her wrists.


Her meaning was clear.

The live broadcast viewers found it hilarious.

UJoking around first thing in the morning! So funny!]

[Yeah! Are they here to entertain us? Starting an argument so early!]

At first, the comments were from Ella's fans, who fully backed Lily's behavior.


But Ava's fans jumped in immediately.

[Why bully Ava! She's our idol, you jerks! Get lost, MIs.Worry-Free and her sidekick are no good!]

The viewers were split, some praising, some cursing.

But it didn't affect their breakfast.

Ella ate slowly, and just as she was about to get up, Arthur'sbig hand pressed on her shoulder, pushing her back into the chair.

"I need to talk to you!"

His voice was cold and a bit hoarse from a hangover. He drank again last night. Ella raised an eyebrow, asking softly, "What's up?"

"Give me a head massage later."

His request was pretty presumptuous.

Ella was about to refuse, but then Arthur's gaze fell on Leo, who was not far away.

"He's smart, the director keeps praising him!"

A blatant threat to Ella.

She nodded. "I happen to know a massage technique that can relieve hangover headaches!"

She stood up and moved behind Arthur, gently massaging his head.

Arthur closed his eyes, looking very pleased, holding a piece of bread in one hand and milk in the other.

The live broadcast viewers went wild seeing this scene.

[They look like a couple! Who would believe they have no feelings for each other?]

[Get together, hurry up and have kids!]

While massaging, Ella glanced at the comments unintentionally.

When she saw the word "kids," her eyes dimmed and her hand paused for a moment.

Arthur noticed her change and looked up, his face dark. "I don't want kids!11 That sentence was like a dagger,stabbing straight through her heart.

'How much sex had we? Not wanting kids? How ridiculous.'

Ella felt like a clown at that moment.

In anger, she increased the pressure of her hands.

Arthur gasped in pain, looked around, and pinched her thigh in a blind spot.

They hurt each other.

Ella felt the hot sensation on her thigh, ignored it, and pressed harder.

"Mr. Smith, you've been working too hard lately, so you need a strong massage to feel better!"

"Okay,I trust you!"

Their words were gentle, full of intimacy.

But their private actions were rougher than ever.

Arthur felt his head was about to be crushed while Ella felt her thigh must be bruised.

"Everyone gather, let's talk about the next competition!"

The director's timely appearance saved them both.

Ella turned and left without looking back, holding Lily's hand and sitting on the sofa.

They sat on a two-person sofa with no room for a third person. Arthur saw this and smiled, walking over to Lily.

Remembering being pulled up last time, Lily smiled and moved voluntarily.making a gesture of invitation.

Ella was speechless.


Some friend with no principles.
###Chapter 82

"Our theme this time is 'Home'!"

When you thought of home, you pictured a dad, mom, and kids,right?

So, that time,it was all about parent-child outfits.

As soon as the director announced the theme, everyone looked a bit stressed.

They were all top-notch fashion designers,great with adult clothes, but kids'stuff? Not so much.


Ella's eyes dropped, her face showing a mix of emotions as she was deep in thought.

Arthur was typing away on his keyboard, replying to an email. He noticed Ella's mood and gave her a nudge.

"What are you doing?"

Ella snapped,her voice rising in irritation.

The room went dead silent.

Arthur's face turned serious. "We're live streaming right now!"

Ella snapped out of it and apologized, "Sorry, I was just lost in thought.Please,go on!""Alright!"
 
The director went on with the rules and had already split everyone into groups. Ella's models were Ava. Arthur, and a child actor.

The kid was still in school and couldn't make it, so they just had his measurements.

That made things tougher.

Ella got the info, her mind wandering.

Arthur looked confused, but Lily next to him felt really bad for Ella.

Ella had been through a lot trying to have a kid, and Lily knew it all too well.


Now, she had to design clothes for Arthur, Ava, and their "child."

It was a tough pill to swallow.

Lily stood up to protest, but Ella turned and shook her head.

After the rules were laid out, everyone headed back to their studios to get to work.

Lily immediately went to Ella, linking arms with her. "If you don't want to do it, let me take over!"

"No need! I'm not that fragile! Besides, this day was bound to come sooner or later!"

Ella had dreamed countless times of a happy family of three.


But now, it was just a dream. Ella sat at her desk, looking through the info. As she looked at the warm family photos, her eyes welled up.Before she knew it, tears were streaming down her face, and she quickly wiped them away.
The usually lively live streaming room was now silent.

In the studio, Ella was busy at her computer,with Lily standing by her side.

Arthur and Ava were sitting on the sofa.

Ava wanted to say something, but Arthur was glued to his computer,looking serious.

The director was at a loss.

'What's going on? Where's the interaction, the sweet moments, the love triangle drama?'

The director sat in the control room, restless. "I thought putting them in a group would spark something, but this..."

He was completely baffled.

Their studio was eerily quiet.

Ella snapped out of it and tugged at Lily. "Let's have a quick meeting to brainstorm!"

Designing clothes should be all about the people wearing them. Since the child actor wasn't there, they could only ask Ava and Arthur for their input. Everyone quickly gathered around a round table.Ella looked at them and started, "I have your measurements. Now let's talk about what kind of clothes you imagine!"

"I'll go first!"

Ava blushed with excitement, glancing shyly at Arthur, then swayed a bit."I dream of having two kids, a boy and a girl! A complete family!"

"After work, Arthur and I could take the kids for a walk in the park or go on a picnic, all of us in matching outfits. My daughter and I in cute dresses, and my son and Arthur in casual wear!"

She was lost in her dreamy vision.

Ella's face darkened, but she jotted down the ideas anyway.

Lily, on the other hand, had enough and slammed the table. "Enough!
You act like you two are about to get married, and besides..."

She shot Arthur a pointed look. "What about you?"

"Me?"

Arthur raised an eyebrow. "I don't like kids!"

The room fell silent.

Ella lowered her head, clearing her throat. "Why?" Her voice fel stuck,as if it had taken all her strength to ask.

Arthur raised an eyebrow. "No reason!" With that, he got up and left.Watching Arthur walk away, Ella turned to the camera. "Looks like our group has the most challenges! Let's keep brainstorming with Ava!"

Arthur had left, but the livestream had to go on.

To lighten the mood, Ella cracked a few jokes.

On the balcony, a gentle breeze blew as Arthur stared into the distance,clearly irritated.


Alan approached. "The live stream was pretty interesting just now. Why don't you want kids?"

"Annoying."

"You mean kids are annoying?"

Arthur glanced at him but didn't reply.

Alan said, "Mr. Robert Smith is eagerly waiting for a great-grandchild,you know."

They all knew about Ella's years of efforts to get pregnant.

Many in their circle even mocked Ella.

After all, if the husband didn't come home, what was the point of trying?

Alan hesitated. "Have you talked about divorce recently?"


"None of your business!"
 
"Check out this news!" The headline was eye-catching: #A Woman's Shocking Affair to Get Pregnant Each word was familiar, but together they seemed strange.

Arthur raised an eyebrow, confidently lifting his chin. "Do you think this could happen to me?"

"Take care of yourself. Women will do anything to have a child!" Alan patted his shoulder. "Just take care of yourself!"

Arthur was left alone on the balcony.

He lit a cigarette, taking a deep drag, his expression darkening as he thought about the investigation results.

Time flew by.

The morning live stream ended.

Ella sat at her computer, feeling stuck and headache-ridden.

"How should I design this outfit? I'm feeling lost."

Designing clothes for her husband and his lover was already absurd.

Now, she even had to make parent-child outfits.

She rhythmically tapped her fingers on the table.

Lily said, "Maybe I should pretend to be sick again!"

They joined the show to boost their popularity.

Backing out because of the parent-child theme would be a bad move. Facing Lily's suggestion, Ella shook her head. "No! Cowardice isn't my style! What do you think of this?" She looked up some ideas on the computer.

Seeing foreign parent-child outfits, Ella had an idea.

Lily glanced at it and shook her head. "These clothes are too good for those jerks!"


The door opened, Arthur walked in, his face dark. "You seem to enjoy talking behind people's backs!"


His deep eyes were stormy, full of anger.

Lily's body trembled, and Ella said, "This has nothing to do with Lily,it was me who said it!"
###Chapter 83

Arthur's eyes narrowed as he looked at Ella, a cold sneer playing on his lips.

He moved closer, step by step, backing Ella into a corner. "You sure about this?"


"Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else. If you've got a problem.take it up with me!"

"Fine!"


Arthur's voice was calm, but his eyes shifted to Lily. "Get out. We need to talk."


Lily just stood there, not budging.

Arthur's anger flared. "Are you sure?"

He spoke slowly, each word dripping with barely contained rage, like a beast ready to pounce.

Sensing the tension, Ella quickly said, "Lily, it's okay. I'll handle this."

"Alright! I'll be right outside.Just call if you need me."

Respecting Ella's wishes, Lily hesitated for a moment before leaving.


The door clicked shut.

Arthur stepped closer, his leg pressing between Ella's, his body pinning her against the wall.

Their bodies were pressed tightly together, heat radiating through their
clothes.

Arthur slowly removed her hat, sunglasses, and mask, revealing her face.

Ella felt a wave of discomfort and looked up at him, anger flashing in her eyes. "So, you're here to get back at me for your lover?"

"You!"


Arthur's jaw clenched as he stared at her,searching her face for something.

But all he saw was anger.


"Lover?" Arthur scoffed, "Are you jealous? Is that why you're pushing for a divorce, playing hard to get?"


Ella met his gaze head-on. "This has nothing to do with anyone else.I just want a divorce, plain and simple."

"Really?"

Arthur grabbed her chin and kissed her hard.

Their lips clashed, breaths mingling.

In no time, their breathing grew heavy.

His hands roamed over her body, her waist, her legs.

Arthur's fingers expertly tore away her dress.

Feelingthe cool air, Ella was shocked and shoved him. "Are you out of your mind?"

She tried to grab her dress, but Arthur's arms held her against the wall like a vice. "Weren't you just enjoying it?" 
"You jerk!"

Ella pushed against his chest, trying to get him off.

She used all her strength, but Arthur didn't budge. "Move! What if someone sees us?"


Arthur, the powerful CEO, was like a god wherever he went.

If anyone found out, they'd blame Ella for seducing him.

No one would blame him; that was the perk of power.

"Relax! No one's gonna see us!"

Arthur reassured her with a kiss, his hand wandering over her hips,then lifting her onto the desk.

"I missed you."

Just a simple sentence, but it was sexy andirresistible.

His hand grabbed her ankle, slowly moving up her calf, thigh, and finally to her pussy, each touch feeling like fire, burning hot.

When his hand finally reached her pussy, Ella went weak, almost collapsing.

Luckily, Arthur knew her body well, holding her waist just in time. "You're getting turned on!"

His teasing voice made Ella blush with embarrassment. She wanted to push him away, but he didn't budge.

Taking a deep breath, she tried to suppress her desire, gritting her teeth."
Stop it, Lily's right outside."

"Then how about we continue tonight?"

"I'm busy; I have work to do!"

"You're just a stand-in for Ms. Worry-Free. What's there to be busy with? I Il take care of you!"

He said it so casually, like he was talking about the weather.

Ella's face darkened, her eyes widening. "Don't push it."

"That's not your call."

As he spoke, his fingers thrust into her, making her moan.

It felt like a jolt of electricity shot through her.

Her moans seemed like an unspoken invitation.

Arthur lowered his head, kissing her lips, his fingers moving more vigorously.

The intense pleasure made her gasp, her moans rising and falling.

Outside the door, Lily could hear Ella's high-pitched moans clearly.

She wished she coud record it and send it to Ava, but she couldn't.

Just then, a familiar figure approached.

Perfect timing.

Lily's eyes lit up, and she quickly stepped forward. "You're here! Someone's in the studio; it's not convenient to come in right now!" "Why not? Even if it's not working hours, this is still our studio!"

Ava glanced at Lily and tried to open the door.

But when she turned the doorknob, she found it locked.

She froze, about to question, when a moan came from inside.

Ava was speechless.

She knew exactly what was happening inside just from the sound.

'Something's off. Who's in there? Could it be Arthur and Worry-Free?

Furious, she raised her hand to knock on the door.

Lily grabbed her wrist. "Think carefully. If you interrupt a man at this time, he might have premature ejaculation!"

"You shameless liar!"

"That's still better than being a mistress! Listen, today I'm the bodyguard.and as long as I'm here, no one's going in!"

"You..."

Another high-pitched moan came from inside.

Ava bit her lip, her face darkening. "Fine, she's just a fashion designer,and she dares to compete with me for Arthur. I'll make her regret ever being born!"

She spat out her threat.

Her eyes glared at the door, and hearing the sounds inside, shestomped her foot in anger and left.
Lily,feeling victorious, smiled. "Serves you right, acting all high and mighty while being a mistress."

She glanced at her phone, seeing it was almost time for the afternoon live broadcast.

But inside the room, Ella's moans were getting louder.

Lily stomped her foot anxiously. 'That's enough, what if someone finds out!



In these situations, it was always the woman who suffered.
###Chapter 84

In the studio, Arthur's movements got more intense, and even with Ella's mouth covered, a moan slipped out.

Thinking of Lily still at the door, Ella felt a wave of shame, her eyes locked on Arthur.


Normally, that fierce look in her eyes would have some effect.

But now, her face was flushed, she was biting her lower lip, and her eyes were glowing with passion.


Her angry glare was seductive, totally irresistible.

Arthur seemed to take it as encouragement, thrusting even more vigorously.

Ella climaxed again.

When Arthur finally stopped, Ella's face was flushed, her expression dazed,and she hung on him like a limp doll.

Time ticked by.

Arthur glanced at his phone, his big hand gently stroking her back. "Hurry up and change, the live stream starts in 10 minutes! And be careful with who you hang out with!"

"What?"

Ella was shocked and tried to push him away.

But she was too weak, and as soon as she pushed him, she slid to the ground like a rag doll.
'Oh no,my face.'

Just as Ella thought she was going to hit the ground hard,a large hand wrapped around her waist, pulling her into an embrace.

"Be careful!"

"None of your business!"

Ella snapped, angrily pushing him away and looking at the dress Arthur had torn and thrown on the ground.

Time was tight, and to avoid being noticed changing clothes, she picked up the dress and started sewing it with a sewing machine.

The sunlight streamed in lazily.

Ella's skin was smooth, her face still flushed, looking like a tempting apple,with a slender neck and delicate curves.


Arthur's throat tightened, just as he was about to speak, his phone rang.

"Arthur, where are you?I need to talk to you!"

Ava's sweet voice came through.

Ella paused, ears pricked up.

"I'll be right there!"

Hanging up, Arthur immediately walked out the door just as Ella expected.

Ella smiled self-deprecatingly and looked up to see Lily's mischievous gaze.

"What are you laughing at? We're married, these things are inevitable! It's just fulfilling a duty!"
'It used to be to keep a secret. Now just fulfilling marital duties.

Lily's face darkened. "You think too much, being able to conquer him in bed is a skill too, practice more, and in the future..."

"Alright, let's get to work! This time, it's a parent-child theme, my mind is a mess. I have no ideas!"


As she spoke, her new dress was already finished.

With the live stream imminent, she quickly put on the dress, hat,sunglasses, and mask.

A few minutes later, the live stream team was all present.

However, Arthur and Ava were not there.

Ella didn't mind, lost in her thoughts.

The theme of the parent-child outfits was warmth, happiness, and joy.

But designing parent-child outfits for her husband and his lover,how ironic,she tried to clear her mind.


Lily looked worried. "Maybe I should handle this one!"

"No, I'll do it myself."

Ella pressed her temples, her gaze falling on the live stream team,noticing something was off.

'Where is Leo? Why isn't he here?'

She frowned, wanting to ask the director, but it was a live stream, so she could only ask after it ended.
Ella was deep in thought, making the live stream a bit dull.

Lily sat down and started sharing Worry-Free's journey with everyone.

Hearing that Worry-Free had been a good student and had won tons of awards in school,viewers flooded the comments with praise.

For a moment, the studio had two different vibes.


Lily was chatting with the viewers, laughing and joking, making the atmosphere lively.

Meanwhile, Ella was at her desk, lost in thought,her face full of worry.

On the balcony.

Ava looked at Arthur with a pout. "You've changed. Why are you so nice to Ms.Worry-Free and even help her handle those negative comments?"

Ava knew only Arthur could do it.

Arthur responded coolly, not denying it.

The atmosphere got awkward.

After a while, Ava spoke softly, "You've changed, you're getting colder towards me!"

"Alright, the live stream is still going, let's get back!"


"Okay!"

Ava smiled sweetly, stepping forward to hold Arthur's arm. "Wait for me!"

Arthur looked down, giving her hand a long look. "You're in the entertainment industry; scandals are bad for you!"
He patted her hand and walked ahead with long strides.

Ava's eyes turned red, tears almost falling.

Coming to her senses, she followedin high heels.

The two entered the studio one after the other, but to those watching closely, it looked like they came in together.

Someone on the director's team got the hint and immediately pointed the camera at them.


[Where did they go during lunch break?]

[Ava's lipstick is smudged, could it bewhat I think?]

[No,my idol.]

The screen was instantly filled with Ava's fans' comments.


Her fans started imagining things, with some even naming Ava's future children.


Ella, lost in her thoughts, suddenly felt a malicious gaze and slowly looked up.

Ava's lips curled in a smug smile. "Ms. Worry-Free, how's your progress?"

"Fine! If you two have any ideas, feel free to share with me!"

Ava had expected to see her furious expression. Unfortunately,Ella's face was unreadable, and her tone was very calm.

It seemed that what had just happened between the two had no effect on her. Ava, feeling unsatisfied, looked at the camera. "Thank you all for your concern, but don't jump to conclusions! It puts a lot of pressure on Arthur!"

Her words revealed a lot to the viewers who were urging them for marriage and children.

They became even more excited.

No one paid attention to Ella and Lily anymore; all eyes were on Arthur and Ava.


After all, not everyone understood the art of clothing, but everyone loved gossip.

Ava's fans went wild, flooding the screen with comments.

[So sweet! I bet someone must be jealous now! Always showing off her relationship with Mr. Smith. Serves her right!]

They thought they were just focusing on Ava and Arthur's relationship.

Unexpectedly, the sarcastic comments completely angered Ella's fans.

[What's wrong with Ms. Worry-Free? She stands on her own charm! She doesn't need men, she just relies on hard work!]

[Yeah, men only hinder her hard work! Fickle men,go away!]

[Oh, come on, whatever you say. Ava and Mr. Smith will always be together, making those jealous people furious!]
###Chapter 85

The vibe in the live stream room was super tense.

Fans from both sides were at it again, arguing non-stop.

Ella had no clue about any of this, while Arthur kept glancing between the live stream and Ella.

He opened his mouth, like he wanted to say something.

Ava looped her arm through his, stood on her tiptoes, and whispered something in his ear.

The camera caught this moment, and it quickly became a hot topic.

[That's so cute! They look like a couple whispering sweet nothings to each other.]


Lily,who was scrolling through the comments, couldn't take it anymore.

She wanted to rush over and give Ava a piece of her mind.

But she knew she couldn't.

She walked over to Ella and pinched her. "Hey, take a look at this!"

Ella winced in pain and looked up, confused. "What are you talking about?



"Check out the comments!"

"Alright!"

Following Lily's direction, Ella glanced at the comments.
Fans from both sides were bickering, how boring.

She waved at the camera. "Hey everyone, let's keep things cool and not argue. How about I show you a special skill?"

She grabbed a sketchbook and a pen and sat in front of the big screen.

"Let me show you my drawing skills! I have no inspiration right now and need to clear my head!"

Ella's slender fingers swiped across the screen.

Soon,she found a photo of Arthur and Ava whispering among the comments.

Ella was speechless.

They looked so close, like a real couple. No one would believe they were just friends.


She channeled hner frustration into her art, picked up the pen, and started drawing.

[Oh my god, she's amazing! Look at how she sketched the rough outline with just a few strokes! Quick strokes, rich imagination, smooth lines! As an art student myself, I think she's incredible!]

[Look, she actually captured that intimate moment between those two!]The live stream room was buzzing, and the photographer knew exactly who to focus on.

As a result, the number of viewers in the live stream room shot up,quickly hitting hundreds of thousands.

Ella smiled as she drew and explained simply and easily so non-art
students could follow along.

Even though Ella was bundled up, making it hard to see her face,she was shining brightly.

Ava clenched her fists in anger, watching Arthur also staring at Ella,feeling frustrated.


A few minutes later.

Ella finished the drawing and handed it to Ava with a smile. "See if it looks like you!"


The drawing was incredibly lifelike, capturing every gesture and expression,even the hair strands had a sense of spirit.

If this drawing wasn't done by Ella, it would have been even better.

Ava thanked her insincerely. "Thanks!"

"No problem! This is my gift to both of you!"

She emphasized each word slowly.

Arthur frowned, looking annoyed. "We're live streaming now,you should be drawing design sketches, not wasting time on this!"

He snatched the drawing from Ava's hand, folded it, and put it în his pocket.

"Alright, you guys chat, I'll get back to work!"

After the little drama, Ella returned to her desk.

She tried to find some inspiration from Ava and Arthur.
-

But her eyes were getting tired, and her mind was getting more and more chaotic.


Compared to Ella's struggle, the other two live stream rooms were buzzing with activity.

Cecilia was already married and had kids.

Even though she didn't design a lot of kids' clothes, being a mom herself.Cecilia had whipped up a few outfits for her own kid, so she was pretty good at the parent-child series.


In no time, she had several outfits sketched out, and she even had some ideas for colors and accessories in her head.


Magnolia, who was right next to her, kept giving her thumbs up.

"Your designs are gorgeous! If these hit the market, they'll sell like crazy!"

"You really know how to flatter!"

Cecilia patted Magnolia's shoulder. "How about a challenge? I'll sketch another one, and you handle the color scheme!"

"Really? Thanks for the opportunity!"

"Don't mention it, we're a team!"

With a few quick strokes, Cecilia designed another outfit.

She handed over the color scheme and accessories to Magnolia.

The two of them worked together seamlessly, earning the title of the most harmonious duo from the viewers. In another live stream room. Andy's parent-child outfits were a bit on the immature side.

But the style was bold, and the colors were bright. These clothes might not be a hit domestically, but abroad, they'd definitely be in high demand.

Viewers were hopping between the live stream rooms,checking out all the action.


The afternoon flew by.

The live stream ended.

Ella held her pen, but her paper was still blank.

Lily looked at her sympathetically. "You're just making things hard for yourself! Have a rest!"

"Okay!"

After work, Ella was exhausted. As she passed by the director, she suddenly stopped.

"Hey,director,where's Leo?"

"We had a work adjustment, and he was transferred to Cecilia's team!"


"Why..."

Ella stopped mid-sentence, smiled at the director. "Thanks for letting me know!"


She believed in finishing what she started.

She had promised to design a wedding dress for Leo's fiancée, so she
couldn't go back on her word. She handed her computer and other things to Lily. "You go home first, I have something to do!"

"Alright, keep your phone with you, so you don't get lost!"

"Got it, you go on ahead!"

Ella scanned the crowd.

Leo was tall and handsome, easy to spot in the crowd.

Ella waved in his direction, and Leo quickly ran over when he saw her.

"Why are you running? You're at work, be more steady!" Ella, like a big sister, took out a tissue and handed it to him.


Leo chuckled. "I'm just in a hurry! If you didn't come to find me, I would ve come to find you. My fiancée sent me a message! Let's find a place to talk!"


The estate had many pavilions surrounded by beautiful scenery.

The two of them looked around and walked to the nearest pavilion.

Leo couldn't wait to take out his phone and relay his fiancée's ideas for the wedding dress.

Ella was speechless.

This client had way too many demands.

She wanted the dress to reflect their childhood friendship, romance, beauty,passion, strength, and courage.

'My God! What do young people want these days, to turn a wedding dress
into armor?'

Ella carefully said, "Her demands are a bit too much,can she specify a type, like a magazine she saw?"

Such disorganized ideas made it hard to start.

Leo scratched his head in embarrassment. "I said the same,but she said there's only one wedding, and she must have a perfect dress!"

The more Ella listened to Leo's fiancée's demands for the wedding dress,the more confused she became.


Helpless, she could only keep asking, "Well, did she mention any specific type she likes?"
###Chapter 86

But Leo was totally clueless.

Leo looked like a deer in headlights, shaking his head at every question."My fiancée handles everything at home, I just need to make money!"

They chatted for a few minutes, but it was a total bust-no useful info at all.


Ella rubbed her temples, clearly frustrated.

Leo's eyes lit up, and he pulled out a potion from his pocket. "Ms. Worry-Free, let me give you a massage!"

Before Ella could even say no, Leo had already opened the potion and started applying it to her temples.

"What are you doing?"

A sudden roar echoed.

Leo jumped, his hand shook, and the potion fell to the ground, rolling into the grass.

Ella frowned and turned around.

Not far away, Arthur stood there, looking furious, like he had caught them red-handed.

Ella's face darkened a bit. "You should go back for now, we'll talk another day!"

"Okay! We can also chat by phone, I'll text you."
Sensing the awkward vibe. Leo kept talking as he walked away.Even when he was far off, his voice still lingered.

Ella turned her gaze back to Arthur, calm and collected. "Don't overthink it,nothing happened between us! We were just talking."

Arthur strode forward and pulled Ella into his arms.

One hand on her waist, the other on her round butt, holding her so tight like he wanted to merge them into one.


"Don't do this, there are people around!"

His sudden move made Ella super flustered.

She glanced around, worried someone might see them.

"Nothing happened? Seriously? He touched you!"

Arthur gritted his teeth, trying to keep his anger in check.

"And what about you and Ava?"

Thinking about their interaction in front of the camera today, Ella's tone turned sarcastic, "You can do it, but I can't?"

"So what?"

Through her sunglasses, Arthur glared at her, his eyes blazing with anger like he wanted to devour her.

"I mean you have no right to control me!"

"Now I'll show you whether I have the right or not!"

Arthur scooped her up and walked to the car.
The car door slammed shut.

Ella was surprised to find a motorhome set up in the garden.

The inside was luxurious, like a fancy hotel.

As she looked around curiously, Arthur's slender fingers reached over and stripped away all her disguises.

Their eyes locked.

Arthur's anger flared even more. "Are you sure you don't want to explain?"

Ella defiantly rolled her eyes. "Of course not!"

"You're so stubborn!"

Arthur gritted his teeth and bit her lip.

The cool touch made Ella shiver, thinking about what happened at noon.she pushed him away with her hands on his chest.

As soon as she pushed, Arthur's slender hand grabbed her wrists and pinned them above her head.

"Today, I'm going to teach you a lesson!"

Arthur's voice was low and hoarse, with a hint of coldness.

Ella was shocked by what this so-called lesson meant.

This car was parked in the middle of the garden, and if it shook violently.they would definitely be noticed.

Plus,she didn't want to do such things in this place.
Thinking of these,Ella struggled even more.

Arthur paused for a moment, then his actions became more intense. His domineering,frenzied kisses trailed from her red lips down to her slender neck and full chest.

Soon,his lips were on her abdomen.

Ella's body had turned to jelly, her legs wrapped around his solid waist,and her arms draped around his neck.

"You miss my dick!"

In the heat of the moment, Arthur's voice cut through.

Reality hit Ella, and her eyes, now clear, were full of rejection. "Let me go,not here, okay? Let's go back to the room!"

"No way!"

Arthur pinched her waist hard. "I want to fuack you right now."

He unbuckled his belt, revealing his erect member.

Ella felt the heat between her legs and shivered. "No!"

"You want it!"

Arthur's body pressed against hers, his lips prying hers open, and his tongue tangled with hers.

He felt Ella's body tighten, then start to move.

Their breaths mingled, and his hands roamed over her body.

In an instant, they were both burning with desire.
Arthur held Ella tightly. "Enjoy it!"

Before the words were out, he thrust into her.

As they became one, Ella's body convulsed, her legs clamping tightly around his waist.

Her mouth opened slightly, and moans echoed, rising and falling.

The motorhome shook slightly, and many people noticed and quietly approached.

But when they tried to peek inside, several men in suits stepped out.

"No one is allowed near this car!"

They were tall and imposing, clearly not to be messed with.

The onlookers chuckled and walked away.

Arthur's assistant emerged from the corner, handing each of them a bonus."Thanks for your hard work today!"

"It's no trouble. Mr. Smith is something else! Even with Ava around, he dares to mess around with another woman!"

"Yeah, the live broadcast has been quite lively these days. You're Mr. Smith's assistant, tell us who he really likes!"

This question was tricky.

The assistant hesitated. "Don't gossip about Mr. Smith, just keep watch,I have important things to do!"

The car's shaking grew more intense.
It was clear how fierce the 'battle' inside was.

In the corner of the garden.

Ava listened to the recording inside, her chest heaving with anger."That bitch dares to seduce Arthur!"

Andy was speechless.

It was hard to say who was seducing whom.

She cleared her throat. "I've listened to the recording several times, we now have solid evidence that she is an impostor, and we don't even know the real Ms. Worry-Free's design level, she might be a fraud."

"You're right! I want both of them out of this industry!"

Thinking of the live broadcast, Ava's lips curved into a sinister smile. "If this is exposed, even the real Ms. Worry-Free wouldn't dare to show up!"


"Yeah! She'd probably just change her name and continue in the industry!"

Fashion design was also a fame and fortune game.

Everyone used the alias.

If a scandal was exposed and they haven't shown their face, it was better to change their identity.

Andy suddenly thought of something, her eyes exceptionally bright. "You mean?"

"It's our idea! I'll arrange this, and whether you can beat Cecilia is up to you!"
Andy was afraid that she couldn't beat Cecilia. "Can you help me.I want to...


"I don't like underhanded tactics! Meet here tomorrow morning! T'll tell you the detailed plan."


After speaking. Ava glanced around, saw no ohe. and hurriedly left.
###Chapter 87

After she left, someone quietly stepped out from the shadows.

Jessa asked, "Is it really worth helping her like this?"

"No choice, I can't compete with the other two in terms of talent, so I have to resort to some tricks!"


Andy looked downcast, disappointment clear in her eyes. "I thought if I helped her deal with Ella, she'd help me get first place. Didn't expect it to turn out like this."


Jessa's face twisted in frustration. "Why don't we get some dirt on her?Record everything she says to keep her from turning on us!"

"You're right, that's what we should do!"

Andy nodded in agreement.

The two of them whispered and plotted for a long time.

Meanwhile, Ava listened to the recording over and over again with her headphones on.

She was so mad she gritted her teeth, wishing she could rush over and tear Worry-free's face apart.

Thinking it over, she realized that despite knowing her for a long time, she had never seen her true face.

'What does she even look like?'

Without realizing it, Ava wandered into the garden. Seeing the RV not far away, her eyes lit up and she was about to run over when Arthur's assistant, Efren Britton, suddenly appeared and stopped her.

"Ms. Davis! Please leave here right now!"

"Why?"

Ava was unconvinced and was about to push past him when she suddenly sensed something was off.


The car was parked there perfectly fine, and there was no one around,so why was it shaking?

The special glass of this car allowed those inside to see out, while those outside couldn't see in.


As the car shook more and more violently, she suddenly thought of something and grabbed Efren's arm. "Is Arthur in there?"

Her eyes seemed to burn as she stared at him, trying to get an answer from his face.


Efren shook his head. "I have nothing to say about this matter! Please leave immediately!"

Ava's expression suddenly changed, and she wished she could rush over.

But besides Efren, there were several bodyguards around.

She smiled bitterly. "I understand, and don't tell anyone I was here!"


"Gotit!"

Not far away on the balcony, Lily saw everything and sneered,nudging Alan. Doesn't it look like a jealous fight?"

Ella's identity had already been exposed, so there was nothing to hide.

At this moment, Lily and Alan were standing together, joking.

Alan lit a cigarette and took a deep drag. "I think it's pretty funny!"

"What's so funny? I need to go teach Ava a lesson!"

With that, Lily, wearing high heels, ran downstairs.

Lily mocked, "Ava? You look pale-who upset you?"

"Stay away from me, I don't want to talk to you right now!"


"Take it easy. I wanted to take you for a walk in the garden. I just saw Ms.Worry-Free get into the RV. How about we go check it out?"

Ava glared at her angrily. "I know what you mean, you just want to anger me. No way!"

She glared at Lily. "Your name is Lily,right? I'll remember you! I'll make sure you disappear from this industry completely!"

Watching Ava walk away, her hair seemed to be bristling with anger,and Lily couldn't help but laugh.

Alan was speechless.

'It's just women and deceitful people who are hard to deal with. The two of them were too scheming.

He stood on the balcony, able to see everything happening around him.Just as he was wondering whether to inform Arthur, the RV door opened.
As their gazes met. Alan was so scared that he ran away.

"Tll head back first. you come later."

Her voice was hoarse from all the shouting, and Ella spoke weakly.

She shot Arthur an angry glare.

Her watery eyes were full of charm, and her glare looked more like a silent invitation.


Arthur lightly licked his lower lip and smiled seductively. "Can't bear to leave me?"


"Stay away from me!"

Ella straightened her clothes, saw no one around, and hurriedly ran off.

Arthur stood there, tugging at his tie. "Liar!"

'Her insistence on divorce was clearly a tactic to attract me.'

Thinking about their recent climax, Arthur was satisfied, his eyes filled with desire.


The phone rang.

He glanced at it, his expression changing. "I'll be back at the company right away!"

The night grew darker.

Ella sat at her computer desk, her head aching. "What should I do? The other groups already have some ideas, but we still have nothing."

"Alright, haste makes waste, don't worry!"
Lily brought over a magazine. "These are works from the parent-child fashion week two years ago. Take a look and get some inspiration!"

"Okay!"

As time passed, Ella's eyes lit up."I can pretend to design parent-child outfits for dogs. That way, I'll feel better."

Lily was speechless.

She really has a rich imagination, but it indeed was a good idea.

With a new approach, things went much smoother.

Time flew by.

At dawn, Ella yawned, looking at the design on the computer,and smiled with satisfaction.


She checked the time; it was already 4 AM.

Lily was sleeping soundly on the bed, not having returned to her room last night.

Arthur had repeatedly mentioned he would come over at night, yet he didn't show up.

'Could he be with Ava?'

Thinking of this, Ella lowered her eyes, hid her complex emotions, and quickly fell asleep.

Early in the morning, Ella and Lily came to the living room as usual.

After breakfast, they learned that the program had been adjusted.
The live broadcast was paused, and the next one would be a runway show to display their designs, which meant they had to complete three outfits in two days.


With tight schedules and heavy tasks, everyone stopped chatting and rushed back to their studios to start working.

In the studio, Arthur didn't come, and neither did Ava.

Only Ella and Lily were exceptionally busy.

Time flew by, and two days passed quietly.

Early in the morning, everyone gathered in the living room.

"Hey everyone, the runway show is at 1 PM this afternoon. Please hurry and get your works ready. If you need anything,just let us know."

Victory or defeat hinged on this moment.

After this runway show, there would be an elimination round,and everyone wanted to perform well.

Ella was no exception. After the director finished speaking,everyone dispersed. Back in the studio, Ella took out the clothes.

"The child actors will come at noon, so please try on these clothes first!"

As a model in the same group, Ava glanced at the clothes and said, "T'll do my makeup first,there's still time to try them on later!"

Arthur responded indifferently, "I'll try them on first!"

He grabbed the clothes from Ella's hands and walked to the changing room. Watching his back,Ava frowned,feeling something was off.

Lily sneered. "What are you looking at? It's not yours.so don't stare.Be careful,or I'll gouge out your eyes!"
###Chapter 88

Ava shot back, "Who do you think you are, talking to me like that?"

Lily stormed over, hands on her hips. "You better watch your mouth. Who do you think you are, criticizing others?"

"You two are always ganging up on me! Enjoy it while you can,cause you won't be here much longer!"

Ava lowered her voice and threatened them as she glared at them.

Just then, the changing room door swung open,and Arthur stepped out.

Arthur had those perfect chiseled features, broad shoulders,and a slim waist-basically, a natural-born model.

With his cool, noble face, elegant vibe, and straight posture, wearing Ella's designs, he looked like he just walked out of a dream.

Ava's jaw dropped. "I knew you were good-looking, but damn, I didn't expect this! HoldI on, I'm changing too!"

She grabbed the clothes from Ella and headed into the locker room.

Arthur stood there, looking at Ella, "What? Cat got yourtongue?"

Ella,like Ava, had been staring, totally mesmerized.

They'd shared a bed for years, and she always knew he was handsome.

But today, in that custom suit, Arthur was on a whole new level.

Every move he made was pure elegance, like a king, stunning everyone with just a glance. Ella smiled softly. "My design looks amazing!"

"Just the clothes?"

Arthur's deep eyes locked onto hers.

Ella's heart skipped a beat. Even behind sunglasses, she felt guilty and looked away. "Is there anything that doesn't fit right? I can fix it."

"I don't know. Why don't you check?"

Arthur stepped forward, grabbed her hand, and placed it on his chest."Measure it yourself!"


The room filled with tension. He didn't say much, but his presence was overwhelming.

Ella swallowed. "Stop it, there are people here!"

"No,I'm not a person."

Lily,trying to help, dashed out and shut the door.

Now it was just the two of them,with Ava in the changing room.

Ella backed up until she was cornered.

"What are you scared of? I'm just asking you to check the fit. Come on."

Arthur guided her hand from his Adam's apple, down to his chest, his abs,and all the way down.

Just as her hand was about to touch his hot dick.

Ella clenched her fist."Stop messing around!"
"I'm not messing around, I jus missed you! It's been two days, and I haven't heard a word from you."

Ella was speechless.

It was true.

She'd been busy designing and making clothes for the past two days.

Arthur hadn't been around, so they hadn't seen each other.

Normally, if she couldn't reach him for a few hours, Ella would get anxious.


But for two whole days, she hadn't thought of Arthur at all.

Ella felt a strange sense of relief. "We're about to get divorced, why should I think of you!"

Arthur's anger flared up at that.

Since the talk of divorce, Ella had lost her usual gentle and obedient demeanor.


Instead, she had become sharp-tongued, not backing down.

Arthur stepped forward and hugged her tightly. "Do you believe I'll fuck you right here?"

As he spoke, his long fingers pressed against her most sensitive spot.

The sudden touch made Ella shiver, almost letting out a moan.

Luckily,she covered her mouth just in time, her eyes wide. "Are you out of your mind?"
The studio and the changing room were only separated by a thin door,and sounds could easily travel.

Arthur leaned in close, his breath hot against her ear. "Guess what I'm going to do?"

His breath reeked of smoke.

Ella wrinkled her nose. "There's a fashion show this afternoon!"

"Then check if my clothes fit!"


Ella pushed him away forcefully just before the changing room door swung open.

Ava strutted out in a lace dress, immediately linking her arm with Arthur's.

"Look! We look so good together!"

There was a mirror on the studio wall.

The two of them stood there, a striking couple, looking like they belonged together.


Ella swallowed her bitterness and raised an eyebrow. "Yeah,you two look great together!"

"Thanks!"

Ava beamed, her cheeks flushed, leaning shyly on Arthur.

Ella glanced at them and went back to her desk. "You've both tried on the clothes. Any issues with the fit? I can fix them now!"

"Nope, they're perfect!"
Even though she didn't like Ella, Ava had to admit the design was top-notch.


The lace dress accentuated her curves, with pearl-embroidered hems and cuffs,giving off an air of elegance and nobility.


The matching accessories were a set of pearl earrings and a necklace.

As soon as Ava walked out, she looked like a wealthy heiress,instantly grabbing everyone's attention.

She was in love with the dress.

With the fashion show coming up, everyone was super busy.

After confirming the outfits fit perfectly, Ella started working on the matching accessories.


Even though everything was planned, Ella never relaxed until the last minute.


As she pondered whether to replace the pearls with other accessories, the studio door suddenly burst open.

Andy rushed in with the director's team, followed by a crowd holding phones.

"What are you doing here?"

Seeing the aggressive crowd, Ella sensed something was off. Andy, looking smug, was the first to speak, "Who are you really? You're not Ms. Worry-Free, are you? The internet is blowing up today. We didn't believe it at first,but now it seems true!"

Seeing someone from the director's team start a live stream, Ella frowned. "
Don't you have any sense of professionalism? Didn't we agree to start the live stream after the fashion show?"

The assistant director scoffed. "Now's not the time for that. You better explain who you really are."

Ella was baffled by their accusations.

As she triedto figure it out, Lily rushed in and showed her a phone.

#Worry-Free Is A Fraud

#Worry-Free Is An Imposter

Worry-Free's name was trending.

Ella quickly clicked to see the content.

It was a long post accusing Worry-Free of being a hypocritical fraud.buying other people's designs and passing them off as her own.

Not only that, but to hide her lack of real talent, she had supposedly hired
a fashion designer to join the show under her name.
###Chapter 89

The following was a recording.

The recording was edited into that proved Ella wasn't Worry-Free, but a stand-in.


Thinking about the bug found a few days ago, Ella understood everything,looked through all the posts, then raised her head and stared at Andy."Baseless rumors,who can prove I'm not Ms. Worry-Free? And if I'm not,then who is?"


"Yeah,nonsense!"


Lily glared at everyone there. "You guys are something else. You invite us to the show, then use us for publicity and try to smear us!"

"Ms. Worry-Free, no, I don't even know who you are. You can't deny that the recording is real. No wonder I felt your work quality fluctuates.Could it be that the person drawing your design sketches isn't the same?"

Ava's words were slanderous, indirectly suggesting Ella had bought design sketches.

Ella raised an eyebrow, her tone icy, "You need to be responsible for what you say.Are you sure?"

Ava looked troubled.

Andy stepped forward. "You two are a team, spending all your time together. Of course,she knows your real level. How can you still threaten her now that you've been exposed?"

"Sorry! I don't know how to address you, but I can't lie to you, nor can I
lie to my fans!"

Ava seemed to say nothing,yet everything.

She hid behind Andy, looking timid.

Ella sneered and asked the staffs, "And what about you? We've done a lot of work under the camera these days. Are you also doubting my identity?"

The assistant director hesitated.

He always remembered the director's words to treat Ms. Worry-Free well.


But now, the online comments were overwhelming, all saying that Ms.Worry-Free in front of them was a stand-in, with recording and so-called evidence.


The director was out on business, and the assistant director was in charge.He wanted to use this buzz to advance his career.

After a brief thought, he made up his mind. "We're live streaming now.I hope you can give the viewers an answer!"

"Live streaming, huh? Very well!"

Ella walked to the camera. "Hello everyone, I'm sorry for the confusion.I promise you, I am Ms. Worry-Free! To prove it, I'm happy to design another piece of clothing in front of the camera!"

In the face of absolute strength, any conspiracy was nothing. With her skills,she wasn't worried at all.

Lily also stepped forward. "Yes, no matter who we are, we have skills, and we're not afraid to show it!"
The two spoke confidently in front of the camera, while Ava lowered her head, a strange smile on her lips.

Her phone buzzed with a message, and in an instant, a flood of negative comments came in.


[Who is this person? From the first day, I didn't like her. She claims to be a fashion designer, but she's hiding and sneaking around like a clown!]

[Yeah, I don't like her either! Whether she's Ms. Worry-Free or not, she and that assistant have been bullying our Ava since day one! Say no to workplace bullying, get them out of the show!]

The malice was overwhelming. Ella glanced at it, then looked at Ava,finally fixing her gaze on Andy.

"What's the meaning of bringing them here?"

Andy stood at the front, and Ella looked him up and down, sneering,"Your taste in clothing has improved a lot recently!"

When Andy first joined the show, she was only rocking a few thousand dollars' worth of clothes. Now, she was decked out in tens of thousands of dollars' worth of gear, especially that watch on her wrist, worth millions.

Feeling guilty, Andy put her hand behind her back. "I came here to expose you. As a fashion designer, you're a stand-in for someone else, and the real Ms. Worry-Free buys design sketches. Both of you are shameless!"

Ella, extremely angry, laughed, her eyes cold. "Slandering others also carries legal responsibility! Are you sure you want to keep going?"

"Of course!"
The live stream continued, and the comments were full of curses.Everyone was demanding that Ella be kicked off the show and that her true face be exposed, driving her out of the fashion industry for good.

Seeing the comments, Andy was thrilled. She wanted to step forward and pull off Ella's mask and hat. But just as she was about to, she remembered Jessa's words and walked over to Ava.


"Let everyone see her true face!" Andy leaned in close to Ava's ear,speaking in a hushed tone.

Ella clearly felt their malice. She saw Ava's eyes light up, and she walked over, raising her hand with a clear purpose.

Ella's heart skipped a beat, and she took two steps back, grabbng Ava's hand. "What are you trying to do?"

"I want everyone to see your face, so you won't tarnish the image of designers in the eyes of the public!"

'Let everyone see what a bitch looks like!' Ava's face was full of malice.She failed once and reached out with her other hand.

Lily, coming to her senses, grabbed her hand and pushed her aside. "Who do you think you are? If you dare touch her, I'll beatyou up!"

When it came to fighting, she was never afraid, rolling up her sleeves.ready to go. Ava, having been hit by Lily before, looked at her and hesitated.

On the other side, Arthur's well-defined fingers tapped on the table,and he watched the live stream. Alan, beside him, was as anxious as a cat on a hot tin roof. "Stop watching, let's go to the scene, something's happened!Our show is going to be ruined!" They invested over a billion dollars in this show, but they only got back half of that amount. If the show truly tanked, the shareholders wouldn't let them off the hook.


Seeing Arthur's calm demeanor, he anxiously said, "Let's go quickly, or itll be too late!"


"What's the rush?" Arthur glanced at his phone. Ella,that stubborn woman, such a big thing happened, and she didn't ask for help.

Seeing the flood of curses in the live stream, he stood up. "Let's go!"

"Okay,hurry up!"

The two hurriedly arrived at the studio entrance, where it was packed with people. Arthur lightly coughed, and the staff sensibly made way.

Arthur, in a suit and tie, exuded a commanding presence, instantly attracting many people's attention. He walked over as if no one else was there,stopping beside Ella.

Through her sunglasses, he could still see her calm face. 'Why didn't she ask for help? Did she expect me to help her?'

Arthur was thinking when his arm was pulled. He turned to see Alan holding his arm. Remembering the matter at hand, he cleared his throat,"What's going on?"
###Chapter 90

"Arthur,you backed my reality show, but I didn't expect to run into such a phony. I'm so upset. Ms. Worry-Free is a fraud, andI this person is no better."


Ava stormed up to Arthur, laying it all out.

It looked like Ella was just a stand-in and a fake.

She knew she had to put on her best face for the cameras, so even when she cried, she made sure to look pitiful and delicate, always aware of her expressions.

But she didn't notice Arthur's face darkening.

His eyes locked onto Ella. "Got anything to say about this?"

"Nothing to say. If someone makes a claim, they need to back it up with evidence! I don't need to prove myself. I am Ms. Worry-Free!"

Ella's shot statement was strong and confident, with no hint of guilt.


Arthur's eyes flashed. "You're good!"

Their eyes met.

Ella didn't look away. "If you want me out, you need to prove I'm not Ms.Worry-Free, or you owe me an apology. Also, if the show goes on, I want a new model!"

Alan, one of the show's investors, didn't dare make a decision and looked at Arthur.

"We need to look into this! Stop the live broadcast, and we'll give everyone a satisfactory answer."

With that, Arthur turned and left, leaving everyone confused.

Ava was stunned for a moment, full of indignation. "Just wait and see!"

Everyone left, leaving the studio empty.

Lily was so mad she felt like hitting someone. "These people are talking nonsense, daring to slander us!"

"Alright, don't be angry. We just need to prepare for the worst!"


"What do you mean by that?"

"If I'm not mistaken, this was probably orchestrated by Ava, and Andy is just a scapegoat!"

Ava seemed weak and gentle on the surface, but she was actually very cunning and always hid behind others when doing bad things.

Lily nodded in agreement. "Then let's expose them!"


"But Arthur won't let anything happen to Ava!"

"I'm not afraid. At worst, we'll start over. I support you, no matter what you want to do!"

Lily and Ella had been friends for many years and understood each other deeply.

Ella sat at her desk, already prepared for the worst.

Meanwhile, Arthur placed the previously investigated materials in front of him and slammed his fist on the table. Alan was startled. "What are you doing? You scared me!"

"How dare she hide this from me!"

"What happened?"

Alan, not understanding, leaned in to look. The name Worry-Free was particularly prominent.

The materials aIso included many of Worry-Free's previous designs.

The styles were innovative and unique, particularly eye-catching.

When he saw the handwriting, his eyes lit up. "You've always said Ella was a stand-in, but it turns out she is indeed Ms. Worry-Free!"

As soon as he said that, he felt a chill down his neck and shrank back."You didn't know, did you?"

Arthur snorted coldly, his chiseled face covered in a layer of frost.

Alan laughed heartily. "You didn't even know about such a big thing!"

Arthur shot him a cold look, his eyes darkening. "Stop talking nonsense!"

The two had been married for many years. Why did Ella hide this? How much more was she hiding from him?

He irritably lit a cigarette. "How's the investigation going?"

"The other party is very cunning. We found the whistleblower. According to them, someone anonymously sent them that information along with a large sum of money!"

Talking about serious matters, Alan's playful expression turned serious. 
He placed the investigation results on the table.

"They used foreign accounts, and the accounts were deleted right after posting. But actions always leave traces. Andy has a foreign background."

The evidence was conclusive.

Andy was the mastermind behind it all. Seeing the amount of money involved, Arthur pressed his temples. "Handle it this way! Have Andy issue an apology statement immediately! This will minimize the impact!"

"Alright, I'll do it right away."

Alan left, and Arthur held Ella's work in his hand, his eyes darkening."Lied to me?"

He put on his coat and turned to leave.

In the studio.

Ella was calculating her personal assets when the door suddenly opened.

Arthur stood at the door, exuding an imposing and aloof presence.

Ella's heart trembled. "I didn't lie! I won't allow anyone to slander Ms.
Worry-Free. I assure you those works were all designed by her!"


As she spoke, she took off her sunglasses.

Their gazes met.

Arthur lowered his head, quickly walked up, and lifted her chin. "Don't you have anything to say?"

Noticing Lily nearby, his eyes darkened as he looked over. "Please leave!" "Alright!"

Sensing the unusual atmosphere, Lily quickly ran out.

The studio was left with just the two of them, and Arthur kissed her forcefully.

The kiss was aggressive, as if he wanted to devour Ella.

As the air in her lungs diminished, Ella struggled, but his strength was overwhelming.

Arthur held her head with one hand, making it impossible to break free.

Just when she thought she was about to suffocate, Arthur reluctantly let her go. "Do you have anything to say now? I hate being lied to the mnost."

His large hand moved to her pussy, his expression playful."Lying comes with a price!"

Arthur slowly leaned in, whispering in her ear.

He licked her ear with his tongue.

The tingling sensation made her body go weak, nearly eliciting a moan from her lips.

"Have you thought it through?"

Arthur's deep, husky voice was filled with endless temptation.

Her body was about to lose control, and Ella panted as she spoke, "What do you want me to say? Ms. Worry-Free is innocent. I can assure you. Don't you believe me?" "I believe you!"

His fingers lightly traced her cheek, while his other hand felt her wetness,his smile deepening. "But right now, in my eyes, you're just a little liar."

The last sentence was spoken slowly, as if hinting at something.

Ella's eyes widened,her petite body enveloped in his shadow.

At some point, their bodies were tightly pressed together with his hands,one on her chest and the other on her pussy.

'If I say the wrong word now, would he take the opportunity to have sex with me?

She took a deep breath. "We must prove Ms. Worry-Free's innocence! And what about your investigation, this matter..."

"This matter was all Andy's doing. I've already had her issue an apology letter.It's over!"

"And what about changing the model?"

"The show's preview has already been released, why bother? I promise to change the model for the next episode!"

The outcome just as expected, Ella's lips curled into a sarcastic smile. "Fine.
I'll attendthe afternoon's runway show on time!"
###Chapter 91

"Good girl!"

Arthur's eyes darkened when he heard Ella give in. He quickly pulled her onto his lap, their bodies pressed tightly together. That was when Ella realized he was already hard and ready.

She glanced down and gave a little twist ofher waist,her already wet core brushing against his erection through their clothes.

Seeing the fire in Arthur's eyes, she leaned in close to his ear. "I'll reward you properly after this is over!"

"I can't wait anymore! I want you now!"

He ripped off her panties, unbuckled his belt, and his cock sprang free.He kissed her hard, one hand gripping her waist and the other supporting her butt.

With a thrust, he was inside her. Ella covered her mouth with her hand,trying to stifle her moans, but they slipped out anyway, her voice a sultry invitation.

Arthur's cock twitched with excitement, and he started thrusting vigorously,pumping in and out of her. In no time, Ella felt herself being filled completely.

Lily was still outside the door, trying hard to keep quiet. Ella felt both ashamed and mindless, looking up at Arthur's face with tears streaming down her cheeks.

"Why are you crying?" Arthur asked, confused. Then he lowered his head and bit her red lips. Caught off guard, Ella let out another moan. Arthur's heavy breathing and Ella's moans mixed together. His movements grew more intense,and Ella's body endured wave after wave of pleasure.

Climax after climax, Ella's body kept twitching, her legs wrapped around his solid waist like an octopus. After what felt like forever, she reached another peak, her nails digging into Arthur's back.

Ella's cheeks were flushed, her expression dlazed, her whole body limp.Arthur,looking satisfied, held her in his arms. "I forgive you," he said, his voice hoarse from passion.

Ella half-closed her eyes, too spent to react. When she finally wanted to speak, Arthur had already dressed and walked out.

"Impressive, you two were amazing!" Lily said as she entered the room,astonished by the scene inside.

Ella lay naked on the desk, completely exhausted. Her smooth skin, full breasts, slender waist, and long legs were exposed to the air. Her skin,dotted with kiss marks, looked like blooming roses, dazzling and eye-catching, making Lily's imagination run wild.

She walked over, tilting her head to look at Ella. "How was it? Did you conquer him with your body?"

Ella gave a self-deprecating smile. "Please, he only loves Ava! I'm just a tool!"

Lily scoffed. "That scumbag just fucks you and then bolts! Next time,you have to struggle, don't let him get away with it!"

"Alright, get ready. It's going to be a tough day since we fell out with them."Okay, with me here, don't worry. No matter how down and out we get.we'll be happy!"

After getting dressed, Ella opened her computer, and the first thing she saw was Andy's apology letter.

Under the power of money. Andy took all the blame on herself. The apology letter was also posted on her personal social media, sincere and earnest.

Ella,however, was full of sarcasm, "If they don't give us justice,we'll get it ourselves!"


"Alright! Go for it!"

Andy had already publicly apologized. In her apology letter, she admitted that jealousy and envy led her to frame Ms. Worry-Free. She solemnly apologized and promised to turn over a new leaf.

The fashion show was about to start, and everyone gathered backstage.Andy timidly hid in the crowd.

Ella spotted her immediately and strutted over in high heels. "Are you sure you want to be the scapegoat? Once you make some choices, you can't ever change them."

"What are you talking about? I don't understand. I've already apologized to you, what more do you want!"

"Alright then!" Ella shrugged. "Remember, you chose the outcome yourself,don't regret it!"

The live broadcast kicked off right at 1 PM. Cecilia was the first to appear.followed by Andy. Despite her mistake, Andy had owned up to it. Whether the netizens forgave her or not, the show couldn't exclude her from the live broadcast. So, she still brought her work and models to the stage.

Backstage, Ella smiled at Arthur and Ava. "What are you doing?"

Ava snapped. "I should be asking you that. The live broadcast is about to start, Cecilia's part is almost over, hurry up and get the clothes out, don't delay the show!"

"What clothes?" Ella spoke sarcastically, "I've already given the clothes to the models, you can leave now!"

Arthur was stunned and questioned, "What do you mean by this?"

Lily rolled her eyes, standing in front of Ella, the two standing side by side.
"It means we don't need you as models anymore. Now leave; you're annoying!"

There were still many staff members around. Ella thought that Arthur wouldn't dare to do anything excessive. She came up with a way to drive Arthur and Ava out. With the door closed, their troubles were shut out.The two high-fived and laughed heartily.

The staff looked at each other, wondering what was going on. Ella noticed their confusion and explained with a smile. "They didn't deserve my design! The fashion show will proceed as usual in a little while, and my model has already arrived!"

"What?" To avoid any mistakes, the staff quickly contacted thedirector.

The director was anxious. He had only been gone for two hours,and such a big problem had arisen. Although the live broadcast continued, and the show's popularity was unprecedentedly high, he was frustrated. He felt like he was going bald, and just then he saw the message from the staff.grabbing his hair again. "What's going onnow?"

The live broadcast couldn't be interrupted. Andy and her group had already left the stage. The director wanted to stop it but it was too late.Looking backstage, he saw Ella leading a few ordinary people onto the stage.

As soon as they appeared, they instantly stunned everyone's eyes.

[What kind of family is this? They look ordinary, but the sense of happiness is overwhelming, it's so healing!]

[The man in a suit, the woman in a dress, and the baby in a little suit,it looks like a noble family. The man is gentlemanly, the woman is gentle,the baby is cute, it's fantastic!]

[I've seen similar clothes before, but for some reason, this group's sense of happiness seems to overflow!]

The three of them instantly won the favor of the netizens. Ella stood aside,watching the screen, her lips unconsciously curling up.
”
###Chapter 92

The best part about boeing a fashion designer? Hands down, it was when the crowd loved your work.

Ella had to bring in these new models last minuate to replace Ava and Arthur.

They look pretty average, which made them way more relatable to regular folks.

A happy little family of three strolled around the stage, and then Ella joined them,leading them in a bow to the audience.

After the show, Ella grabbed the mic. "Hey everyone, you might be wondering why I chose these models. It's because I want to show the joy of everyday people."

Her voice was soft but strong as she explained her design philosophy:happiness wasn't about fancy houses or cars, but about having family and love based on mutual understanding.

With her explanation, the whole show felt even more meaningful.

After talking about the clothes, Ella switched gears. "I have one more thing to address, and that's some rumors from this morning!"

"First off, I am real Ms. Worry-Free. I won't let anyone slander me, and I will take legal action if needed!"

She paused and looked down at the audience.

In the dim light, Arthur, dressed in a suit, looked like a total aristocrat.His sharp features were hidden in the shadows, making him look mysterious and dangerous.

Ella couldn't see his expression, but she felt a chill run down her spine.

She turned her gaze to the camera. "Andy took all the blame, but that's not the truth. Ava, don't you have something to say?"

Ava asked, "What are you talking about?"

"Ever since Andy joined the show, she's been getting all these luxury items from you, which you have shown off on Twitter. How do you explain that?From day one, you accused us of bullying you."

"That's a lie!"

Realizing the accusations were aimed at her, Ava jumped up, clearly upset.

"People know the truth!"

Ella sneered, "You and I both know what's really going on,so why pretend? And another thing..."

Holding the mic, she walked to the edge of the stage. "I asked the show for the relevant videos. It's quite a coincidence that all the videos that could clear my name are missing. Mr. Smith invested billions in this show for you, right? Doesn't that say something?"

"You!"

What used to be a point of pride now felt like a slap in Ava's face.Her face turned red with anger. "Are you really crazy?"

"So what if I am? Are you scared?"

Ella pulled out her phone and showed the screen to the camera. "Everyone.look, this is a video of Andy and Ava plotting together!"

In the video, Ava and Andy were whispering to each other.

Then, Ava handed a bracelet to Andy.

After the video ended, Ella showed several bills.

The bills clearly showed that Ava had transferred up to a million dollars to Andy.

[Shameless! She even played tricks, just jealous of Ms. Worry-Free and wanting to drive her out!]

[Shameless! Such a person should be kicked out of the show. Mr. Smith fell for Ms. Worry-Free. So this woman felt threatened and resorted to despicable means!]

The evidence wasn't complete, but it was enough to reveal Ava's true colors.

Even though Ava's fans tried to defend her in the live stream,they were outnumbered.

They were soon overwhelmed by the vast number of netizens and left.

All the comments were criticizing Ava.

The number of viewers in the live stream hit a new peak, going over a million.

The director was torn. The live stream's numbers were through the roof.which should've been a good thing, but it had nothing to do with fashion design. It was the rich -people drama that had everyone hooked.

Soon enough, today's events were trending on social media.

#New Celebrity Frames Fashion Designer

And right alongside it. Ella was trending too.

#Cool Designer Proves Innocence

Some folks were thrilled, others not so much.

Ella scrolled through the online comments with a smile, while Lily let out a sigh of relief.

No matter what, they had won the first round.

Ava's face flushed with anger, tears brimming as she faced the camera."T m innocent! I don't know where those bills came from. They have nothing to do with me! You all..."

She couldn't keep upthe act.

The netizens' insults were brutal and filthy, and she couldn't take it anymore. She ran off, covering her face.

Even as she fled, her sobs echoed, proving she was quite the actress.

After showing the bills, Ella bowed deeply to the camera. "Thank you all for your support. I hereby announce my official withdrawal from the competition. There are too many shady dealings in this show, and as an ordinary person, I can't fight them, but I can avoid them!"

With that, she took Lily's hand and bowed to the camera again. Then she put down the microphone and left with grace.

Many netizens took screenshots of their backs and posted them online.

[Look at Worry-Free, so cool! Women should be like this,smart and brave!So cool!]

Talking tough made Ella feel great, but reality hit hard.

Ella had just stepped off the stage when she was stopped.

Lily shrank back. "You two talk, I'll go back to the room and wait for you!"

"Okay!"

Ella stood in the shadows, her gaze steady. "What's the matter?"


Arthur laughed in frustration.

An hour ago, they were making love passionately. Now, she was distant and cold towards him.

Arthur's anger subsided halfway as his eyes roamed over her long legs.a hint of desire in his gaze.

"Have you thought about the consequences?"

"What else?" Ella raised an eyebrow. "Do whatever you want! I'll take it!"


"Are you sure you can handle it?"

Arthur stepped forward and grabbed her chin, forcingher to look up at him.


"I'm not kidding!"
Ella grabbed his wrist, her nails digging into his flesh.

The hand gripping her chin tightened, and so did her fingers.

"Good!"

Arthur suddenly laughed, then released her chin. "Next time we meet.I hope you still have this confidence!"

Ella had just returned to the room when Lily rushed up. "How was it?Did he do anything to you?"

Ella joked, "What are you thinking? Your mind is full of dirty thoughts!"

She pushed her away and collapsed on the bed. "We're going to have a tough time ahead!"

"Don't be afraid! I'm here!" Lily said as she packed their bags. "Let's pack up first, in case someone comes to kick us out!"

"You're right!"

Ella only allowed herself a few seconds of despair before she was full of energy,getting up and moving quickly.

In less than half an hour, they had packed everything and took the elevator to the first floor.


"Are you leaving?"

Leo quickly ran over and grabbed their suitcase. "Do you have a car?I'll help you."

"Thank you, you're so nice!" Lily gave his shoulder two quick pats. "Hey.if you ever get fired, youa can always come work at our studio!"
###Chapter 93

Leo was at a loss for words.

Being a director and making clothes? Those are two totally different things.

Ella burst out laughing. "Alright, don't listen to her nonsense. Let's get out of here!"

They hopped in the car, loaded up their luggage, and took off in no time.


From the end of the live stream to their departure, it was less than an hour.


On the balcony, Arthur watched the car fade into the distance,his face dark and brooding.

There was a knock at the door.

Ava walked over, looking upset. "What am I supposed to do now?Everyone online is cursing me, telling me to get out of the entertainment industry! How am I supposed to survive this?"

"Shut up!"

Arthur, irritated by Ava's whining, snapped at her. "'I invested so much time, money, and effort, and you let me down big time."

"Arthur, I'm so sorry! I just couldn't stand her."


"You're way out of line!" Arthur shot her a sharp look.

Ava hung her head in shame, "What do we do next?"

"Let things play out."

Arthur grabbed his coat and walked out.

Alan was dumbfounded.

Ella left, and Arthur took off too, leaving him to deal with the fallout.

As an investor, he scratched his head and looked atthe tearful Ava with disdain. "You just blew a golden opportunity!"


Ava seethed with anger.

She thought joining this fashion competition would show her fans her taste and elegance, solidifying her spot in the entertainment world.

She never expected it to backfire like this.

Thinking about the harsh comments from netizens, Ava clenched her teeth in fury.

The live stream ended, but the online chatter didn't.

Both Ella and Ava were trending on social media.

The reviews were polar opposites. Ella was showered with praise and hailed as the most talented designer in the country, while Ava was branded as two-faced and despicable.

At the studio, Emily saw Ella and Ava return and quickly went to greet them.

"You're back! You two must be exhausted!"

"Not exhausted, just unlucky! How's the studio? Any order cancellations?"

Arthur was vindictive. Ella rubbed her temples, "Let us know immediately if there are any changes!"

Emily nodded. "So far, no order cancellations! In fact, because of your recent online buzz, we've gotten a lot more orders!"

The internet was a double-edged sword; it could lift some people up while tearing others down.

Ella returned to her desk and looked at the new orders, her face full of worry. "I'm afraid we might lose them soon!"

"What are you worried about? Our Worry-Free Studio was built from nothing! If worst comes to worst, we start over." Lily patted Ella's shoulder.
"Now let's think about the breach of contract penalty!"

Since they voluntarily withdrew from the show, if they were held legally responsible, they'd have to pay the penalty.

After Emily left, Ella and Lily started figuring out how to raise the penalty money.

Luckily, they had earned a bit recently, enough to keep them afloat.

But if they paid the penalty, their future works would hit a snag.

"Don't worry, no matter what challenges we face, we just need to tackle them head-on! By the way, I just got an email, take a look."

It was an email from Glenn, inviting Ella to a fashion gala.

Ella glanced at it and smiled. "What's this fashion gala?"

Lily said, "Glenn really came through for us! He's such a rock for our studio."

She added, "Exactly! Even if we get into trouble, orders from this gala won't be canceled!"

The folks attending the fashion gala were all loaded and influential.For them,buying a piece of clothing was like buying a bottle of water.

So,once they placed the orders, they were pretty much locked in.

Ella was pumped. "Let's pack up quick, we're going to this gala!"

"Hold on, take a breather! The gala's in the evening! We can go home and catch some sleep first!"

These past few days, being on the show with cameras everywhere,they had to be on their toes all the time. It was exhausting. Now that they could chill, they should go home and rest.

Ella agreed,packed up, and headed home. As soon as she walked in, Sofia greeted her warmly.

"You're back! Your trip must have been exhausting. Check out the delicious meal I made for you on the table! There's more in the kitchen!"

Sofia took Ella's things and glanced at the kitchen.

Following her gaze, Ella was surprised. "Why is he back too?"


'Isn't Arthur supposed to be with Ava?'

Sofia heard this and nudged her arm. "What are you talking about? Your husband's back, and as a wife, you should be considerate. And you're asking why he's back!"

"Yeah,it's all my fault."

Ella smiled and helped Sofia to the sofa. "Grandma, how have you been these days? Did you miss me?"

"You can be so sweet!" Sofia held Ella's hand, smiling widely. "I'm happy,just that you're busy and don't have time to call me. I missed you! It'srare for you two to be together, you should make the most of tonight!"

Sofia's suggestive words made Ella's face darken. She didn't know how to respond.

At that moment, Arthur, busy in the kitchen, came out.

He hadn't changed his clothes, just took off his suit jacket, rolled up his sleeves, revealing his toned arms.

His long legs were tightly wrapped in suit pants, looking sexy and alluring.

Thinking of this, Ella's cheeks flushed. "You're tired too, let the servants do it!"

"No need! It's rarefor me to be back, I want to cook for grandma," Arthur said indifferently, his eyes fixed on Ella,dark and unreadable.

Ella lowered her head. "Alright, you cook, I'll chat with grandma!"

"You're so inconsiderate, go heIp! I'll pack your luggage!"

Sofia pushed Ella into the kitchen without giving her a chance to refuse.


With the kitchen door closed, it became a confined space.

Ella looked at the prepared ingredients and smiled. "Do you need my help?"

Arthur placed the vegetables in front of her. "Wash these vegetables." "Okay!"

Ella quickly turned on the faucet, the sound of water breaking the awkward silence, calming her uneasy heart a bit.

The two of them in the same space,each doing their own thing, without any communication.

Outsidde the kitchen, Sofia pressed her ear to the door.

Inside, there was only the sound of water. She looked disappointed and pulled the servant to the room.

"What do you think is going on with these two? I've been watching the live broadcast these days, the two of them..."

Sofia had seen everything in her life, sharp and perceptive.

In the live broadcast, Arthur was always defending Ava, she saw it clearly.

Thinking that Arthur had fallen for someone else, Sofia was sad with her eyes filled with tears.

The servant was speechless.
###Chapter 94

In no time, the dining table was loaded with mouth-watering dishes.

Ella was about to sit across from Sofia, but Sofia nudged her right in front of Arthur.


"You two must be missing each other after being apart for so long! After lunch, go take a nap."

Ella was taken aback by Sofia's words. She was about to refuse, but seeing Sofia's hopeful eyes, she just smiled and nodded.

They had just had a fight, and now lying on the same bed would be super awkward.


The food tasted like nothing.

Sofia kept trying to lighten the mood, serving food to Arthur and then to Ella,bustling around like crazy.

Ella noticed and felt uneasy, wanting to say something but holding back.

After the meal, Sofia eagerly pushed them back to their room. "Get plenty of rest; it's the key to staying healthy!"

'Sleeping together more will build feelings.'

Sofia shut the door witha hopeful look on her face.

Ella was speechless.

Looking at the calm Arthur,she felt a bit frustrated.

It wasn't her fault, but she felt guilty for no reason.

"You sleep, I have work to do!" Ella said, avoiding him by grabbing her laptop and sitting by the window.


Arthuir raised an eyebrow and stayed silent, heading straight to the bathroom.


For Arthur, the smell of cooking oil on his body was unbearable.

The sound of running water made Ella nervous. 'What am I afraid of? I didn't do anything wrong.'


Ella patted her face to stay awake, then her fingers flew over the keyboard.busy with her design.

Time was tight, and the task was heavy.

If she had to pay the penalty, Worry-Free Studio would have no cash flow,so she needed to take on more work to make money.

Thinking this, Ella pushed all other thoughts aside andfocused on drawing.

After a while, the water stopped, and Arthur came out of the bathroom.

Ella stretched and looked up, startled. "What are you doing? Why aren't you wearing any clothes?"

"This is my own home."

Arthur's voice was low as he walked over, completely naked.

Ella was startled, quickly turning to close the curtains. "I didn't know you had such a fetish."

Walking around naked in broad daylight.

"What? You've touched it, are you still afraid to look?"

Arthur took a few steps forward and pulled Ella into his arms.

Fresh from the shower, his body carried the fresh, clean scent, his hair wet,with water droplets sliding down, incredibly sexy.

The moment he held her, Ella's whole body stiffened.

Arthur was completely naked, and she wore thin summer clothes.His hot breath was overwhelming, especially the unique scent of Arthur's hormones, making it hard to breathe.

Ella nervously swallowed. "You..."

Just as she spoke, Arthur's long fingers lifted her hair, playing with it in his hand.

He hugged her from behind, his thin lips slowly approaching her ear.

"How should I punish you?"

Arthur's hot breath on her cheek made Ella's body uncontrollably tremble.

At the same time, her legs went weak, and she felt powerless.

Noticing the change in her body, she was angry at herself for being so weak-willed.

They were clearly about to divorce, yet she still couldn't resist his temptation.

She tried to push him away, but Arthur's arms were like iron clamps,tightly holding her in his embrace.

Taking a few deep breaths, Ella spoke in a hoarse voice, "Punish me? Isn't it you who's in the wrong?"

'Ava slandered me, he even defended her, and now he wants to punish me.How shameless!'

Thinking of this, her anger flared, and she struggled to break free.

Seeing Ella struggling in his arms, Arthur smirked, as if mocking her efforts.


A sense of humiliation surged in her heart.

Ella turned her head, her cheeks flushed, her eyes cold. "Please let go of me."

"Keep your voice down, don't wake Grandma!"

"You!"

His attitude made her feel like no matter what she did, it was unreasonable.

Ella pressed her temples, speaking seriously. "Fair is fair, we both know who's at fault! You can ask me to pay the penalty, but please, stay away from me!"

Anger burned in her chest, almost consuming her.

But he didn't seem to care about what she said. Instead, his hands kept wandering over her body.

"To avoid causing Grandma any worry, just cooperate with me!"

"You!"

All communication was in vain.

Arthur's mind was only on sex.

A deep sense of powerlessness surged in her heart, and when Ella wanted to struggle again, the hand on her waist tightened.

Their bodies were tightly pressed together.

Arthur was completely naked, and looking down, his penis was already erect, ready to enter her body at any moment.

Ella knew that Arthur was never one to wrong himself, and she could only endure it.

As she was thinking,his long fingers pinched her chin and kissed her.

The kiss was domineering and punishing, as if he wanted to swallow her whole.

Not getting a response from Ella, Arthur became angry and bit her.

The taste of blood spread in their mouths.

Ella,unwilling to be outdone, bit back, and Arthur smiled, kissing her more roughly.

Ella wanted to dodge but couldn't,forced to endure.

Their lips and teeth intertwined, breaths entangled.

Soon, Ella's eyes were blurred, her body soft, her mind blank, and her clothes were gone, her long legs tightly wrapped around his waist.

Her legs were spread, and her pussy was exposed.

Arthur eagerly entered her body, starting to thrust wildly.

Ella's moans spilled from her lips.

Thinking of Sofia next door, Ela quickly covered her mouth.

Arthur roughly pulled her hand away. "No need! The house is soundproof!"1


"Get lost!" Ella wanted to harshly curse him harshly, but her soft words acted as an invisible aphrodisiac, exciting Arthur.

The two naked bodies entangled, Arthur's big hands wandering over Ella's smooth skin.

His penis thrusting into her body sent a wave of pleasure through Ella.

In no time, she was defeated, her body soft, if not for the hand on her waist,she would have collapsed like a puddle of mud.

Her lips parted, eyes closed, face flushed, the desire in her eyes particularly alluring.

Arthur's heavy breathing and Ella's moans intertwined.

Eventually, when Ella was about to faint, Arthur finally stopped.

He lay naked beside her, panting heavily. "Do you know your mistake?"


Exhausted, Ella had only one thought before sleep,and that was divorce.

Arthur looked at the sleepingElla, carrying her to the bathroom to wash.

The water cascaded over her beautiful face, flushed cheeks, red lips,slender neck, full breasts, slim waist, long legs, and her delicate pussy.

Ella's body was perfect, every part arousing his desire.
###Chapter 95

Arthur looked at Ella's sleeping face and just couldn't bring himself to wake her up again. So, he gave her a quick wash, dried her off, and gently placed her back on the bed.

Even though Ella's eyes were shut, she was totally aware of everything going on. Once she was back in bed, she rolled over and drifted into a deep sleep.

When she woke up again, it was already getting dark. She grabbed her phone and saw a bunch of missed calls.

Ella jumped up, dialing back while heading to the closet to change.

"Ella, where are you? The gala's about to start! I couldn't reach you!"

"Sorry, I overslept. I'll be there in half an hour!"

"Alright, hurry up. I'll wait for you at the entrance. We'll make a grand entrance together!"

"Got it,see you soon!"

After hanging up, Ella quickly picked out a dress and sat in front of the mirror to get ready.

At a fashion party, everyone there was either rich or important. She had to look perfect, especially with her makeup and accessories. As a fashion designer, she couldn't afford to be sloppy.

Looking in the mirror, she noticed the red marks on her body and frowned. She was holding a backless dress, but the hickeys were too obvious

Reluctantly, she picked a different dress.

The new one had a high neck and a high slit, covering the hickeys perfectly.

Ten minutes later, with flawless makeup and dressed to the nines, Ella walked into the living room.

Arthur, who she thought had already left, was sitting on the sofa with his laptop.

Hearing her, Arthur slowly turned his head, raising an eyebrow. "Going out? Dressed like that?"

Ella's graceful figure and the perfectly tailored dress made her look like a goddess, impossible to ignore.

'Going out for what? To meet a lover?'

The dress was too form-fitting, with a high slit showing off her long legs.and the cinched waist highlighting her slender figure.

He felt a lump in his throat. "You can't go out!"

His words were cold and sharp.

Ella's smile faded, and she replied disdainfully, "Why?I married you,I didn't sell myself to you!"

As she spoke, she walked to the door.

She chose a pair of high heels, making her legs look even longer and more alluring.

Grabbing her bag, she was about to leave when she felt his cold gaze.She
一
smiled elegantly. "Sorry, I'm not your mistress, so I won't do everything you say."

Ella's glance was full of charm.

Arthur clenched his laptop. "Are you sure you want to go out?"

"Of course! Don't wait up for me tonight, go to bed early!" Ela,in her high heels, swayed her slender waist and disappeared out the door.

The door closed.

Arthur raised an eyebrow, lightly rubbing his fingers. He could still smnell Ella's scent on them.

She was becoming more and more unruly.

He picked up the phone, his thin lips parting, "Find out where Ella is going!"

After hanging up, he walked into the closet to change his clothes.

When he came out again, he was wearing a tailored suit, exuding an air of nobility, with a distant look in his eyes.

He elegantly raised his arm to check the time, then turned and left the house.

In the room, Sofia watched the two leave through a crack in the door.sighing.

"What are these two up to? They were fine when they were sleeping,what happened now?"


The maid was speechless.
She had been told not to pry into their business when she first started working here.

Now,seeing Sofia's worried face, she couldn't help but feel a bit sorry for her.

Sofia's words hung in the air, and she looked troubled. "Forget it, I need to get more medicine and go to church to pray tomorrow!"

The older generation believed that children were the glue that held marriages together.

In Sofia's eyes, only by having children could their marriage bond be truly strengthened.

After getting in the car, Ella suddenly sneezed.

She turned to look at Lily. "Didn't you say to meet at the entrance of the party?"

"I was worried about you! Let's go together! There are a lot of directors tonight. Especially Mr. Meza, who has a historical drama coming up. If we can snag the costume design for this production, it'll be a huge break for us!"

Ramon Meza was an international director with a ton of awards under his belt.

He was best known for his historical dramas.

His works not only made actors famous but also brought fame to everyone involved.

The costume designer for his last historical drama became a rising star in
the fashion industry because of it.

Ella's eyes lit up, clenching her fist with determination. "We have to get it!"

At the entrance, luxury cars were everywhere, and handsome men and beautiful women were all around.


Everyone was arriving in pairs.

Ella and Lily walked in with their heads held high, their hair flowing.exuding charm, arm in arm.

Their entrance instantly drew a lot of attention.

Ella was in a dark green dress that hugged her curves perfectly. She had a hairpin in her hair, a pearl necklace around her slender neck, and her hands folded in front of her abdomen, looking like a woman from a painting, unreal in her beauty.

Lily, beside her, was equally stunning in a red dress with a large skirt.her fiery red lips and exquisite makeup making every smile full of charm.instantly capturing many men's hearts.

The appearance of the two beauties made many men eager.

Ella and Lily had been beauties since childhood, used to being watched.

They walked into the party hall calmly, with their goal clear: Ramon.

However, Glenn hadn't arrived yet, and without an introduction, it would be rude to approach him directly.

"Let's get something to eat first!"

Lily's suggestion made Ella's stomach growl.
She had barely eaten anything earlier, and after intense sex, she was hungry.

They nodded in agreement and headed to the food area.

But with their exquisite makeup, eating would ruin their lipstick,which wasn't worth it.

So they acted like thieves, looking around to make sure no one was watching, then quickly lowered their heads, opened their mouths wide,and stuffed food in, chewing furiously!

They ate a piece of steak, which filled their stomach.

With delicious food in front of them, they couldn't resist.

So they continued to eat heartily!

They thought their actions were discreet and unnoticed.

In a corner of the party, someone watched the scene with a smile.

His eyes behind the glasses were full of affection. To avoid disturbing them,he stood there for a long time without approaching.

After a while, seeing them finally satisfied and patting their stomachs,he shook his head with a smile and walked over.


"How was it? Are you full?"

The gentle voice startled them, but upon seeing it was an acquaintance,Glenn Cole, they breathed a sigh of relief.
###Chapter 96

The sweet sounds of music started filling the banquet hall.

The host stepped up to the center stage and began introducing the folks who put this shindig together.

This gala was thrown by some big-shot magazines to boost their profiles and support a good cause.

When the host wrapped up, the crowd went wild with applause.

Glenn shot a look at Ella. "This is our shot. If we throw some cash their way,we'll be all over the magazines tomorrow!"

Ella got the hint and gave Lily a nod.

Lily, right on cue, raised her hand. "We're donating $500,000!"

Worry-Free Studio was just getting off the ground and wasn'tia big player yet.

So,$500,000 was the perfect amount-not too flashy, but not cheap either.

Ella and Lily exchanged satisfied smiles.

With the donation part over, the banquet rolled on.

Next up was the mingling session to help everyone make some connections.

Ella looked a bit worried. "Introducing us to Mr. Meza won't get you in hot water,will it?"

"Relax, Mr. Meza knows some of my family. I'm just making the intro.Whether you land the deal is up to you!"
Glenn leaned in close, lowering his voice. "Have some paper and a pen ready, and try to show off your skills. Mr. Meza really appreciates talented designers!".

The lighting was dim, and from a distance, it looked like they were hugging as they whispered.

Meanwhile, in a corner of the banquet, Arthur stared at them coldly.People nearby felt a chill run down their spines, but they couldn't stop gossiping.

"Who was that stunning woman earlier? I heard she's from Worry-Free Studio. She's gorgeous, with those long legs. She and the guy with her look perfect together!"

"Totally! She's beautiful, especially those legs. And the guy is tall. They're a perfect match!"

The gossip reached Arthur's ears.

Efren shivered, pulling his neck in. "Mr. Smith, this banquet is a big deal for Mrs. Smith. She probably wants to work with Ramon!"

The entertainment world was a small place.

Ramon's new TV series was a hot topic, and every designer here wanted a piece of it.

Ramon was a famous director with high standards. Working with him was a surefire way to get famous.

Arthur's face stayed cold, his grip on the wine glass tightening until his knuckles turned white.
Not far away, Ella suddenly smiled.

The sound of glass shattering echoed.

Arthur's wine glass had broken in his hand.

Efren shrank back, hiding in the corner, too scared to say another word.

He silently prayed Ella wouldn't do anything to piss Arthur off more,or the fallout would be brutal.

'What happened to the last person who ticked Arthur off? They crossed him in the morning, and by afternoon, their company was toast.'

A chill ran down his spine, and he wished he could disappear.

But honestly, Ella and that guy did look pretty good together!

Ella was chatting away when she suddenly felt a chill run down her neck.

She glanced around but didn't found any familiar faces in the crowded banquet hall.

Shrugging it off, she smiled. "Thanks a lot!"

"No big deal. Let's head over now! Don't stress, just be yourself!"


"I'll follow your lead!"

Ella took a deep breath to steady herself and then walked over.


Ramon was surrounded by a crowd.

On closer inspection, she recognized many familiar faces.

These were all big-name fashion designers, andit was clear why they were
flocking to Ramon.

Ella cleared her throat and followed Glenn over.

"Quite the crowd here, Ramon!" Glenn said,and people automatically made way for him.

The reason was simple: Glenn hadn't been back long, but he was a big shot.

Ramon turned and saw Glenn, his smile widening. "You only come to see me when you need something. You've been back for ages and haven't visited me!"


"Uncle Ramon, you're always teasing me. It's because you're so busy!"

After some quick small talk, Glenn leaned in close to Ramon's ear and introduced the person beside him, "The one in the dark green dress is Ms.Worry-Free, who prefers to keep her identity under wraps for now. The other is her assistant!"

Ramon was momentarily taken aback, then looked them over and smiled warmly."Hello,ladies!"

"Hello, Mr. Meza. It's a pleasure to meet you. I hope we can work together in the future! We..."

Ella glanced around, realizingit wasn't the best place to talk.

Glenn suggested, "Let's sit over there! It's been a while, let's catch up properly!"

"Sounds good!"

With Glenn's help, things became easier.
They moved to a quieter corner of the banquet hall.

Once seated. Ramon got straight to the point. "I've been watching your live streams lately. You've got good skills and ideas! What you lack is experience, but in this industry, talent trumps experience!"

He picked up a glass of red wine and swirled it gently. "There won't be any more issues with the live streams,right?"

This TV series had a long production time and consumed a lot of resources. He didn't want anything to tarnish it.

Ella smiled confidently. "Don't worry, I won't let you down! And I conduct myself with integrity,so no scandals here!"

"That's good to hear!"

Ramon made a gesture of invitation.

Ella got the hint, pulling out a notebook and pen from her bag. "Your next TV series is a historical one. I did some research online, though it's not comprehensive or professional enough. If we sign the contract, I'll dive deeper!"

As she spoke, she started sketching. A few minutes later, a design appeared on the paper.

Ramon's eyes lit up. "Why did you choose peonies?"

"Peonies symbolize power and wealth, making them perfect for the queen's attire. Of course, the main pattern on the queen's dress is the royal emblem,so the peonies are just on the collar and hem."

When it came to clothing, Ella was a pro.
Ramon fired off several questions. and Ella answered them all smoothly.
They had a great conversation.

Lily,unable to get a word in, just nodded along.

Glenn, legs crossed, held a wine glass, seemingly savoring the wine but actually keeping an eye on Ella.

His gaze was intense, filled with love and admiration.


Lily noticed this and smiled slightly.
###Chapter 97

Lily thought. "If Arthur really makes them pay the penalty, then he doesn't deserve to be Ella's husband. Glenn seems like a much better fit for her."

Years had gone by, and Glenn's crush on Ella hadn't faded one bit. It was clear he genuinely liked her.

Right then and there, Lily decided she was going to play matchmaker for those two.

Ella, meanwhile, had no clue she was about to get a fresh dose of brainwashing.

She was totally lost in her fashion design ideas.

Ramon, being the top dog in historical series, had super high standards for costumes.

After chatting for a bit, Ella soaked up knowledge like a sponge.

On the other side of the room, Arthur was glaring at Glenn and Ella, and he let out a cold snort.

"How ridiculous! Trying to seduce my wife! I want all his info in 10minutes."

Efren had no choice but to dash out of the banquet hall to get it.


When he came back, he had Glenn's info in hand.

Glenn, the heir of the Cole family, had just returned after finishing his studies and was now holding a big position in the family.

Arthur thought, "He's only been back a few months and he's already
cozying up to Ella."

His long fingers drummed on the table, his dark eyes giving nothing away.

After a bit, he muttered, "Too ugly!"

His tone was dripping with disdain.

Efren chimed in, "Of course, he's nowhere near your level!"

Arthur's lips curled up in satisfaction. "Double your salary this month!"

In the distance, Ella laughed heartily, and Arthur's grip on his wine glass tightened, his knuckles turning white.

Efrenwas speechless.

'Ella, can you stop laughing? Your husband's mad with jealousy.'

Efren's inner thoughts went unheard by Ella, and even if she did hear them,she wouldn't care.

She was over the moon. "Mr. Meza, are you serious? You really want to sign a contract with us?"

"Of course! But we need to make sure your reputation doesn't affect the TV series!"


"Don't worry, I promise it won't!"

Ella was so happy she couldn't stop smiling.

Her face was glowing like the spring sunshine, incredibly warm.

Seizing the moment, Glenn pulled out the prepared contract.
Naturally, the contract needed some tweaks. Glenn quickly called his assistant, and half an hour later, the revised contract was in their hands.

Everything went smoothly, and they successfully signed the contract.

Ella's smile was unstoppable.

After signing the contract, Ella felt completely at ease, like a huge weight had been lifted off her shoulders. No more worrying about her studio going bankrupt.

She and Lily then mingled with the guests like social butterflies.

When other fashion designers found out Ella had signed a contract with Ramon, they were green with envy,especially Andy.

Of course, she was at the banquet too.

She wasn't actually invited, but she agreed to be someone's date.

Her goal was to work with Ramon, even if it was just for some scraps, to clear up the rumors about her.

But before she could even make a move, the contract was already signed,and it was with her most hated Worry-Free Studio.

She couldn't stand it. Conveniently, a waiter passed by, and she grabbed two bottles of red wine.

She strode purposefully towards Ella.

No one at the banquet noticed this scene, except for Arthur, who had been keeping a close eye on Ella from the corner. He saw Andy heading her way and quickly got up, moving swiftly.
But there was still some distance between them, and even though he took big strides, it was still too late.

Andy smashed the wine bottle towards Ella.

Just when it seemed likethe bottle would hit Ella and Lily, a pair of strong hands grabbed Ella's waist, pulling her away, and Lily was also pushed aside.

The two bottles of red wine crashed to the ground, spilling wine everywhere, creating a mess.

Ella,still in shock, looked at Andy in front of her. "You tried to hit me!"

Andy, having missed her target, angrily grabbed another bottle of wine from a nearby waiter. "Bitch, it's all your fault, you ruined my career!"

Holding the wine bottle, she kept ranting.

She found a good angle and swung the bottle again.

But Ella and Lily were ready this time, and they easily dodged.

Then, in perfect sync, they each grabbed one of Andy's arms and pulled hard.

Andy screamed in pain, "Let go of me, or I won't let you off!"

"Stop talking nonsense, daring to hurt us in public, you deserve a beating!"


Neither Ella nor Lily was one to back down.

Thinking of the wine bottle just now, if it had hit their heads,they would have been bleeding.

They tightened their grip, one hand holding her arm, the other pulling her hair,causing Andy to raise her head in pain.


"Hitting us with a wine bottle, it's not too much to slap you a few times!"

Without giving Andy a chance to respond, they acted.

In no time, Andy's face was bruised and swollen.

Glenn, watching from the side, couldn't help but smile. "Alright, have you both vented enough?"

With that, he looked at the bodyguards.

The bodyguards understood and immediately dragged Andy out of the banquet hall.

The farce ended.

Ella then realized that Glenn had been standing by her side protectively.

Their posture seemed somewhat intimate.

From a distance, they looked like they were hugging.

She stepped back to maintain distance. "Sorry for messing up the party!"

These days had been too stressful, so Ella lost her temper.

But after hitting someone, she felt a bit regretful.

After all, the people attending the banquet were from the same industry.and this could damage Worry-Free Studio's image.

Glenn smiled brightly. "It's okay. Well done! She deserved it."
"Yes, I think the same! We are so in sync!"

Lily patted his shoulder, giving him an encouraging look. "Keep it up, I'm rooting for you!"

The three of them laughed at Lily's teasing.

On the other side, Arthur, who was too late to help Ella, was furious, his face dark.

Thinking of the scene just now, still in shock, he glanced at Efren."Blacklist Andy."

With a simple sentence,he ruined her career.

Efren nodded and immediately made a call.

The party continued, but Ella could clearly sense that the expressions of those around her had changed.

They seemed somewhat disdainful.

She thought, 'Alright! I don't careabout these strangers's opinions.'

Ella then approached several target clients.

They were all wealthy women who demanded unique clothing styles.

With her eloquence and professional knowledge, Ella secured several big orders.
###Chapter 98

The banquet was finally over.

Ella was so wiped out she could barely stand.

"Lily, I'm just gonna grab a cab. You drive home! It's too much for you to drop me off!"

"Alright! Be safe!"

Ella was debating whether to call Glenn when a car pulled up in front of her.

The window rolled down, and there was Glenn, looking ridiculously handsome with his glasses and a smile. "Hop in, I'll take you home!"

Ella didn't stand on the ceremony. After a quick hello, she got in the car.

The engine roared to life, and they sped off like a bullet.


Arthur was left speechless.

He'd taken a call and was just a minute late coming out.

And now, Ella was in another guy's car. His face darkened, eyes turning icy. "Follow them! Get Ella back!"

'Following is easy, but how do I get her back?'

While Efren was stuck in a dilemma, Arthur yanked him from the driver's seat. "You take a cab home!"

With that, he got in and floored it, speeding off.
Efren stood there, watching the car disappear, heart pounding in fear.

"Mr. Smith, drive safe, or I'm out of a job!"

He muttered, debating whether to call Ella.

Then he saw Arthur block Glenn's car.

Arthur had gone nuts, driving like a maniac and forcing Glenn to stop.

With a screech, Arthur's car skidded to a hal in front of Glenn's.

Thinking of what might happen next, Efren covered his eyes.

It wasn't just Efren who was startled.

When Arthur's car caught up, Ella thought they could just avoid each other.

She never expected Arthur to go crazy, drifting his car to a stop in front of them.

Luckily, the driver braked in time, avoiding a pile-up.

The sudden stop jolted Ella, making her lurch forward.

Just when she thought she'd hit her head, Glenn's arm wrapped around her waist,holding her tight.

The sudden closeness made Ella's heart race.

In the shock, her mind went blank.

It took her a moment to snap out of it. Just as she was about to speak, the car door was yanked open.
Arthur's face was stormy, his cold eyes fixed on Ella's waist.

Seeing Glenn's hand on her waist,he wanted to chop it off.

He pulled Ella out of the car.

Caught off guard, Ella's legs gave out, and she fell into Arthur's strong arms, her hands instinctively wrapping around his waist.

This small gesture pleased him.

Arthur's lips curled slightly, but thinking of Glenn's hand on her waist,he wiped her waist forcefully.

Everything happened so fast, Ella was still in a daze.


A gust of wind cleared her head a bit.

She struggled to stand up from Arthur's arms, her face cold. "Are you crazy? Do you know how dangerous that was?"

Luckily, the driver stopped in time, or it would've been a disaster.

Arthur's lips curled slightly, but he didn't answer. His cold eyes locked on Glenn. "Don't touch what's not yours! Or I wwon't hesitate to chop off your hand!"

Glenn looked at his fingers, still warm from the touch.

Facing Arthur's cold stare, he was unafraid and looked back at Ella wvith gentle eyes.

"We're just friends, and you two are about to get divorced!"

The word 'divorce' hit a nerve with Arthur, his face turning icy.
He swung his arm, trapping Ella in his embrace. "We're just having a spat!You don't stand a chance!"

With that, he scooped Ella up and put her back in his car, flooring the gas pedal.

The scenery blurred past as they sped down the road.

Ella propped her chin on her hand, staring out the window, not wanting to deal with the crazy Arthur.

The atmosphere in the car was cold and silent.

After a while, Arthur sighed. "What do you want?"

"I want to work, make money, pay off debts! I want freedom!" Ella didn't even look at him, her tone full of impatience.

"You!"

Arthur irritably pounded the car door. "Stop making a fuss! And I haven't agreed to the divorce."

Ella sneered, "So what? Stay away from other men? You can spend a fortune on Ava, but I have to stay away from other men. Why should I do this?"

Ella turned her head, coldly looking at him, the sarcasm in her eyes undisguised.

Just then, the light turned red, and the car stopped. Arthur frowned. "Can you clear your head? Stop saying things out of anger. Ava and I are not what you think. I take care of her because..."

At that moment, the light turned green.
The car didn't move, and the honking from behind kept sounding.

Arthur irritably withdrew his gaze and floored the gas pedal.

The explanation was interrupted, and he had no desire to speak again.

Ella was speechless.

They were about to get divorced. Ella no longer cared about his relationship with Ava.

She looked out the window, not caring about Arthur's intentions.

The car stopped at the house. She got out and went inside without hesitation.

Opening the door, she thought Sofia had already gone to bed. She quietly went to her room, feeling irritated at the thought of sharing a room with Arthur tonight.

She grabbed a random nightgown and walked into the bathroom.

After a quick wash, she looked at the nightgown in her hand and froze.

'What was going on? Oh my God, I just grabbed a random one.

It was a revealing lace dress, showing off her long legs and a large part of her chest. It was a sexy lingerie.

Ella covered her face with her hand, feeling embarrassed. Just as she was thinking of changing, she heard the door open.

'Oh no, Arthur is back.'

In a panic, she turned on the faucet.
The water ran, and she was as anxious as a cat on hot bricks, not knowing what to do.

She could only hope Arthur had something to do and would leave.

Time passed slowly. She pressed her ear to the door, hearing the sound of clothes being taken off.

Arthur wasn't going to leave.

There was a knock on the bathroom door.

Ella was startled, her voice trembling, "What is it?"

"It's been too long for your shower. Hurry up and come out!"

Arthur's voice was cold, giving no hint of his mood, but Ella felt a chill.

She rolled her eyes and said, "The water heater has some issues. You should use the other bathroom!"

"Come out!"

Arthur's commanding tone left no room for refusal.

Ella,leaning against the door, was furious. "I don't want to come out.You go somewhere else!"

As soon as she finished speaking, the doorknob turned.

Ella immediately grabbed the doorknob, but Arthur was so strong that the door was about to get pulled open.

Arthur lost his patience. "What are you fussing about?"
###Chapter 99

"Hold on a sec, I'll be right out!"

Ella knew she couldn't dodge this, so she had to face it. She glanced at the clothes in her hand; better to wear them than nothing at all.

Then she spotted a towel nearby and got an idea.

The door creaked open.

Arthur glanced over, a smirk playing on his lips.

Fresh from the shower, Ella smelled like body wash, her smooth skin on display, looking incredibly tempting.

Her hair was still damp, hanging loose, and her eyes had that lazy,sexy look, mixed with a bit of nervousness, like a scared, injured deer.

Arthur raised an eyebrow, watching her slowly step out. When their eyes met,Ella's gaze was so captivating it made his mouth go dry.

"Didn't get enough at noon?"

Arthur's deep, husky voice broke the silence.

Ella jumped, pressing herself against the wall. "Aren't you gonna shower?Hurry up!"

"Something's off here."

Arthuar squinted, giving her a once-over.

Ella's scalp tingled, feeling the heat rise in her body as she pressed tighter against the wall, trying to keep her distance.
Arthur's eyes darkened, his sharp gaze scanning her.

He noticed the kiss marks on her smooth skin, his pupils narrowing,throat bobbing.

Ella felt the shift in him and quickly said, "Go shower, it's late!"


"Alright."

Arthur turned to the wardrobe, puzzled as he slowly approached her.

His unique scent surrounded Ella,his tall frame looming over her, full of pressure.

Ella clutched the towel tightly, lowering her voice, "Hurry up and go!"

"Always in a rush? What are you hiding?"

Noticing her odd behavior, Arthur's expression changed,and he yanked the towel away.

Seeing her outfit, Arthur's mouth went dry, his throat moving up and down,eyes full of desire.

Ella panicked, looking down at herself, then screamed and ran back to the bed,covering herself with the blanket.

"I grabbed the wrong clothes! Don't get the wrong idea,go shower!"

Her explanation sounded more like an excuse.

Arthur chuckled, then jumped onto the bed, trapping Ella in his arms.

"Are you sure you grabbed the wrong clothes and weren't trying to seduce me?"
His long fingers brushed her cheek.

Arthur's touch was scorching, making her shiver wherever he touched.

Just that simple touch made Ella tremble, her body going limp. She glared at him, trying to stay calm. "Go shower!"

"Alright,wait for me!"

Arthur smiled meaningfully, then walked into the bathroom.

'What just happened?'

Ella's mind was a mess, her face blushing as she replayed the scene.


Her words had sounded a bit too suggestive.

To avoid more embarrassment, she quickly jumped out of bed, changed into very conservative clothes, covering herself up, and got back under the covers.

She'd been through so much that day, she was exhausted. and soon her breathing evened out.

The bathroom door opened again.

Arthur didn't even bother to dry off, eagerly walking out.

But instead of the alluring beauty he imagined, he found Ella sleeping soundly, like a little pig.

He walked over tentatively, his hot breath brushing her ear.

Ella mumbled in her sleep, annoyed, then pulled the blanket over her head and continued snoozing.
Her little face was flushed from sleep; she was really fast asleep.

Arthur glanced down at his erection, his eyes darkening.

"Just teasing me without helping me out, huh? You little devil."


Ella, even in her sleep, was smiling, dreaming about securing Ramon's big order. She was already fantasizing about how this would cement her place in the industry and lead to great success.

In her sweet dream, she suddenly felt a big hand roaming over her body.


Arthur's unique scent filled her nose.

That big hand stopped at her chest, then moved down to her pussy.


'Am I dreaming?'

Feeling the itch below, Ella's eyes flew open. She grabbed Arthur's hand."Don't mess around, it's late."

"Is it late?"

Arthur scooped her up, trapping her in his arms. "But my little friend here is wide awake!"


Their bodies were pressed tightly together.

She could clearly feel his erection.

Ella's body stiffened, her face full of refusal. "I'm tired, I want to sleep!"

"That's not up to you! If it weren't for your sexy lingerie, I wouldn't be so worked up!"

Ella's face turned red with shame. She was about to say something, but
Arthur, seeing her conservative clothes, angrily tore them off.

Arthur, naked, pressed down, sensing the wetness in her vagina, and entered her directly.


"You!"

Ella was startled, her whole body trembling. A moan almost escaped her lips, and she quickly covered her mouth with her hand.

But Arthur wasn't satisfied. One big hand lifted her hands above her head,the other grabbing her full chest.

They knew each other's bodies well.

In no time, Ela's face was flushed; she was already aroused.

Arthur's movements became rougher, thrusting wildly,each thrust hitting her cervix.

Ella was forced to endure, her body trembling, feeling his erection constantly invading her, moans spilling from her lips.

Hearíng her sounds, Arthur got more excited, grabbing her waist and thrusting even more fiercely.

After a while, Arthur seemed dissatisfied with the position. He grabbed her and pressed her against the wall.

Ella felt shy as she pressed against the wall, her hips sticking out towards him.

Seeing her slender waist and round butt, Arthur got even more aroused.his movements becoming more intense.
Seeing Ella's aroused state, he seemed to comfort her, dropping a kiss on her ear.

Ella was tightly held, Arthur's unique scent constantly filling her nose,her whole body burning, her mind dizzy.

At this moment, she couldn't think, only feeling her whole body burning,especially the erection inside her, constantly filling her.

Time passed bit by bit, and finally,he stopped.

Arthur held her, groaning, panting heavily. "This sexy lingerie is great,wear it more often!"


"You!"

Hearing his voice, Ella was mortified.

She looked up, glaring fiercely. "I said I grabbedI the wrong clothes!"

"Okay,I believe you!"

Arthur's face was full of indulgence, as if everything Ella said was just playing hard to get.

Ella was about to explode with frustration.

She glared fiercely, thinking she looked quite intimidating.

But what she didn't expect was...
###Chapter 100

Right now, if she glanced in the mirror, she'd see her cheeks all flushed,eyes sparkling like little pools, her look all sultry, oozing that can't-resist charm.

Ella,feeling totally wiped out, dragged herself to take a quick shower and then crashed into bed.

When Arthur got back to bed, Ella had already shut her eyes.

He chuckled softly as he lifted the blanket, causing Ella to curl up like a scared little bird.

Arthur sighed and pulled her into his arms. "Just sleep! I swear I won't bug you anymore!"

However, his promise didn't hold much water.

Because in the middle of the night, Arthur kept kissing her again.

Even though he didn't go all the way, he did everything else.

Seeing the kiss marks and bite marks on her body, Ella angrily grabbed his arm and bit down hard.

After a whole night of chaos, it was already noon when she finally woke up.

Dragging her tired self, Ella opened the door and saw Sofia's teasing grin.

"Tired, huh? Come on over, I made you some nourishing soup! They say drinking this guarantees a baby boy!"

The rich aroma drifted over.
Thinking about the soup's purpose, Ella instinctively resisted.

Sofia cheerfully served a bowl and placed it beside her. "Hurry up and drink, Arthur had a bowl before he left!"

"Really?" Ella looked skeptical.

Sofia nodded. "Of course, having a baby isn't just your job, it takes both of you. Trust me, if you both follow the plan, you'll definitely have a baby!"

"Alright then!"

Though she said that, Ella had already made up her mind; she was determined to get a divorce ASAP.

Starving,she felt full after drinking a bowl of soup and soon arrived at Worry-Free Studio.

Sitting at her desk, Ella called the other two over.

"Emily, there are only three of us in the studio, and we've taken on a big project. We need to work together, or we won't be able to handle it! Don't worry, there will be bonuses after this project!"

Emily smiled happily. "Thank you. I'll definitely follow orders and work hard to complete the task!"

"Alright, let's team up and we'Il definitely finish it!" Ella handed the prepared materials to the two of them.

"Even though I'm a fashion designer, this time we're designing costumes for a historical drama. This means we need to ensure the costumes are historicallyaccurate. We need to combine history and find relevant info! It'Il be hard work for you."
One person's strength was limited.

To avoid designing historically inaccurate costumes,for the next few days,the three of them would research and mark important points.

The three of them formed a team and quickly divided the work.

At the end of the day, Lily stood by, hesitant to speak.

Ella raised an eyebrow. "What's up?"

"What do you think of Glenn?"

Ella was stunned. "What do you mean?"

"Don't play dumb with me, Glenn likes you. What do you think?"

"What can I think? I'm not divorced yet. I can only take it one step at a time,and besides..."

Thinking of their past relationship, Ella smiled bitterly. "There's a big gap between us, so don't talk nonsense! I don't want to affect him!"

"You always think about others, not yourself!"

The two of them chatted as they walked to the studio entrance.

A Rolls-Royce Phantom pulled up.

The window rolled down, and a familiar face appeared.

Ella frowned. "I can go back by myself!"

"Get in the car, Grandpa wants us to go back!"

Even though they were getting divorced, dealing with the elders was still a
shared responsibility.

Ella waved to Lily. "You go ahead, I have a task to complete!"

The word "task" drifted into his ears with the wind.

Arthur's face darkened.

The car sped down the road in silence.

Ella sensed that the atmosphere was a bit off, but she didn't pay it much mind, assuming he was just stressed about work.

Not wanting to be his emotional punching bag, she propped her chin on her hand and looked out the window.

Coincidentally, it was especially congested after work today, and under the neon lights, her beautiful face looked even more alluring.

Arthur glanced at her out of the corner of his eye,his throat tightening. He pulled Ella's waist, trapping her in his arms.

"You!"

Just as she was about to say there were people around, the driver in front sensibly pulled up the partition.

The back of the car became a private space.

Ella's face flushed as she pushed Arthur away. "I'm very tired!"


"Really?"

Arthur's tall body pressed closer, his eyes full of mischief. "Are you sure?"


"We're almost there, don't mess around!"
To Ella's relief, the traffic cleared up.

Soon, the car arrived at the Smith Villa.

Before getting out, she saw Robert coming out with a cane.

Robert's kind smile made her feel at ease.

Ella got out of the car and greeted him. "Grandpa, why did you come out!"

"Of course, to welcome you! How have you been? How's your health?"


Robert was eagerly hoping for a grandchild.

Ella's smile became a bit awkward. She warmly took Robert's arm. "I'm fine,just a bit busy with work lately. Let's go inside first!"

They chatted and laughed as they walked in.

"Isn't this the busy bee? Instead of being a good rich wife, you insist on working for others, born lowly!"

A sharp, sarcastic voice suddenly sounded.

Ella looked up and saw that Arthur's aunt, Gabriella Jade, was also there.

Every time they met over the years, Gabriella would mock her.


In the past, Ella would never talk back.

But now, since she and Arthur were getting dlivorced,why should she put up with it?

Ella's smile faded, and she spoke unceremoniously, "Born lowly? What do you mean by that? Are you looking down on hardworking people? I remember Grandpa saying the Jade family used to be poor, right?"
Halfway through, she turned to Robert with a smile.

Robert glared at Gabriella, displeased. "As an elder, you should act like one.Stop being so sharp-tongued. If you keep this up, go home and don't come here to be an eyesore!"

Robert's words were extremely blunt, like a slap in the face.


Gabriella had never been treated like this.

In the past, Ella would never have dared to talk back to her.

She stood up abruptly from the sofa. "Dad, you're siding with an outsider now, and what did I say wrong? She married into a wealthy family and doesn't think about having children, just about working."

"Shut up!"

Robert, unable to bear it, scolded coldly, "If you keep this up, leave now."


"Dad,you've changed!"
