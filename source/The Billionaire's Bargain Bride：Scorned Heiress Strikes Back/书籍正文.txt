###Chapter 1

The storm raged over Owathe that evening, the downpour relentless as Evelyn Hartley hurried toward Dream Club. Rain lashed against her skin, soaking through her clothes, but miraculously, the cake box in her arms remained untouched.

At the entrance to the private room, she hesitated, her fingers curling around the door handle. Then, a voice from inside froze her in place.

"Serena, for three years, Nathan never stopped looking for you. And now—you're finally back!"

Evelyn's breath hitched.

Serena Cole.

The same Serena Cole who had once been Nathan Black’s lover.

A soft, feminine laugh followed. "But hasn’t Nathan already married?"

"Oh, Serena, don’t even think about that woman. Nathan was forced into it. His father threatened to kill you if he didn’t comply. He only married her to protect you."

"Really?" Serena’s voice dripped with skepticism.

"Of course! Why else would Nathan choose someone like Evelyn? She’s plain, overweight, and an illegitimate child. Marrying her was just his way of spiting his father!"

Evelyn’s grip on the cake box tightened, her knuckles whitening. The words sliced through her like a blade, leaving her numb.

She remembered the night Nathan had proposed—how her heart had soared, how she’d thought herself the luckiest woman alive. She hadn’t known then that she was nothing more than a pawn in his revenge.

A bitter laugh escaped her lips.

So, in their eyes, she was just the ugly, unwanted wife.

"Speaking of Evelyn," another voice chimed in, "it’s been five hours. Do you really think she’s coming? Delight Desserts is all the way in the eastern suburbs. The trip alone takes three hours, and that place always has a ridiculous line. No way she’s dumb enough to go."

"If Nathan asked, she’d crawl there on her knees. Everyone knows how pathetically obsessed she is with him."

Evelyn inhaled sharply, forcing her expression into steel. Then, with a sharp push, she swung the door open.

The room fell silent as all eyes turned to her.

Her gaze immediately found Nathan—lounging on the sofa, his posture effortlessly elegant, his striking features as flawless as ever. The man who had once made her heart race.

Her husband.

The CEO of Triumph Consortium.

A mocking voice broke the silence.

"Serena, ever wondered what Nathan’s wife looks like? Well, here she is."

Evelyn stood there, drenched and disheveled, her clothes clinging to her curves in unflattering ways. Rain-soaked strands of hair stuck to her face, drawing attention to the dark mark on her left cheek.

The room waited, breathless, for her reaction.

But Evelyn only smiled—cold, sharp, and utterly unreadable.

"Sorry I’m late," she said, her voice steady. "The cake took longer than expected."

And then, with deliberate slowness, she lifted the box—and let it drop to the floor.

The crash echoed through the room.

Silence.

Then—

"Oops."

Her smile didn’t waver.

Nathan’s eyes darkened.

And the game began.
###Chapter 2

Ignoring the mocking gazes around her, Evelyn stepped forward with trembling hands, placing the delicate dessert box on the glass table. "Nathan, I got the mousse cake you wanted," she said, forcing a smile that didn't reach her eyes.

Nathan didn't even glance her way as he pushed the box toward Serena. "Here, darling," he cooed, his voice dripping with false sweetness. "Now you can have it."

Serena's cheeks flushed pink as she fluttered her lashes. "Oh, I only mentioned it in passing..."

The realization hit Evelyn like a physical blow. Her breath caught as she stared at the cake box - the one she'd waited in line for four hours to obtain, skipping lunch and enduring the summer heat. All for Serena?

"See how devoted Nathan is to you, Serena?" one of the socialites crowed. "He'd move mountains for you!"

"Go on, eat it," another chimed in. "Evelyn went through so much trouble to get it. Would be a shame to waste her... efforts."

Evelyn's nails dug into her palms, the pain barely registering over the humiliation burning through her veins. She'd never felt more like a pathetic fool in her life.

Nathan suddenly stood, his towering frame casting a shadow over Evelyn as he approached. His ice-cold gaze met hers without a flicker of emotion.

"The divorce papers are waiting on your nightstand," he stated flatly. "Sign them tonight."

"Divorce?" The word tore from Evelyn's throat as all color drained from her face. Her knees threatened to buckle beneath her.

Nathan's expression remained impassive. "I only married you to satisfy my father and protect Serena's reputation. Now that she's back, my obligation is fulfilled."

The truth sliced through Evelyn's heart with surgical precision. Their entire marriage had been a calculated ruse. She was nothing more than a disposable pawn in his twisted game.

A hollow laugh escaped Evelyn's lips, bitter and broken. She lifted her tear-filled eyes to meet Nathan's, a final desperate plea shining through. "Tell me honestly, Nathan... In all these years, did I ever mean anything to you? Or was I just... convenient?"

Cruel laughter erupted around them. "Is she serious? Does she actually think Nathan could care about someone like her?"

"Look at her! She's practically invisible!"

Nathan didn't even blink as he delivered the killing blow. "Yes."

The single word shattered what remained of Evelyn's heart. Tears spilled over as she felt something inside her break irreparably.

A strange calm settled over her then. With slow, deliberate movements, Evelyn nodded. "I understand," she whispered. "I'll sign them tonight."

The words tasted like ashes in her mouth.
###Chapter 3

"See you tomorrow at ten at the courthouse," Nathan said, his voice devoid of warmth.

Without another word, he turned away and sank back onto the plush sofa, his attention already elsewhere.

Evelyn's footsteps dragged as she moved toward the door, each step heavier than the last.

Just then, Serena's saccharine voice drifted through the room. "Nathan, I'm stuffed. Can I throw this cake away?"

Evelyn froze at the words, her breath hitching.

"Of course," Nathan replied without hesitation.

Hearing his casual dismissal, Evelyn squeezed her eyes shut, letting the tears mingle with the rain still clinging to her cheeks.

She fled the penthouse and returned to Reverie Villa—the home she had once shared with Nathan.

The divorce papers lay on the coffee table, just as he had promised.

Evelyn skimmed through the documents, her fingers trembling slightly as she noted the terms.

Three hundred million dollars. Two luxury estates.

Even after using her, Nathan had ensured she wouldn’t leave with nothing.

Three years of marriage, reduced to a transaction. Was this her worth?

A bitter laugh escaped her lips as she signed the papers.

A single tear splattered onto the document. She quickly wiped it away, blinking hard to stop any more from falling.

Then, her phone buzzed.

A message from her mentor.

"Evelyn, have you made your decision? This scholarship abroad is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Don’t let it slip away."

Evelyn stared at the screen, her fingers hovering before she typed her reply.

"I’ve decided. I’m going."

For weeks, she had hesitated, torn between staying and starting over.

Now, the choice was clear.

She would take this chance.

She needed this chance.

A new life. A fresh start. One where she wasn’t just someone’s discarded wife.

After sending the message, she shoved her phone into her pocket and began packing.

Despite the fever from yesterday’s downpour, she forced herself to the courthouse the next morning, arriving right at ten.

But as the clock ticked past eleven, Nathan was nowhere to be seen.

Evelyn dialed his number.

The moment the call connected, Serena’s voice chirped in the background. "Nathan, can you help me with this?"

Then, Nathan’s voice, distracted and indifferent. "I’m busy. We’ll reschedule."

The line went dead.

Evelyn lowered the phone, her grip tightening around it.

Of course.

Even now, she was an afterthought.

But not for long.

She turned on her heel and walked away.

This time, she wouldn’t wait for him.

This time, she would choose herself.
###Chapter 4

The line went dead without warning.

Evelyn Hartley stared at her phone, the sudden silence pressing against her eardrums. A lump formed in her throat, sharp and unyielding. With trembling fingers, she typed out one last message to Nathan Black—short, final, a quiet surrender.

Then, without hesitation, she pried the SIM card from her phone and dropped it into the nearest trash bin. The action was swift, decisive. No turning back.

She slipped her phone into her pocket and walked away, her heels clicking against the pavement in a steady, determined rhythm. Today wasn’t just another day. Today was the day she left for Chixdon.

And she swore to herself—once she stepped onto that plane, Nathan Black would become nothing more than a ghost of her past.

Three Years Later

The Caldwell family estate in Owathe buzzed with energy, the grand banquet hall alive with laughter and the clinking of crystal glasses. The air was thick with the mingling scents of expensive perfumes and champagne.

The Caldwells, one of Owathe’s most powerful families, had spared no expense for tonight’s celebration. The return of their patriarch’s goddaughter from abroad was an event worthy of the city’s elite, and they had all come—politicians, business magnates, socialites—each vying for a glimpse of the woman who had been absent for years.

In a shadowed corner of the room, Dylan Reeves leaned in, his voice low.

“Nathan, isn’t it true that Evelyn’s back today too?”

Nathan Black stilled, his fingers tightening imperceptibly around his wine glass. He took a slow sip before nodding, his expression unreadable.

Dressed in a tailored navy suit, he exuded effortless authority, his presence magnetic even in silence.

“About damn time,” Dylan muttered, then turned to Serena Cole, who stood beside Nathan with practiced grace. “That woman Nathan married should’ve been out of his life years ago. Congratulations, Serena. It’s only a matter of time before you take her place.”

Serena’s lips curved into a demure smile. “Being by Nathan’s side is enough for me. Titles mean nothing.”

But the way her gaze lingered on Nathan betrayed her true desires. Everyone in the room could see it—the hunger, the expectation.

Nathan didn’t meet her eyes. Instead, he tapped his glass absently, lost in thought.

Dylan smirked, nudging him. “Come on, Nathan. You adore Serena. Once Evelyn’s officially out of the picture, you’ll make her your wife, won’t you?”

Nathan remained silent, his jaw tense.

Serena opened her mouth to speak—but before she could, a hush fell over the crowd.

All heads turned toward the entrance.

The sharp click of heels against marble echoed through the hall, commanding attention.

And then—

She appeared.

A vision in crimson.

The dress clung to her curves, the deep V-neckline daring, the sequins catching the light with every step. The fishtail hem swayed with her movements, fluid and hypnotic.

Her face was a masterpiece—high cheekbones, full lips, eyes lined in dark kohl that only amplified their brilliance.

Evelyn Hartley had returned.

And she was stunning.
###Chapter 5

Her presence didn’t just command attention—it electrified the room, leaving everyone breathless.

“Holy hell! Who is that woman? How has someone this mesmerizing been hiding in Owathe all this time?” Dylan Reeves blurted, his jaw practically hitting the floor.

Serena Cole smirked, swirling her champagne. “Stunning, isn’t she?”

Nathan Black’s gaze lifted slowly, his sharp eyes narrowing as they landed on her. Recognition flickered—subtle, dangerous.

Dylan, ever impulsive, straightened his tie with a cocky grin. “I’m getting her number. Watch and learn.”

He sauntered over, flashing what he thought was his most irresistible smile. “Well, hello there. Dylan Reeves—heir to the Reeves fortune. And you are…?”

Evelyn Hartley’s lips curved, amusement dancing in her eyes.

Oh, the irony.

This was the same man who’d sneered at her in the past, tossing cruel jabs like confetti. Pathetic. Worthless. His words had cut deep once.

Now? He was practically drooling.

The satisfaction was delicious.

Dylan, mistaking her smile for encouragement, leaned in. “Care to share your name, gorgeous?”

Before she could answer, a smooth, commanding voice cut through. “Evelyn.”

Both turned.

Ethan Caldwell approached with effortless grace, his presence alone parting the crowd.

Dylan stiffened. “Mr. Caldwell.”

Ethan barely spared him a glance before locking eyes with Evelyn. “Marcus is waiting. Your godfather doesn’t like to be kept waiting.”

“Of course.” She fell into step beside him without hesitation.

Dylan gaped as they walked away, then bolted back to Nathan’s group, nearly tripping in his excitement. “That’s Marcus Donovan’s goddaughter! Evelyn something—sounds like royalty, right?”

Nathan’s expression darkened.

Theodore Whitmore, silent until now, finally spoke. “Marcus and his wife never had children. For years, relatives tried pushing their kids on them—all rejected. Then, three years ago, they announced a goddaughter from Chixdon. Everyone assumed she lived there. Turns out she’s been here the whole time.”

Dylan’s grin turned predatory. “Mom wanted me to cozy up to Marcus’s heir. Wasn’t thrilled before… but now?” He cracked his knuckles. “Consider me motivated.”

The game had just gotten interesting.

###Chapter 6

"You can't go after her."

The deep, gravelly voice cut through the air like a blade, silencing the room. Nathan Black stood with his arms crossed, his piercing gaze fixed on Dylan Reeves.

Dylan and Serena Cole both stiffened, their expressions shifting from amusement to shock.

"Why the hell not?" Dylan demanded, his brows furrowing in confusion.

Nathan’s face remained unreadable, his tone icy. "Because I said so."

The finality in his words left no room for argument. His sharp jawline and dark eyes betrayed nothing, but the tension in the room thickened instantly.

Serena’s lips parted as if to speak, but before she could utter a word, Nathan pushed off from the wall and strode out of the room without another glance.

Frustration coiled in Serena’s chest as she watched him leave, her fingers curling into tight fists. Why would Nathan care if Dylan pursued that woman?

Evelyn Hartley stepped out of the restroom, smoothing the fabric of her dress before turning to head back to the ballroom.

Then she froze.

Leaning casually against the wall, his tall frame casting a long shadow, was Nathan Black.

Their eyes met—just for a fraction of a second—before Evelyn coolly averted her gaze and walked past him as if he were a stranger.

She had spent three years convincing herself she had erased him from her memory.

Yet here he was, effortlessly unraveling her resolve with just one look.

But this time, she wouldn’t let him see her falter.

"Wait."

His voice, low and commanding, stopped her in her tracks.

Evelyn turned, her lips curving into a practiced, polite smile. "Can I help you, sir?" Her voice was smooth, almost melodic, betraying none of the storm raging inside her.

Nathan let out a dark chuckle, his smirk laced with irony. "Evelyn, are we really playing this game?"

Her breath hitched.

He recognized her.

For a brief moment, surprise flickered in her eyes before she schooled her expression back into indifference. "What do you want, Mr. Black?"

"No more pretending?" he challenged, stepping closer until he loomed over her.

Evelyn tilted her chin up, meeting his gaze head-on. "Since you’ve already seen through me, what’s the point?"

Nathan’s lips curled into a humorless smile. "Did you really think running away for three years would erase everything between us?"

The air between them crackled with tension.

Evelyn’s pulse raced, but her voice remained steady. "I don’t know what you’re talking about."

Nathan leaned in, his breath warm against her ear as he murmured, "Then let me remind you."

###Chapter 7

"Fled?" Evelyn Hartley's lips curled into a mocking smile as if she'd just heard the most absurd joke.

She met Nathan Black's gaze head-on, her emerald eyes flashing with undisguised scorn. "You're the one who stood me up that day, Nathan. You set the time, then changed it last minute. Did you expect me to wait around like some obedient puppy? Newsflash—you're not that special."

The venom in Evelyn's voice made Nathan's jaw tighten visibly.

As his expression darkened, she cut him off with a dismissive wave. "Save your breath, Mr. Black. The divorce is happening. Ten o'clock sharp at the courthouse tomorrow."

Turning on her heel, she paused mid-step and threw him one last scathing look over her shoulder. "Do try to be punctual this time. Unlike you, I value my time."

The click of her stilettos echoed through the hallway as she walked away without a backward glance.

Rounding the corner, Evelyn pressed a trembling hand against the wall, her carefully constructed composure cracking. Beneath the icy facade, her pulse raced like a trapped bird.

After steadying her breathing, she smoothed her dress and reentered the ballroom—only to be met with chaos.

"Mr. Patel! Someone help!"
"Raj! Stay with me!"
"Call 911 now!"

A panicked crowd parted as a figure rushed past Evelyn toward the commotion's epicenter.

Raj Patel, a distinguished businessman, lay sprawled on the marble floor, his face turning an alarming shade of purple as he gasped for air.

Nathan was already kneeling beside him when Evelyn arrived.

"Nathan!" Priya Sharma, Raj's distraught wife, clutched at Nathan's sleeve like a lifeline.

"Stay calm, Mrs. Sharma," Nathan said in that infuriatingly composed voice. "Marcus—fetch Dr. Donovan immediately!"

"Make way!" Evelyn's commanding voice cut through the hysteria as she pushed forward.

Her couture gown restricted movement, so without hesitation, she ripped the delicate fabric up to her thighs and dropped to her knees beside the gasping man.

With practiced efficiency, she tore open Raj's collar and pressed two fingers to his throat. "Ethan!" she barked at the nearest familiar face. "Emergency kit. Now!"

As Ethan Caldwell sprinted away, Evelyn addressed the gawking crowd. "Everyone back! He needs oxygen!"

Her sharp tone sent guests stumbling backward, creating a clearing around the scene.

Raj's lips were turning blue when Evelyn tilted his head back—just as his body went terrifyingly limp.
###Chapter 8

The crowd gasped and instinctively stepped back, creating a wide berth around Raj Patel and Evelyn Hartley.

Nathan Black observed Evelyn handling the medical emergency with practiced precision, his thoughts drifting. It suddenly struck him—she'd completed her medical degree before switching to biomedical research.

Just then, Ethan Caldwell arrived with the emergency kit, breathless. "The medical supplies, Miss Hartley!"

Efficient hands unzipped the case, retrieving antiseptic, sterile gauze, and a preloaded syringe. Evelyn saturated a cotton pad with disinfectant, swabbing an area near Raj's left pectoral muscle.

As she prepared the injection, a shrill voice pierced the tension.

"Stop right there!" Serena Cole pushed forward, eyes flashing. "Who authorized you to play doctor? This isn't some back-alley clinic—that's a human life you're gambling with!"

Evelyn's fingers stilled. She turned slowly, frost in her gaze. "Unless you hold a medical license, I suggest you let qualified personnel handle this."

Serena's mouth opened in outrage when Olivia Sinclair intervened.

"Nathan! Rein in your... acquaintance." The steel in Olivia's voice matched her glacial stare. "If her interference costs Raj critical seconds, I'll personally ensure she faces consequences."

Nathan said nothing, but the arctic glare he leveled at Serena spoke volumes. The venomous socialite shriveled under his regard, biting her painted lip until it blanched.

Ethan addressed the room with authority. "For those unaware, Evelyn has accepted a cardiothoracic surgery fellowship at Royal Crest Medical Center. The Caldwell family guarantees her credentials. Any objections?"

Murmurs rippled through the gathering. Royal Crest wasn't just the top cardiac hospital in Eldoria—it ranked among the world's elite institutions.

Priya Sharma's face transformed with hope. She grasped Evelyn's wrist. "Please. Save my husband."

Evelyn gave a single decisive nod. Without hesitation, she positioned the needle at the fifth intercostal space along the midclavicular line and administered the injection.

A collective breath held as the plunger depressed.

The arrival of the house physician almost went unnoticed until guests urgently shushed him. Taking in the scene, the doctor froze—then watched Evelyn's technique with widening eyes.

"What's she—" a guest began whispering.

"Pericardiocentesis," the doctor murmured reverently. "That's textbook emergency procedure for cardiac tamponade."

Silence descended like a shroud as Evelyn maintained steady pressure on the syringe. Beads of sweat formed at her temples, the only sign of the immense pressure.

Then—Raj's labored breathing eased. His ashen lips regained color.

A monitor someone had produced began beeping in a strong, regular rhythm.

The doctor exhaled sharply. "She just saved his life."

Priya collapsed to her knees in relieved sobs. Olivia clasped Evelyn's shoulder with rare emotion. Even Nathan's typically impassive expression showed a flicker of... something.

Serena, meanwhile, had turned the shade of spoiled milk. As discreetly as possible, she melted into the crowd—but not before shooting Evelyn a look of pure venom.

Evelyn barely noticed. She was already rattling off post-procedure instructions to the medical team now swarming Raj. Only when they wheeled him toward the waiting ambulance did she finally slump against a pillar, adrenaline crash hitting hard.

That's when a tumbler of whiskey appeared in her line of sight. She followed the extended arm up to Nathan's unreadable face.

"Drink," he ordered. "You've earned it."

Across the room, Ethan watched the exchange with narrowed eyes. His phone was already dialing Royal Crest's chief of surgery. Someone needed to hear about tonight's events—immediately.


###Chapter 9

The surrounding crowd edged closer, their curiosity ignited.

The family physician answered in hushed tones, "She's performing a pericardiocentesis. This gentleman has accumulated fluid around his heart, and the procedure is meant to drain it to alleviate his distress."

"Ah," came the murmured response.

Time seemed to freeze as all eyes remained locked on Evelyn.

After what felt like an eternity, she finally withdrew the syringe from Raj.

A collective sigh of relief swept through the onlookers as color gradually returned to Raj's face, though his breathing remained shallow.

Moments later, medical personnel arrived and swiftly transported Raj to the hospital.

Ethan offered his hand to help Evelyn rise from her kneeling position.

Having been so intensely focused on the procedure, Evelyn felt a tingling numbness in her legs as she stood.

"Evie!" a familiar voice called out.

Marcus Donovan approached with a warm, affectionate smile.

"Evie" was the special nickname Marcus and his wife, Olivia, had given Evelyn—a symbol of their hopes for her to embrace a fresh start in life.

One of the guests inquired with interest, "Mr. Donovan, is this extraordinary young woman your goddaughter?"

Marcus cast a fond glance at Evelyn before addressing the guests. "Indeed! She is the goddaughter Olivia and I are proud to call our own."

A wave of admiration rippled through the crowd.

"Thank heavens Evie was here tonight!"

"She's so young, yet she's already set to join the prestigious Cardiac Surgery Department at Grandview General Hospital. Truly remarkable!"

Though praises showered over her, Evelyn remained composed, unswayed by the flattering words.

Once the banquet officially commenced, Evelyn and Ethan led the opening dance.

Their movements were fluid, their steps synchronized—so intimate that the audience couldn't help but admire their chemistry.

To everyone watching, they made a perfect pair.

Nathan, seated with one leg crossed over the other, idly tapped his fingers against his thigh as he observed them.

His expression was unreadable, but those who knew him well could sense the storm brewing beneath his calm exterior.

The next morning at the courthouse, Nathan and Evelyn arrived punctually.

When Evelyn spotted Nathan, she walked past him without so much as a glance and strode inside.

Nathan watched her retreating figure, his eyes narrowing ever so slightly.


###Chapter 10

Evelyn's phone buzzed sharply in the quiet waiting area, shattering the tense silence.

She glanced at the screen, her lips tightening briefly before excusing herself to take the call.

"What is it?" she answered, her tone clipped.

"Star, it's Addie again," came the bright voice on the other end. "Elsa Torres won't take no for an answer. She's demanding you personally perform her son's surgery."

Evelyn exhaled, unimpressed. "I'm not available. His case isn't urgent, and their local team is perfectly competent. There's no reason for me to intervene."

Addie chuckled lightly. "I know, but you know how mothers are. She insists only the best will do for her son—and apparently, that's you."

Evelyn's fingers tapped impatiently against her thigh. "Tell her no again. I'm in the middle of something important." Without waiting for a reply, she ended the call and returned to Nathan.

Five minutes later, Nathan's phone rang.

His expression darkened the moment he answered. "I'll be right there," he said tersely before hanging up.

"Nathan!" Evelyn caught his arm before he could leave. Her grip was firm, her gaze unwavering. "I don't care what just came up—we're getting divorced today."

She was certain it was Serena calling him, judging by the urgency in his voice.

Nathan turned to her, his voice low. "It's my father. He's been rushed to the hospital."

Evelyn's demeanor shifted instantly. Without hesitation, she stood. "I'm coming with you."

Nathan didn't argue, striding toward the exit without another word.

Grand Oaks General Hospital, VIP Ward

"Mom!" Nathan burst into the room, his voice tight with concern. "How is he?"

Margaret turned, relief flickering in her eyes before worry took over again. "He was fine until he got that call. It triggered an asthma attack."

Only then did she notice Evelyn standing behind Nathan.

Margaret blinked, then her eyes widened in shock. "Evelyn? My God—what happened to you these past three years? You look completely different!"

Despite the drastic change in Evelyn's appearance—her once-heavy frame now slender, the dark mark on her face gone—her striking features were unmistakable.

"Margaret," Evelyn greeted calmly.

Just then, Leonard stirred in the hospital bed.

Margaret immediately turned back to him, relief softening her features. "Oh, you scared me half to death!"


###Chapter 11

Leonard Grant's gaze darkened as it landed on Nathan. "Nathan, tell me you didn't actually go through with divorcing Evelyn?" The day after Evelyn had returned to the country, she had reached out to Leonard. But the next morning, Leonard had been stunned to learn that Nathan and Evelyn were heading to the courthouse to finalize their divorce.

At the question, Nathan's jaw tightened. His cold eyes flicked to Evelyn before he let out a humorless laugh. "Leonard."

Evelyn stepped closer to the hospital bed.

Time had not been kind to Leonard these past three years.

Now in his seventies, he looked far older than his wife, Margaret, who was barely past fifty.

Nathan, their only child together, had been born long after Leonard's two children from his first marriage.

When Leonard's eyes landed on Evelyn, they widened slightly—surprise and recognition flickering in his gaze. "Evelyn? Is that really you?"

Evelyn gave a small, silent nod.

Leonard's face brightened with relief. "Ah! So this is what you truly look like, my dear."

Then his expression hardened as he turned back to Nathan. "Evelyn has my full support. I won't allow this divorce."

Evelyn spoke carefully. "Our decision was mutual. Nathan and I have both thought this through. You have to understand—"

"What?" Leonard's breathing grew ragged, his face flushing with distress. "No! I refuse to accept this!"

Margaret reacted instantly, placing a soothing hand on his shoulder. "Leonard, calm down. It's alright—they won’t go through with it. Just breathe."

Then she shot Nathan and Evelyn a sharp look. "Both of you—out. Now."

With Leonard in such a fragile state, neither dared argue.

They obeyed silently, stepping out into the hallway.

The moment the door clicked shut behind them, Nathan whirled on Evelyn, his voice icy. "Are you playing games with me, Evelyn?"

Evelyn's brows drew together in disbelief.

She met his gaze head-on. "Nathan, do you honestly think I told Leonard about the divorce?"

Nathan's lips curled in disdain. "Who else would have?"

He remembered how she had deliberately stepped away to take that call at the courthouse—and how, mere minutes later, his mother had called him.

His voice dripped with contempt. "Given my father’s condition, we’ll have to delay the divorce. Happy now?"

Despite her resolve to stay detached, his words cut deep. The pain must have shown in her eyes, because Nathan’s expression only darkened further.

Evelyn took a steadying breath. "Mr. Black, you don’t have to be like this. Believe me, I want this divorce just as much as you do."

...


###Chapter 12

Evelyn let out a soft sigh, her lips curving into a faint smile. "Your father isn't feeling well today. Don't worry—I'll bring it up with him again tomorrow."

Nathan studied her with narrowed eyes, searching for any hint of deception in her expression. Before he could respond, the hospital room door creaked open.

Margaret stepped inside, her voice calm but firm. "Leonard wants to see you both now."

Nathan and Evelyn followed her into the room, where Leonard lay propped up against the pillows. Though his complexion was still pale, there was a determined glint in his eyes.

"Nathan," Leonard rasped, his voice weak but unwavering. "You will not divorce Evelyn. Do I make myself clear?"

Nathan exhaled sharply, his jaw tightening. "Fine. No divorce. Just focus on getting better." Despite the irritation in his tone, concern flickered in his gaze.

Leonard turned to Evelyn next. "And you, Evelyn. Promise me you won't leave him."

Without hesitation, she nodded. "I won't."

A relieved sigh escaped Leonard, and he sank back into the pillows, finally at ease.

Once they ensured he was resting, Nathan and Evelyn stepped out into the hallway.

Then, abruptly, Evelyn's phone rang.

She answered, and a sharp, demanding voice crackled through the line.

"Evelyn! You've been back in the country for days, yet you haven't even bothered to come home. Do you think you're above us now? Get here. Now."

The caller was none other than Victor Sterling—her biological father.

A cold smirk tugged at Evelyn's lips as she listened, her expression unreadable. "Understood," she replied flatly before ending the call.

Without sparing Nathan another glance, she turned on her heel and walked away.

When she arrived at the Sterling estate, she punched in the security code at the front gate.

Incorrect password.

Frowning, she tried again.

Incorrect password.

A bitter laugh escaped her.

Instead of knocking, she circled to the back of the mansion. Five minutes later, she returned with a sledgehammer in hand.

With one powerful swing, she smashed the lock.

The deafening bang triggered the estate's alarm system, its shrill wail piercing the air.

Almost instantly, the front door flew open.

The butler, wide-eyed and flustered, gaped at her. "This is outrageous! Do you have any idea whose home this is? You can't just—"

Evelyn didn't let him finish.

She stepped past him, her expression icy.

"I know exactly whose home this is."

###Chapter 13

The grand foyer of the Sterling mansion was just as opulent as she remembered—gleaming marble floors, towering chandeliers, and the faint scent of expensive perfume lingering in the air.

But the moment she stepped inside, the atmosphere shifted.

Victor Sterling stood at the top of the staircase, his face twisted in fury. "What the hell was that?"

Evelyn tilted her head, feigning innocence. "Oh? Was the doorbell broken?"

His face darkened. "You insolent—"

Before he could finish, Diana Prescott—Victor's wife—appeared beside him, her lips pressed into a thin line. "Evelyn. Must you always cause a scene?"

Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Only when I'm not welcome at my own home."

Lila Sinclair, Victor and Diana's daughter, sauntered into view, her smirk dripping with condescension. "Oh, please. You were never really part of this family."

Evelyn's fingers twitched, but she kept her voice steady. "Funny. I seem to recall my name is still on the inheritance documents."

Victor's expression darkened further. "Enough. You're here because I allowed it. Now, sit down. We have matters to discuss."

Evelyn crossed her arms. "By all means. Let's discuss."

But as she followed them into the sitting room, she already knew—this wasn't a conversation.

It was a battlefield.

Ignoring the stunned butler, Evelyn Hartley tossed the sledgehammer aside with a careless flick of her wrist and strode into the Sterling mansion like she owned it—because, in her mind, she still did.

Inside, Victor Sterling was already storming toward the commotion, his face dark with irritation. "What the hell is going on out here?" He froze mid-step when his gaze landed on Evelyn.

His eyes widened.

She had changed.

The butler scrambled in after her, pointing an accusatory finger. "Mr. Sterling! She—she smashed the door open with a hammer!"

From deeper in the house, a woman's voice rose in alarm. "Victor? What was that noise?" Moments later, Grace Monroe rushed into the foyer, her hand flying to her mouth at the sight of her daughter. "Evelyn? Is that really you?"

The butler gaped, unable to reconcile the poised, striking woman before him with the Evelyn he remembered—the one who had left three years ago, broken and defeated.

"Evelyn!" Victor snapped, finally regaining his composure. "You can't just barge in here and start destroying property! Have you lost your damn mind?"

Evelyn's lips curled into a cool, mocking smile. "I tried the passcode. Repeatedly. It kept rejecting me." She tilted her head, her voice dripping with false sweetness. "Funny, isn't it? This is my home. I couldn’t have forgotten the code. The lock must be defective. A little adjustment seemed necessary."

Victor's jaw clenched.

He had changed the code deliberately—his way of telling her she was no longer welcome after she fled the country three years ago, refusing to admit her so-called crimes. The audacity of her breaking in like this sent fury boiling through his veins.

His face darkened, veins standing out on his forehead as he leveled a glare at her. "Evelyn. On your knees. Now."

For a heartbeat, Evelyn went still, her expression chilling.

Grace gasped, rushing forward to grab her daughter’s arm. "Evelyn, please—just apologize! Don’t make this worse!"

Evelyn shook her off, her gaze never leaving Victor’s. "I won’t apologize for something I didn’t do."

She had sworn, from the very beginning, that she hadn’t stolen the missing money. That she hadn’t pushed her half-sister, Lila Sinclair, down the stairs. But no one had believed her.

Victor’s face twisted with rage. "Enough! You will face the consequences of your actions today!"

His voice thundered through the foyer. "Someone bring me the brass rod!"

At those words, Evelyn’s fists clenched at her sides, her nails biting into her palms.

Grace let out a desperate cry. "No! Victor, please—!"

But Evelyn didn’t flinch. She stood tall, her voice icy. "I said no."

Victor’s fury burned hotter. "You don’t get to refuse!"

Evelyn met his glare, unflinching. "Watch me."


###Chapter 14

The polished silver cane gleamed under the chandelier's light as the butler approached. "Mr. Sterling," he announced, presenting it with a deferential bow.

Evelyn's breath hitched. The cane—solid, unyielding metal—was an instrument of torment she knew too well. Memories of searing pain flashed through her mind, and she took an involuntary step back.

Victor Sterling advanced, his grip tightening around the cane as he raised it high, his face twisted in fury. The air thickened with tension.

Then—

A hand shot out, intercepting Victor's wrist mid-swing.

Shock flickered across his face. He hadn’t expected Evelyn to fight back.

Before he could react, she wrenched the cane from his grasp.

The sound of metal striking marble cracked through the room like thunder as Evelyn slammed it against the floor, snapping it clean in two.

Silence.

Her chest heaved, but her expression remained unreadable. Inside, though, a storm raged—years of fear, finally shattered.

Victor gaped at the broken pieces, then at her, disbelief and fury warring in his gaze. "You—you dare defy your own family?" His hand twitched, ready to strike.

"Enough!"

A commanding voice cut through the tension.

Two figures descended the grand staircase.

Leading was Diana Prescott, Victor's wife, elegant in a sapphire gown that accentuated her timeless beauty. Despite her age, she carried herself with the grace of a woman who had never known defeat.

Behind her, Lila Sinclair glided down in a white dress, her delicate features the picture of innocence—the cherished daughter, the golden child.

"Victor," Diana chided softly, though her tone brooked no argument. "Must you always resort to violence?"

He bristled. "You don’t understand. This ungrateful girl—she stole—"

"Enough," Diana repeated, her voice cool. "The past is done. We don’t even know the full truth of what happened. And Evelyn is now Mrs. Black."

Her gaze flickered to Lila, who offered a small, forgiving smile. "Even if she did push Lila all those years ago, Lila has moved on. Why dredge up old wounds?"

Victor opened his mouth—then closed it, speechless.


###Chapter 15

Evelyn's gaze lingered on Diana with unspoken complexity. Logically, Diana should despise her—after all, she was Victor Sterling's illegitimate daughter, born from an affair that had shattered their family.

Yet Diana had never treated her with anything but warmth, even when the rest of the world had turned its back on her.

She had been the only one who believed in Evelyn’s innocence when the missing necklace scandal erupted.

"Diana," Evelyn murmured softly, her voice barely above a whisper.

Diana responded with a tender nod, her eyes sweeping over Evelyn with a mix of concern and maternal affection. "Evelyn, my dear, how have you been these past three years? You’ve grown so thin. And your birthmark—it’s completely gone now."

She was the first to notice, the first to care.

Lila stepped forward with a practiced smile, looping her arm through Diana’s as she chimed in, "Isn’t it incredible, Mother? I barely recognized her at the Caldwells’ gala last night. She’s practically a different person. I always said she’d be stunning if she just lost a little weight."

It had been Lila, of course, who had informed Victor of Evelyn’s return—and her dramatic transformation.

Evelyn met Diana’s gaze steadily. "I had a full medical evaluation while I was abroad. The doctors discovered my weight issues were caused by certain medications that disrupted my hormones. As for the birthmark… it faded on its own over time."

By the end of her first year away, the dark mark had begun to lighten inexplicably. By the second, it had vanished entirely.

Grace gasped, her hand flying to her mouth. "What do you mean? What kind of medication were you taking? Evelyn, how could this have happened?"

"I don’t know," Evelyn admitted, shaking her head.

But she intended to find out. Now that she was back, she would uncover the truth—whether it had been a medical error or something far more deliberate. And she would finally understand the origins of that birthmark.

Her eyes swept the room, searching for any flicker of guilt among the assembled faces. But their expressions revealed nothing.

Lila sighed dramatically, her voice dripping with false sympathy. "Evelyn, you’ve endured so much."

She turned to Victor, her tone saccharine. "Father, don’t you think it’s time to let bygones be bygones?"

Victor’s response was laced with reluctant affection. "I forgave her long ago. I even told her she could keep the necklace if she wanted it so badly."

Lila beamed, the picture of sisterly devotion. "Evelyn and I are family. Why wouldn’t I be kind to her?"

Victor exhaled, then fixed Evelyn with a stern look. "Do you see how Lila treats you? Remember how you treated her before? Out of respect for her generosity, I’ll let this matter rest today."

His gaze sharpened. "Thank her. Don’t be ungrateful."

###Chapter 16

The air in the room thickened with unspoken tension. Evelyn’s fingers curled into her palms, her nails biting into her skin.

She had spent three years rebuilding herself—only to return to the same twisted games.

But this time, she wouldn’t play by their rules.

This time, she would make them regret ever underestimating her.

Evelyn's response was a quiet scoff, her lips curling with barely concealed sarcasm.

Lila's words rang hollow in Evelyn's ears, so insincere they made her stomach churn.

"If we're done here, I'll take my leave." Without waiting for a response, Evelyn turned on her heel and strode away.

"Did you see that? That's how your daughter behaves!" Victor Sterling's voice boomed behind her, thick with fury.

"I'm sorry, Victor. I'll speak to Evelyn. She'll... she'll thank Lila," Grace Monroe murmured, her voice trembling with meekness as she tried to placate him.

Evelyn's steps didn't falter, but the sound of Victor's enraged shouts and Grace's timid apologies followed her out. The disdain in her eyes only deepened.

Once she reached her car outside the Sterling estate, Evelyn sank into the driver's seat and closed her eyes, exhaling sharply.

A suffocating weight pressed against her chest. She had expected this confrontation, but living through it was another matter entirely. It left her feeling raw, exposed—like she couldn’t breathe.

After a moment, she pulled out her phone and typed a quick message.

A reply buzzed almost instantly.

A faint smirk tugged at her lips as she read it.

Tossing her phone onto the passenger seat, she started the engine and peeled away from the curb.

That evening, at Velvet Mirage, one of the city’s most exclusive lounges, Evelyn’s entrance didn’t go unnoticed.

She wore a sleek, black satin dress that clung to every curve, the thin straps leaving her collarbones and shoulders bare. The deep V-neckline drew the eye, accentuating the elegant slope of her neck and the delicate hollow of her throat.

Her auburn hair was swept into a high ponytail, the sharp angles of her face highlighted by smoky eyeshadow and a bold winged liner that made her emerald eyes impossible to ignore.

Every head turned as she walked in.

From the VIP balcony above, Nathan Black’s gaze locked onto her the moment she stepped through the door.

With the stir she caused, it was impossible not to notice her.

His jaw tightened as his eyes trailed over the scandalously short hem of her dress.

Could she be any more obvious?

"Nathan, have you and Evelyn finalized the divorce yet?" Dylan Reeves’ question snapped Nathan out of his thoughts.

Beside him, Serena Cole stiffened, her fingers tightening around her glass as she waited for his answer.

Nathan’s expression remained unreadable. "My father had an episode when he found out. He’s in the hospital now."

Dylan scoffed, his voice dripping with disdain. "That scheming witch must have told him. I knew it. She never wanted this divorce. She ran away three years ago, and now that she’s back, she’s still playing games—dragging this out like she has any right to."

The disgust on Dylan’s face was palpable. His knuckles whitened around his drink. "Nathan, I swear, tomorrow I’ll make sure she shows up in court."

Nathan shot him a warning glance, his tone icy. "Stay out of it. This is between her and me."


###Chapter 17

Serena studied Nathan intently, her instincts screaming that something wasn't right. Why did she get the feeling he wasn’t as eager for the divorce as he claimed? The thought made her press her lips together in frustration.

Meanwhile, as Evelyn approached the private booth in the upscale lounge, she spotted a familiar figure already seated inside.

The woman—Natalie Brooks—looked up, her sharp eyes sweeping over Evelyn before lighting up with admiration. "You're even more breathtaking in person than in those magazine spreads!" Natalie grinned, opening her arms. "Welcome back, darling!"

Evelyn melted into the embrace before sliding into the plush seat across from her best friend. Natalie poured them both glasses of rich red wine, then arched a perfectly sculpted brow. "Alright, spill. What’s got you summoning me for emergency drinks on a Tuesday night?"

Clinking their glasses together, Evelyn exhaled, her gaze dropping to the swirling liquid. "I went back to the Sterling mansion today. The security code was changed, and then—" She recounted the humiliating encounter with Lila and Victor Sterling, her voice tight with restrained anger.

Natalie listened, her expression darkening. When Evelyn finished, she leaned forward, her manicured fingers tapping against the table. "Evie, have you ever stopped to wonder why Lila is so obsessed with tearing you down? She’s the legitimate Sterling heiress. You’re the daughter of an affair—technically no threat to her inheritance. So why go out of her way to frame you, sabotage you, even fake injuries to make you look bad?"

Evelyn stiffened.

Natalie’s lips curled knowingly. "Think about it. What if she was the one who planted those pills in your bag that night?"

A beat of silence passed before Evelyn whispered, "I’ve had three years abroad to piece it together. And I think… it was always about Nathan."

"Finally," Natalie breathed, slumping back in her seat. "I’ve been saying for years that Lila’s obsession with Nathan was pathological. You were too trusting—believing her when she ‘warned’ you about other women circling him. But all those ‘tips’ just drove him further away. Was she ever really on your side?"

Evelyn’s laugh was bitter. The truth stung like salt in a wound.

How had she missed it? She’d been Lila’s puppet all along.

###Chapter 18

The penthouse elevator doors slid open, and Nathan stepped inside, shrugging off his suit jacket. His phone buzzed—another message from Lila. He ignored it, tossing the device onto the couch.

Across the city, Evelyn stared at her own screen, Natalie’s words echoing in her mind. A notification flashed: Security Alert: Unauthorized Access Attempt – Sterling Mansion.

Her blood ran cold.

Someone was trying to break into the place that had just rejected her.

And she had a terrifying suspicion who it might be.

Natalie let out a soft sigh, relief washing over her delicate features. "At least you finally see the truth now."

Then, as if struck by a sudden thought, she tilted her head. "Did anything... unusual happen when you visited the Sterling mansion? Did anyone act strangely when they found out about the hormone medication causing your weight issues?"

Evelyn shook her head, her dark curls swaying. "Their reactions were carefully controlled. But I've struggled with my weight since I was a child. Even if it's true that someone gave me those pills without my knowledge, it's unlikely the Sterlings were behind it. Still... I can't ignore the possibility that someone in that house knows more than they're letting on."

Natalie nodded thoughtfully, her manicured nails tapping against her glass. "True. You only discovered Victor was your biological father at seventeen, and you moved into the Sterling estate after that. Who would target a child like that? It couldn't have been your mother, right?"

Evelyn shot her a dry look.

Natalie quickly laughed, waving a hand. "Kidding! Grace adores you. Everyone knows that."

It was true. Grace loved Evelyn fiercely—but she was also painfully submissive to Victor, treating his word as law. Whenever Victor punished Evelyn, Grace could only weep and beg on her behalf.

Natalie's expression turned serious. "Uncovering something buried for over twenty years won't be easy, but secrets always leave traces. We'll find the truth."

"I know," Evelyn replied, her voice steady.

Then, shifting gears, Natalie arched a brow. "So... you're really going through with the divorce from Nathan?"

Evelyn scoffed at the mention of his name, her lips curling in disdain. "Nathan and I ended three years ago."

Natalie sighed, swirling her drink. "Probably for the best. That marriage brought you more misery than joy. A relationship that only leaves you lonely isn't worth clinging to. Look at you now—gorgeous, successful, with your pick of anyone you want. Why waste another thought on someone like Nathan?"

"Exactly." Evelyn raised her glass with a dazzling smile. "To new beginnings."

After finishing their drinks, they hit the dance floor.

Evelyn and Natalie immediately became the center of attention, their beauty and confidence magnetic. At first, others danced around them, but soon, the two women commanded the space entirely.

Evelyn, in particular, was mesmerizing—her movements fluid, her elegance effortless. Every flick of her hair, every sway of her hips held the crowd captive.

Nathan watched from the shadows, his jaw tightening as he observed his wife—still legally his wife—dancing like she hadn’t a care in the world.

Did she really think she could just move on?


###Chapter 19

Evelyn noticed Nathan’s intense gaze fixed on Serena and felt a sharp pang of jealousy. Why was he so focused on her? She had assumed Nathan barely knew the woman.

Just as Evelyn was about to divert his attention, she saw Serena excusing herself toward the restroom. Without hesitation, Evelyn stood and followed.

Serena stepped onto the balcony adjacent to the restroom, answering her phone with a quiet, "Hello?"

It was Leonard on the line.

"Evelyn, can you come back to the estate?" His voice was firm but weary.

Surprise flickered through her. "You’ve already been discharged?" She had visited him at the hospital earlier that day—his recovery seemed too swift.

"Yes. The hospital was suffocating," Leonard replied curtly.

"I’ll be there soon," Evelyn said quickly before ending the call.

As she turned to leave, she froze.

Serena stood in the doorway, blocking her path.

Their interactions had been scarce over the years. Leonard had always despised Serena, and after Nathan stopped bringing her around, their paths rarely crossed.

Yet, one memory burned vividly in Evelyn’s mind—three years ago, at the Dream Club. She had stood in the pouring rain, clutching a cake Nathan had claimed he wanted. Only later did she learn the truth: it had been for Serena.

The cake had ended up in the trash.

That night, Evelyn realized her marriage was nothing more than a transaction—Nathan’s sacrifice for Serena.

Even now, facing her again, old wounds throbbed. Evelyn inhaled sharply, averting her gaze as she moved to step past her.

But Serena’s voice cut through the silence.

"Ms. Hartley."

Evelyn stopped.

Serena’s lips curved into a smile that didn’t reach her eyes. "We should talk."


###Chapter 20
A realization struck Evelyn—Serena didn’t recognize her. It made perfect sense. Even Dylan had failed to place her at the gala, and Serena knew her far less than he did.

"Can we talk?" Serena asked, her voice smooth but laced with something unreadable.

Evelyn offered a faint, practiced smile. "Of course."

Curiosity flickered in Evelyn’s chest. What could Serena possibly want to discuss with her, unaware of who she truly was?

They stepped onto the balcony, the evening breeze carrying the faint scent of roses.

Evelyn wasted no time. "What did you want to talk about?"

Serena’s gaze lingered on Evelyn’s striking features—high cheekbones, full lips, eyes that seemed to hold secrets. A face that could make any woman seethe with envy.

With a tight, artificial smile, Serena said, "Miss Hartley, as someone so closely tied to the head of the Hartley family, surely you wouldn’t stoop to stealing another woman’s man, would you?"

Evelyn blinked, momentarily stunned. Was she being accused of seduction? And whose man, exactly?

She arched a brow, feigning innocence. "And who, pray tell, is this man you’re referring to?"

"Nathan," Serena replied without hesitation.

Evelyn let out a sharp, mocking laugh, meeting Serena’s gaze head-on. "And who do you think you are to say that to me?"

Serena’s lips pressed into a thin line. "I’m saying it as the woman who will marry Nathan one day."

Evelyn’s expression turned icy with disdain. "One day? Come back and warn me when you’re actually wearing his ring."

Serena’s eyes flashed with irritation. "Miss Hartley, you wouldn’t want to be labeled a homewrecker, would you?"

Evelyn’s laughter rang out again, sharp and derisive. "Why should I care, Miss Cole? You’re the one tangled up with a married man."

The words hit Serena like a slap.

Her face paled, then flushed with anger.

Evelyn tilted her head, her gaze dripping with contempt. "You’re in no position to lecture me, darling."

Without another glance, Evelyn turned and walked away, the click of her heels echoing her finality.

The calmness she felt was liberating. This was proof—she was finally letting go of the past.

Behind her, Serena clenched her fists, nails biting into her palms.

She hated to admit it, but Evelyn was right.

Until she became Nathan’s wife, her threats meant nothing. Her priority now? Ensuring Nathan’s marriage ended—permanently.


###Chapter 21

At the Grant family estate, Evelyn had arranged for a private driver to take her to the grand mansion earlier that day. Once the car pulled up to the entrance, the driver departed swiftly.

As Evelyn stepped out, her eyes immediately landed on a sleek silver Aston Martin parked directly across from her.

The door swung open.

Nathan emerged from the driver’s seat, his presence commanding as always.

The moment Evelyn spotted him, she turned her gaze away and strode toward the mansion without hesitation.

"Stop." Nathan's voice cut through the air, sharp and unyielding.

Evelyn paused mid-step but didn’t turn around.

Nathan closed the distance between them in a few long strides, his piercing gaze sweeping over her with an intensity that was impossible to decipher.

His voice dropped to a dangerously smooth murmur. "Evelyn, let me remind you—until the divorce is finalized, every move you make, every word you speak, reflects on the Grant name."

He emphasized the word move.

Evelyn whirled around to face him, her lips curling into a mocking smile. "And what, exactly, is wrong with how I move, Mr. Grant? Or are you so old-fashioned that a woman walking with confidence offends you?"

Her eyes flashed with defiance as she continued, "Since we’ll be going our separate ways soon, I’d appreciate it if you stayed out of my business. Let’s keep our lives separate, shall we?"

Without waiting for a response, she turned on her heel and marched into the mansion, leaving Nathan standing there, his jaw clenched in frustration.

Evelyn had clearly grown bolder in the last three years.

Leonard brightened when he saw Nathan and Evelyn arriving together.

Margaret, however, frowned slightly at Evelyn’s choice of attire but ultimately held her tongue.

Evelyn turned to Leonard with concern. "Leonard, how are you feeling? Is your health holding up?"

"As long as I avoid stress and stay calm, I’m perfectly fine," Leonard assured her with a gentle smile.

A crease formed between Evelyn’s brows.

Nathan spoke up, his tone clipped. "Why did you call us here, Father?"

Leonard’s smile widened. "Starting tonight, both of you will be moving back into the estate."

Evelyn and Nathan reacted in unison, their voices sharp with disbelief. "What?"

Their synchronized shock was almost comical.

Nathan shot Evelyn a sideways glance, suspicion flickering in his eyes. Had she somehow influenced Leonard’s decision?


###Chapter 22

With a strained laugh, Evelyn responded, "Leonard, isn't that a bit excessive?"

Instantly, Leonard's expression turned pitiful. "I'm just feeling rather lonely these days. Would it be too much to ask for you and Nathan to keep me company more often?" He looked every bit the picture of a neglected elder, his shoulders sagging slightly.

Both Nathan and Evelyn were at a loss for words.

Letting out a dramatic sigh that carried the weight of resignation, Leonard continued, "Never mind, I understand. Young people like you wouldn’t want to waste your time with an old man like me. A little solitude never hurt anyone—"

Evelyn couldn’t bear to hear him speak like that. She cut in quickly, "Leonard, I’ll move back here to keep you and Margaret company."

She had only mentioned herself returning, pointedly leaving Nathan out of the equation. Besides, she had already planned to discuss her impending divorce with Leonard the next day. Her stay at the Grant family estate would be brief.

At her words, Leonard’s face brightened instantly. He turned to gauge Nathan’s reaction, his eyes gleaming with satisfaction.

Nathan’s brows knitted together in clear displeasure at the turn of events.

Leonard’s tone turned stern. "Is it truly such a burden for you to spend time with an old man like me?"

"Nathan, just agree. Your mother misses you too," Margaret chimed in, giving him a meaningful look.

Facing Leonard’s expectant gaze, Nathan seemed to consider something before finally relenting with a stiff nod.

Leonard’s face lit up like the sun breaking through clouds. "Wonderful! Winston has already prepared your room. It’s getting late—you both should rest for the night."

When Nathan stepped into the bedroom, his scowl deepened at the sight of the massive bed dominating the space.

Evelyn, maintaining her composure, walked straight past him into the bathroom without a word.

The butler, Winston Graves, had arranged everything meticulously—fresh clothes, toiletries, even the faint scent of lavender in the air.

After her shower, Evelyn slipped into her silk loungewear and climbed into bed without sparing Nathan a glance.

Nathan emerged from the other bathroom, his gaze landing on Evelyn already settled under the covers. He scoffed. "Evelyn, don’t even think about sharing this bed with me. That’s not happening."

Evelyn rolled her eyes so hard it was a miracle they didn’t get stuck. "As if I’d ever want to share a bed with you. I’d probably wake up screaming from nightmares."

She made her stance clear, voice firm. "I’ll be sleeping in the bed. You can take the sofa."

Nathan’s frown deepened. "The sofa? Seriously?"

With a mocking smile, Evelyn arched a brow. "Mr. Black, isn’t it about time you displayed some gentlemanly manners?"



###Chapter 23

"Gentlemanly behavior? That’s not exactly my forte," Nathan sneered as he closed the distance between them.

Before Evelyn could react, he seized her wrist, yanked her off the bed, and tossed her effortlessly over his shoulder.

"Nathan! You absolute bastard! Put me down—now!" she shrieked, pounding her fists against his back as he strode across the room.

With zero finesse, he dumped her onto the couch, barely sparing her a glance before sprawling across the bed like a conquering king.

Evelyn’s blood boiled.

Clenching her teeth, she launched herself off the couch, stormed back to the bed, and—without hesitation—kicked him square in the ribs.

The impact sent Nathan tumbling off the mattress, landing hard on the floor.

For a heartbeat, he just stared, disbelief etched across his face.

Him? Thrown off his own bed?

Slowly, he rose to his feet, his voice a dangerous growl. "Evelyn Hartley."

Propping herself up on one elbow, she met his glare with a smirk. "Problem, Mr. Black? Don’t tell me you’re planning to retaliate. That would be so ungentlemanly of you."

Nathan exhaled sharply, jaw tight. "Fine." The word dripped with warning before he turned on his heel and stalked toward the walk-in closet.

A thorough search later, he emerged empty-handed—no spare blankets.

Grudgingly, he returned to the couch, his towering frame crammed into the five-foot space, legs dangling awkwardly over the armrest.

Meanwhile, Evelyn stretched luxuriously across the bed, flipping onto her side just as her phone buzzed.

Ethan’s name flashed on the screen.

Frowning, she answered. "Ethan?"

"Evelyn, Olivia’s been asking about you all day. She wants to know when you’re visiting."

"I’ll stop by tomorrow," she said, lowering her voice. "And tell her not to worry about the divorce. It’ll be finalized by then."

From the couch, Nathan’s brows lifted.


###Chapter 24

Ethan's laughter bubbled through the phone. "Perfect! Once the divorce is finalized, we're hitting the club. I'll book five male escorts just for you."

"Two would suffice," Evelyn replied, her tone dead serious.

After a beat, she added, "Remember the one from last time?"

His physique and face had been rather memorable.

Nathan's jaw tightened as Evelyn spoke, his expression darkening.

"Fine, have it your way!" Ethan chuckled. "I'll make sure the selection meets your standards this time."

Suddenly recalling something, Ethan continued, "Oh, and Dylan Reeves from the Thornton family has been asking about you. Seems like he’s taken an interest."

Evelyn's brows arched slightly. "Dylan? How intriguing..."

Her eyes gleamed with cunning, and after a brief pause, she instructed Ethan, "If he asks again, give him my number. Just don’t mention my name."

Her words carried an unspoken weight.

"Why?" Ethan sounded genuinely puzzled.

"I have some questions for him," Evelyn explained.

"Got it," Ethan replied.

Their conversation continued for a while before they finally hung up.

As Evelyn set her phone aside and reached to turn off the lamp, Nathan's voice, laced with sarcasm, cut through the silence. "Evelyn, it seems your life abroad was quite... colorful. Five escorts? Do you really think you could handle that many men?"

Nathan’s remark made Evelyn sigh dramatically. "Had you shown up on time at the courthouse three years ago to finalize our divorce, Mr. Black, my life overseas could have been far more exciting."

Nathan scoffed. "Is that so? Then make sure you convince Leonard tomorrow."

His gaze hardened. "We need to wrap this up quickly. Serena is waiting."

He didn’t know why he felt compelled to add that last part.

A pang of sorrow flickered in Evelyn’s chest, but her face remained composed.

She turned to Nathan, her smile dazzling. "Don’t worry, Mr. Black. I’ll make sure you and your beloved Serena are united without delay."

With an elegant flick of her wrist, she turned off the light, settled into bed, and closed her eyes.

She had known for three years that Nathan wanted to divorce her for Serena. She had returned this time to end things once and for all. So why did it still sting?

Nathan spent the entire night on the sofa, sleep evading him.


###Chapter 25

The morning light did little to soften the exhaustion etched into Nathan's features as he left for work, dark circles shadowing his piercing gaze.

In stark contrast, Evelyn awoke feeling rejuvenated, the weight of her decision lifting with the dawn. After breakfast, she made her way to Leonard's study.

The moment she stepped inside, Leonard set aside his newspaper. "Evelyn, what brings you here?" His voice was warm but carried an undercurrent of weariness.

Settling onto the plush sofa, Evelyn met his gaze. "There's something important I need to discuss with you."

Leonard exhaled heavily, his sharp eyes narrowing slightly. "Let me guess—this is about your divorce from Nathan."

Evelyn stiffened, caught off guard by his directness. After a beat, she nodded.

"Three years ago, before I left the country, Nathan and I agreed to end things," she admitted. "But he never showed up at the courthouse, and I... I was in too much of a hurry to push it further."

A storm of emotions flickered across Leonard's face. The revelation that their marriage had been crumbling for years visibly shook him.

"I won't allow it," he declared, his voice rough with suppressed anger.

Leaning forward, he softened his tone. "Evelyn, I saw how deeply you loved him when you married into this family. Yes, he's distant now, but people change. Do you remember how cold I was toward you at first?"

A faint smile touched Evelyn's lips.

Leonard had been the most resistant to her presence in the beginning. It had taken months of patience, of proving herself, before he'd finally accepted her as family.

She had clung to that hope—that if she loved Nathan fiercely enough, his indifference would thaw. But three years of silence had hardened her resolve.

"Leonard," she said firmly, "I've thought this through. I want the divorce."

Her unwavering certainty silenced him. After a long pause, Leonard's expression shifted, something calculating glinting in his eyes.

"Fine," he conceded. "But will you at least wait until after my birthday celebration? At my age, who knows how many more I'll have?" His voice cracked with deliberate vulnerability. "Let me have this one happy occasion."

Evelyn reached for his hand. "Don't say that. You're healthier than most men half your age!"

Leonard waved her off with a tired chuckle. "Life has a way of wearing a man down."


###Chapter 26

Evelyn's chest tightened at the sight of Leonard's exhaustion.

A heavy silence stretched between them before she finally nodded. "I'll wait. I promise."

She knew Leonard's birthday was only a month away, and the last thing she wanted was to add to his stress with her and Nathan's messy situation.

"That's wonderful! You've always been so thoughtful, Evelyn," Leonard said, his smile warm but carrying a hint of something unspoken.

Secretly, he was certain a month would be enough time to make Nathan and Evelyn reconsider their divorce.

After discussing Leonard's health for a while longer, Evelyn excused herself and retreated to her room.

The moment the door closed behind her, she grabbed her phone and dialed Nathan's number—one she still knew by heart.

His deep voice answered on the second ring. "Hello."

"Leonard agreed to the divorce," Evelyn said flatly, wasting no time.

Nathan went silent.

Leonard had actually consented?

Had Evelyn really convinced him?

Before he could respond, she continued, "But he wants us to wait until after his birthday this year."

Nathan let out a dry chuckle. "A delay tactic—this is what you wanted all along, isn't it?" His tone turned mocking. "Do you really think one month will change my mind?"

Evelyn shut her eyes briefly, frustration simmering beneath her skin. She inhaled sharply before reopening them, her gaze icy.

"Nathan, if you can get your father to agree to the divorce right now, I'll meet you at the courthouse today."

His voice darkened. "Believe me, I would. But this morning, my mother told me the doctor issued another warning—his asthma attacks are worsening. I can't risk upsetting him."

Evelyn's temper flared. "Then you should understand why I can't push him either. What choice do I have but to wait?"

A bitter laugh escaped her. "If you had shown up three years ago, we wouldn’t be here. And now you have the nerve to act like I’m the one clinging to you? Do you really think I can’t let you go?"

Nathan's jaw clenched, veins standing out on his forehead. He opened his mouth to fire back—

But Evelyn spoke first.


###Chapter 27

"The divorce papers are signed. As far as I'm concerned, we're done. You can pretend your ex-wife no longer exists. Go ahead—pour all that love and devotion into Serena. I know you're dying to marry her, but for Leonard’s sake, you’ll have to wait a little longer. What’s another month after three years, right?"

Nathan’s eyes narrowed, his voice rough and low. "Good. That’s exactly how it should be. We’re nothing to each other now."

"Obviously!" Evelyn snapped, her tone icy before she abruptly hung up.

She collapsed onto the sofa, her expression stormy, her mood sour.

She never wanted to see or speak to Nathan again. If she could, she would’ve dragged him to the courthouse that very second to cut every last tie between them. Maybe then, she’d finally be free of the hold he still had on her heart.

But beneath the cold façade, Evelyn was anything but calm.

The sudden ringing of her phone shattered the silence.

Glancing at the caller ID, her breath hitched before she answered, "Mom."

"Evelyn, could you come home? I miss you," Grace’s voice was fragile, pleading.

"Of course. I’ll be there soon," Evelyn replied without hesitation.

Grace’s voice brightened instantly. "Wonderful! I’ll make all your favorite dishes for lunch."

After hanging up, Evelyn left the Black family estate and headed straight for Vera Vis.

Her father had bought the lavish property for Grace years ago.

Grace’s face lit up the moment Evelyn walked in. She hurried over, ushering her to the sofa, her expression a mix of relief and joy.

"Evelyn, you look absolutely stunning now. It makes me so happy. But… why didn’t you tell me about your transformation sooner?" Her voice dipped into melancholy.

Evelyn stayed silent.

The truth was, she’d only achieved her current figure three months ago.

When she first moved overseas, she used to call Grace every day. But those conversations always turned into pleas—Grace begging her to come home, lamenting how Victor was furious about her leaving, or worse, pressuring her to apologize to Lila.

Slowly, Evelyn stopped calling.

Between the grueling schedule her mentor and his wife had set for her, she barely had time to breathe, let alone dwell on family drama.


###Chapter 28

Evelyn turned her piercing gaze toward Grace, giving a slow nod. "Yes, we've met. You were convinced I stole Lila's necklace." A humorless laugh escaped her lips as she added, "Funny, isn't it? My own mother couldn't bring herself to trust me." The memory still stung like salt in an open wound.

Grace's face twisted with visible distress at the accusation. "Evelyn, darling, I was wrong. So terribly wrong. Later I realized someone had framed you."

With an indifferent shrug that didn't reach her stormy eyes, Evelyn countered, "Does the truth even matter now? You still believed I pushed Lila on purpose. That's why you demanded I apologize to her."

"No, sweetheart, that's not how it was," Grace protested, shaking her head vehemently. Her hands fluttered nervously as she explained, "I knew you didn't push her, but given the circumstances... an apology would have calmed Victor down. If you'd just said sorry, maybe he wouldn't have..." Her voice broke as she gestured helplessly toward Evelyn's imagined bruises. "Do you think it didn't destroy me to see you hurt like that?"

The memory flashed vividly - Evelyn standing her ground, refusing to confess to crimes she didn't commit while Victor rained blows upon her with that damned brass knuckles. The pain had been excruciating, but surrendering her integrity would have hurt far worse.

Her stubborn silence had earned her exile from the Sterling mansion that very night. The wounds on her back had festered, the infection spiking her fever to dangerous levels. That was the moment she'd lost all faith in Victor Sterling.

Even now, years later, the recollection made Evelyn's jaw tighten. She met Grace's watery gaze head-on, her voice steel wrapped in velvet. "Why should I apologize for something I didn't do? Admitting guilt would mean accepting their lies as truth. I'd rather endure physical pain than compromise my principles."

Tears spilled down Grace's cheeks as she wrung her hands. "I was shortsighted," she whispered hoarsely. "I only wanted to protect you from further harm."

The sight of her mother's crumbling composure softened Evelyn's stance slightly. With a resigned sigh, she reached out, gently steadying Grace's trembling hands. "It's alright, Mother. I forgave you long ago. There's no need for this self-flagellation now."

Grace's tear-streaked face lifted with fragile hope. "Truly? You've really forgiven me?"

"Truly," Evelyn confirmed, dabbing Grace's cheeks with a tissue. The simple gesture coaxed a tremulous smile from her mother.

After a contemplative pause, Grace's expression grew thoughtful. "Evelyn... do you suppose Diana could be responsible for the hormone imbalance?"


###Chapter 29
Evelyn stared back in disbelief. "Grace, why would you think that? I've battled my weight since I was a child. If hormones were to blame, wouldn't that mean someone's been manipulating them since I was little? Diana didn't even know I existed back then. How could she be responsible?"

Grace's voice rose, sharp with conviction. "Why not? You reconnected with the Sterlings at seventeen, but that doesn't mean Diana only learned about you then! She could have found out earlier. With her family's power, targeting a child would've been effortless."

Evelyn shook her head, her expression calm but firm. "It wasn't Diana. You're reading too much into this."

The unwavering trust in Evelyn's eyes sent a pang through Grace's chest. "Evelyn, do you truly admire her that much? You defend her so fiercely."

Evelyn pressed her lips together, then spoke earnestly. "I respect Diana because she's genuinely kind—not just to me, but to you too. Even though you don't live at the Sterling estate, you visit often, and she never speaks poorly of you. She simply... ignores you."

She hesitated before continuing. "And she treats me, her husband's illegitimate daughter, with the same indifference. She doesn't embrace me, but she hasn't made my life difficult either. When I first arrived, some maids bullied me. Diana noticed and fired several as a warning. After that, no one dared to cross me again. So no, I don't believe she'd secretly poison me as a child."

Grace's face darkened. Her fingers curled into fists, nails biting into her palms.

"That's exactly what she wants you to see! It's all an act! As the Sterling matriarch, she has to maintain appearances. But behind closed doors? Who knows what she's capable of?" Grace's voice turned brittle. "Evelyn, I never realized you felt so strongly for her. Why not just call her 'Mother' then? Why acknowledge me—the mistress, the disgrace? And if not her, who? Are you accusing me or your grandmother?"

The accusation hung in the air like a blade.

Evelyn flinched as if struck. She stood abruptly, her composure cracking. "Grace! How could you say that? I'm stating facts, not choosing sides. And I've never blamed you or Grandmother. Your words hurt me."

Regret flashed across Grace's face. She reached out, then let her hand fall. "I'm sorry. I let my jealousy cloud my judgment." Her voice wavered. "I envy Diana—she has the life, the title I wanted. And I... I'm just the other woman who dragged you into this mess. Hearing you defend her made me irrational. Can you forgive me?"


###Chapter 30

Evelyn's response was glacial. "Mother, you're being irrational. Maybe you should take some time alone to collect yourself. I need space to think."

Without waiting for a reply, she turned on her heel and retreated to her bedroom.

Grace watched her leave, her expression heavy with remorse.

Once inside, Evelyn collapsed onto the plush armchair, exhaling sharply. Memories of Grace's stories about her doomed romance with Victor Sterling resurfaced—how his aristocratic family had scorned her humble origins, how Diana Prescott of the illustrious Prescott family had set her sights on Victor at a gala, and how his parents had forced him to abandon Grace for a more "suitable" match.

Grace had stayed anyway, clinging to the shadows of Victor's life, convinced Diana was the true villain who had stolen her happiness.

Evelyn had never understood her mother's choices. The bitterness, the refusal to move on—it all felt like self-inflicted torment. But Grace was still her mother, and Evelyn had long accepted that some wounds never truly healed.

Her phone buzzed, snapping her out of her thoughts.

She glanced at the screen, her lips thinning when she saw the caller ID.

With a reluctant swipe, she answered. "Yes?"

"Evelyn, darling! You’ve been back for days—when are you finally coming to the hospital?" The smooth, persuasive voice belonged to Sebastian Holloway, deputy director of Grandview General.

Irritation flickered in her chest. "Why the rush? I just returned. Don’t I deserve time to adjust? It’s not like the Cardiac Surgery Department is collapsing without me."

Sebastian chuckled. "We have surgeons, but none like you."

Evelyn pinched the bridge of her nose. Truthfully, she hadn’t planned on working at a hospital at all. But Sebastian had pulled strings for her overseas, and now she owed him.

"Fine," she relented. "I’ll come the day after tomorrow. Happy?"

"Ecstatic," he said smoothly. "I’ll personally introduce you to the team."

"No," she cut in. "No grand welcomes. Just point me to my office and let me work."

Sebastian sighed but conceded. "As you wish."

###Chapter 31

The morning of her first day arrived with an unrelenting downpour. Evelyn stood by the window, watching raindrops race down the glass like tears.

Grace had left before dawn—another silent retreat.

Evelyn dressed in crisp black slacks and a tailored white blouse, her fingers lingering on the stethoscope in her bag. It had been years since she’d worked in a hospital. The thought of stepping back into that world sent a ripple of unease through her.

Her phone buzzed again—a message from Natalie, her closest friend.

First day jitters?

Evelyn smirked. More like first day regrets.

Natalie replied instantly. You’ll be fine. Just don’t let the egos get to you.

Evelyn pocketed her phone. Easier said than done.

The hospital loomed ahead, its glass façade reflecting the stormy sky. She took a deep breath and stepped inside.

The receptionist barely glanced up. "Name?"

"Dr. Evelyn Hartley."

The woman’s eyes snapped to hers. Recognition flashed. "Oh. You’re the new cardiac surgeon."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Problem?"

The receptionist hesitated. "No, it’s just… people have been talking."

Evelyn’s stomach tightened. Of course they have.

Before she could respond, a familiar voice cut in.

"Ah, Dr. Hartley. Right on time."

Sebastian stood there, smiling like a man who knew too much.

Evelyn forced a polite nod. "Deputy Director."

His grin widened. "Come. There’s someone you should meet."

She followed, already dreading what—or who—waited for her.

Evelyn ended the call and stepped out of her room. Despite Grace's offer to cook, Evelyn insisted on preparing lunch herself, keeping her mother out of the kitchen.

As they sat down to eat, Grace smiled warmly. "It's been ages since I've tasted your cooking, Evelyn. You haven't lost your touch."

"Then have some more," Evelyn replied, her lips curving slightly.

Grace took another bite before her expression turned thoughtful. She studied Evelyn carefully. "So, you've officially recognized Marcus and Olivia as your godparents, haven't you?"

"That's right," Evelyn answered casually, though her fingers tightened slightly around her fork.

Grace pressed on. "I heard the Caldwell family recently acquired land for a luxury resort project?"

Evelyn's gaze sharpened. "Mom, where is this going?"

Grace gave her a knowing smile. "Well, the Caldwells are looking for investors. Maybe our family could be part of it?"

Evelyn's expression remained unreadable. "I don’t interfere with the Caldwells' business."

Grace sighed. "I’m not asking you to interfere. Just mention it to Marcus. He’d consider your opinion."

Evelyn let out a dry laugh. "Did Dad put you up to this? Is this his idea?"

Grace hesitated. "Well—"

Evelyn cut her off. "Tell him I won’t bring it up to Mr. Caldwell. If he’s serious about this partnership, he should approach them directly instead of using me as a middleman."

Grace’s smile faltered. "Evelyn, you—"

Evelyn interrupted again, her voice firm. "Mom, let’s drop this, please."

Then, softer, she added, "Can we just enjoy our meal?"

Grace opened her mouth but ultimately stayed silent.

After lunch, as Evelyn loaded the dishwasher, her phone buzzed.

It was Leonard.

"Hello, Leonard," she answered.

"Evelyn, do you have a minute?" he asked.

"Just finished lunch. What’s going on?"

Leonard exhaled heavily. "Would you mind bringing some homemade food to Nathan at his office?"

He continued before she could respond. "You don’t know how bad it’s been these past three years. Since you left, no one’s made sure he eats. He forgets meals when he’s working, and his stomach’s gotten worse. I’d really appreciate it if you could help me out this once."

###Chapter 32

Evelyn hesitated, her grip tightening on the phone. The last thing she wanted was to step back into Nathan’s world—not after everything that had happened.

But Leonard’s plea tugged at her.

She sighed. "Fine. I’ll drop something off."

Leonard’s relief was palpable. "Thank you, Evelyn. He’s at the Black Industries headquarters."

After hanging up, Evelyn stared at her reflection in the kitchen window.

Why was she doing this?

She didn’t owe Nathan anything.

Yet, despite herself, she found her hands moving, pulling out ingredients from the fridge.

Old habits died hard.

As she packed the food into a container, her phone buzzed again.

An unknown number.

She answered cautiously. "Hello?"

A smooth, unfamiliar voice replied, "Miss Hartley, we need to talk."

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. "Who is this?"

The voice chuckled darkly. "Let’s just say… someone who knows more about Nathan Black than you do."

Her breath hitched.

What game was this?

And why did it feel like she was being pulled back into a storm she’d fought so hard to escape?

Evelyn's lashes fluttered as she replied, "What if I order him some gourmet delivery instead?"

A beat of silence stretched on the other end before Leonard's weary voice came through. "That won't do, Evelyn. Nathan's too particular. He won't touch takeout. Don't trouble yourself—if you're swamped, I'll handle it."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Leonard had backed her into a corner.

"Fine, I'll take care of it. You should rest, Leonard. Your health comes first," she conceded, recognizing his unspoken motive—to bridge the chasm between her and Nathan.

Leonard's relief was palpable. "Thank you, Evelyn. Just make sure he eats. He forgets meals when left to his own devices."

"Understood," she said tersely.

After hanging up, Evelyn informed Grace she was stepping out and left Sterling Holdings.

Luckily, a Michelin-starred bistro was just blocks away. She selected an array of dishes before heading to Black Enterprises.

At the sleek corporate tower, she bypassed the main elevators and strode toward the CEO's private lift. Without hesitation, she pressed her thumb to the biometric scanner.

Beep. Beep.

The doors slid open.

Evelyn's breath hitched. Her fingerprint still worked. She'd assumed Nathan would have purged her access by now.

Leonard had registered her print years ago, back when she'd personally prepared Nathan's lunches. But after just two deliveries, Nathan had coldly ordered her to stop.

Undeterred, she'd continued cooking—only to transfer the meals into upscale takeout containers, instructing secretaries to deliver them anonymously. The memory made her lips twist wryly.

Unbeknownst to her, the lobby buzzed with speculation.

"Who was that?" a receptionist hissed. "She just accessed the CEO's elevator!"

"His wife?"

"Impossible. HR said Mrs. Black is... substantial. That woman was a knockout—all legs and cheekbones."

Oblivious, Evelyn stepped off the elevator and approached Nathan's office. His secretary blinked in shock before stammering, "Miss, do you have an appointment?"


###Chapter 33

Evelyn approached with a warm smile, her designer heels clicking softly against the marble floor. "Sophie, it's been ages."

Over the past three years, Evelyn's regular lunch deliveries had made her a fixture among the executive assistants at Black Enterprises.

Sophie Bennett, the senior secretary, blinked in momentary confusion. "I'm sorry, do we know each other?"

"It's Evelyn. Don't you recognize me, Sophie?" Evelyn's voice held a musical lilt that hadn't been there before.

Sophie's professionally manicured hands flew to her mouth. "Mrs. Black? My God! You look..." The secretary's eyes widened as she took in Evelyn's transformed appearance - the sleek blonde bob, the tailored Chanel suit, the effortless confidence radiating from her.

Evelyn merely chuckled, the sound like wind chimes in spring. "Is Nathan available?"

"Yes, of course! He's in his office. Please, go right in." Sophie recovered quickly, gesturing toward the imposing double doors.

With a gracious nod, Evelyn crossed the reception area. She paused before the mahogany doors, taking a steadying breath before knocking twice - firm but feminine.

The deep voice that answered sent shivers down her spine. "Enter."

Nathan Black looked up from his documents, his piercing blue eyes turning glacial the moment they landed on her. "What are you doing here?"

Evelyn carefully placed the insulated lunchbox on his desk, keeping her gaze averted. "Leonard asked me to bring you lunch." Her fingers lingered on the container for a heartbeat too long before withdrawing.

Nathan's lips twisted into a sardonic smile. He knew this game. She'd obviously used his father as an excuse to see him.

Memories flooded back - those first months of marriage when Evelyn had taken over preparing his meals with obsessive attention. He'd only discovered her culinary efforts after she'd left for Paris, when his taste buds rebelled against the catered lunches his new assistant provided.

The investigation that followed had revealed everything - how Evelyn had personally selected each ingredient, how she'd studied his preferences like sacred texts.

Her absence had left a void no five-star restaurant could fill. His morning coffee tasted bitter without her precise two sugars. His steak lacked that perfect sear only her hands could achieve. Even his dry cleaning smelled wrong without her lavender sachets tucked between the folds.

The penthouse at Black Tower had become unbearable - every room haunted by traces of her. The way she'd arranged his ties by color gradient. The lemon polish she used on his Oxfords. The handwritten notes she'd leave in his briefcase.

These thoughts churned in Nathan's mind as Evelyn turned toward the exit, her perfume - something expensive and French - lingering in the air.

"Wait!" The command tore from his throat just as her hand touched the doorknob.

###Chapter 34

Evelyn froze, her pulse hammering against her ribcage. Slowly, she turned to face him, schooling her features into polite inquiry. "Yes?"

Nathan rose from his chair, his towering frame dominating the spacious office. He circled the desk with panther-like grace, stopping mere inches from her.

Up close, she could see the flecks of silver in his stubble, the faint lines of exhaustion around his eyes. He smelled like expensive whiskey and something uniquely Nathan - a scent that still made her knees weak after all this time.

"You've changed," he murmured, his gaze sweeping over her in a way that made her skin prickle with awareness.

Evelyn forced a light laugh. "Paris changes everyone." She kept her tone breezy, though her palms had gone damp.

Nathan's fingers caught her chin, tilting her face toward the light. "I wasn't talking about your hair." His thumb brushed her lower lip, sending an electric current through her body. "You're different."

The office phone chose that moment to buzz. Sophie's voice filtered through the intercom. "Mr. Black, your two o'clock is here. Should I send them in?"

Evelyn seized the interruption to step back, putting much-needed distance between them. "I should go."

Nathan's expression darkened. "We're not finished."

A knock at the door punctuated his words. The knob began to turn.

Evelyn's eyes widened in alarm. The last thing she needed was company gossip about her unexpected visit. Without thinking, she darted toward the private elevator reserved for executives.

"Evelyn!" Nathan's roar followed her as the doors slid shut.

Inside the descending elevator, Evelyn pressed a trembling hand to her chest. The rapid thud of her heartbeat mocked her carefully constructed composure.

She'd promised herself this would be a quick, professional delivery. No emotions. No complications. Yet thirty seconds in Nathan's presence had shattered that resolve completely.

The elevator doors opened to the underground parking garage. Evelyn hurried toward her waiting car, only to freeze when she saw the familiar figure leaning against her Mercedes.

"Going somewhere, Mrs. Black?" Nathan purred, pushing off the car with predatory grace.

Evelyn's breath caught. How had he beaten her downstairs?

Before she could react, Nathan closed the distance between them, caging her against the vehicle with his arms. "You owe me an explanation," he growled, his breath warm against her ear. "Starting with why you really came today."

The scent of his cologne enveloped her, stirring memories she'd fought hard to suppress. Evelyn swallowed hard, her carefully rehearsed speech evaporating under the heat of his gaze.

Nathan's phone buzzed insistently in his pocket. He ignored it, his focus entirely on her. "Well?"

Evelyn opened her mouth to respond when a familiar voice cut through the tension.

"Nathan? What's going on here?"

Both turned to see Serena Cole standing a few feet away, her designer-clad figure the picture of poised elegance. Her sharp gaze darted between them, missing nothing.

Evelyn felt the blood drain from her face. Of all the people to witness this scene...

Nathan didn't loosen his hold. "This doesn't concern you, Serena."

Serena's perfectly sculpted eyebrows arched. "Doesn't it? After everything we've—"

"Enough." Nathan's voice cracked like a whip. "Leave."

For a heartbeat, Evelyn thought Serena might argue. Then the other woman's lips curled into a knowing smile. "Of course. We'll continue our... conversation later." With a final pointed look at Evelyn, she turned on her stilettos and walked away.

The moment Serena disappeared around the corner, Nathan's attention snapped back to Evelyn. "Now. Where were we?"

Evelyn's fingers clenched around her car keys. This was spiraling out of control faster than she'd anticipated. She needed to regain the upper hand - fast.

"Actually," she said, summoning every ounce of her newfound confidence, "I believe we were saying goodbye." With a deft maneuver, she slipped under his arm and into the driver's seat.

Nathan's hand shot out, preventing her from closing the door. "This isn't over."

Evelyn met his stormy gaze without flinching. "Isn't it?" She turned the ignition, the engine's growl underscoring her words. "Three years ago, you made your choice perfectly clear."

His grip tightened on the doorframe. "Things change."

"Do they?" Evelyn shifted into gear. "Then prove it."

With that challenge hanging between them, she pulled his hand away and closed the door. The tires squealed as she sped out of the parking garage, leaving Nathan standing alone in the dust.

Her hands shook on the steering wheel, but her resolve held firm. If Nathan Black wanted her back, he'd have to work for it this time.

And Evelyn Hartley was done making things easy for him.

Nathan studied the logo on the meal container with a frown. "What's this, Evelyn? You expect me to eat takeout?"

Evelyn turned to face him, arms crossed. "It's from La Maison Étoilée—hardly fast food."

With a dismissive flick of his wrist, Nathan pushed the container aside, his voice icy. "I'd rather have something you made."

A dry laugh escaped her. "You're joking, right, Mr. Black?"

Nathan's expression darkened. "Evelyn, my father told you to bring me food, not dump some random takeout on my desk to check it off your list. I want your cooking."

She didn't flinch. "This is what I brought. Eat it or don't—your choice."

Without waiting for a response, she turned toward the door.

Just as she reached for the handle, it swung open.

Evelyn froze. Standing in the doorway were two unexpected visitors. Serena's eyes narrowed slightly in surprise, while Dylan's face lit up with a charming smile.

"Ms. Hartley! What a pleasant surprise," Dylan greeted warmly.

Evelyn offered a curt nod before brushing past them without a word.

Serena and Dylan stepped inside, the tension thickening the air.

"Nathan," Serena began, her voice laced with suspicion, "why was she here?"

Ignoring her question, Nathan leaned back in his chair. "Why are you here?"

His evasion only deepened Serena's unease.

Dylan smoothly intervened. "Serena was worried you hadn't eaten, so she brought lunch."

Nathan gestured to the takeout container. "Already taken care of."

Serena's gaze flicked to the food, her instincts screaming that Evelyn had brought it. She reached for it. "This isn't healthy. Try this instead—it's homemade by our chef."

Nathan's hand shot out, stopping her mid-motion. "Leave it."

Serena's fingers hovered in the air, stunned.

Dylan cleared his throat. "Let's just leave both options here. Nathan can decide what he wants."

With a tight smile, Serena withdrew her hand.

###Chapter 35

The silence in the office was suffocating.

Nathan ignored the food entirely, his attention fixed on his laptop. Serena watched him, frustration simmering beneath her composed exterior.

Dylan, ever the peacemaker, broke the tension. "So, Nathan, about the merger—"

"Not now," Nathan cut in, his tone sharp.

Serena's patience snapped. "Is this about her? Again?"

Nathan finally looked up, his gaze glacial. "This is my office. If you're here to interrogate me, you can leave."

Dylan shot Serena a warning look before turning back to Nathan. "We just wanted to make sure you were okay."

"I'm fine." The words were clipped.

Serena exhaled sharply. "Fine. But don't expect me to keep pretending this isn't happening."

With that, she grabbed her purse and stormed out.

Dylan hesitated, then followed, casting one last glance at Nathan.

Alone again, Nathan stared at the untouched takeout container.

His phone buzzed. A message from his father:

"Did she bring you lunch?"

Nathan's jaw tightened.

The game was far from over.

Nathan shifted the conversation toward Dylan, asking, "How are things between you and Evelyn, Dylan? When is she finalizing the divorce with you?"

Dylan responded coolly, "My father's condition is that the divorce can proceed, but not until after his birthday later this year. The divorce is on hold until then."

Hearing this, Serena arched a brow. "So, you're saying you'll have to wait an entire month more?"

"That's correct," Dylan confirmed.

Nathan let out a frustrated curse under his breath. "That scheming woman must have gotten to your father. I knew she wouldn’t let you go without a fight." His irritation flared as he added, "Damn, she really has some nerve!"

Dylan’s expression darkened at Nathan’s harsh words. He fixed him with a sharp glare, his voice icy. "Watch your mouth. I won’t tolerate that kind of talk."

To his own surprise, Dylan found Nathan’s crude remarks about Evelyn irritating.

Nathan blinked, taken aback. He wasn’t sure if Dylan was scolding him for his language or for insulting Evelyn.

Serena’s lips thinned. Was Dylan actually defending Evelyn now?

What had changed since Evelyn’s return? Before, any mention of her name would barely register on Dylan’s face—his indifference so complete it was as if she meant nothing to him.

But now…

Evelyn seemed capable of stirring something in him.

A cold realization settled in Serena’s chest. She forced the words out, her voice tight. "Dylan… are you having second thoughts about the divorce?"

This suspicion had been gnawing at her ever since Evelyn came back. There was something different in Dylan’s demeanor—something she couldn’t quite name, but it unsettled her deeply.

At her question, Dylan’s jaw tensed. He looked away, his response measured. "No."

But there was a slight hesitation in his denial, betraying his uncertainty.

Serena’s eyes glistened with unshed tears. "Or could it be… have you started to develop feelings for Evelyn?"

Dylan’s expression hardened.

In a low, firm voice, he replied, "Absolutely not. My feelings for Evelyn are nonexistent."

Internally, he admitted that hearing about the divorce delay from Leonard had brought him an unexpected sense of relief. But he refused to believe it was because of Evelyn.

No, it was just that he wasn’t ready—unsure if he should marry Serena after the divorce. This delay was merely a temporary reprieve, giving him time to reconsider everything.

?
###Chapter 36

Nathan's office door clicked shut behind Serena and Dylan, leaving an uneasy silence in its wake. The air still carried the faint scent of the soup Serena had insisted Nathan drink while warm—a gesture that now felt more like a claim than kindness.

Dylan adjusted his cufflinks as they stepped into the elevator, his reflection sharp in the polished metal. "You're overthinking this, Serena. Look at Evelyn—she's hardly Nathan's type. That scar on her cheek? The way she dresses? Please. He'd never seriously consider someone like her."

Serena's fingers tightened around her purse strap. "Then why did he hesitate when you mentioned the divorce?"

The elevator dinged, doors sliding open to the parking garage. Dylan guided her forward with a hand at her elbow, his voice dropping. "Because pressuring him now risks backfiring. What if he digs in his heels just to defy us?" He unlocked the car with a smooth click of his key fob. "We need to understand what—or who—is making him second-guess."

Serena slid into the passenger seat, her designer skirt whispering against the leather. "You think it's Evelyn?"

"Or this new complication—Lila." Dylan's jaw flexed as he started the engine. "Ethan gave me her number himself. That's practically an invitation."

A muscle twitched near Serena's eye. First Evelyn, now Lila Sinclair? Every woman near Nathan was a threat waiting to be neutralized.

Dylan smirked, merging into traffic. "Relax. I'll handle Lila. But Evelyn..." His fingers drummed the steering wheel. "We haven't seen her since she returned. Maybe it's time for a reunion?"

Serena stared out at the blur of city lights, her silence answer enough.

Inside his office, Nathan stared at the untouched soup container. Dylan's words echoed: "He'll keep his word."

A bitter laugh escaped him. Promises made in grief had expiration dates.

His phone buzzed—a message from Leonard: "One month, Nathan. Don't make me intervene."

The screen darkened as his thumb hovered over Evelyn's contact. Five years of silence between them, yet her face flashed behind his eyelids every night. That scar. Those defiant eyes.

The intercom crackled. "Mr. Black? Your 3 o'clock is here."

Nathan deleted the unsent text. "Send them in."

The door opened to reveal Lila Sinclair in a crimson dress that screamed calculation. "Long time no see, Nathan." Her smile didn't reach her eyes. "Shall we discuss how you're going to fix what your family broke?"

Outside, storm clouds swallowed the sun.


###Chapter 37

At the Caldwell estate, Evelyn found only Olivia at home when she arrived. Marcus and Ethan were both at the company.

Evelyn greeted Olivia warmly.

"Come here, darling," Olivia said, her voice laced with affection. "Ethan and I were just talking about how much we missed you yesterday." She gave Evelyn a playful scolding look, though her eyes sparkled with warmth.

"And here I am, back to see you," Evelyn replied with a soft smile. She settled beside Olivia and linked their arms together. "How have you been? Any health issues lately?"

Olivia shook her head. "I feel wonderful! Ever since you performed that surgery for me, my heart hasn’t given me a single problem."

Evelyn’s smile deepened. "That makes me happy."

Years ago, during a trip to Chixdon, Olivia had collapsed from a heart attack on the street. While others hesitated, Evelyn had stepped forward, administering critical first aid that saved Olivia’s life. Later, she performed the surgery that fully restored Olivia’s health.

During that time, Olivia and Marcus had grown incredibly fond of Evelyn. Eventually, Olivia had asked her to become her goddaughter.

Olivia shifted the topic. "Ethan mentioned you and Nathan were supposed to finalize the divorce papers today?"

"That’s been delayed," Evelyn pressed her lips together before explaining her recent conversation with Leonard.

After listening, Olivia smiled knowingly. "It seems Nathan’s father is gently nudging you two to reconsider. He doesn’t want this divorce to happen, hence the indirect approach."

Evelyn nodded. "I understand that."

Olivia studied her. "And how do you feel about it?"

A faint, bittersweet smile touched Evelyn’s lips. "I’m just waiting for next month to finalize the divorce."

Olivia raised a brow. "You’re not even tempted to try one last time?"

Evelyn exhaled softly, her gaze distant. "After three years of failing to win Nathan’s heart, I doubt one month will change anything."

She straightened, her voice firmer now. "Even if it could, I don’t want to anymore. I’m exhausted. I refuse to spend my life chasing after someone else’s affection. It’s time I lived for myself."

Olivia squeezed her hand. "That’s a wise decision, my dear. I support you completely."

Evelyn chuckled.

The rest of the afternoon passed in pleasant conversation between them. When Marcus and Ethan returned in the evening, their delight at seeing Evelyn made for a lively dinner.

Afterward, Ethan motioned for her to follow him upstairs to his study.


###Chapter 38

"What's bothering you, Ethan?" Evelyn asked as she stepped into the room.

Pulling out his phone with a mischievous grin, Ethan suggested, "How about we snap a picture together?"

Evelyn arched a perfectly shaped brow, amusement dancing in her eyes. "Still trying to get under your ex's skin, are we?"

It had been nearly a month since Ethan's breakup, and he had confided in Evelyn that his ex was still sulking over something trivial. His plan? Make her jealous enough to come crawling back.

Ethan's expression darkened slightly. "That video of us dancing when you came back went viral. She saw it, but still nothing. I think we need to turn up the heat. There's no way she can ignore this!"

Evelyn sighed dramatically, shaking her head. "Fine. What's your grand plan for this photo?"

Ethan already had it all figured out. "Just follow my lead," he said, his grin widening.

In the next moment, they snapped the picture—quick, effortless. Ethan barely glanced at it before posting it online, satisfaction gleaming in his eyes.

Meanwhile, Nathan was scrolling through his social media feed when Ethan's latest post caught his attention. His brows furrowed as he took in the image of Ethan and Evelyn, their faces close, their smiles bright.

In the photo, Ethan's fingers lightly pinched Evelyn's cheek, eliciting a mock-irritated expression from her. Though the pose wasn’t overtly intimate, the familiarity between them was undeniable. Something about the sight of them together sent an unexpected surge of irritation through Nathan. His jaw tightened as he swiftly scrolled past, refusing to dwell on it.

At nine sharp, Evelyn returned to the sprawling Grant estate. She stepped into the bedroom to find Nathan already there, his presence an unwelcome surprise. A faint crease formed between her brows.

"Nathan, Leonard insisted we stay in the house, not that we share a room," she said coolly, her gaze sharp. "Find another room."

Nathan looked up slowly, his expression dripping with disdain. "You think I want this? This is the only bedroom in this entire mansion with both a bed and a couch. Blame Leonard for his meddling."

His tone turned icy. It was clear Leonard had orchestrated this arrangement with deliberate intent.

Evelyn paused, caught off guard. She hadn’t expected Leonard to be so relentless in pushing her and Nathan together. After a brief hesitation, she turned toward the walk-in closet.

"Evelyn," Nathan called out abruptly as she took a few steps.

She stopped and turned, meeting his gaze.

His voice was low, edged with warning. "We're still married, Evelyn. To the world, you're still my wife. That photo with Ethan—think about what it means for me."

A beat of silence.

"It affects my reputation."

?
###Chapter 39

Evelyn spun around, her lips curling into a mocking smile. "Worried about your precious reputation?" she scoffed, her eyes flashing with defiance. "I’ve already signed the divorce papers. As far as I’m concerned, we’re done. Let’s stay out of each other’s lives, alright?"

Nathan rose from the sofa, his icy gaze pinning her in place. "Until the divorce is finalized, the world still sees us as married. Your reckless behavior could drag the Black family’s name through the mud. Do you really want that?"

A dry laugh escaped Evelyn’s lips. She tilted her head, regarding him with open disdain. "Oh, Mr. Black, spare me the theatrics. Hardly anyone even knows I’m Mrs. Black. Your family’s reputation is the last thing on my mind."

Nathan faltered, realization striking him like a slap. In their three years of marriage, Evelyn had rarely accompanied him to public events. It wasn’t that he had hidden her—she simply refused to go. As a result, most only knew his wife as an unremarkable, overweight woman.

Evelyn’s expression hardened as she noted his silence. "While I was gone, Serena clung to you like a second shadow. You didn’t seem to care about propriety then. Why the sudden concern?" she challenged, her voice dripping with sarcasm.

Nathan’s jaw tightened, but then a slow, knowing smirk spread across his face. He studied her, amusement flickering in his eyes. "Interesting how well-informed you are about my life, even from abroad. Almost as if you’ve been keeping tabs on me."

For a split second, surprise flickered in Evelyn’s gaze. She hadn’t sought out the information—Natalie had filled her in. But she recovered quickly, flashing him a teasing grin. "Of course I did. Catching you cheating could’ve netted me a bigger settlement, don’t you think?"

Nathan arched a brow, unimpressed. "Is that so?"

Done with the conversation, Evelyn turned on her heel, snatching her loungewear from the closet before disappearing into the bathroom.

Silence settled between them like a thick fog.

That night, sleep evaded Nathan. He woke the next morning with an aching back and immediately ordered a new bed.

Meanwhile, Evelyn was brimming with energy. She had just returned to her room after breakfast when her phone buzzed with an unfamiliar number.

She swiped to answer. "Hello?"

"Good morning, Ms. Hartley. It’s Dylan Reeves. I hope you remember me," came the smooth, familiar voice.

###Chapter 40

At the mention of Dylan, Evelyn arched an eyebrow in curiosity. “What’s this about, Mr. Reeves?” she asked, cutting straight to the point.

“I was hoping to have the pleasure of your company for dinner, Ms. Hartley,” Dylan replied smoothly, his voice warm.

A knowing smile curled on Evelyn’s lips. “That sounds delightful. I happen to be free tonight.”

“Then it’s settled,” Dylan said, his tone brightening. “I’ll send you the details of the restaurant shortly.”

“Looking forward to it,” Evelyn responded before ending the call.

As she set her phone down, a calculating gleam flickered in her eyes. She intended to use her position as the Hartley family’s goddaughter to pry some answers out of Dylan—answers that had been kept from her for far too long.

Just as she was about to slip her phone into her bag, it buzzed again. The caller ID made her pause. She answered swiftly. “Hello?”

A soft, melodic voice floated through the line. “Evelyn, it’s been days since you returned. Three years without a word, and now you’re avoiding me? Are we really going to act like strangers, even though we’re sisters?” It was Lila.

Evelyn’s lips thinned, her expression unreadable. “I’ve been busy,” she replied coolly.

“I get that,” Lila said, undeterred. “But we should meet. How about lunch today? It’s time we caught up.”

Evelyn hesitated for only a second. “Fine.”

“Perfect! Let’s meet at Happer Restaurant. You always loved their food,” Lila suggested brightly.

“I’ll be there.”

“Noon, then,” Lila said before hanging up.

Evelyn exhaled sharply, steeling herself. There were questions she needed answered, and she wasn’t leaving without them.

At Happer Restaurant, Evelyn stepped into the private dining room to find Lila already seated. The moment she entered, Lila sprang up with a dazzling smile and rushed toward her.

“Evelyn! You look absolutely stunning,” Lila gushed, her eyes sweeping over her sister with exaggerated admiration. “Almost makes me jealous. Come, sit!” She reached for Evelyn’s hand.

Evelyn jerked her hand away before Lila could touch her, ignoring the flicker of hurt in her sister’s eyes, and moved to the table. Lila’s smile faltered as she stared at her empty hand.

Regaining her composure, Lila followed and sat beside Evelyn, her expression a mix of confusion and wounded innocence. “Evelyn, why are you being so cold? What happened to us? We used to be so close.”

Evelyn nearly scoffed. Once, she had believed Lila was the only person in the world who truly cared for her.

Now, she knew better.

###Chapter 41

Lila's voice softened as she continued, "Evelyn, I know you're still hurting because of me. Three years ago, I thought you were the one who pushed me down the stairs. I realized later it was an accident, but by then, it was too late. I tried to convince Father, but he wouldn’t listen. I’m sorry you suffered because of my mistake. Can you find it in your heart to forgive me, just this once?"

Despite Lila’s remorseful tone, Evelyn’s expression remained cold and unreadable. The memory of Lila’s shrill accusation—"Evelyn, why did you push me?"—still echoed in her mind. Though Lila had quickly taken back her words when she saw their father’s wrath, the damage had been done.

Evelyn’s lips curled slightly as she met Lila’s gaze. "Did you really invite me here just to dredge up the past?"

Lila shook her head, her face turning serious. "There’s something more important."

Without hesitation, she leaned in. "While you were away, I kept an eye on Nathan for you. His ex, Serena, has been circling him like a vulture these past three years. Now that you’re back, you can’t let her get away with this. She’s shamelessly trying to ruin your marriage—it’s unacceptable. You need to put her in her place and make sure she never comes near Nathan again."

She clenched her fists, her eyes burning with righteous indignation, as if she were ready to fight Evelyn’s battles for her.

Evelyn’s gaze flickered with quiet amusement. How had she never noticed before just how invested Lila was in Nathan’s affairs?

With a faint, knowing smile, Evelyn tilted her head. "Isn’t it a little odd for my sister to be so involved in my marriage? People might start wondering if you have… ulterior motives regarding your brother-in-law."

Lila’s face paled for a fraction of a second before she quickly schooled her expression into one of wounded innocence. "Evelyn, I’m only worried about you. I know how difficult the Black family can be. That’s why I’ve been watching Nathan for you. It hurts that you’d think I have anything but your best interests at heart."

Evelyn’s response was cool and measured. "I appreciate your concern, Lila. But my relationship with Nathan is my business. I’d prefer if you stayed out of it."

A brief silence fell between them. Lila’s mask slipped for just a moment—gone was the sister who used to manipulate Evelyn with ease. In the past, Evelyn would have immediately apologized for doubting her. But now…

Lila quickly recovered, though her smile didn’t quite reach her eyes. She had always known how to pull Evelyn’s strings, but something had changed.

Then, as if remembering something, Lila perked up. "Now that you’re back, have you thought about your career? What about joining me at Sterling General Hospital?"

At the mention of the hospital, Evelyn’s brows furrowed slightly.


###Chapter 42

Lila Sinclair's question didn't come as a surprise.

That evening at the Caldwell family banquet, Lila had been forced to leave abruptly after receiving an urgent call from her mentor. Because of this, she had missed Evelyn Hartley's heroic act—and Ethan Caldwell's public declaration that Evelyn might soon join Grandview General Hospital.

When Evelyn mentioned the hospital, Lila's face brightened with pride. "Yes, I've started working at Grandview," she said, her voice laced with satisfaction.

Evelyn tilted her head, feigning curiosity. "Oh? What position do you hold? Attending physician? Or something else?"

The question caught Lila off guard. A flicker of discomfort crossed her features before she forced a smile. "Well, I'm not officially on staff yet. Grandview only accepts the best—there are rigorous exams and multiple selection rounds." She paused, then added, "Right now, I'm training under the Chief Surgeon in the Cardiac Department. My mentor believes in another two years, I'll be ready to pass the exams and secure a permanent position."

Evelyn nodded slowly. "I see."

Lila leaned forward, her tone dripping with false generosity. "Evelyn, you should join me there. You might not qualify for training yet, but you could start as my assistant. With time, you could work your way up."

A polite smile curved Evelyn's lips. "That's kind of you, but I've already accepted another position. I start tomorrow."

Lila's eyes narrowed slightly. "Really? Where?"

Evelyn's smile deepened, mysterious. "You'll find out soon enough."

Lila barely suppressed a scoff. Probably some no-name clinic, she thought dismissively.

Throughout the meal, Lila kept steering the conversation, desperate to maintain control. "Evelyn, now that you're the Caldwells' goddaughter, I'm so happy for you. Since our families are closer, maybe you could arrange a dinner with Marcus and Olivia for us?"

Evelyn's expression remained cool. "We'll see."

Marcus Donovan and Olivia Sinclair despised Victor Sterling for how he had treated Evelyn. The mere mention of him soured their moods.

Lila clenched her teeth but held back her frustration. She couldn't afford to push too hard—not when Evelyn held all the cards now.

When they finally left the restaurant, Lila suggested extending their afternoon together. Evelyn declined with effortless grace before driving off, leaving Lila standing on the curb, seething.

Back at the Sterling estate, tension hung thick in the air.

###Chapter 43

What game is Evelyn playing now? Lila wondered, her nails digging into her palms.

And more importantly—where was she really working tomorrow?

The answer would come sooner than Lila expected. And it would shake her to her core.

"Why did you buy a new bed?" Leonard Grant demanded, his brows furrowing in disapproval as he glared at Nathan Black.

Nathan didn’t flinch. "What else would a bed be for, if not sleeping? Especially after you had every other bed in the house removed."

Leonard’s jaw tightened. "You and Evelyn are still married. Married couples share a bed, not sleep separately."

Nathan met his father’s gaze coolly. "This marriage might not last another month. What difference does it make now?"

Leonard faltered, momentarily speechless. Then, recovering quickly, he snapped, "Don’t divorce her. Where else will you find a wife like Evelyn? You’re taking your luck for granted. You’ll regret it once she’s gone."

Nathan scoffed, a derisive smirk twisting his lips. "Regret divorcing Evelyn? Trust me, that’s something I’ll never feel." His voice was sharp with conviction, leaving no room for doubt.

What he didn’t know was that soon, he would come face-to-face with the bitter taste of regret.

Leonard’s eyes darkened as he studied his son. "Is Serena the reason you’re divorcing Evelyn?"

Nathan remained silent.

Leonard’s expression hardened instantly. "Nathan, listen to me clearly. As long as I’m alive, I will never allow you to marry Serena."

Margaret Hayes, standing nearby, paled at the intensity of his words. She quickly stepped forward, placing a calming hand on Leonard’s arm. "Leonard, please, don’t get worked up like this. It’s not good for your health."

Nathan’s expression darkened, his gaze locked onto his father’s. "Why can’t I marry Serena? You’ve been against her for six years. Isn’t that enough time to prove her love?"

Leonard exhaled heavily, his voice softening with an almost pleading tone. "Nathan, as your father, would I ever steer you wrong? Serena isn’t the right woman for you. Trust me just this once—end things with her and make your marriage work with Evelyn. Please."

Nathan let out a sharp, humorless laugh. "You’ve been singing the same tune for six years—claiming you’re protecting me while manipulating my choices, threatening me to cut ties with Serena, and forcing me into a marriage with Evelyn. You always think you know what’s best for me."

He paused, his voice dropping to an icy whisper. "But, Dad, I’m not that naive boy anymore. Do you really think I’ll still bend to your threats?"

Nathan’s tone was razor-sharp by the end, his eyes unblinking, challenging Leonard with unwavering defiance.

Leonard’s face flushed with anger, his hands trembling.

"Leonard, please, calm down," Margaret urged, gripping his arm tighter before turning to Nathan with pleading eyes. "Nathan, this isn’t the time to upset your father. Just stop, please."


###Chapter 44

Nathan pressed his lips together, refusing to speak. The air in the room grew colder, yet a flicker of something unreadable—perhaps concern—passed through his dark eyes before vanishing just as quickly.

Leonard’s anger eventually cooled, though his chest still rose and fell with heavy breaths. He studied Nathan for a long moment before speaking again. "Nathan, let’s make a wager about your relationship with Evelyn. One month—that’s all I ask. During that time, you’ll cooperate with my plans and genuinely try to develop feelings for her. If, after thirty days, you still prefer Serena over Evelyn, I swear I’ll never interfere in your love life again. But if not… you’ll end things with Serena and commit to your engagement with Evelyn."

He knew Nathan had changed drastically over the past six years. Force wouldn’t work anymore—subtlety was necessary.

At Leonard’s proposition, Nathan’s brows drew together in surprise. He hadn’t expected such an unconventional bet.

A knowing smirk curled Leonard’s lips as he watched Nathan’s silent contemplation. "What’s wrong? Afraid? Or worried you might actually fall for Evelyn?"

The idea was laughable to Nathan. Fall for Evelyn? Impossible.

"Fine," Nathan said, confidence lacing his voice. "You have your bet." One month, and then Leonard would be out of his personal life for good. As for developing feelings for Evelyn? That outcome was beyond unlikely. He was certain he’d win.

"Excellent," Leonard replied with a satisfied nod.

That evening, Evelyn arrived at the upscale restaurant where she was supposed to meet Dylan for dinner.

The moment she stepped inside, she noticed the unusual emptiness of the place. It took her only a second to realize—Dylan had reserved the entire venue.

"Ms. Hartley," Dylan greeted smoothly as he approached.

Tonight, he looked every inch the polished gentleman—his suit immaculate, his dark hair perfectly styled. He gestured for her to take a seat with practiced charm, the picture of sophistication. To an outsider, he might have seemed like the ideal suitor.

But Evelyn’s gaze betrayed her true feelings, a flicker of disdain passing through her eyes before she masked it.

Once seated, Dylan snapped his fingers, and the first course was served without delay.

"Please, enjoy," he said, gesturing toward the elegantly plated dishes.

Evelyn picked up her fork, taking a small bite before glancing at Dylan. "Mr. Reeves," she began casually, "wasn’t your cousin once involved with Nathan?"

Indeed, Dylan and Serena’s mothers were sisters—though their lives had taken drastically different paths. One had married into the wealthy Reeves family, while the other had settled for a high school teacher.

...
###Chapter 45

Nathan's gaze sharpened at Evelyn's question. A flicker of suspicion crossed his mind—was she genuinely interested in him?

With deliberate calm, he answered, "Yes, Serena, my cousin, was Nathan's first love. She still holds his heart."

Evelyn's lips curved into a faint smile. "But rumors say Nathan is already married. And his wife... isn’t your cousin."

Dylan's expression darkened instantly. "That woman? She’s nothing—plain, with an unsightly scar on her cheek."

He leaned in, voice dripping with disdain. "Nathan only married her to protect Serena. When Serena returned three years ago, he tried to divorce that woman immediately. But she was cunning—she fled abroad before he could finalize it. If not for her, Nathan and Serena would be married by now."

A pause. Then, with cold certainty, he added, "No one can come between them. They’re destined to be together."

Evelyn’s grip on her fork tightened. Even after all this time, hearing it spoken aloud still felt like a knife twisting in her chest.

Dylan studied her reaction, satisfaction curling in his chest. He continued, his tone laced with false sympathy, "There’s more. Nathan didn’t just marry that woman for Serena’s sake."

Evelyn lifted her gaze, curiosity flickering through the pain.

With a sly smile, Dylan explained, "Originally, Nathan’s father, Leonard, had arranged for him to marry a woman from the prestigious Perez family. A socialite—beautiful, refined, everything Serena wasn’t. Nathan knew Serena would feel inferior, so he chose the Wright family’s forgotten daughter instead. A lesser threat."

Evelyn’s face paled. Her throat tightened, each breath suddenly an effort. The lengths Nathan had gone to for Serena—it was almost laughable.

Dylan feigned concern. "Ms. Hartley, are you alright? You look unwell."

In truth, he had fabricated half the story. His goal was simple: make Evelyn believe she stood no chance.

Yet, Evelyn swallowed every word. Her heart ached, slow and relentless. Forcing a brittle smile, she asked, "If Nathan loves Serena so much, why marry someone else at all?"

Dylan sighed dramatically. "Blame Leonard. He thought Serena wasn’t good enough—too common for the Black family. But now? Nathan controls everything. Leonard’s objections mean nothing."

Evelyn watched Dylan closely. His expression was steady, unwavering. To him, this was the truth.

But what he didn’t know—what no one knew—was the real reason Leonard had despised Serena.

And Evelyn intended to keep it that way.

###Chapter 46

Evelyn remembered, from what she knew of Leonard, that his reservations about Serena went far beyond simple background concerns. If family status had been Leonard's only issue, she doubted his reaction would have been so severe when Nathan brought her home—especially considering Evelyn's own humble beginnings. Leonard had accepted her, despite her being an illegitimate child with less-than-stellar looks. So why the harsh judgment toward Serena, whose only "flaw" was a deceased father and modest upbringing?

Besides, Serena’s uncle was the chairman of the Thornton Group.

Evelyn had assumed Dylan, as Serena’s cousin, would know more about the situation. But it turned out he was just as clueless.

Dylan’s gaze lingered on Evelyn, a sudden realization dawning on him. He quickly interjected, "Ms. Hartley, don’t misunderstand. My cousin isn’t the problem here. She and Nathan have a real connection. It’s that wretched woman who forced her way into their relationship."

Evelyn’s expression darkened, a vein pulsing at her temple. Her voice was icy, her eyes narrowing as she regarded Dylan. "Mr. Reeves, repeatedly insulting someone’s appearance is hardly gentlemanly behavior."

Dylan stiffened, then chuckled awkwardly. "Well, I have strong opinions about that woman. You might not know this, Ms. Hartley, but she—born out of wedlock—isn’t just unattractive and overweight. She’s utterly delusional. She actually believes Nathan married her for love, so she acts like she owns him—controlling the household, meddling in his business, tracking his every move, and scheming behind the scenes."

He scoffed, his disdain palpable. "She’s sabotaged every woman who’s ever spoken to Nathan or shown him the slightest kindness. Ridiculous, isn’t it? Nathan was sick of her antics. Frankly, we all were."

His lip curled in contempt. "She’s nothing but an illegitimate daughter from a nobody family. Does she really think marrying Nathan elevates her? It’s laughable!"

Evelyn exhaled silently, her emotions churning. Watching the mockery on Dylan’s face, her own expression turned frigid. Then, a slow, knowing smile curved her lips. "Interesting… Mr. Reeves, wasn’t your mother once a penniless student funded by your father?"

Dylan froze for a split second before forcing a nod. "Yes, that’s correct."

Evelyn’s smile remained, sharp as a blade. "And isn’t it true that when your mother was pregnant with you, your father was still legally married to his first wife?"

Years ago, Cassandra Whitmore had approached Gregory Thornton under the guise of gratitude. Slowly, she had ensnared him, becoming his mistress and maintaining the affair for years.

Gregory had never intended to leave his wife—Cassandra was merely a hidden indulgence. Tragically, his wife fell gravely ill and passed away. Around the same time, Cassandra discovered she was pregnant. When the ultrasound confirmed a son, Gregory finally married her.


###Chapter 47

The whispers had never truly died down. Among their social circle, speculation still lingered—did Cassandra Whitmore have a hand in Gregory Thornton's first wife's mysterious death? Though no proof ever surfaced, the rumors had left a stain that time couldn't erase.

Ethan Caldwell had shared all of this with Evelyn Hartley.

When Dylan Reeves heard Evelyn's words, his expression twisted. His forced smile barely masked his discomfort as he asked, "What exactly are you insinuating, Ms. Hartley?"

Evelyn's lips curled into a smirk, laced with quiet mockery. "Just a friendly observation, Mr. Reeves. Isn't it fascinating how your mother climbed from mistress to wife? When she was pregnant with you, she was nothing more than your father's dirty little secret. So, if we're being honest, the line between you and an 'illegitimate child' is paper-thin. Maybe you should take a long look in the mirror before judging others."

Her voice turned icy as she continued, "No one chooses how they're born."

"Does anyone want to be labeled illegitimate? As a grown man, shouldn't you know better than to fling such petty insults?" With that, Evelyn pushed back her chair and stood.

She looked down at Dylan, her tone cool and detached. "Forgive me, Mr. Reeves, but I have no appetite for dining with someone who lacks basic decency."

Dylan's face darkened as Evelyn gathered her things and strode out.

Seated in her car, Evelyn exhaled sharply, a bitter laugh escaping her. The irony was almost amusing—Dylan, of all people, acting morally superior when his own mother's past was anything but pristine.

A sudden craving hit her. Without another thought, she drove straight to The Velvet Fork, famed for their honey-glazed pork ribs.

As she stepped out of her car, a familiar voice called out. "Evelyn."

Turning, she saw Diana Prescott emerging from a sleek black Bentley, her smile warm but calculated. Evelyn returned the greeting with a polite nod.

Diana approached, linking their arms as if they were old friends. "Dining alone?"

"Yes," Evelyn replied, keeping her tone neutral.

"Why not join us? Victor and Lila are already inside," Diana offered, already guiding her toward the entrance.

Evelyn hesitated for only a second before nodding. "Fine."

Following Diana into the private dining room, Evelyn met the stunned gazes of Victor Sterling and Lila Sinclair.

Lila's smile was bright but sharp. "Mother, Evelyn—what a surprise. How did you two end up together?"

###Chapter 48

The crisp evening air carried the scent of blooming jasmine as Evelyn stepped into the elegant restaurant. She had been lost in thought when Diana’s voice pulled her back to reality.

“We happened to meet in the parking lot,” Diana explained smoothly, her tone light. “Evelyn was dining alone, so I invited her to join us.”

Lila offered a practiced smile, though her eyes flickered with something unreadable. “Of course. Evelyn, please, sit with us.”

The dinner progressed with Victor and Diana attending to Lila’s every request—refilling her wine, adjusting her napkin, praising her latest achievements. Evelyn, meanwhile, ate in silence, her fingers tightening slightly around her fork.

Then, without warning, a glistening piece of seared scallop landed on her plate.

Evelyn blinked, startled.

Victor leaned back, his expression indifferent. “Try it. The chef’s specialty.”

She stared at the scallop, a wry smile tugging at her lips. Just as she opened her mouth to respond, Diana’s fork darted forward, swiftly reclaiming the seafood and depositing it back onto Victor’s plate.

Victor froze, his brows lifting in surprise.

Evelyn’s gaze flicked to Diana, intrigued.

Diana set her fork down with deliberate calm, her voice low but firm. “Evelyn is allergic to shellfish. How could you forget something like that?”

The words hung in the air, sharp and undeniable. Victor’s face darkened, while Evelyn’s pulse quickened. She hadn’t expected Diana to remember. Her own father hadn’t.

Lila’s smile faltered for a fraction of a second before she laughed, the sound light but edged with something cold. “How strange. You’re both allergic to seafood—almost like you’re the real mother and daughter.”

Diana shot her a warning look. “Don’t be ridiculous.”

Victor chuckled, though his eyes remained guarded. “Should we assume everyone with a shellfish allergy is related?”

Lila giggled, covering her mouth with her hand. “Just a joke!”

For a brief moment, something flickered in Victor’s gaze—something dark and unreadable—before it vanished.

Ignoring them, Diana reached for the platter of roasted lamb and placed a tender slice on Evelyn’s plate. Their eyes met, and Evelyn felt an unexpected warmth.

“Thank you,” she murmured.

Diana simply nodded and returned to her meal.

Then Victor turned to Evelyn, his tone shifting, colder. “Lila mentioned you declined her offer to join her at Grandview General. Why?”

His expression hardened. “Do you think you’re above it? Have you considered your qualifications compared to hers? Lila graduated top of her class. You barely scraped by.”

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her napkin.

###Chapter 49

What would Victor say next? And why did Diana’s small act of kindness feel like a lifeline in a storm?

Evelyn stood in the Cardiac Surgery Department, her fingers tightening around the edge of the desk as Victor’s words sliced through the air.

"Lila is offering you an assistant position as a favor. With your skills, tell me—what hospital would even consider hiring you?"

A bitter smile curled Evelyn’s lips. Of course. In Victor’s eyes, only Lila’s achievements mattered. Had he ever truly seen her? When she had brought home a flawless report card, he had barely glanced at it before dismissing her, too engrossed in his work to care.

During university, her grades hadn’t matched Lila’s—but not because she lacked ability. No, she had realized early on that every time she outshone Lila, her sister’s congratulations came with a strained smile. Grace had advised her to step back, to let Lila shine. "She’s always been kind to you," Grace had said. So Evelyn had held back, scraping by with just enough to pass. And Lila? She had brightened, even offering to tutor her.

Now, looking back, Evelyn wondered how she had been so naive.

"I already have a job," she said coolly.

Victor scoffed. "What kind of job? Some back-alley clinic with no future? Quit and take Lila’s offer at Grand Oaks General. Don’t be ungrateful." His tone was sharp, final.

Evelyn opened her mouth to retort, but Diana cut in.

"Enough. If Evelyn has a job, let her keep it. She doesn’t need to follow Lila everywhere. She has her own path."

A warmth flickered in Evelyn’s chest.

Lila sighed, playing the peacemaker. "Dad, if Evelyn doesn’t want to come to Grand Oaks, we shouldn’t force her."

Victor’s jaw tightened. "Fine. Do as you please, Evelyn. But I’d love to see which hospital was desperate enough to hire you."

With that, he turned away, dismissing her entirely. Evelyn barely flinched.

After dinner, she retreated to the Black family estate. Stepping into the bedroom, she froze.

Two beds.

The spacious room, once solely hers, now held a second bed—undoubtedly Nathan’s doing. She exhaled, too tired to dwell on it. After a quick shower, she slipped beneath the covers, eager for rest before her shift tomorrow.

Just as her eyes closed, the door creaked open.

Nathan stepped inside, and in an instant, Dylan’s words echoed in her mind. "He’s always loved Serena."

Her chest tightened. She shot him a frosty glare before turning away. Nathan ignored it, and silence settled over the room like a suffocating blanket.

Evelyn fell into a fitful sleep—only to jerk awake hours later, gasping, her skin slick with sweat.

A nightmare.

In it, Victor, Grace, even Nathan—they had all conspired to kill her. Grace’s dagger had been inches from her heart when she woke, her pulse racing.

Why would she dream something so cruel about the people closest to her?

Shaking, she slipped out of bed and onto the balcony. Curling into the swing chair, she hugged her knees to her chest, the night air doing little to calm the storm inside her.


###Chapter 50

The unsettling thought weighed heavily on Evelyn's mind as she buried her face in her knees. The cool night air brushed against her skin, but it did little to soothe the storm inside her. Suddenly, the balcony door clicked open, the sound slicing through the silence.

Evelyn lifted her head, her dark eyes shimmering with unspoken emotions.

Nathan stood there, his broad frame silhouetted against the dim light from the bedroom. His voice was rough with sleep. "What are you doing out here at this hour?"

For a moment, Evelyn simply stared at him, her expression unreadable. Then, she turned away, unable—or unwilling—to hold his gaze any longer.

Nathan frowned, irritation flickering in his sharp blue eyes. He had woken to find the bed empty, an inexplicable pang of worry tightening his chest. Now, seeing her here, unharmed, he felt foolish for caring.

He was about to turn back inside when—

"Nathan." Evelyn's voice, crisp and cool, stopped him mid-step. "You truly love Serena, don't you?"

Nathan hesitated, his jaw tensing before he turned to face her fully. His expression was unreadable, but his silence spoke volumes.

Evelyn's lips curled into a bitter smile. "To marry someone like me—an illegitimate daughter with nothing to offer—just for her sake... You must really adore her."

The irony in her tone was sharp enough to cut.

Before Nathan could respond, Evelyn continued, her voice barely above a whisper, "Leonard insists we wait a month before finalizing the divorce. That must be frustrating for you."

Nathan's gaze darkened, a flicker of disdain crossing his features. "At least you're aware of it."

Evelyn looked away, her smile faint and humorless. "Don't worry. When the time comes, I'll make sure the divorce goes through smoothly. You'll be free to be with Serena."

Her words were calm, detached, as if she were discussing the weather rather than the end of her marriage.

Nathan's eyes narrowed. Her indifference shouldn’t have bothered him—but it did. The unfamiliar irritation coiled in his chest, tightening his voice. "See that you do."

With that, he turned sharply and strode back inside, the balcony door slamming shut behind him with a finality that echoed through the night.

Evelyn watched him go, her expression serene. Then, she turned back to the city lights, her fingers curling around the railing. Sleep eluded her for the rest of the night, and by morning, dark shadows lingered beneath her eyes. After hastily applying concealer and securing her sleek wig into a neat ponytail, she left the penthouse without another word.

The Grand Hills General Hospital parking lot was nearly full when she arrived. Originally, Sebastian was supposed to meet her at the entrance, but Evelyn had insisted on heading straight to the Cardiac Surgery Department.

Yet, as she stepped out of the elevator, a security guard blocked her path. "Identification, please. What’s your business here?"

Before Evelyn could respond, a familiar voice called out from behind.

"Evelyn?"

She turned—and there stood Lila.

?
###Chapter 51

"What brings you here, Evelyn? Were you looking for me?" Lila Sinclair's voice dripped with false sweetness as she grasped Evelyn Hartley's wrist with deceptive gentleness. "Come, let's go inside."

The automatic doors of Silvercrest General Hospital's cardiac wing hissed open, revealing the controlled chaos of the cardiac surgery department. Lila led Evelyn past nurses pushing medication carts and interns clutching clipboards, their path ending at the glass-walled doctors' lounge.

As they entered, the hum of conversation paused. Several doctors looked up from their charts, their expressions shifting when they noticed Evelyn standing beside their golden girl.

"Lila, who's your lovely companion?" asked a young resident, adjusting his glasses.

"My sister," Lila announced with a theatrical flourish that made Evelyn's skin prickle. "Evelyn Hartley."

Murmurs of appreciation rippled through the room. Evelyn could practically see the mental calculations happening behind their eyes - the Sinclair name carried weight here, and Lila was the department's rising star.

Lila turned those calculating blue eyes on Evelyn, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "Darling, have you finally come to accept my offer? I've arranged everything - you'll be my personal assistant while you prepare for your licensing exams."

Before Evelyn could respond, Dr. Vivian Cross, the deputy chief physician, interjected. "Your sister's joining us, Lila? How wonderful!"

"Of course!" Lila's smile didn't reach her eyes. "She graduated top of her class at Stanford Medical, though..." She trailed off meaningfully, letting the unspoken implication - that Evelyn had abandoned her career for Nathan Black - hang in the air.

Evelyn's voice cut through the tension like surgical steel. "I'm not here to be your assistant, Lila."

The room went still. Lila's perfectly manicured fingers fluttered to her chest in mock distress. "Evelyn, please don't be difficult. I know it's not ideal, but where else would take you without board certification? At least here I can protect you."

Two senior nurses exchanged glances before one snapped, "You should be grateful! Most interns would kill for this opportunity."

"Indeed," added Dr. Cross, her lips pursed. "Without Lila's influence, you'd be lucky to get a position at a community clinic."

Evelyn met their stares without flinching. The fluorescent lights overhead cast sharp shadows across her angular features, emphasizing the stubborn set of her jaw. She'd spent years bending to others' expectations, but no more.

Lila's carefully constructed mask slipped for just a moment, revealing the venom beneath. "Evelyn, be reasonable. After everything you've put our family through—"

"Everything I've put you through?" Evelyn's laugh held no humor. "That's rich, coming from you."

The tension crackled like static before a storm. Around them, medical staff shifted uncomfortably, caught between loyalty to the hospital's darling and curiosity about this mysterious sister who dared challenge her.

###Chapter 52

A sudden commotion at the door shattered the standoff. A code blue alarm blared through the overhead speakers as a gurney burst into the hallway, surrounded by a frantic medical team.

"Crash cart! We need a crash cart now!"

Evelyn's training kicked in before conscious thought. She moved with practiced efficiency, grabbing gloves from a nearby dispenser. Her sharp eyes took in the patient's ashen complexion, the irregular EKG tracing, the telltale jugular vein distension.

"Cardiac tamponade," she said, more to herself than anyone else.

Lila's hand clamped down on her arm. "What do you think you're doing? You're not credentialed to—"

Evelyn shook her off. "That man is dying. Either help or get out of the way."

The challenge hung in the air between them - a gauntlet thrown down in front of the entire department. For the first time, uncertainty flickered across Lila's perfectly composed features.

Around them, the medical team froze, waiting to see which Sinclair sister would take charge. The cardiac monitor's relentless beeping counted down the seconds, each one precious, each one lost.

Evelyn didn't wait for permission. She reached for the pericardiocentesis tray, her movements sure and steady. "Somebody prep for emergency thoracotomy. And page Dr. Pierce - now."

The room erupted into motion, professionals responding to clear authority despite the unconventional circumstances. Only Lila remained still, her manicured nails digging into her palms as she watched her carefully constructed narrative unravel before her eyes.

The real question wasn't whether Evelyn could save the patient - it was what would happen when the dust settled, and Silvercrest General Hospital realized they had two Sinclair sisters, but only one true healer.

Evelyn let out a derisive laugh, her voice laced with icy amusement. "Who told you I needed her help to get into Grandview General Hospital?"

The words hung in the air, leaving Lila and the two doctors momentarily stunned into silence.

One of them recovered first, scoffing. "Excuse me? Do you honestly think Grandview General is some small-town clinic where anyone can waltz in and out as they please? Even Lila is only the director’s apprentice—not a full-fledged doctor. And you think you can just waltz in without connections?"

Lila’s lips pressed into a thin line, her earlier composure cracking. "Evelyn, ambition is good, but you should know your limits. Aiming for the impossible will only make you look foolish." Her voice sharpened with each word, her cheeks flushing with barely restrained frustration.

Evelyn had somehow secured a full-time position as a resident physician at Grandview General. How?

Lila’s face paled, then darkened with barely concealed fury. The words she had thrown at Evelyn moments ago now boomeranged back, mocking her.

Evelyn merely arched a brow, her smirk deepening. Was this Lila’s true face? The sweet, doting sister act crumbling under the weight of jealousy?

The other doctors exchanged uneasy glances. They had always seen Lila as the epitome of grace—protective, kind, the perfect older sister. But now, she stood there, openly belittling Evelyn in front of everyone, her tone dripping with venom.

Then again, could anyone blame her? Lila had spent a year at Grandview General without securing a permanent position, while Evelyn had somehow walked in and claimed one effortlessly. The injustice of it was enough to make anyone lash out.

Realizing the weight of her outburst, Lila quickly schooled her expression, forcing a softer tone. "Evelyn, I didn’t mean it like that. I was just… surprised. How did this happen?"

Before Evelyn could respond, Miranda Graves—Lila’s sharp-tongued ally—cut in. "Mr. Mercer, isn’t it hospital policy that all new hires must pass the internal exam? Those exams are held in January. It’s June now. The season is long over."

Trevor Mercer’s gaze flicked toward Evelyn, but before he could speak, another doctor interjected. "Mr. Mercer, we don’t usually allow visitors in this area. She’s only here because she’s Lila’s assistant."

Trevor’s brows lifted in surprise. "Lila’s assistant?"

Lila straightened, her confidence returning. "That’s right."

Trevor let out a quiet scoff before striding toward Evelyn. She suppressed a sigh. So much for keeping a low profile. With Sebastian Holloway’s assistant here, any chance of slipping under the radar was gone.

His voice was light, but his eyes were probing. "Already making friends, I see?"

###Chapter 53

Evelyn Hartley pressed her lips into a tight line, her silence more telling than any words could be. Unfazed, Trevor Mercer turned to the gathered staff and declared, "Allow me to formally introduce Dr. Evelyn Hartley. She will be joining us as a resident physician in the Cardiac Surgery Department, effective immediately. She’ll report directly to Deputy Director Vivian Cross."

Originally, Sebastian Holloway had intended for Evelyn to take on the role of attending physician, but she had declined, citing the grueling hours and clinical demands as too much for her preference. Reluctantly, Sebastian had agreed, placing her as a resident under Vivian’s supervision—though not without securing her promise to assist in surgeries when necessary.

A heavy silence blanketed the room after Trevor’s announcement, the tension so thick it could be cut with a scalpel.

"A resident?" Lila Sinclair’s voice sliced through the quiet, dripping with disdain. "She’s being hired as full-time staff?"

"Correct," Trevor replied smoothly, his tone leaving no room for argument.

"That’s impossible!" Lila burst out, her face twisting in disbelief. "Evelyn hasn’t even passed her medical licensing exams! She barely scraped through her bachelor’s degree with mediocre grades!"

The condescension from the senior female physicians was palpable, their whispers sharp with judgment. Evelyn’s patience was wearing thin, her fingers curling at her sides—but before she could retort, a voice called out from the doorway.

"Mr. Mercer, what brings you here?"

All eyes snapped toward the newcomer. It was Trevor Mercer, personal assistant to Sebastian Holloway, the hospital’s deputy director. His presence instantly shifted the energy in the room.

The doctor who had been berating Evelyn quickly smoothed her expression into one of deference, stepping forward with a syrupy smile. "Mr. Mercer, does Mr. Holloway have any new instructions for us?"

Trevor ignored her. His gaze swept the room before landing squarely on Evelyn.

"How did she even get in?" one of the doctors muttered, her tone laced with skepticism.

"Mr. Mercer," another chimed in, her voice sharp, "our hospital’s admission standards are notoriously strict—no exceptions for favoritism or shortcuts. Could you clarify this situation?"

Every pair of eyes in the room locked onto Trevor, waiting for his response.

Trevor’s jaw tightened at Lila’s accusations. The insinuation that Evelyn was unqualified—that she lacked credentials—was laughable. Clearly, Lila knew nothing about her younger sister’s true accomplishments.

Amidst the rising murmurs, Trevor exhaled sharply. Evelyn had deliberately kept her reputation under wraps. She didn’t want anyone knowing she was the acclaimed "Star" surgeon, personally headhunted by Sebastian Holloway from Chixdon Hospital. Now, her discretion had backfired spectacularly.

Trevor cleared his throat, his voice cutting through the tension. "Dr. Hartley’s circumstances are unique. Mr. Holloway arranged a specialized examination for her, which she passed with distinction. This has been approved by the director, and she is now officially part of our team."

###Chapter 54

Nathan leaned back in his chair, his fingers steepled. "Naturally, obtaining a medical license is a standard requirement."

The room plunged into silence, though the weight of unspoken skepticism lingered. To some, this reeked of blatant favoritism.

Once Trevor Mercer exited, the doctors returned to their tasks, though hushed whispers still slithered through the air. Lila Sinclair, her envy barely concealed beneath a thin veneer of politeness, sauntered toward Evelyn Hartley with a smile that didn’t touch her cold eyes.

"Evelyn," she began, her voice dripping with false sweetness, "why keep me in the dark about your new position? Here I was, offering you an assistant’s role like some charity case, not realizing you’d already climbed higher. You made me look like a fool."

Evelyn tilted her head, her expression serene. "I thought it’d be a nice surprise, Lila. Isn’t this wonderful news? Aren’t you happy for me?"

Lila’s spine stiffened before she forced a nod. "Of course, I’m thrilled for you! I just never imagined you’d land something so prestigious so quickly after returning. Sebastian Holloway must’ve been very impressed to arrange a special exam just for you. Quite the accomplishment—unprecedented, really."

Her words, though seemingly complimentary, carried the sharp edge of insinuation—that Evelyn had used connections rather than merit.

Evelyn’s smile didn’t waver. "Oh, Sebastian and I are quite close. He mentioned how often you and Victor visited his home, begging for leniency during your exams. He asked me to remind you—do it again, and he’ll have no choice but to dismiss you from Grand Oaks General."

The office froze.

Every head swiveled toward Lila, whose face had gone ashen. The revelation shattered her carefully crafted image of the self-made prodigy who despised nepotism. Now, the hypocrisy lay bare.

A flush of humiliation crept up Lila’s neck. She hadn’t expected Sebastian to share such details with Evelyn—let alone for Evelyn to weaponize them publicly.

Before Lila could retaliate, Evelyn stood, smoothing her coat. "Excuse me. I need to change." She strode toward the locker room, leaving a room crackling with tension.

The morning passed in icy isolation. Even Vivian Cross, Evelyn’s supposed mentor, treated her with frosty detachment.

Evelyn remained unbothered.

By noon, Leonard Grant called, inviting her to lunch. With a generous break ahead, she agreed and headed to the restaurant.

But when she pushed open the private dining room’s door, her steps faltered.

Nathan Black lounged on the sofa, his smirk lazy and knowing.

At that moment, her phone buzzed—Leonard’s name flashing on the screen.

...


?
###Chapter 55

Evelyn's phone buzzed in her hand. She glanced at the caller ID before answering. "Leonard?"

"Evelyn, I'm afraid something urgent has come up. I won't be able to join you and Nathan for lunch today. You two will have to go ahead without me," Leonard said, his voice laced with regret.

A flicker of resignation passed through Evelyn. "Alright," she murmured softly.

Hanging up, she stepped back into the private dining room. Nathan was already seated, his sharp gaze lifting to meet hers as she approached. "Leonard can't make it," she informed him. "He wants us to eat without him."

Nathan didn’t seem surprised. A slow, knowing smirk curved his lips as he leaned back in his chair. "How convenient. He’s certainly persistent in forcing us together."

Evelyn said nothing, her expression unreadable.

Nathan chuckled darkly. "No response, Evelyn?"

Her lips pressed into a thin line before she turned to face him fully. Her voice was steady, unwavering. "There’s no need for your little tests. I had no idea about any of this. And Mr. Black, regardless of your father’s intentions—whether he’s trying to push us together or something else—it doesn’t change the outcome. We will get divorced."

Nathan studied her, his piercing gaze narrowing slightly. "Good. As long as we’re on the same page." His tone was smooth, but his eyes lingered, as if searching for any crack in her composure.

Silence settled between them as they ate, the clink of silverware the only sound in the room.

Eventually, Evelyn excused herself to the restroom.

On her way back, she nearly collided with Dylan Reeves and Serena Cole. Both froze, clearly not expecting to see her here.

Dylan’s eyes raked over Evelyn’s striking features, a familiar hunger flashing in his gaze. She was as breathtaking as ever. But the memory of how she had humiliated him last time flared his temper.

Evelyn barely spared them a glance, her expression cool and detached as she moved to walk past them.

Dylan’s irritation spiked at her indifference. "Ms. Hartley," he called out sharply, halting her steps.

She turned, her face impassive. "Yes, Mr. Reeves? Did you need something?"

His tone was mocking. "I heard you’re joining the Cardiac Surgery Department at Grandview General Hospital. Interesting choice."

Evelyn remained silent, her gaze steady.

Dylan smirked, crossing his arms. "Funny thing—my uncle happens to be the chief physician there. I asked him about you, and he said there’s no one named Hartley on staff. No Evelyn. No new hires matching your description." He tilted his head, satisfaction dripping from his words. "Care to explain that, Ms. Hartley?"


###Chapter 56

Evelyn's eyebrows shot up in surprise. She hadn't expected that the husband of Dylan's aunt was the head of the Cardiac Surgery Department at Grandview General Hospital.

"Really?" Evelyn responded with a faint, knowing smile.

Dylan and Serena exchanged glances, baffled by Evelyn's composed reaction. Both assumed she must be utterly shameless to remain so unruffled.

Serena pressed her lips together before speaking. "That can't be right. No one with the surname Caldwell or the name Evelyn? At the Caldwell family gathering, Mr. Caldwell himself announced that Ms. Caldwell was joining the Cardiac Surgery Department at Grandview General! Surely he wouldn’t lie about something like that?"

Dylan nodded in agreement. "Exactly. It was strange, so I looked into it. My uncle confirmed—no doctor or nurse by that name. Though, there is a caregiver named Caldwell."

Serena gasped dramatically, shaking her head. "A caregiver? That can't be!"

"Believe it or not, it's the truth," Dylan said coolly before turning to Evelyn. "So, Ms. Caldwell, care to explain what your real position at Grandview General is?"

Evelyn watched their synchronized performance with detached amusement, her lips curling into a scornful smile. "My employment at Grandview General and my role there—why is that any of your concern? Since when are we close enough for me to owe you an explanation?"

Dylan stiffened, caught off guard by her sharp retort.

After a beat, he scoffed. "Ms. Caldwell, does your defensiveness mean you're embarrassed about being caught in a lie? Imagine the scandal if people found out the Caldwells' goddaughter doesn’t actually work at Grandview General. What would that say about you—or the Caldwells?" His tone dripped with thinly veiled threat.

Evelyn let out a derisive laugh, as if he'd told a bad joke. "Oh, please. Go ahead, spread the word. See if I care."

Her defiance only deepened Dylan's scowl. Then, a smirk tugged at his lips. "Fine. Maybe you don’t mind being called a liar. But what about the scandal of seducing a married man?"

Evelyn tilted her head, feigning innocence. "A married man? You mean… Nathan?"

Dylan seized the opening. "So you admit it!"

Unnoticed by them, a middle-aged woman had been eavesdropping. At the mention of Nathan, her eyes gleamed with intrigue. Silently, she slipped away toward a private room at the end of the hall.

As she entered, a cheerful voice called out, "Beatrice! You're late! Three glasses as punishment!"

The room was filled with high-society women, all influential figures. Beatrice Waltham grinned as she took her seat. "Forgive my tardiness—I just overheard the juiciest gossip right outside!"

###Chapter 57

"What kind of gossip?" someone asked eagerly, leaning forward with undisguised curiosity.

Beatrice Waltham tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, her lips curling into a knowing smile as her gaze settled on one person in particular. "This little tidbit involves... Mrs. Olivia Sinclair."

The room instantly hushed, all eyes turning toward Olivia, who sat poised among them. Olivia didn’t so much as flinch. She merely lifted her chin, her expression cool. "Oh? Something about me?"

Beatrice nodded, her eyes gleaming. "Exactly."

"It concerns you and Mr. Marcus Donovan’s goddaughter, Evelyn Hartley."

"What do you mean by it involves Evelyn?" Ethan Caldwell, seated beside Olivia, cut in sharply. The atmosphere grew tense, every ear straining to catch Beatrice’s next words. After all, until now, Evelyn had only ever been spoken of in glowing terms.

Beatrice savored the attention, straightening her posture as a sly smirk played on her lips. "I had a chat with Dylan Reeves. His uncle, who happens to be the chief of Cardiac Surgery at Grandview General Hospital, told him... Well, there isn’t a single doctor or intern by the name Hartley—or even Donovan—in that department."

She paused, letting the weight of her words sink in before continuing, "And it’s not just the doctors—none of the nurses, either. But here’s the interesting part—there is a caregiver with the last name Donovan working there. Could that possibly be your goddaughter Evelyn, Mrs. Sinclair?"

"A caregiver? That can’t be right!" someone gasped, feigning shock.

"Absolutely preposterous," another murmured, though her eyes sparkled with scandalous delight.

"I overheard it myself in the hallway," Beatrice declared confidently, eager to cement the rumor. She had long resented Olivia, envying her marriage to Marcus, the respected head of the Donovan family, especially given Olivia’s well-known struggles with fertility. Beatrice, too, had faced similar struggles, but her husband had never let her forget it. Now, with the perfect opportunity to humiliate Olivia, she wasn’t about to let it slip away.

Yet, Olivia and Ethan remained unshaken, their expressions betraying nothing.

With false concern, Beatrice turned to Olivia, her voice dripping with faux sympathy. "Mrs. Sinclair, perhaps you could clarify this little... discrepancy?"

She gave a light, mocking laugh. "Of course, I’m sure you and Mr. Donovan would never deceive anyone. But could it be... your goddaughter has been less than truthful with you?"

Just then, Ethan spoke, his voice firm. "Evelyn hasn’t lied. She did start working in the Cardiac Surgery Department at Grandview General today."

Beatrice pressed a hand to her chest in mock surprise. "How strange! If that’s the case, why would the chief physician claim otherwise? Mr. Caldwell, perhaps it’s unwise to place such blind trust in her."

Her tone turned conspiratorial. "I fear her motives might not be as pure as you think."

###Chapter 58



At these words, Olivia Sinclair's expression turned to ice, her sharp gaze narrowing as she fixed Beatrice Waltham with a chilling stare. "Mrs. Waltham," she said, her voice dripping with frost, "I suggest you choose your accusations very carefully."

Beatrice feigned distress, pressing a hand to her chest. "Oh, my dear Mrs. Caldwell! Please don’t misunderstand—I’m only repeating what I’ve heard. And just before coming here, Dylan mentioned that your goddaughter has been involved with a married man!"

A woman seated beside Beatrice gasped dramatically. "Impossible! She’s entangled with a married man? You must be joking!"

Olivia’s interest sharpened at the mention of a "married man." She had a strong suspicion who they were referring to. A slow, knowing smile curved her lips. "Very well, Mrs. Waltham. Since you seem so certain, perhaps you’d care to enlighten us—who exactly is Evelyn supposedly involved with?"

Beatrice leaned in, lowering her voice conspiratorially. "The man in question is none other than Nathan Black, of the illustrious Black family! Everyone knows Mr. Black is married, don’t they?"

At this revelation, both Olivia and Ethan Caldwell’s frowns vanished. Their expressions smoothed into calm indifference. Sensing the skeptical glances around her, Beatrice hastily added, "I swear it’s the truth! If you don’t believe me, just step outside and see for yourselves. Mrs. Caldwell’s goddaughter is right there in the hallway with Dylan."

The women exchanged uncertain glances, torn between curiosity and the risk of offending Olivia. Noticing their hesitation, Olivia smirked inwardly. "Well then," she said, rising gracefully from her seat, "let’s go and settle this ourselves."

Encouraged by her lead, the group followed her out of the room. As they turned the corner into the hallway, they found Evelyn Hartley, Dylan Reeves, and Serena Cole standing together.

At that moment, Dylan was speaking in a condescending tone, "Ms. Hartley, you must realize Nathan is already taken. I’d advise you to keep your distance. Being labeled a homewrecker—or worse, a mistress—wouldn’t just tarnish your reputation. It would humiliate the entire Caldwell family."

He paused for effect before adding, "Surely you wouldn’t want whispers spreading that Mr. Caldwell’s goddaughter is chasing after another woman’s husband?"

Evelyn burst into laughter, the sound bright and unbothered. It had been a while since she’d encountered someone so shameless. Turning to Serena, she arched a brow playfully. "Perhaps those warnings would be better directed at your cousin."

Dylan’s face darkened instantly. Just as he opened his mouth to retort, a sharp click echoed through the hallway. The door to the adjacent private room swung open. From his angle, all Nathan could see was Evelyn standing near the doorway.

Nathan’s brow furrowed slightly. "Why are you still out here?" he asked, his voice calm but firm. "Come inside."

At his words, Dylan and Serena’s expressions shifted visibly. Dylan stepped forward, only to freeze when he spotted Nathan standing inside the room. "Nathan?" he blurted out, stunned. "Is that really you? You’re having dinner with Ms. Hartley?"

###Chapter 59

Nathan appeared momentarily stunned by Dylan’s interruption but swiftly composed himself. "Nathan..." Serena stepped closer, her voice dripping with tenderness as her eyes shimmered with concern. "Are you and Ms. Hartley—"

Nathan remained silent. A sharp pang of jealousy twisted in Dylan’s chest. Squaring his shoulders, Dylan spoke up, his voice firm. "Nathan, you promised Serena that once you divorced that woman, you’d marry her. So why are you here, dining alone with Ms. Hartley? What exactly is going on between you two?"

"Dylan."

A commanding voice cut through the tension. All eyes turned as Ethan Caldwell emerged from the shadows, his expression unreadable but his presence undeniable. Flanking him were several high-society elites, their gazes sharp with curiosity.

"Ethan, Olivia," Evelyn acknowledged, surprise flickering in her tone.

Ethan gave Evelyn a brief nod before fixing Dylan with a piercing stare. "Since you’re well aware Nathan is still married, why encourage your cousin’s advances? What’s your game?"

Dylan’s jaw tightened under Ethan’s scrutiny. "Nathan and my cousin were meant for each other. Circumstances tore them apart, but their feelings remain. Besides—"

Ethan cut him off sharply. "That was then. Nathan is a married man now. If your cousin continues chasing after him, she’s nothing more than a homewrecker."

The words struck Serena like a slap. Her lips pressed into a thin line, anger and humiliation warring inside her. If only Evelyn weren’t in the picture, she wouldn’t be reduced to this. Tears welled in her eyes as she turned to Nathan, her voice trembling. "Nathan... do you really see me that way? As the other woman?"

Nathan frowned slightly but said nothing. Dylan bristled, glaring at Ethan. "That’s rich, coming from you, Mr. Caldwell. While you’re busy slandering my cousin, maybe you should take a closer look at your goddaughter’s behavior! She’s the one cozying up to a married man. Just the other day, Serena and I saw her leaving Nathan’s office. And now, here they are, dining together. If anyone’s the homewrecker, it’s Evelyn!"

He paused, then delivered the final blow. "And let’s not forget—you claimed Evelyn was joining the Cardiac Surgery Department at Grandview General. But my uncle, the chief physician there, confirmed there’s no Evelyn Hartley—or anyone with the last name Caldwell—on staff. So, what’s your excuse for that lie?"

Beatrice Waltham, watching the scene unfold with amusement, leaned toward Olivia with a smirk. "Mrs. Caldwell, your goddaughter isn’t making a very good impression."

###Chapter 60

The whispers in the room grew louder as the tension thickened. Meeting alone with a married man like Nathan—imagine the scandal if this got out!

Evelyn stood frozen, her heart pounding. Olivia Sinclair, usually composed, shot Beatrice Waltham a glare so icy it could have frozen the champagne in her glass. A nearby socialite, sensing the brewing storm, discreetly tugged at Beatrice’s sleeve, urging her to stop. Beatrice complied outwardly but smirked inwardly, amused by Olivia’s obvious discomfort.

Across the room, Ethan Caldwell let out a derisive laugh after hearing Dylan Reeves’ self-righteous speech. He fixed Dylan with a look of pure disdain. "Who told you Evelyn’s last name was Reeves? And who claimed Evelyn was even her real name?"

Dylan and Serena Cole exchanged confused glances. What was Ethan implying?

"Evelyn, come here," Olivia called, breaking her silence for the first time. Evelyn moved gracefully through the crowd of elite women, stopping beside Olivia. Olivia gently adjusted a loose strand of Evelyn’s hair before turning to Nathan, her voice cool and deliberate. "Nathan, perhaps you’d like to properly introduce her to everyone?"

The room fell silent, all eyes shifting to Nathan. He met their gazes without flinching, his voice steady and firm. "She is Evelyn Black."

The moment the words left his lips, the impact was immediate. Dylan and Serena looked as if they’d been struck by lightning, their faces draining of color. They stared at Nathan, mouths agape, unable to form a coherent response.

After a long, suffocating silence, Serena finally found her voice, though it trembled. "Nathan… what did you just say? Who is she?"

Nathan didn’t hesitate. "She is my wife. Evelyn."

The revelation sent shockwaves through the room. Not just Dylan and Serena, but every socialite present was rendered speechless. Olivia’s goddaughter—Evelyn—was the elusive Mrs. Black? It was too unbelievable to process.

Beatrice’s smile turned brittle, her shock evident. "That’s impossible! How can she be Evelyn?"

Dylan exploded, his voice laced with disbelief. He turned to Evelyn, taking in her undeniable beauty. To him, she bore no resemblance to the woman he remembered. How could this poised, elegant figure be the same Evelyn he had once dismissed?

Blinded by denial, Dylan blurted out, "Evelyn was plain, overweight, with that hideous birthmark on her face. There’s no way this woman is her!"

Olivia’s and Ethan’s expressions darkened instantly. "Mind your words, Dylan," Ethan snapped, his tone glacial. After a beat, he added mockingly, "What? Did you expect Evelyn to stay exactly as you remembered her? Birthmarks fade, people change—or is this your pathetic way of coping with the fact that she never wanted you?"

Dylan’s face burned with humiliation. He opened his mouth to retort, but no words came. The truth was too bitter to swallow. Years ago, he had looked down on Evelyn, finding her beneath his notice. Yet here he was, hopelessly infatuated with her now. The irony was cruel.

Before Dylan could muster a response, Ethan delivered the final blow. "Why don’t you call your uncle now, Mr. Reeves, and confirm whether there’s a Dr. Evelyn Hartley in the Cardiac Surgery Department at Grandview General?"

Dylan clenched his jaw so hard it ached. He had nothing left to say.

###Chapter 61

At that precise moment, Evelyn Hartley glided forward with effortless grace, stopping mere inches away from Serena Cole. Their gazes locked in a silent battle of wills. Serena couldn't tear her eyes away from the woman who had undergone such a breathtaking transformation. She had always harbored a secret envy of Evelyn’s beauty, but now, seeing her standing there—radiant, confident, and draped in elegance—that envy burned hotter than ever.

How had this happened? The same Evelyn whom Dylan Reeves had once mocked as plain and unremarkable now stood before her, poised and untouchable. Worse yet, she was the goddaughter of Marcus Donovan, a man whose influence could topple empires.

Serena had never considered Evelyn a true rival for Nathan Black’s affections. Even after learning of their marriage, she had dismissed it as a temporary arrangement. But now… Now, Evelyn was a force to be reckoned with.

Evelyn tilted her chin slightly, her voice smooth as silk yet laced with steel. "Miss Cole, whatever history you shared with Nathan—whatever affection he may have once held for you—those days are over. I am his wife now. And until our marriage is dissolved, I expect you to respect those boundaries. Understood?"

Without waiting for a response, she turned on her heel and strode toward Olivia Sinclair, leaving Serena seething in her wake.

Evelyn hadn’t planned on engaging in petty confrontations, especially with divorce looming. But after Dylan and Serena’s blatant attempts to humiliate her, she refused to hold back any longer.

Nathan watched her walk away, a smirk tugging at his lips.

Evelyn joined Olivia in the secluded circle of elite women, where the atmosphere had shifted dramatically.

"Mrs. Sinclair, you’ve been keeping secrets!" one woman teased. "Who knew your goddaughter was the illustrious Mrs. Black? Such discretion!"

"Indeed, Mrs. Waltham," another chimed in, casting a pointed glance at Beatrice. "Perhaps next time, you should verify your accusations before spreading them. We nearly believed your slander."

Beatrice’s face flushed with humiliation. She forced a brittle smile. "My mistake. I’ll be more careful in the future."

Evelyn turned to the ladies with a gracious smile. "Ladies, I’d appreciate it if we kept this matter private." With her marriage nearing its end, she saw no reason to invite further scrutiny.

"Of course, Evelyn. Your secret is safe with us."

"You have our word."

Evelyn inclined her head. "Thank you. I truly appreciate it."

Meanwhile, in another private suite, tension crackled in the air.

###Chapter 62

"Dylan, is that woman really Evelyn?" Nathan asked, his voice laced with disbelief as he struggled to process the revelation.

Serena blinked rapidly, her gaze darting between the two men before settling on Nathan, silently demanding an explanation.

"Yes," Nathan replied coolly, his tone indifferent.

An uneasy silence descended upon the room.

Dylan and Serena exchanged glances, their expressions mirroring their shock. After a tense pause, Dylan cleared his throat. "How did she lose all that weight? Plastic surgery? And that birthmark—it's completely gone?"

Nathan took a deliberate sip of his coffee before answering. "My father mentioned Evelyn's weight issues stemmed from a hormonal imbalance caused by childhood medication. As for the birthmark, it faded naturally during her second year abroad."

A sudden realization flickered in Dylan’s eyes. "At the Caldwell family gala—you knew it was her, didn’t you?"

"Obviously," Nathan said with a shrug. Despite her past appearance, Evelyn had always possessed striking bone structure. That night, he had recognized her immediately.

"No wonder!" Dylan burst out, slapping his palm against his thigh. That explained why Nathan had been so possessive, cutting off any chance of Dylan pursuing her. So, the stunning woman was Evelyn all along!

Meanwhile, Serena sat frozen, her face pale. The thought of Nathan spending another month with this breathtaking version of Evelyn sent waves of panic through her.

Her voice trembled as she locked eyes with Nathan. "Nathan… after this month, you’ll still go through with the divorce, right?"

"Obviously," Nathan answered without hesitation. Then, softening slightly, he added, "My decision to divorce her was never about her looks."

Dylan seized the opportunity to reassure Serena. "Exactly. Nathan only married her—I mean, Evelyn—to protect you. Now that you’re back together, there’s no reason for him to stay with her."

He caught himself before calling Evelyn "ugly" again—now, the word felt absurd. Turning back to Serena, he added, "Don’t worry. The divorce is happening. After that, Nathan will marry you, just like he promised."

Serena searched Nathan’s face for confirmation, but he abruptly set down his fork and stood. "I need to get back to the office. Work can’t wait." Without another word, he strode out, leaving them behind.

Serena watched him go, her stomach twisting as she bit her lip. Dylan sighed and stood as well. "Come on, let’s head back."

During the drive to the Thornton estate, Serena couldn’t contain her anxiety any longer. "Dylan… what if Nathan changes his mind now that Evelyn looks like that? What if he falls for her?"

Dylan kept his eyes on the road but smirked. "Relax. If Nathan were the type to be swayed by looks alone, would he have ever chosen you in the first place?"

###Chapter 63

Serena was momentarily stunned into silence by Dylan's words. Yet, she couldn't deny the truth in them—Nathan's past admirers had always been the kind of women society deemed flawless, the kind she could never measure up to.

Despite Dylan's reassurances, unease coiled in her stomach like a restless serpent. They returned to the Thornton estate, a place Serena frequented so often she practically had her own wing.

Dinner that evening started pleasantly enough, the air filled with light chatter and the clinking of silverware. Then, like a sudden storm, Gregory Thornton's phone rang.

Gregory answered mid-bite, his expression shifting from relaxed to thunderous in seconds. His voice boomed across the dining room. "What did you just say?"

The table fell silent. Every pair of eyes locked onto Gregory as he shot to his feet, his knuckles whitening around his phone. "What the hell is going on?" he barked before storming out.

Cassandra, ever composed, gestured for everyone to continue eating. But Dylan didn’t touch his food, his frown deepening as he watched his father disappear down the hall.

Gregory returned moments later, his face dark with fury.

"What happened?" Cassandra asked, her voice steady.

Gregory’s glare landed on Dylan like a guillotine. "What the hell did you do today, Dylan?"

Dylan stiffened.

Cassandra interjected smoothly, "Gregory, explain yourself. What’s going on?"

Gregory exhaled sharply. "Our company was this close to finalizing a multi-million-dollar resort deal with the Donovans. Contracts were ready to sign. Then, just now, Marcus Donovan’s assistant called—they’re pulling out. No explanation, just that I should ask Dylan."

His voice dropped to a dangerous growl. "So, Dylan. What did you do to piss off the Donovans?"

Dylan and Serena exchanged stunned looks. The Donovans had acted fast—proof of just how much Evelyn meant to them.

Trapped, Dylan confessed everything—the confrontation, the insults, Evelyn’s true identity.

Gregory’s face turned crimson. He slammed his fist on the table, making the china rattle. "Have you lost your damn mind? Everyone knows how protective Marcus and Olivia are of their goddaughter! And you targeted her?"

Dylan stayed silent. Now that he knew "Evelyn" was actually the Evelyn Hartley, her hostility made sense. That dinner where she’d humiliated him? Payback. But with Cassandra present, he couldn’t exactly admit to his past misdeeds.

Then Serena spoke up, her voice soft but firm. "Uncle Gregory, this is my fault. Dylan was defending me. He didn’t mean to offend her."

She explained the misunderstanding, including Evelyn’s hidden identity.

Gregory and Cassandra stared at them, stunned. After a long silence, Gregory gritted out, "Tomorrow, both of you are coming with me to apologize to the Donovans. And you will make this right with Evelyn Hartley."

###Chapter 64

With a reluctant sigh, Nathan gave in, knowing he had no other options. The once peaceful family dinner had turned tense, the air thick with unspoken words. Gregory Thornton barely touched his meal before pushing his plate away and storming upstairs without another word.

Dylan Reeves clenched his fists, frustration simmering beneath his skin. He felt wronged, angry—but most of all, trapped.

Meanwhile, at the Black family estate, Evelyn Hartley had already eaten before arriving home. She spent a few minutes chatting with Leonard Grant in the living room before retreating to her room.

Stepping into the dimly lit space, she flicked on the lights, gathered fresh clothes, and headed to the bathroom. When she emerged later, skin still damp from her shower, she froze at the sight of Nathan lounging on the sofa, his eyes fixed on the television.

Evelyn’s expression tightened, but she said nothing, moving instead to her vanity. As she settled into the chair, Nathan’s deep, mocking voice cut through the silence.

"Evelyn, you’re quite the hypocrite, aren’t you?"

Her fingers stilled around the bottle of serum. Slowly, she turned toward him, irritation sharpening her gaze. "Nathan, are you seriously starting this now?"

He rose from the sofa, a smirk playing on his lips as he closed the distance between them. "You were so righteous before—claiming that since the divorce papers were signed, we were officially over. That whatever happened between Serena and me was none of your business." His eyes gleamed with amusement. "And yet, today, you warned her to stay away from me because I’m still technically married. Doesn’t that make you a liar?"

Evelyn’s lips pressed into a thin line. She had felt that way—once. But things had changed. Why should she make things easier for Serena when the woman was clearly trying to sabotage her?

Fueled by defiance, Evelyn stood, meeting Nathan’s gaze head-on. "Yes, I said that. But I’ve reconsidered." Her voice was cool, deliberate. "Once the divorce is finalized, you and Serena can do whatever you want. But until then?" She tilted her chin up. "You don’t get to parade her around like some trophy. And for the record, I said it to your face today—no secrets, no games. I’d say that’s pretty damn direct."

Nathan let out a low, humorless laugh. He hadn’t expected that response. She was sharper than he gave her credit for. And despite his outward irritation, something inside him flickered with satisfaction. He’d always suspected her indifference was an act.

Raising a brow, he challenged her. "And what if I ignore your little warning?"

Evelyn scoffed, turning back to her vanity. "Then go ahead. Try me."

Nathan watched her for a moment longer, an unreadable smile tugging at his lips before he disappeared into the walk-in closet. Silence settled between them, heavy but not uncomfortable.

Evelyn went to bed early that night, and Nathan followed after finishing some work. The quiet was shattered hours later when a shrill ringtone pierced the darkness. Nathan frowned, reaching for his phone on the bedside table. The caller ID made his jaw tighten.

He answered. "Hello?"

###Chapter 65

The phone's shrill ring shattered the silence of the night. Nathan Black stirred, his hand fumbling for the device on the nightstand. The caller ID flashed Serena Cole. He swiped to answer, his voice rough with sleep.

"Serena?"

"Nathan, I—" A fit of coughing interrupted her. Her voice, usually so poised, was now fragile and strained. "I'm sorry to call so late, but I don't feel well. Could you come over? Please?"

Nathan sat up, the sheets pooling around his waist. "You're sick? I'll call an ambulance."

"No!" The refusal was sharp, desperate. "I hate hospitals. I just—I need you here."

Silence stretched between them, thick and heavy. On the other end, Serena exhaled shakily, then coughed again. "Never mind. It's nothing serious. Just an old problem that flares up sometimes. I can manage. Go back to sleep."

But she didn’t hang up.

Nathan’s jaw tightened. After a beat, he said, "I’ll be there in twenty minutes."

A soft, relieved sigh. "I’ll wait."

The call ended. Nathan swung his legs over the edge of the bed, the cool air of the room brushing against his skin. He reached for the lamp, flooding the space with warm light.

Evelyn Hartley, already awake, propped herself up on one elbow. Her dark hair tumbled over her shoulder as she studied him, her gaze sharp despite the late hour. "Where are you going?"

Nathan didn’t look at her as he pulled on a shirt. "Out."

"To see Serena?"

His fingers stilled on the buttons. "She’s unwell. I’m just checking on her." The moment the words left his mouth, he frowned. Why was he explaining himself to her?

Evelyn’s lips curled into a knowing smile. "If she’s sick, shouldn’t she call a doctor? What are you going to do—wave a magic wand?"

Nathan shot her a glare. "Go back to sleep."

He strode to the closet, yanking out a jacket. When he turned, Evelyn was already dressed, slipping into her shoes with deliberate ease.

Nathan’s eyes narrowed. "What are you doing?"

Evelyn met his gaze, defiance sparking in her eyes. "I’m coming with you."

"Why?"

"Because," she said smoothly, "someone needs to make sure you don’t get played."

###Chapter 66

The drive to Serena’s penthouse was tense, the hum of the car’s engine the only sound between them. Nathan’s grip on the steering wheel was tight, his knuckles white. Evelyn watched him from the passenger seat, her expression unreadable.

"You don’t trust her," she said finally.

Nathan didn’t answer.

Evelyn smirked. "Interesting."

The elevator ride up was worse. The mirrored walls reflected their silence back at them—Nathan’s rigid posture, Evelyn’s casual lean against the railing. When the doors slid open, Serena was waiting in the doorway, wrapped in a silk robe, her face pale.

Her eyes flickered to Evelyn, surprise flashing before she masked it with a weak smile. "You brought company."

Nathan stepped forward. "You said you were sick."

Serena coughed delicately into her hand. "I am. But I didn’t expect…" Her gaze darted to Evelyn again.

Evelyn crossed her arms. "Don’t mind me. I’m just here to observe."

A beat of silence. Then Serena’s lips thinned. "How… thoughtful."

Nathan exhaled sharply. "Serena, what’s really going on?"

Serena’s eyes glistened. "I just needed you, Nathan. That’s all."

Evelyn snorted.

Nathan shot her a warning look before turning back to Serena. "If you’re sick, you need a doctor. Not me."

Serena’s fingers twisted in the fabric of her robe. "Since when do you deny me anything?"

Evelyn’s phone buzzed. She pulled it out, glanced at the screen, then smirked. "Well, this is awkward."

Nathan frowned. "What?"

Evelyn held up her phone. On the screen was a notification from a gossip blog—Serena Cole spotted clubbing last night, looking radiant as ever.

The timestamp? Three hours ago.

Serena’s face drained of color.

Nathan’s expression darkened. "Explain."

Evelyn pocketed her phone, her smile razor-sharp. "Like I said. Someone had to make sure you didn’t get played."

Evelyn responded with unshakable conviction, "Why shouldn’t I? Isn’t Miss Cole feeling ill? Perfect timing. I’d love to see for myself what’s so urgent that she requires another woman’s husband at this ungodly hour."

Nathan studied her, a flicker of amusement dancing in his gaze as he arched a brow and chuckled. "You’re jealous."

Evelyn’s expression remained unreadable. Jealous? Hardly. She wasn’t jealous—she was determined to dismantle Serena’s little game. Earlier that day, she had made it explicitly clear that Serena was to stay away from Nathan, yet here she was, summoning him under the cover of night. If that wasn’t a blatant provocation, then what was?

A cold smile curved Evelyn’s lips as she replied, "Believe what you want."

"Either way, I’m coming with you tonight."

Evelyn paused, her eyes sharpening with silent warning. "And if you refuse, I’ll simply inform your father about this little midnight rendezvous come morning."

Nathan’s expression darkened at her words, and he let out a derisive scoff. "Impressive, Evelyn. Resorting to threats now?"

Without another word, Evelyn turned on her heel and strode toward the door, tossing over her shoulder, "Let’s not keep Miss Cole waiting, Mr. Black."

Watching her retreating figure, Nathan exhaled sharply but chose not to argue further.

An hour later, the sleek silhouette of Nathan’s midnight-blue Bentley pulled to a stop in front of Serena’s residence. Together, Nathan and Evelyn stepped out of the car and ascended the steps to the front door. Nathan knocked firmly.

When the door swung open, Serena’s face lit up at the sight of him. "Nathan!" she exclaimed, her eyes sparkling with delight.

Just as she moved to greet him, her smile faltered abruptly as Evelyn stepped into view behind him. Serena froze, her expression flickering with shock before she quickly masked it with forced composure.

After an awkward beat, Serena managed a tight smile. "Mrs. Black, what a... surprise. To what do I owe the pleasure?"

Evelyn blinked, her long lashes fluttering as she offered a saccharine smile. "Miss Cole, I heard you weren’t feeling well, so I thought I’d accompany my husband to check on you. After all, it would be rather scandalous if word got out that a married man was visiting a single woman’s home alone so late at night, don’t you think?"

She paused briefly, her tone smooth and poised, then continued, "As Nathan’s wife, I simply wanted to ensure there are no... misunderstandings. Consider it a gesture of goodwill."

Serena’s face tightened, her throat working as she struggled to form a response. The last thing she had anticipated was Evelyn’s presence tonight.

Internally, Serena couldn’t deny that she had intended to provoke Evelyn by summoning Nathan at such an hour, hoping to assert her influence over him. Yet the fact that he had brought Evelyn along felt like a deliberate slap in the face—a silent but cutting rebuke to her schemes.

In that moment, a hot wave of humiliation washed over Serena, as if she’d been physically struck. The sight of Evelyn, composed and unshaken, only deepened the sting.

###Chapter 67

Noticing Serena's silence, Evelyn leaned in slightly, her voice dripping with false concern. "What's the matter, Miss Cole? Aren't you happy to see me?"

"Of course, I'm happy to see you," Serena replied, forcing a tight smile as she gestured for Nathan and Evelyn to enter. "Please, come in."

Once inside, Nathan's voice dropped to a husky murmur. "Serena, where does it hurt?"

"I have a fever," Serena whispered, her voice weak—playing her part while genuinely suffering from the rising heat in her body.

Evelyn stepped closer, pressing the back of her hand against Serena's forehead, holding it there for a beat too long. After a calculated pause, she withdrew her hand and said coolly, "It's not too high. Manageable."

She tilted her head slightly before adding, "Do you have any fever medication here, Miss Cole?"

Serena shook her head. "No, I don't."

Evelyn turned decisively to Nathan. "You should go to the pharmacy and get her something for the fever."

A flicker of irritation crossed Serena's face at Evelyn's commanding tone, but she bit back her words. Nathan hesitated for a moment before nodding and leaving without another word.

With Nathan gone, only Evelyn and Serena remained in the room. Evelyn maintained her composed facade, a faint smile playing on her lips as she asked, "No fever medicine? But surely you have ice packs?"

"Yes," Serena admitted reluctantly.

"That'll do," Evelyn said breezily. "Just wrap one in a towel and press it to your forehead. It should help bring your temperature down."

Serena exhaled softly before turning toward the kitchen. Minutes later, she returned, settling onto the couch and pressing the wrapped ice pack to her forehead.

Evelyn crossed the room with effortless grace, sinking into the armchair opposite Serena. She crossed her legs, the picture of elegance, a knowing smirk tugging at her lips. "It seems you didn't take my advice to heart, Miss Cole."

Serena's lashes fluttered, and she pressed her lips together before answering softly, "Mrs. Hartley, you misunderstand. I was alone, feverish, and terrified. Dylan always turns his phone off at night—I couldn't reach him. In that moment of panic, I didn’t know who else to call but Nathan."

Evelyn arched a brow, feigning innocence. "Is that so? You could have called an ambulance. Paramedics would have arrived quickly."

Serena lowered her gaze, her voice trembling with quiet sincerity. "You might not understand, but I've spent so much time in hospitals over the years because of my poor health. Those memories have left me with a deep fear of them. I avoid hospitals unless it's absolutely necessary."

Evelyn's smirk deepened internally, but outwardly, she adopted an expression of sympathy. She nodded slowly. "I see. Still, Miss Cole, Nathan isn't the right person to call. He's not a doctor—his presence alone won't cure you." She paused, then offered smoothly, "Here's an idea—let's exchange numbers. If you feel unwell again in the middle of the night, call me directly. As a doctor, I can help you immediately."

###Chapter 68

Evelyn retrieved her phone, fingers hovering over the contacts app as she prepared to add Serena’s number.

Serena’s polite smile tightened almost imperceptibly, though her voice remained smooth. "That won’t be necessary, Mrs. Black. But I appreciate the gesture."

Evelyn arched a brow, her lips curving into a knowing smirk. "Oh? Why the hesitation, Miss Cole?" Her tone dripped with playful challenge as she met Serena’s gaze. "Unless, of course, only Nathan’s attention can cure what ails you?"

For a fraction of a second, Serena’s carefully constructed composure cracked. A flicker of irritation crossed her features before she schooled them back into serenity.

"Absolutely not!" Serena replied swiftly, though the forced lightness in her voice betrayed her. She offered a practiced smile and extended her phone. "But since you insist, I’d be happy to exchange numbers. Here’s mine..."

Evelyn saved the contact and immediately dialed to verify it. The sharp ring of Serena’s phone echoed between them before she ended the call. "Perfect. Now, Miss Cole, if you ever feel unwell—day or night—don’t hesitate to call."

"Thank you, Mrs. Black," Serena said, her smile tight.

"My pleasure," Evelyn replied sweetly.

When Nathan returned with medication for Serena’s fever, he watched her swallow the pills before leaving with Evelyn.

From the window, Serena observed their retreating figures, her fingers curling into fists at her sides. She had underestimated Evelyn.

This wasn’t the timid woman she remembered. Evelyn was now a rival—sharp, cunning, and unafraid to fight for Nathan. If Serena didn’t act soon, she risked losing him completely.

A steely resolve hardened in her eyes.

The next morning, in the Cardiac Surgery Department of Grand Pines General Hospital, Evelyn assisted Deputy Chief Physician Vivian Cross during rounds. As they entered a patient’s room, Evelyn’s gaze landed on a poised middle-aged woman seated by the window.

The woman stood gracefully. "Dr. Cross."

"Mrs. Sharma," Vivian acknowledged with a nod.

Raj Patel, the patient in the bed, remained asleep. He was the man who had collapsed at Evelyn’s welcome banquet weeks ago. After discussing Raj’s condition and upcoming surgery with Priya, Vivian and her team moved on.

Once rounds concluded, Evelyn doubled back to Raj’s room alone. She knocked lightly before entering.

Priya looked up, surprise flickering across her face. "Is something wrong with my husband’s condition, Doctor?"

###Chapter 69

"It's me, Evelyn," Evelyn said, pulling off her surgical mask.

Nathan had always regarded Raj as a compassionate man with extraordinary skills. Both Raj and Priya had shown nothing but kindness and encouragement toward him. Though Evelyn had only interacted with the Patels occasionally during gatherings at the Grant estate, they had always treated her with respect. Never once had they judged her for her past or her appearance. When Nathan had been harsh with Evelyn, Priya had even reprimanded him for it. For these reasons, Evelyn held the Patel family in high esteem.

When Priya heard the name "Evelyn," her expression shifted instantly, surprise flashing across her features.

"You're Evelyn? You were the one who saved Raj that day?" Priya asked, clearly stunned. She hadn't expected that Marcus's goddaughter and Nathan's wife were the same person.

"Evelyn, you look so different now! I wouldn't have recognized you if you hadn't told me," Priya remarked.

Looking closer, Priya noticed that while Evelyn had lost weight and the dark mark on her face had vanished, her delicate features remained unchanged.

Seeing Priya's reaction, Evelyn smiled softly. At that moment, Priya grasped Evelyn's hand, her gratitude overflowing.

"Thank you, Evelyn. What you did for Raj was everything. If it weren’t for you, he might not have made it."

Evelyn shook her head modestly. "No thanks needed, Mrs. Patel. Any doctor would have done the same."

Just as Priya was about to say more, a sharp knock interrupted them.

"Come in," Priya called.

Evelyn and Priya both turned, surprised by who stepped through the door.

"Nathan, what brings you here?" Priya greeted warmly.

Nathan hesitated briefly, caught off guard by Evelyn's presence. His gaze flickered toward her before he stepped inside.

"I had some free time between meetings, so I thought I’d check on Mr. Patel," he said, though his attention lingered on Evelyn.

It was the first time Nathan had seen her like this—dressed in a white doctor’s coat, a stethoscope draped around her neck, her dark hair pulled into a loose bun. No makeup, just the natural glow of her skin and the quiet confidence of a woman who knew her worth.

Evelyn met his gaze for only a second before turning away. "Mrs. Patel, I should get back to my rounds. Excuse me."

Priya nodded. "Of course. Let’s have lunch soon—just us."

Evelyn agreed with a quick nod and slipped out, leaving Nathan standing there, watching her go.

###Chapter 70

Once Evelyn had left, Priya turned to Nathan and couldn’t hold back her thoughts. "Nathan, what in the world happened to Evelyn in these past three years? She’s changed so much."

Nathan shared a brief explanation about Evelyn’s childhood struggles with hormone medication.

"I see," Priya murmured, realization dawning on her face. She then fixed Nathan with a serious look. "Now that Evelyn is back, you should treasure her and make the most of your time together."

Nathan’s expression remained unreadable as he replied, "We’re actually planning to divorce."

Priya’s brows knitted together sharply. "Why? Is it because of that Serena?"

Nathan answered with deliberate calm. "Mrs. Sharma, you know exactly why I married Evelyn in the first place."

A flicker of unease crossed Priya’s face at his words.

After a brief silence, she sighed. "Even if your reasons were strategic at first, three years is a long time. It’s hard to believe there’s no real affection between you now. Besides, Evelyn has been nothing but devoted to you. You don’t find that kind of love every day, Nathan. You should cherish her."

She pressed her lips together before adding firmly, "Serena isn’t the right woman for you."

Nathan’s eyes narrowed as he studied Priya. "You’ve barely met Serena. What makes you so certain she isn’t right for me?" He let out a dry chuckle. "Or did my father say something about her to you?"

Priya shot him a disapproving glare. "Nathan! That’s your father you’re speaking of!"

She hesitated for a moment before softening her tone. "I may not know Serena well, but there’s something unsettling about her."

Nathan exhaled in mild exasperation. "Since when did you start judging people based on gut feelings?"

Caught off guard, Priya pursed her lips. "Trust me and your father. We only want what’s best for you. Serena isn’t it."

Nathan’s gaze darkened, his voice edged with finality. "I’m the only one who decides what’s best for me."

Eager to shift the conversation, he asked, "How is Mr. Patel doing now?"

Recognizing his unwillingness to discuss Serena further, Priya replied, "Raj is stable. His surgery is already scheduled."

"That’s good to hear," Nathan nodded, his tone lighter.

He stayed in Raj’s hospital room for another hour before his assistant called about an urgent company matter, forcing him to leave.

As he approached the elevator, a soft voice called out behind him. "Mr. Black..."

Nathan paused mid-step before turning around. His expression remained impassive as he recognized the person walking toward him.


###Chapter 71

Evelyn hurried toward Nathan, her face lighting up with a practiced smile. "Mr. Black, are you here to see Serena? I can take you to her."

Nathan regarded her with an icy stare. "Do you have something to say to me? Spit it out."

Though momentarily thrown by his frosty demeanor, Lila kept her smile in place, though it wavered slightly. "Actually, I wanted to ask a favor. Could you pass along a message to Serena for me? Even though she secured her position at Grandview General Hospital with the deputy director’s help, she should know her skills aren’t up to par. The hospital conducts strict monthly evaluations, and failing them could lead to termination. It would be humiliating for her to be fired."

She paused, pressing her lips together before continuing in a tone dripping with false concern. "Mr. Black, please tell Serena it might be better if she resigned voluntarily. That way, she could focus on improving her skills and maybe return later, more prepared. Relying on connections alone won’t keep her at Grandview General."

Nathan listened, his expression unreadable. Then, a faint smirk curled his lips, his eyes glinting with derision. "And what exactly are you implying?"

Lila faltered for a second before recovering. "Oh, nothing specific! I just hoped you could relay this message to Serena for me. That’s all."

"Really?" Nathan let out a low, humorless chuckle. "You and Serena work in the same hospital, yet you’re asking me to deliver this little warning? What am I, your personal messenger?"

His voice dropped to a dangerous timbre as he continued. He knew all too well how Evelyn, despite her kindness, had been manipulated by Lila—betrayed time and again by the sister who pretended to care while scheming behind her back.

Lila’s smile stiffened. After a beat, she sighed dramatically. "Serena won’t listen if it comes from me. But she’ll take it seriously if it’s from you, Mr. Black. She always listens to you."

Nathan’s lips twisted into a cold, mocking smile. "Miss Sinclair, don’t waste your concern on Evelyn. As long as she’s my wife, who would dare dismiss her?"

Lila’s eyes widened in shock, her carefully constructed mask slipping. She had assumed Nathan shared her disdain for Evelyn. But now…

Nathan looked at her with undisguised contempt. While he didn’t particularly care for Evelyn, he despised manipulation even more.

Lila’s transparent attempt to use him to undermine Evelyn only fueled his irritation. Seeing right through her ploy—her thinly veiled effort to tarnish Evelyn’s reputation and sway his opinion—Nathan felt nothing but disgust.

Without another word or even a glance in her direction, he turned and walked away. His imposing figure cut through the hallway with effortless authority, leaving Lila seething in his wake.

###Chapter 72

She had been the first to meet Nathan! So why had he chosen Evelyn, the plain-looking illegitimate child, over her?

At that moment, Lila couldn’t help but blame Diana for everything. If Diana hadn’t brought Evelyn into the Sterling family all those years ago, Evelyn would never have crossed paths with Nathan, let alone married him.

The thought made Lila clench her fists.

She would find a way to win Nathan back, no matter what it took.

Meanwhile, Evelyn was in her office, reviewing patient files when her phone buzzed. A small smile curved her lips as she recognized the caller ID. She answered, her voice smooth. "Hello?"

Olivia’s voice came through the line.

"Evelyn, the Thorntons reached out to Marcus. They want to apologize to you in person. What do you think?"

Evelyn wasn’t surprised. Given Marcus’s involvement, she had expected the Thorntons to react. She tapped her fingers lightly against her desk before responding, "Let them come. If they’re sincere, I’ll hear them out."

Olivia agreed. "I’ll arrange for them to meet you at noon, during your break."

"Perfect," Evelyn said.

At midday, Evelyn drove to the Caldwell estate. When she arrived, she found the Thorntons already waiting in the grand sitting room—Gregory, Dylan, and even Serena, all stiff with tension.

Gregory stood immediately as Evelyn entered, his tone deferential. "Mrs. Black."

Evelyn acknowledged him with a cool nod before taking a seat on the plush sofa.

Gregory wasted no time. "Mrs. Black, I deeply regret my son’s behavior. His words were inexcusable. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive him."

He shot Dylan a sharp look, prompting him to speak.

Dylan’s gaze was locked on Evelyn, his expression unreadable. Even now, he couldn’t reconcile the fact that Marcus Donovan’s goddaughter was the same woman he had once dismissed so easily.

Gregory’s voice snapped him back to reality. "Dylan."

Clearing his throat, Dylan stood. "Mrs. Black, my words that night were thoughtless and disrespectful. I sincerely apologize." His tone was contrite, though his jaw remained tight.

Evelyn studied him for a long moment before responding. "There’s no need for forgiveness, Mr. Reeves. Your words meant nothing to me."

The silence that followed was heavy. Gregory shifted uncomfortably. "Mrs. Black, is there anything we can do to make amends?"

Evelyn’s lips curved into a faint, knowing smile. "Actually, there is."

The room tensed.

She leaned forward slightly, her voice soft but deliberate. "I want Dylan to publicly retract every insult he’s ever directed at me. In front of the same people who heard them."

Dylan’s face paled.

Gregory hesitated only a second before nodding. "Consider it done."

Evelyn rose gracefully. "Then we’re finished here."

As she turned to leave, she caught the flicker of resentment in Dylan’s eyes.

Good.

Let him choke on his pride.

###Chapter 73

The game was far from over.


Gregory Thornton's expression brightened at Evelyn's words. Just as he was about to respond, she added, "He really isn't worth my time. Worrying over every little thing from unimportant people would be exhausting."

Dylan Reeves' face darkened instantly. Unimportant?

Gregory's jaw tightened, but he suppressed his irritation, remembering their purpose for being there. He turned to Olivia Sinclair with a hopeful smile. "Mrs. Sinclair, since Mrs. Black holds no grudge against Dylan, perhaps we can discuss reviving our business partnership?"

"Mr. Thornton," Olivia replied coolly, "Evelyn's forgiveness comes from her kindness, not because this matter should be overlooked. Your son accused her of seducing a married man without proof! If we ignore this, others might think it's acceptable to disrespect her."

Her gaze hardened as she continued, "As for your proposal, consider it rejected."

The shock on Gregory and Dylan's faces was immediate. Before Gregory could respond, Serena Cole, who had remained silent until now, spoke up.

"Mrs. Sinclair, Mrs. Black, please accept my apology as well. I share responsibility in this matter. Could you show some leniency toward the Thorntons? I'm willing to take full accountability."

Her voice was soft but firm.

Olivia almost laughed. She looked at Serena with disdain. "You? I doubt you have any right to ask for leniency. Miss Cole, there’s one simple thing you can do—stay away from Evelyn’s husband. As we’ve established, Nathan is married. Your closeness to him might give people the wrong idea. Wouldn’t that be… inappropriate?"

She threw Dylan’s earlier accusation back at Serena with a smirk.

Serena’s expression froze. Dylan, visibly agitated, cut in, "Mrs. Sinclair, you don’t understand the full story! Nathan and Serena were once deeply in love! If not for—"

"Once being the key word," Olivia interrupted sharply. "Why dwell on the past?"

Evelyn couldn’t help but laugh. She tilted her head, a mocking smile playing on her lips. "Even if they were together, that’s long over. Now, Nathan is married. Yet, Miss Cole called him late last night, asking him to come over. Doesn’t that seem… questionable?"

Olivia’s eyes widened in shock. "What? Evelyn, did that really happen?"

Not just Olivia, but Gregory and Dylan also looked stunned. Dylan shot Serena a glance, his expression resigned. He knew exactly why she had done it.

With a sharp bang, Olivia slammed her palm on the coffee table, fury flashing in her eyes. "This is completely unacceptable!" She turned to Gregory, her voice icy. "Mr. Thornton, you need to control your son and niece better. As for any business between our families—forget it."

"Mrs. Sinclair, I just wanted to—"

But Olivia had already dismissed him with a wave of her hand.

###Chapter 74

Before Gregory could finish, Olivia cut him off sharply, "I'm rather occupied at the moment, so I'll have to ask you to leave now." Recognizing the steel in Olivia's tone, Gregory realized further negotiation was pointless. His expression darkened as he reluctantly ushered Dylan and Serena out.

The moment they stepped into the car, Gregory slammed the door shut with a resounding bang, making Dylan and Serena stiffen in their seats, barely daring to breathe. Once settled, Gregory turned to Serena, his voice icy. "You knew we were here to reconcile with Evelyn, yet you contacted Nathan last night. Were you deliberately trying to cause trouble for her?"

His gaze hardened like flint. "Or is it that you only care about yourself? Do you even consider the consequences your actions might bring upon the rest of us?" His words were razor-sharp.

Serena paled, her hands trembling as she rushed to explain. "No, that’s not it at all! I was feeling terribly ill last night. With my mother away in Soling and Dylan unreachable, I had no choice but to ask Nathan for help. I just needed him to bring me some medicine." She paused, swallowing hard. "Please believe me. I never intended to cause any trouble for Evelyn."

Dylan jumped to her defense. "Father, Serena wouldn’t do something like that intentionally. You know her."

Gregory’s expression remained stern. After a tense silence, he issued a warning.

"Remember this—Evelyn isn’t the same person she was three years ago. The way the Caldwell family stands behind her now speaks volumes about their regard for her. From this moment on, you will both keep your distance and avoid stirring up any trouble for her. Understood?"

Then, as if struck by a sudden thought, he added, "And as long as Evelyn and Nathan are married, Serena, you are to stay away from Nathan. No exceptions."

At his words, Serena’s face drained of all color.

She bit her lip, remaining silent. Dylan, however, looked bewildered. "Father, you were the one who always supported Serena being with Nathan! Besides, if they married, it would benefit our family!"

Gregory’s reply was chillingly calm. "Are Serena and Nathan married right now?"

He had once encouraged their relationship because it cost the Thornton family nothing—in fact, it would have been advantageous had Serena married Nathan. But things had changed. Nathan’s wife now had the full backing of the Caldwell family. Gregory knew that if Serena entangled herself with Nathan while he was still married, it would spell disaster for the Thorntons. The Caldwells would not tolerate such a scandal, and the Thorntons would bear the brunt of their wrath.

Dylan faltered, but then insisted, "Nathan said he’ll divorce Evelyn in a month and marry Serena afterward."

Gregory had no patience left. "We’ll discuss it after the divorce is finalized." He had no desire to hear another word from either of them. Turning to the driver, he snapped, "Drive!"

Dylan fell silent, the tension in the car thick enough to suffocate.

###Chapter 75

At the Caldwell family estate, Olivia Sinclair was fuming, her fingers curling into tight fists. "Serena Cole has no dignity left!"

Evelyn Hartley gently rubbed Olivia's shoulder, her voice soothing. "Don't let her get to you, Olivia. I didn’t let her walk all over me."

Then, Evelyn recounted the events of the previous night. By the time she finished, Olivia’s anger had cooled slightly.

"You handled that perfectly, Evelyn! That’s exactly how you should deal with women like her." Olivia’s tone was firm. "Even if you’re divorcing Nathan in a month, you’re still his wife right now. You have every right to stand your ground. Why let anyone disrespect you? You hold the moral high ground—there’s nothing to fear."

Evelyn smiled faintly. "That’s what I thought too."

"Good. That’s the right mindset." Olivia nodded approvingly.

After their conversation, Evelyn left the estate and returned to the hospital to continue her shift. Midway through her rounds, her phone buzzed. The caller ID flashed Grace Monroe.

"Evelyn, could you come by after work? I’d love to see you at the Sterling mansion," Grace’s voice was warm, almost pleading.

Evelyn hesitated, pressing her lips together before answering. "I’d prefer not to go back there right now. Let’s meet at Vera Vis instead."

A brief silence stretched between them. Then, realization struck Evelyn, and she let out a cold laugh. "This isn’t your idea, is it? Victor put you up to this."

Grace sighed. "Yes, your father asked me to call you. But I do miss you, Evelyn."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Fine. Tell him I’ll be there tonight." She hung up before Grace could respond.

She knew exactly why her father wanted to see her. The memory of publicly calling out Lila Sinclair’s mistake at the hospital flashed in her mind. No doubt, Lila had already run to Victor, twisting the story. A smirk tugged at Evelyn’s lips. Let them try.

Later, as she changed in the locker room, her phone rang again. The name on the screen made her eyebrows lift in surprise. She answered with a casual, "Hello?"

A deep, icy voice responded, "I’m waiting for you in the parking lot at Grandview General."

"Come down now." It was Nathan.

Evelyn frowned. "Why are you here?"

Nathan’s tone was clipped. "My father insists I accompany you to the Sterling estate."

That caught her off guard. Earlier, Leonard Grant had invited her to dinner, and she’d mentioned her plans to visit the Sterlings. He hadn’t said a word about Nathan joining her.

"You have ten minutes," Nathan said abruptly, ending the call before she could reply.

###Chapter 76

Evelyn hastily changed her outfit, grabbed her purse, and rushed to the parking lot. Spotting Nathan’s sleek black car, she yanked the door open and slid into the passenger seat. The moment she shut the door, the engine roared to life, and they sped off.

As the city blurred past the windows, Evelyn turned to Nathan. "Just drop me off at the Sterling estate. You don’t have to stay. I won’t tell Leonard you were there."

Nathan’s grip on the steering wheel tightened, his brows knitting together. "Even if you don’t say a word, my father will find out. You know how he is."

Evelyn bit her lip, considering. Leonard’s obsession with pushing them together was no secret. She sighed and fell silent for the rest of the ride.

When they arrived at the Sterling mansion, they stepped out together. Victor Sterling, sprawled on the living room sofa, shot up like a spring the moment the door opened. His face twisted in fury as he stormed toward Evelyn. "You ungrateful little—!"

His tirade died in his throat when he noticed Nathan standing beside her. Grace, trailing behind Victor, froze mid-step, her eyes widening at the sight of Nathan. Then, with practiced ease, she plastered on a bright smile. "Evelyn! Mr. Black! What a lovely surprise!"

Victor swallowed hard, his demeanor shifting instantly. "M-Mr. Black! To what do we owe the pleasure?"

The irony wasn’t lost on Evelyn. Despite being Nathan’s father-in-law, Victor still addressed him with stiff formality, his tone dripping with deference. Knowing Nathan’s indifference toward Evelyn, Victor treaded carefully around him.

Nathan’s lips curled into a faint, unreadable smile. "I’m here to have dinner with Evelyn."

Victor’s face lit up with exaggerated enthusiasm. "Of course, of course! Please, make yourself at home!" He practically bowed as he ushered Nathan further inside.

Once seated, Nathan turned to Victor, his tone deceptively light. "You seemed to have something urgent to say to Evelyn earlier. What was it?"

Victor paled, his mouth opening and closing like a fish out of water.

Just then, footsteps echoed from the staircase.

"Dad, is Evelyn back?" Lila’s honeyed voice floated down.

She descended gracefully, her smile faltering for a split second when she spotted Nathan beside Evelyn. A flicker of something dark passed through her eyes before she recovered, her expression melting into warm delight. "Evelyn! Nathan! What a wonderful surprise!"

Her performance was flawless, but Evelyn didn’t miss the way Lila’s fingers twitched at her sides.

###Chapter 77

The air in the Sterling dining room was thick with unspoken tension.

Lila took her seat across from Evelyn, her smile never wavering as she engaged Nathan in polite conversation. "Nathan, I heard BergWind just secured the Montgomery project. That’s incredible!"

Nathan gave a noncommittal hum, his attention seemingly elsewhere.

Victor, eager to impress, chimed in. "Mr. Black’s business acumen is unmatched! Isn’t that right, Evelyn?"

Evelyn stabbed a piece of asparagus with more force than necessary. "Mm."

Grace, ever the peacemaker, quickly changed the subject. "Evelyn, darling, how’s work at the hospital?"

Before Evelyn could answer, Lila cut in with a saccharine smile. "Oh, I’m sure she’s doing wonderfully. Though, I did hear there was some… drama recently?"

Evelyn’s grip on her fork tightened.

Nathan’s gaze sharpened. "Drama?"

Lila feigned innocence. "Oh, just some silly rumors. Nothing important."

Victor’s eyes darted between them, sensing danger. "Let’s not talk about work at the table, shall we?"

But Nathan wasn’t letting it go. His voice was dangerously calm. "What rumors?"

The room fell silent.

Lila’s smile didn’t reach her eyes. "Well… people are saying Evelyn was involved in some… questionable decisions regarding a patient."

Evelyn’s blood ran cold.

Nathan’s expression darkened. "Is that so?"

Victor shot Lila a warning look, but she continued, her voice dripping with faux concern. "Of course, I don’t believe a word of it. But you know how people talk."

Evelyn’s chair screeched as she stood abruptly. "Excuse me."

She didn’t wait for a response before storming out of the dining room.

Nathan’s icy voice followed her. "We’re leaving."

Lila’s smile finally cracked.


Evelyn turned to Victor, pressing for an answer, her voice steady but insistent. "Father, what were you going to say to me earlier?"

With Nathan in the room, Victor hesitated, his words caught in his throat. But then, a flicker of determination lit his gaze, and his tone turned sharp. "Tell me, why would you say those things in front of your colleagues at the hospital?"

"Those things?" Evelyn's lips curved into a knowing smile. She tilted her head slightly, feigning innocence. "Father, are you referring to the time you took Lila to meet Mr. Holloway at Grand Oak General, hoping he’d pull strings to secure her a permanent position? What’s wrong with me stating facts? Or are you suggesting it never happened?" Her voice was light, almost playful, but the challenge in her words was unmistakable.

Victor stiffened, momentarily speechless. Lila, who had been listening, felt her cheeks burn with humiliation. How would Nathan see her now?

Victor’s face darkened with anger. "How dare you judge your sister? Lila may not be a permanent staff member yet, but it’s only a matter of time! She was an exceptional student—unlike you, who barely scraped by. You should be grateful your connections got you into Grand Oak General at all. Without them, do you honestly think someone like you would have made it?"

His voice rose, his temper flaring, completely forgetting Nathan’s presence.

Nathan observed the exchange in silence, his expression unreadable. His gaze lingered on Evelyn, a flicker of something unspoken passing between them. He knew better than anyone that Grand Oak General didn’t operate on favors alone. Their hiring standards were ruthless, and only genuine skill earned a place there. Clearly, Victor had no idea just how capable Evelyn truly was.

Evelyn merely shrugged, her smile faint but victorious. "Is that so? Funny, then, how I’m the one with a permanent position at Grand Oak General, while Lila remains temporary."

Nathan couldn’t help the amused quirk of his lips. This was a side of Evelyn he hadn’t seen before—bold, unapologetic. She had always idolized Lila, treating her with near reverence. What had changed?

Victor’s face flushed red with fury. He opened his mouth to retaliate, but Evelyn cut in smoothly, her tone deceptively sweet. "Father, perhaps you should lower your voice. My husband is still here, watching."

The reminder struck like a slap. Victor’s mouth snapped shut, his expression twisting with frustration. He had no retort, no way to regain control of the situation.

The air in the room grew thick with tension, the unspoken words hanging heavily between them.

###Chapter 78

Lila Sinclair's cheeks burned with humiliation as the scene unfolded before her. She dared only a fleeting glance at Nathan Black, who was now watching Evelyn Hartley with an amused, almost admiring smile. That look from Nathan stoked the flames of Lila's frustration, igniting a bitter resentment that made her bite her lip hard enough to draw blood.

The living room crackled with tension. Grace Monroe made several attempts to lighten the mood with small talk, but her words fell flat, doing nothing to dispel the suffocating atmosphere.

When dinner was finally announced, the group moved to the dining room in stiff silence. As they took their seats, Evelyn asked, "Where’s Diana?"

"She's occupied tonight and won’t be joining us," Victor Sterling replied curtly.

Evelyn nodded, her expression unreadable, and said nothing more.

The meal passed in oppressive quiet, the clinking of silverware against porcelain the only sound.

Throughout dinner, Lila’s gaze kept flickering toward Evelyn, her emotions oscillating between jealousy and simmering rage. The more she replayed the evening’s exchanges in her mind, the more her anger boiled. This time, she wouldn’t let Evelyn walk away unscathed. She needed to teach her a lesson—one she wouldn’t forget.

A cunning glint flashed in Lila’s eyes as she quietly formulated her plan.

Rising gracefully from her seat, Lila picked up a clean bowl and ladled steaming soup into it. She carried it over to Evelyn with a saccharine smile. "Here, Evelyn. You should try this soup."

Evelyn’s sharp eyes narrowed slightly as she studied Lila, her gaze laced with suspicion.

Lila pressed her lips together, feigning remorse. "Evelyn, I want to apologize for earlier. I never meant to embarrass you in front of everyone. I was just so shocked when I heard about your position at Grand Hills General Hospital that I spoke without thinking. Please forgive me."

Her words dripped with false sincerity, but Evelyn remained unmoved, her expression cool and unreadable.

Victor, ever the instigator, scoffed. "Evelyn, are you really going to sit there and ignore Lila after she’s apologized and even brought you soup? Take it already."

A flicker of something unreadable passed through Evelyn’s eyes. Slowly, she stood and reached for the bowl—just as Lila deliberately loosened her grip.

The scalding liquid splashed over Lila’s hand.

"Ah!" she shrieked, her skin turning an angry red. Tears sprang to her eyes as she clutched her injured hand, her face contorted in pain.

###Chapter 79

The room fell into shocked silence after the incident.

"Lila!" Victor Sterling sprang to his feet, rushing to her side with deep concern as he cradled her injured hand. "It hurts… it hurts so much! Dad, the pain is unbearable!" Lila sobbed, tears streaking down her flushed cheeks.

Seeing his daughter in agony, Victor's chest tightened with sorrow and fury.

Just then, the Sterling family butler hurried over. "Miss Sinclair, we need to cool the burn immediately with cold water."

"Yes, hurry! Help her now!" Victor barked, snapping into action as he motioned for the butler to assist Lila.

Once Lila had been tended to, Victor whirled around, his sharp gaze locking onto Evelyn Hartley with barely contained rage. His eyes burned with accusation, as if his glare alone could condemn her.

"Evelyn, how could you be so cruel? Lila was only trying to make amends by offering you soup, and you repaid her kindness by scalding her hand!"

The veins in Victor's temples pulsed visibly as his voice rose in fury.

By now, Evelyn had steadied herself. Her tone was icy as she countered, "I didn't burn her. She dropped the bowl herself."

"Enough!" Victor roared. "You're still lying and blaming Lila? I won't tolerate this! You need to be taught a lesson!"

He took a menacing step toward her, his fists clenched.

Just then—

"Victor, stop!" Grace Monroe pleaded desperately, grabbing his arm. "Please, it was an accident! A misunderstanding!"

"Let go of me!" Victor roughly shook her off. "This is your fault—your coddling has turned her into this!"

As he turned away, Grace suddenly collapsed to her knees with a heavy thud.

Her eyes brimmed with desperation as she looked up at him. "Victor, I'm begging you… please!"

Evelyn's jaw tightened, her lips pressing into a thin line. "Mom, get up!"

Grace turned tearful eyes to her daughter. "Evelyn, just apologize to your father. Please, say you're sorry."

Evelyn's expression darkened, her fists clenching at her sides.

Beside her, Nathan Black, who had remained silent until now, frowned deeply. Disdain flickered in his eyes at Grace's plea—she was too quick to demand submission from Evelyn without even hearing the truth.

Taking a sharp breath, Evelyn stepped forward and reached for Grace's arm. "Stand up."

But Grace resisted. "No, not until you—"

"I said stand up!" Evelyn snapped, her voice cutting through the tension as she yanked Grace to her feet.

###Chapter 80

Evelyn's hands trembled slightly as she rose to her feet, her protests dying on her lips. Grace's expression smoothed into practiced calm as she faced Victor squarely, her voice crisp and deliberate. "Let me make one thing perfectly clear—it was Lila who intentionally dropped that bowl. She was setting me up."

Just as Victor opened his mouth to respond, Lila glided into the dining room. Victor immediately turned his attention to her, his tone laced with concern. "Lila, how are you feeling now?"

"Much better, Father," Lila replied sweetly. Then, with a pointed glance at Evelyn, she added, "Dad, please don't blame Evelyn for this."

"I'm sure it was just an accident. I'm fine now, so let's just move on, alright?" Lila said, her voice dripping with false magnanimity.

Victor stared at her, frustration tightening his jaw. "You're far too forgiving! Evelyn deliberately poured hot soup on you, and you're just going to let it slide? Your leniency will only encourage her to keep behaving this way!"

Lila shook her head gently, her voice soft but calculated. "We're sisters, Dad. As the elder one, it's only right that I show her kindness."

Victor fell silent, his anger simmering beneath the surface. Though furious, he restrained himself—Nathan's presence made any outburst unwise. For now, he'd let Lila's act stand, but Evelyn wouldn't escape consequences forever.

With a heavy exhale, he turned to Evelyn, his gaze sharp as steel. "Well, Evelyn? Aren't you going to apologize to Lila now? Since she's chosen to defend you, we'll let this go—for now. But mark my words, if anything like this happens again, I won't be so forgiving!"

Evelyn scoffed, her voice icy. "Why should I apologize for something I didn't do?" She locked eyes with Lila, her expression unreadable. "You know the truth, Lila. Is this little charade really worth it?"

Lila's face twisted with feigned hurt, her voice trembling. "Evelyn, I already apologized for what happened at the hospital. What more do you want from me? Even if you can't forgive me, there was no need to retaliate like this. It really hurt."

Grace stepped forward then, her voice pleading. "I'm sorry, Lila. Evelyn didn't mean it. Please, don't hold it against her."

"Mother!" Evelyn turned sharply toward Grace, disbelief and betrayal flashing in her eyes. "You don't believe me either?"

Grace looked pained. "Evelyn, please, just listen to me. Apologize to Lila."

Silence stretched between them, Evelyn's gaze hollow as it lingered on Grace. Then, a bitter laugh escaped her—one laced with something dangerously close to despair.

Nathan, watching Evelyn closely, caught the flicker of anguish in her expression. His fingers curled into fists, an unfamiliar surge of protectiveness rising in his chest. He opened his mouth to intervene—

But before he could speak, Evelyn abruptly turned and strode to the dining table. She snatched up a bowl, ladled steaming soup into it, and without hesitation, flung the scalding liquid straight onto Lila's outstretched hand.

###Chapter 81

Lila's scream pierced the air.

Victor lunged forward, his face contorted with rage. "Evelyn! Have you lost your mind?"

Grace gasped, hands flying to her mouth. "Oh my god—!"

Nathan moved instantly, stepping between Evelyn and Victor, his voice a low warning. "Enough."

Evelyn didn't flinch. She met Lila's wide, tear-filled eyes with a chilling smile. "There. Now I actually have something to apologize for."

Lila clutched her reddened hand, her perfect facade cracking. "You—you bitch!"

Victor's face darkened. "That's it. You're done."

Evelyn tilted her head, her voice eerily calm. "Funny. I was just thinking the same thing about you."

Nathan's grip tightened on Evelyn's wrist, pulling her back. "We're leaving."

Grace reached out desperately. "Evelyn, please—"

But Evelyn was already walking away, her spine straight, her steps measured. Behind her, Lila's sobs and Victor's furious shouts faded into the distance.

Nathan kept pace beside her, his voice low. "That was reckless."

Evelyn didn't look at him. "No. Reckless would've been throwing it in her face."

A beat of silence. Then, Nathan exhaled sharply—almost like a laugh. "Point taken."

The front door slammed shut behind them, sealing away the chaos.

Evelyn took a deep breath of the cool night air.

Game on.

Lila Sinclair's scream sliced through the dining room, sharp as shattered glass. "Evelyn Hartley, have you gone completely insane?"

"Evelyn, what the hell are you doing?"

The room plunged into stunned silence, every pair of eyes locked on Evelyn’s bold move. Even Nathan Black’s usually impassive expression flickered with surprise before settling into something darker—a quiet, calculating amusement, his lips quirking slightly.

Evelyn set the bowl down with deliberate slowness, her icy gaze sweeping over Lila, who clutched her scalded hand with a pained grimace. With a derisive scoff, Evelyn tilted her chin up. "Since everyone seems so convinced I burned Lila’s hand on purpose earlier, I figured I shouldn’t disappoint. Now, I did do it intentionally. Happy to take credit this time."

Lila’s face twisted in shock and fury, her manicured nails digging into her palm. How dare Evelyn humiliate her like this? And right in front of Nathan? Did she have no fear of him seeing her for the ruthless woman she truly was?

"You psychotic bitch!" Victor Sterling roared, his face mottled with rage as he lunged toward Evelyn. "I’ll make you regret this!" His hand shot up, poised to strike.

Evelyn’s eyes turned to steel. She was ready—more than ready—to meet his attack head-on.

But before Victor could follow through, Nathan’s voice cut through the tension like a blade. "Mr. Sterling." His tone was deceptively smooth, but the undercurrent of warning was unmistakable. He locked eyes with Victor, a cold smirk playing on his lips. "Think very carefully about what you’re about to do."

The words hit Victor like a physical blow. His arm froze mid-air, muscles tensing as the reality of Nathan’s threat sank in. After a tense beat, he lowered his hand, his fury simmering into impotent resentment.

Lila’s eyes welled with furious tears as she stared at Nathan in disbelief. He was defending Evelyn? Since when did he take her side? Had that scheming witch somehow bewitched him?

Even Evelyn was caught off guard. She hadn’t expected Nathan to intervene. Regaining her composure, she exhaled sharply. "This dinner is clearly over." Turning to Nathan, she added coolly, "Let’s go."

Nathan didn’t argue. He rose smoothly, following Evelyn out of the Sterling mansion without another word.

Once inside the car, Evelyn’s pulse still thrummed with adrenaline. After a moment, she turned to Nathan, her voice edged with dry amusement. "Back there—"

"I didn’t do it for you," Nathan cut in, his voice rough as he started the engine. His grip on the steering wheel tightened. "You’re still my wife, Evelyn. Any insult to you is an insult to the Black family."

Evelyn’s half-formed gratitude evaporated. She turned away, a bitter smile curling her lips. "Funny. I was about to say I didn’t need your help. I had it handled."

Nathan didn’t respond. The silence between them was thick, charged with unspoken tension.

Outside, the city lights blurred past, indifferent to the storm brewing inside the car.


###Chapter 82

Nathan's lips curled into a mocking smirk as he regarded Evelyn with narrowed eyes. "Seems my intervention was entirely superfluous."

At that moment, Evelyn's phone buzzed sharply.

She glanced at the screen—Victor Sterling's name flashed across it. Without hesitation, she swiped to decline. Almost immediately, another call came through, this time from Grace Monroe. She rejected that one too. Then, like an unrelenting storm, notifications flooded in—message after message, until finally, her phone fell silent.

Nathan's sharp gaze flickered toward her. Drawing a slow breath, Evelyn unlocked her phone, her jaw tightening as she scanned the texts.

Victor's furious words glared back at her:
"Evelyn! How dare you defy me? Return home NOW—you have five minutes!"
"Apologize to Lila this instant! Do you think Leonard Grant's favor makes you untouchable?"
"Are you even still my daughter? What kind of monster have you become?"
"What filthy life did you lead abroad to turn out like this?"

A cold laugh escaped her as she exited the chat, only to see Grace's messages waiting.

"Evelyn, please, don’t be stubborn. Just come home and apologize. Lila won’t stay angry, and once she forgives you, your father will too."
"For once, listen to me. Do this."

Her fingers trembled slightly around the phone. Grace’s pleas were like shards of glass twisting in her chest. After a long moment, she pocketed her phone and stared blankly out the car window, emotions churning violently beneath her calm exterior.

Nathan watched her from the corner of his eye, his expression unreadable. The rest of the drive passed in suffocating silence.

When they arrived at the Grant estate, they retreated into their usual routines—Evelyn to her work, Nathan to his. To an outsider, she might have seemed unaffected. But that night, sleep refused to come.

By morning, the shadows beneath her eyes betrayed her restless night as she headed to the office.

Meanwhile, at the Grant mansion, Leonard sat poised on the sofa, his sharp gaze fixed on the unexpected visitors—Victor Sterling and Lila Sinclair.

"Speak," Leonard prompted, his voice calm but edged with authority.

Victor didn’t hesitate. "Mr. Grant, family matters should stay private, but I’m at my limit. My daughter Evelyn—she’s gone too far this time. She’s cruel."

He lifted Lila’s hand, displaying the angry red burn. "Look what she did."

Leonard’s brow furrowed slightly, though he remained silent.

Beside him, Margaret leaned forward. "What happened?"

Victor’s voice darkened. "Evelyn attacked Lila—twice. During dinner, Lila was serving soup. Evelyn let the bowl slip on purpose, scalding her. The soup was boiling. Lila didn’t even cry out—she begged me not to blame Evelyn. But then Evelyn threw another bowl at her, making it worse."

###Chapter 83

Leonard’s expression remained unreadable, but his fingers tapped once against the armrest. "And you’re certain it was intentional?"

Lila’s eyes welled with tears. "I—I don’t want to believe it, but… she looked at me before it happened. Like she wanted to hurt me."

Margaret gasped softly, her hand flying to her chest. "Evelyn would never—"

Victor cut in sharply. "She did. And if Nathan hadn’t intervened, who knows what else she might have done?"

A tense silence settled over the room.

Then Leonard spoke, his voice dangerously quiet.

"Bring Evelyn here. Now."

Victor Sterling's voice trembled with barely contained fury. "I wanted to teach Evelyn a lesson right then and there, but Nathan stepped in and shielded her, stopping me from acting. However, I refuse to let this matter slide. I came here today to inform you both, hoping you and Mrs. Grant will address Evelyn's behavior. If left unchecked, her actions will only escalate."

Leonard Grant zeroed in on one crucial detail—Nathan had defended Evelyn.

Margaret Hayes gasped, her face paling. "Evelyn would never do something like that!"

Victor's jaw tightened. "Nathan saw everything. If you doubt my word, Mr. and Mrs. Grant, you can ask him yourself."

Leonard studied Victor with an unreadable expression. "So, your sole purpose for visiting was to report this incident and demand discipline for Evelyn?"

After a weighted pause, he added, "No other reason?"

The question caught Victor off guard. He shook his head quickly. "No, nothing else. I simply felt you should know."

Leonard smirked, then leaned in to murmur something to Margaret.

Her brows furrowed in concern. "Are you certain about this?"

Without hesitation, Leonard nodded. "Do it."

Margaret excused herself and ascended the stairs. Moments later, she returned, extending a slip of paper to Victor. "Take this."

Victor glanced down—his breath hitched. It was a check for half a million dollars.

His head snapped up, bewildered. "Mr. and Mrs. Grant, what is this for?"

Leonard chuckled darkly. "Consider it compensation for Lila's medical expenses, plus extra for the inconvenience. I trust it's sufficient."

Victor stiffened. "There must be a misunderstanding. We didn’t come here for money!"

Lila, who had remained silent until now, spoke up. "Please, Mr. Grant, we would never ask for compensation."

Victor nodded firmly. "Exactly. We came to discuss Evelyn’s actions, not to take your money. We can’t accept this."

Leonard's smile turned razor-sharp. "And why would I reprimand my daughter-in-law for you? I know her character better than anyone."

His voice dropped to a dangerous calm. "She would never do what you’ve accused her of."

Victor and Lila exchanged uneasy glances. "But Mr. Grant," Victor insisted, "everything I’ve said is true! If you don’t believe me, ask Nathan!"

Leonard's smirk widened. "Even if it were true, so what? I’d bet my fortune it was Lila who provoked Evelyn first. If this amount isn’t enough, name your price."

Victor and Lila froze, their expressions crumbling. They hadn’t expected Leonard to defend Evelyn so ruthlessly—nor to turn the tables on them so effortlessly.

###Chapter 84

Before they could respond, Leonard's voice cut through the tense silence. "Is there anything else you'd like to say to me?" His tone was deceptively polite, but the underlying message was clear—Victor and Lila were being dismissed.

Lila's eyes shimmered with unshed tears as she tugged at her father's sleeve. "Dad, we should go," she whispered, her voice barely audible.

Victor clenched his jaw, realizing any further argument would be futile. He rose stiffly from his seat and addressed Leonard and Margaret. "Mr. and Mrs. Grant, we'll take our leave now. But we won't be accepting your money. Keep the check."

With that, Victor and Lila turned toward the exit.

As they walked away, Leonard gave a subtle nod to his assistant. "Winston."

The man moved swiftly, intercepting them just as they reached the grand foyer. With practiced ease, Winston pressed the check into Victor's palm. "Mr. Grant insists you take this. Consider it closure on the matter. And," he added smoothly, "he prefers this doesn't become public knowledge."

Without waiting for a reply, Winston retreated, leaving Victor seething.

Victor stared at the check, his fingers tightening around it. Was this nothing more than a bribe to buy their silence?

Beside him, Lila struggled to process her emotions. Memories of past visits to the Grant mansion with Diana flashed through her mind—Leonard had always been distant but courteous. When had his demeanor turned so cold?

Her thoughts spiraled. Evelyn must have poisoned his mind against me. She had hoped Leonard would reprimand Evelyn after learning what happened. Instead, he had defended her without hesitation.

A bitter jealousy twisted inside her. Why couldn't I have been the one to marry Nathan?

Victor's voice snapped her back to reality. "Leonard's blatant favoritism is unacceptable!" He placed a reassuring hand on her shoulder. "Don't worry, Lila. I'll make sure you get justice."

Lila bit her trembling lip and shook her head. "Dad, let it go. It's not worth provoking the Grants over this. You heard what Mr. Grant said."

Victor fell silent, weighing her words. Finally, he exhaled sharply. "Fine. Let's go home."

Lila nodded. "Alright."

Meanwhile, at Grand Plains General Hospital, Evelyn was in her office when a soft knock interrupted her.

A security guard stepped inside. "Dr. Hartley, you have a visitor."

"Thank you," Evelyn replied, rising to follow him.

Outside, Grace Monroe stood waiting. Evelyn's brows furrowed slightly as she guided Grace to a quieter corner.

"Why are you here?" Evelyn asked, her tone guarded.

Grace took a deep breath. "Evelyn, something felt off about you yesterday. You and Lila were always close. What changed? Did she do something to upset you?"

Evelyn's expression remained unreadable. "Do you honestly believe I orchestrated that incident with Lila?"

Grace hesitated, then sighed. "I don't want to think so, Evelyn. But we all saw what happened."


###Chapter 85

"You saw it with your own eyes?" Evelyn let out a soft, bitter laugh, her voice laced with sarcasm. "Lila handed me that bowl of soup yesterday with both hands—one of them carefully positioned to hide her actions from anyone watching. Only she and I knew what really happened."

She met Grace’s gaze directly, her disappointment palpable. "I’m your daughter. Don’t you know who I am? And yet, you’d rather believe Lila over me..."

A heavy pause lingered before Evelyn added, her tone grave, "Mom, this isn’t the first time."

"N-No, Evelyn, that’s not it," Grace stammered, her distress evident.

The hesitation in Grace’s voice spoke volumes. A cold, hollow laugh echoed in Evelyn’s chest, though her expression remained composed. She tilted her head slightly. "This isn’t the only reason you came to see me, is it?"

"Evelyn..." Grace reached out, her fingers brushing against Evelyn’s hand, her eyes pleading. "I do believe you."

Evelyn’s eyes narrowed almost imperceptibly. She held Grace’s gaze in silence, already sensing there was more to come.

Just as she expected, Grace continued, her voice softening, "But, Evelyn, you can’t deny that the second time, you deliberately poured that soup on Lila’s hand. That was wrong. Shouldn’t you apologize to her?"

Evelyn wasn’t surprised. This was the real purpose of Grace’s visit. What did Grace’s earlier words even mean? A fresh wave of disappointment crashed over her.

She offered Grace a faint, humorless smile. "If that’s all you came here to say, you might as well leave now. I will never apologize to Lila."

Grace’s face twisted with worry. "Evelyn, please, just listen to me this once. Compromise isn’t weakness. Lila holds power in the Sterling family. Have you thought about how your father or Diana will react? Think about Diana! Lila is her precious daughter. What do you think will happen when she finds out? Do you really believe we’ll walk away unscathed?"

Diana had been away in Soling since yesterday and still didn’t know about the incident. At the mention of her, Evelyn’s gaze flickered—just for a second—before her expression hardened again.

"So what? If they want to come at me, I’m ready."

Evelyn had known the risks when she made her choice.

Grace’s frustration boiled over. "Evelyn, you—"

"Enough, Mom." Evelyn cut her off sharply. "I have work to do. You should go."

She turned to leave.

"Evelyn!" Grace’s voice cracked with desperation. "Even if you don’t care about the consequences, what about me? How am I supposed to face them? How do I look your father in the eye after this? Do you think he’ll be kind to me now?"

A sob broke through Grace’s words.

Evelyn froze at the sound. Her shoulders tensed, her face paling slightly. The weight of Grace’s words pressed down on her, dragging her into a familiar abyss of guilt. She had fought against it so many times before—always giving in when Grace played this card. But not this time.

Without turning back, Evelyn spoke, her voice steady. "Mom, don’t worry. Even if Dad leaves you, I won’t. I can take care of you myself."


###Chapter 86

With those words, Evelyn strode away without waiting for Grace’s reply.

Grace stood frozen, her eyes wide as she watched Evelyn’s retreating figure. The unwavering confidence in her daughter’s stance left her speechless. This was not the Evelyn she knew—the one who used to shrink under pressure. Something had shifted, and Grace wasn’t sure how to process it.

The encounter weighed heavily on Evelyn’s mind, casting a shadow over her day. Though she had held her ground, an uneasy restlessness settled in her chest. She couldn’t shake the worry that Victor and Diana might take their frustration out on Grace for what had happened.

Meanwhile, at the Grant family estate, Nathan had barely stepped inside when Leonard summoned him to the study.

“Victor and Lila paid me a visit this morning,” Leonard began without preamble.

Nathan’s eyebrow arched slightly. “Here to complain about the incident?”

“Indeed.” Leonard leaned forward, curiosity flickering in his gaze. “What really happened?”

Nathan recounted the events with detached precision. “Both sides told different stories, so the truth is murky. Evelyn’s parents didn’t believe her. They kept pressuring her to apologize to Lila. Eventually, Evelyn lost patience and poured a bowl of soup over Lila’s hand.”

A faint smirk tugged at the corner of his lips as he spoke. Last night’s Evelyn had been… unexpectedly intriguing.

Leonard caught the subtle shift in Nathan’s expression and chuckled. “I knew it. Evelyn wouldn’t act like that without reason. She must have been pushed to her limit.”

Nathan’s smirk faded into a cool mask. “You trust her that much?”

“Absolutely,” Leonard replied without hesitation. “I have a good eye for people.” He studied Nathan for a moment before asking, “And what do you think about all this?”

Nathan’s jaw tightened. “It’s none of my concern.”

Leonard gave him a pointed look. “Evelyn is your wife, Nathan. How is this not your concern? Your wife is being bullied, and you’re just going to stand by?”

A cold laugh escaped Nathan. “She made it clear she doesn’t need my help. She thinks she can handle everything on her own.” His tone dripped with sarcasm. “So, no need to worry about her.”

Leonard’s lips curved knowingly. There was more to this story—something had happened between them yesterday. He gave Nathan a long, assessing look.

Nathan stiffened under the scrutiny. “If there’s nothing else, I should go.”

“Don’t forget—dinner tomorrow. No excuses,” Leonard called after him.

Nathan paused, meeting Leonard’s gaze briefly before turning away. The door clicked shut behind him, leaving the room in silence.


###Chapter 87

Nathan watched as Theodore walked away, exhaling a weary sigh. He was certain Theodore had already guessed who tomorrow night's special guest would be.

At the Velvet Lounge, Evelyn's mood was dark enough to summon Natalie for drinks.

Natalie, having heard about yesterday's events and today's tense conversation with Grace, clenched her fists in silent fury. "I'll never understand your mother's logic," she muttered, shaking her head. "She clearly loves you, but some of her choices cut deeper than any knife. A mother's support should be unconditional—just her faith in you should be enough. No grand speeches needed. And yet..."

Her voice dropped, laced with frustration. "Maybe she's just too afraid of facing Victor or Diana. But by backing down, she's dragging you down with her."

Evelyn stayed quiet, swirling her drink absently, lost in thought.

Minutes ticked by before she finally lifted her gaze, her eyes distant.

Natalie's chest tightened at the sight. She opened her mouth to offer comfort when Evelyn suddenly met her eyes.

"Natalie, sometimes I don’t know how to navigate my own mother," Evelyn admitted, her tone edged with bitter amusement. "She should be my safe haven, but instead, she suffocates me. And yet... she’s still my mother. I can brush off my father’s indifference, but with her? It’s different."

Natalie squeezed Evelyn’s shoulder gently. "She does love you. She just... apologizes with silence instead of words."

Evelyn’s lashes fluttered, her voice barely above a whisper. "The worst part? She doesn’t believe me. She chose Lila’s side—twice. That’s what breaks me."

Natalie sighed. "Lila’s a master manipulator. Even you were fooled once. Your mother just can’t see past her act. She thinks Lila would never hurt you intentionally."

A hollow smile touched Evelyn’s lips. "It all comes down to trust. And she doesn’t have enough in me."

Natalie had no rebuttal. The truth was too heavy to deny.

With a quiet clink, she raised her glass. "Tonight, we drink until the world makes sense again."

Evelyn chuckled, tapping her glass against Natalie’s. "Let’s not overdo it. Work tomorrow."

They both laughed, the sound a brief respite from the storm.

Upstairs, in a shadowed booth...

Theodore, freshly returned from a business trip, had arranged to meet Nathan and a few others. For now, it was just the two of them—Dylan and the rest hadn’t arrived yet.

Theodore studied Nathan over the rim of his glass. "Dylan told me about Evelyn’s situation."

Nathan’s expression flickered, but he said nothing, taking a slow sip of his whiskey instead.


###Chapter 88

The evening air was thick with unspoken tension as Theodore Whitmore studied Nathan Black’s profile. "Evelyn has changed quite a bit these past three years," Theodore remarked, exhaling slowly. After a deliberate pause, he added, "Dylan mentioned that Leonard suggested you and Evelyn wait a month before finalizing the divorce?"

Nathan’s jaw tightened imperceptibly before he responded, "Yes."

Theodore offered a knowing half-smile. "And how do you feel about that?"

Nathan pressed his lips into a thin line, his voice dropping to a low, measured tone. "I made a deal with my father. I’ll play along with his plans for Evelyn and me this month. If I still want the divorce afterward, he’ll back off."

Theodore’s eyebrows lifted slightly, but he remained silent, his gaze steady on Nathan.

A smirk tugged at Nathan’s lips, edged with defiance. "I won’t lose this time."

Catching the certainty in Nathan’s voice, Theodore tilted his head, his next question laced with quiet implication. "So, if you do go through with the divorce from Evelyn, do you intend to marry Serena next?"

Nathan’s smirk faltered. His lips pressed together briefly before he answered, the hesitation speaking volumes.

Theodore leaned back, his expression thoughtful. "I thought as much."

Nathan turned to him, a faint crease forming between his brows.

Theodore didn’t mince words. "There’s something off between you and Serena, isn’t there?"

Nathan exhaled sharply, his voice barely above a murmur. "I don’t even remember when it started, but… the feeling is gone."

Theodore nodded slowly. "I’ve noticed for a while now." He studied Nathan carefully before asking, "What’s your plan, then?"

Nathan’s reply was devoid of emotion. "I’ll marry Serena."

Theodore frowned slightly, but Nathan continued, his tone resolute. "I owe her that much. It’s a promise—my way of making amends." His eyes darkened as he added, "She’s suffered enough because of me these past three years."

Theodore considered his words before responding. "But what Serena truly wants might not be a marriage built on obligation. She loves you. She’ll want your heart, not just a gesture."

Nathan’s gaze flickered briefly before hardening. "This is all I can give her right now. Once the divorce is finalized, I’ll tell her the truth. If she can’t accept it, I’ll find another way to make things right."

Theodore sighed, recognizing the futility of arguing further.

Just then, the door opened, and Dylan Reeves strode in, followed closely by Serena Cole.

"Nathan," Serena greeted softly, settling beside him with practiced ease. She turned to Theodore with a warm smile. "Theodore, it’s good to see you back!"

Theodore returned the smile politely.

Dylan collapsed onto the sofa with a dramatic groan. "Theodore, your timing is impeccable. I’m drowning in misery and in desperate need of a drink."

Theodore arched a brow. "Is this about the Caldwell family?"


###Chapter 89
The whispers about the Caldwell family potentially partnering with the Thornton family had spread like wildfire through their elite social circle. Yet, in a shocking turn of events, the Caldwells had abruptly changed direction, now seeking a new collaborator.

Dylan nearly cursed under his breath, barely stopping himself as he shot a glance at Nathan. He exhaled sharply, his irritation palpable. "I completely misjudged Evelyn. How could someone like her—an outsider to the Caldwells, no less—somehow win them over?"

Theodore leaned in, curiosity etched on his face. "Is there really no way to salvage this?"

Dylan sighed heavily. "Mrs. Caldwell made it crystal clear that my family should forget about any collaboration. What else can I do?"

But as he spoke, a flicker of hope crossed his features. He turned to Nathan, eyes pleading. "Nathan, you could help me out here, couldn’t you?"

Nathan swirled his drink before meeting Dylan’s gaze. Dylan pressed on, "Evelyn listens to you. If she could just put in a good word for my family with Mr. Caldwell, maybe we could still save this deal." He was also eager to prove to his father the value of his connection to Nathan.

Nathan took a slow sip before responding firmly, "I’m not getting involved."

Dylan’s face darkened with frustration. "Nathan—"

Theodore cut in smoothly, "Let’s not dwell on this. Drinks first, business later."

Though seething, Dylan knew better than to push Nathan further. Reluctantly, he raised his glass and clinked it against the others’.

Meanwhile, at Evelyn and Natalie’s table, an unwelcome trio approached.

Three men in flashy suits, their smirks oozing arrogance, stopped in front of them. The leader, Trenton, flashed a grin that didn’t reach his eyes. "Care to join us for a drink, ladies?"

One of his lackeys, Marco, slid two glasses toward Evelyn and Natalie.

Evelyn didn’t even glance at the drinks. "Not interested," she said flatly.

Trenton chuckled, undeterred. "No problem." He jerked his chin at Marco. "Get them some water instead."

Marco nodded. "Right away, boss."

Evelyn crossed her arms. "I said I’m not drinking anything."

Trenton’s smile turned predatory. "Come on, don’t be like that."

Silence. Natalie, beside Evelyn, didn’t bother looking up from her phone.

Trenton’s patience snapped. His voice dropped to a growl. "You’re drinking with us tonight, whether you like it or not."

Evelyn stood, her gaze icy. "Try me."

Trenton smirked and nudged Marco. "Make sure they drink. But play nice… for now."

Marco reached out, fingers brushing toward Evelyn’s chin—

She caught his wrist in a vice-like grip.


###Chapter 90

Nathan Black's gaze snapped downward as Evelyn Hartley's fingers tightened around Marco Rossi's wrist. The sudden shift in the atmosphere was palpable.

Marco's face twisted in pain before he could even react. "Ah—let go! That hurts!" he yelped, his voice cracking as he tried to jerk his hand free. But Evelyn's grip only tightened, her expression eerily composed.

"Please! I'm sorry!" Marco begged, his earlier bravado crumbling under the sharp agony. "I won't do it again, I swear!"

The commotion drew the attention of nearby patrons, their curious glances flickering toward the unfolding scene.

From their elevated booth on the second floor, Nathan and his companions had a clear view.

Theodore Whitmore nudged Nathan with a smirk. "Isn't that Evelyn and Natalie down there? Looks like trouble."

Dylan Reeves scoffed, swirling his drink lazily. "Serves her right."

From their vantage point, they could see Evelyn and Natalie surrounded by three men. One—Marco—was clearly in distress, his face contorted in pain. Another suddenly lunged at Evelyn with a snarl.

Serena Cole frowned. "Nathan, you should go help them."

Dylan rolled his eyes. "Why? Maybe she enjoys the attention."

Nathan's expression darkened, his sharp glare silencing Dylan instantly. He pushed back his chair, ready to intervene—

Then, in a flash, Marco was sent stumbling backward. The second attacker swung at Evelyn, only for her to dodge effortlessly and deliver a sharp punch to his nose. The man reeled, clutching his face in shock.

Nathan's eyes narrowed.

Trenton Reeves and his group stood frozen, stunned by Evelyn's unexpected ferocity.

"Take her down together!" Trenton barked, his voice laced with frustration.

But Evelyn moved like lightning—a precise one-two punch, followed by a devastating side kick that sent Trenton flying backward. He crashed into a table several feet away, sending glasses shattering to the floor.

The entire bar fell silent, patrons gaping in disbelief.

Evelyn merely dusted off her hands, rolling her shoulders as if she'd just finished a light workout.

Natalie Brooks grinned, stepping forward to clap her on the back. "Damn, Evelyn. You've been holding out on me."

She had always known Evelyn could handle herself, but this? This was next level.


###Chapter 91

Evelyn flashed a knowing smirk, her confidence radiating. Ever since the previous altercation, she had thrown herself into mastering self-defense techniques, determined never to be caught off guard again.

She sauntered toward the still-recovering Trenton, arching a brow in playful defiance. "Still think Natalie and I should join you for that drink?"

Trenton visibly flinched, his pride wounded. A flicker of resentment burned in his eyes, but he forced a tight-lipped smile and shook his head. "No, I—I wouldn’t dream of it."

Evelyn’s voice turned icy. "Then I suggest you leave. Now."

"Right. We’re going," Trenton muttered, his face flushed with humiliation.

His friends, nursing their bruises, scrambled to help him up, and they hastily retreated from the bar. As they disappeared into the crowd, Trenton shot one last venomous glance over his shoulder, silently vowing revenge for the disgrace Evelyn had dealt him.

With the confrontation behind her, Evelyn returned to her seat beside Natalie as if nothing had happened. The entire scene had sent a clear message to anyone else foolish enough to approach them—Evelyn wasn’t just a pretty face. She was a storm wrapped in silk, a rose with thorns sharp enough to draw blood.

Upstairs in the VIP booth, Nathan had settled back into his chair, his expression unreadable.

Theodore let out a low whistle, turning to Nathan with an impressed grin. "Damn. Didn’t know Evelyn could fight like that. You ever see that side of her before?"

Nathan took a slow sip of his whiskey, his gaze lingering on Evelyn below. "No."

The truth was, he’d never bothered to look. The old Evelyn had been nothing more than a shadow in his periphery. But this version—confident, unyielding, electrifying—had caught his attention in a way he hadn’t expected. A strange curiosity stirred within him, an itch to unravel the layers of this woman he’d once dismissed.

Though his face remained impassive, his eyes kept drifting back to her.

Serena noticed. Her grip tightened around her glass, jealousy coiling in her chest like a venomous snake. She had seen the way Nathan watched Evelyn—like she was a puzzle he suddenly wanted to solve. No. She wouldn’t let Evelyn steal him away.

Determined to reclaim his attention, Serena downed her drink in one go, then reached for another.

Meanwhile, Dylan sat frozen in his seat, his emotions a tangled mess.

Evelyn had been breathtaking just now—commanding, fearless, magnetic. She was everything he admired. And yet, the bitter irony gnawed at him. Why did she have to be Evelyn? The same woman he had once scorned, belittled, and pushed aside.

If only she were just Marcus’s goddaughter. If only things were simpler.

An uncomfortable silence settled over the group, thick with unspoken tension.

Finally, Theodore cleared his throat, eyeing Serena with concern. "Hey, maybe slow down. You know you can’t handle your liquor."

Serena waved him off with a tipsy laugh. "Relax. I know what I’m doing."

Theodore exchanged a glance with Nathan, shaking his head. Love—or whatever this mess was—always complicated things.

Downstairs, Natalie’s infectious laughter had lifted Evelyn’s spirits. But then, Natalie’s expression grew serious, her voice dropping to a whisper. "Evelyn… what if Mrs. Sterling comes after you? What if she demands an apology?"

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her glass.

She had no answer.


###Chapter 92

Evelyn froze at those words, her breath hitching for a moment. Her emotions toward Diana were complicated—respect, gratitude, and admiration all tangled together in a messy knot. Diana had been the only one in the Sterling family who had believed her when she swore she hadn’t stolen Lila’s necklace.

But that didn’t mean she would bend. Not even for Diana. When it came to her principles, Evelyn’s resolve was unshakable. "No matter what," she said, her voice sharp as steel, "I will never apologize to Lila."

A beat of silence passed before she added, cold and final, "It doesn’t matter who asks me. The answer will always be no."

Natalie nodded fiercely beside her. "Damn right! You didn’t do anything wrong, so why should you apologize? If you back down now, Lila will just keep pushing you."

At the mention of Lila, Evelyn’s lips pressed into a thin line. Lately, Lila’s behavior had crossed every line of decency, and Evelyn was done tolerating it.

Just as she was about to speak, Natalie suddenly nudged her, tilting her chin toward the VIP section upstairs. "Isn’t that Nathan and his friends?"

Evelyn’s gaze snapped up, landing on the booth where Nathan sat, his posture relaxed. And there, draped over his arm like a possessive vine—Serena. The woman was swaying slightly, her fingers curled possessively around Nathan’s sleeve as he leaned in, murmuring something to her.

Evelyn’s eyes darkened. So, Serena had chosen to ignore her warning. Fine.

Natalie bristled beside her. "What the hell is Serena doing? Does she have no self-respect?"

Evelyn rose smoothly from the couch, her expression eerily calm. "Come on, Natalie. Let’s go say hello."

Natalie grinned, mischief flashing in her eyes. "Oh, this is going to be good."

Serena was clearly drunk.

"Serena?" Nathan nudged her gently. "You alright?"

Eyes fluttering shut, Serena pouted like a petulant child. "Don’t… bother me…"

"I’m sleeping… Just let me sleep…" she mumbled, tightening her grip on Nathan’s arm.

Dylan sighed, rubbing his temples. "Just let her lean on you for a bit. She’s been in a foul mood lately."

Nathan’s jaw tightened, but before he could respond, a sharp, honeyed voice sliced through the air.

"Well, well. What do we have here?"

The group turned to see Evelyn and Natalie approaching, their heels clicking ominously against the floor.

Theodore stiffened, clearing his throat. "Uh… Serena’s had a bit too much to drink."

Natalie’s lips curled into a mocking smirk. "If she’s drunk, then someone should take her home. Or is clinging to another woman’s husband part of her usual drunk routine?"

Theodore winced. Evelyn was Nathan’s wife, and Serena’s behavior—whether intentional or not—was undeniably inappropriate.

Dylan, ever the knight in shining armor for Serena, jumped in. "She’s wasted. She doesn’t even know what she’s doing."

Evelyn’s smile was glacial. "Oh, I think she knows exactly what she’s doing."

Nathan’s gaze locked onto hers, unreadable.

The tension in the air was thick enough to choke on.


###Chapter 93

Natalie Brooks scoffed, her lips curling in disdain. "Who can tell if she's genuinely wasted or just putting on a show?"

Dylan Reeves bristled, irritation flashing in his eyes. "You—" He bit back his words, knowing better than to provoke Natalie given her connections.

Before the tension could escalate, Nathan Black's cold, detached voice sliced through the air. "What are you doing here?" His piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn Hartley.

Evelyn met his stare with unshaken composure. "I spotted someone familiar and thought I'd come say hello."

Dylan seized the opportunity before Nathan could respond. "Well, now that you've done that, you can go."

Evelyn tilted her head slightly, fixing Dylan with a sharp look. "Whether I stay or leave is my choice. Why are you so eager to interfere?"

Dylan faltered, momentarily speechless, before his expression darkened. With a mocking laugh, he sneered, "Oh, how bold you've become since gaining Mr. Caldwell's favor. The great goddaughter of Ethan Caldwell must think she's untouchable now."

Evelyn's eyes turned glacial. "If you know that, then maybe you should learn when to keep quiet."

Dylan clenched his jaw, unable to retort.

Nathan, lounging back in his seat, observed Evelyn with lazy amusement, his dark eyes unreadable. He didn’t miss a single detail—her calculated words, the tension in her posture.

Here to greet them? He almost smirked. That was a lie. She was here because she couldn’t stand seeing Serena Cole draped over him.

Meanwhile, Natalie strode toward Serena, her patience wearing thin. She reached out to shake her awake. "Miss Cole, it's time to let go of Nathan and leave."

But Serena swatted her hand away, groaning, "Don't touch me! Go away… I don’t want anyone else! Nathan… Nathan… only Nathan!"

Her flushed cheeks and slurred words left little doubt—she was undeniably drunk, her eyes fluttering shut as she clung to Nathan’s arm.

Dylan attempted to smooth things over. "Apologies. Serena gets… affectionate when she’s drunk. She just happened to be sitting next to Nathan tonight, so…" He shrugged lightly at Evelyn. "I’m sure you understand, Mrs. Black. Once she sobers up, she’ll let go on her own."

Evelyn couldn’t help but laugh—a sharp, humorless sound. The absurdity of Dylan’s excuse was almost impressive.

Natalie shot her a questioning glance, silently asking for direction.

Evelyn stepped forward, her gaze flickering from Serena to Nathan. Nathan met her eyes, his expression unreadable, but there was a flicker of curiosity—what would she do next?

After a beat, Evelyn turned her attention to the wine glass on the table. "It seems Miss Cole is very drunk," she remarked smoothly.

"Obviously," Dylan muttered.

But just as Theodore Whitmore—Nathan’s ever-watchful friend—wondered if Evelyn would back down, she picked up the glass and, without hesitation, flung its contents straight into Serena’s face.

"AHHH!" Serena shrieked, jolting upright as the wine dripped down her cheeks and soaked her hair. She blinked rapidly, disoriented and gasping.


###Chapter 94

The air in the VIP lounge grew thick with tension as Nathan and Theodore froze, their eyes locked onto Evelyn in stunned disbelief. Their jaws slackened, struggling to process the bold move she had just executed.

Evelyn, however, remained the picture of composure. She placed the empty glass back onto the table with deliberate precision, a faint smirk playing at the corners of her lips. "Well, well. Miss Cole seems much more alert now, doesn't she?"

Nathan barely glanced at his wine-stained sleeve. A flicker of amusement danced in his dark eyes as he studied Evelyn, his head tilting slightly in silent intrigue.

Dylan was the first to snap out of his shock. His face flushed crimson as he exploded, "Evelyn! What the hell was that? Have you completely lost your mind? How could you humiliate Serena like that?"

Evelyn batted her lashes, feigning innocence. "Humiliate her? Oh, Dylan, you misunderstand. I was simply helping her sober up. Isn't that what friends do?"

Dylan scoffed, his anger barely restrained. "Sober her up? That was a cheap shot, and you know it!"

"Enough, Dylan," Serena interjected suddenly, her voice soft but firm. She dabbed at her damp face with a tissue, offering Evelyn a weak, apologetic smile. "Mrs. Black was only looking out for me. I... I made a fool of myself earlier. I shouldn’t have drunk so much."

Her voice trembled, laced with vulnerability, her expression painted with remorse. The contrast between her fragile demeanor and Evelyn’s unshaken confidence made the latter appear almost ruthless in comparison.

But Evelyn didn’t care. With a saccharine smile, she patted Serena’s shoulder. "Then perhaps next time, Miss Cole, you’ll remember your limits. If you forget again, I’d be more than happy to... assist you once more."

Serena’s smile faltered, her eyes flickering with something unreadable.

At that moment, Nathan rose from the sofa and strode toward Evelyn. "We’re leaving," he stated coolly.

Evelyn barely spared him a glance. "You go ahead. Natalie and I aren’t finished yet."

Without waiting for his response, she turned to her best friend. "Shall we?"

"Absolutely," Natalie replied with a grin, and the two women walked away, leaving a heavy silence in their wake.

Nathan remained rooted in place, his gaze tracking Evelyn’s retreating figure, his expression unreadable.

From the sidelines, Theodore exhaled sharply, shaking his head. "What the hell happened to her in those three years abroad? She’s not the same Evelyn anymore."

Yet, even he couldn’t deny—this new version of her was utterly magnetic.

Back in their private booth, Natalie burst into laughter. "That was brilliant. Serena won’t dare pull that drunken damsel act again anytime soon."

Evelyn chuckled softly but said nothing more. They lingered a while longer before parting ways for the night.

When Evelyn stepped into the Black family mansion, the faint glow of the television in the living room caught her attention. She paused, curiosity piqued, and made her way toward the source of the light.

There, Leonard Grant was sprawled across the sofa, dozing lightly, the flickering screen casting shadows over his peaceful face.


###Chapter 95

"Leonard? Leonard?" Evelyn whispered, gently shaking him awake.

Leonard blinked his eyes open, his lips curving into a soft smile when he saw her. "Evelyn, you're home."

Evelyn's voice was tender as she spoke. "It's late. Why are you still up?"

"I must've dozed off watching the news," Leonard lied, though the truth was he had waited for her return.

After a beat, he asked, "Where were you so late? Did something happen?"

Evelyn settled beside him with a quiet sigh. "Natalie and I went out for drinks."

At that, Leonard's gaze sharpened. "Did someone upset you? If anyone dared—just say the word, and I'll handle it." His protective tone sent warmth flooding through her chest.

Evelyn nodded. "Don't worry, Leonard. I'm not the same person I used to be. I won't let anyone walk over me. But if I need help, you'll be the first to know."

"Good." Leonard exhaled, some of the tension leaving his shoulders. "Alright, it's late. You have work tomorrow. Get some rest."

Evelyn stood. "Let me help you to your room first."

Leonard chuckled. "Fine, fine."

After making sure Leonard was settled, Evelyn retreated to her own room. She showered quickly and collapsed into bed without checking if Nathan had returned. The alcohol pulled her under almost instantly, her exhaustion and the lingering buzz sending her into a deep, dreamless sleep.

The next morning, at Grandview General Hospital’s Cardiac Surgery Department, Evelyn resumed her usual routine. Lila’s absence for the past two days didn’t surprise her. A cold smirk flickered across her lips before she pushed the thought aside.

She had just finished her rounds when her phone buzzed. Her fingers stilled as she glanced at the caller ID. After a brief hesitation, she answered.

It was Diana.

"Can we meet for lunch?" Diana’s voice was clipped, no pleasantries offered.

Evelyn’s grip tightened slightly on her phone. "Of course."

"Happer Restaurant at noon."

"Understood."

Diana hung up without another word.

Evelyn exhaled slowly, her lips pressing into a thin line. The coldness in Diana’s tone hadn’t escaped her. It made sense—after everything that had happened with Lila, how could Diana not be upset? With a bitter twist of her lips, Evelyn tucked her phone away and forced herself back to work.

At noon, inside the elegant confines of Happer Restaurant, Diana sat across from Evelyn, her expression unreadable. After a long silence, she finally spoke. "I want to hear your side of what happened."

Evelyn met her gaze evenly. She had expected Diana to demand an apology outright.

Calmly, Evelyn recounted the incident, sticking strictly to the facts.

As she spoke, Diana’s brows furrowed slightly. Evelyn’s version differed from what Victor had told her. With no surveillance in the dining room and Diana absent during the altercation, the truth hinged entirely on conflicting testimonies.


###Chapter 96

The silence in the room stretched on, thick and heavy.

Finally, Evelyn broke it with a soft, humorless laugh. "You came here to ask me to apologize to Lila, didn't you?"

Diana met her gaze steadily, her voice calm but firm. "I came for the truth."

"The truth?" Evelyn's tone turned sharp, laced with bitterness. "Good luck finding that. No cameras in the dining room, just our word against hers. How do you prove anything?"

Diana didn’t respond immediately. After a beat, she exhaled slowly. "Evelyn, you’ve changed."

The Evelyn she once knew would never have retaliated against Lila like this.

Evelyn nodded, unflinching. "Yes, I have. And honestly? I don’t regret it. I’m done letting people walk all over me."

She leaned forward, eyes locked onto Diana’s. "Do you really think I’d deliberately scald Lila’s hand? Remember three years ago—when she accused me of pushing her on purpose? Victor beat me so badly I couldn’t sit for days. If I had actually hurt her this time, what would I gain? More of his disgust? And Nathan—you know how much I used to care about him. If I’d acted like a monster in front of him, what would he think of me?"

She had never voiced these thoughts aloud before. With Victor and Grace, it would have been pointless—they never listened. But Diana was different.

So far, Diana hadn’t once accused her of hurting Lila intentionally or demanded an apology.

Diana considered her words, then chuckled dryly. "And yet, the second time, you did pour that soup on her hand on purpose."

A faint, icy smile touched Evelyn’s lips. "If they were going to believe I did it anyway, why not give them what they wanted?"

Diana studied her for a long moment before shaking her head slightly. "You remind me of myself when I was younger."

Evelyn pressed her lips together, then spoke bluntly. "Diana, I’m not apologizing to Lila."

She paused, her voice hardening. "I won’t apologize for things I didn’t do. And for the things I did do? I stand by them."

Diana’s expression softened with resignation. After a brief silence, she sighed. "Let’s just eat."

The subject was dropped, and the meal continued in uneasy quiet.

Midway through, Evelyn excused herself to the restroom. As she finished and reached for the stall door, snippets of conversation drifted in from outside.

"Lila, I can’t believe your sister would do that to you—twice! You can’t let her get away with this!"

"Seriously, you should tell your father. He needs to teach her a lesson!"

Evelyn’s fingers stilled on the door handle.

###Chapter 97

Hidden within the restroom stall, Evelyn Hartley smirked, her arms crossed as she leaned casually against the wall, listening to the venomous words being hurled outside.

Lila Sinclair’s voice, soft yet insistent, cut through the chatter. "Don’t say that—she didn’t mean it. She just—"

"Didn’t mean it?" one of the women scoffed. "Who would believe that? She’s obviously jealous of you, trying to sabotage your happiness!"

"Exactly!" another chimed in. "Lila, you’re accomplished, admired, and adored by everyone. And your sister? A disgrace—an illegitimate daughter hidden away, ugly and despised."

"She must be seething with bitterness!"

Lila sighed. "That’s not true. It’s been three years. Evelyn isn’t the same person she used to be."

A derisive laugh followed. "Oh, please! How much could she possibly change? Just looking at her irritates me."

"Right! No amount of makeovers can fix her kind of ugly. She’s rotten to the core!"

"Lila, now you’ve got me curious," another woman purred. "Why don’t you bring her out sometime? I’d love to see this so-called transformation for myself."

"Let’s see if she’s still the same pathetic eyesore!"

The group erupted into cruel laughter, each adding their own mocking remarks.

A sharp glint flashed in Evelyn’s eyes as she pushed open the stall door and stepped out. The laughter died instantly as the women froze, their expressions shifting from amusement to shock.

Lila’s face paled when she spotted Evelyn. The others, however, recovered quickly, their smirks returning as they eyed her with malicious delight.

"Ms. Hartley," one of them greeted, her tone dripping with false sweetness.

Evelyn recognized her immediately—Felicity Chamberlain, from a minor noble family in Soling and one of Lila’s closest allies.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Oh? You recognize me?"

Felicity offered a simpering smile. "I had the pleasure of attending your debutante party hosted by the Hartley family years ago."

Evelyn gave a slow nod. "I see."

Then, with deliberate amusement, she turned her gaze to Lila, her lips curving into a dangerous smile. "Lila, aren’t you going to introduce me properly to your friends?"

All eyes snapped to Lila, waiting.

Lila’s jaw tightened, her fingers clenching at her sides. "She… She is—"

But the words stuck in her throat.

Evelyn’s smile widened. "Oh? Cat got your tongue?"

The tension thickened, the air crackling with unspoken hostility.


###Chapter 98

One of the women gasped, her face draining of color as realization struck.

Evelyn observed them with effortless poise, her crimson lips curling into a knowing smirk. "Evelie," she said, her voice deliberate and smooth, "was the nickname Marcus and Olivia gave me. But my real name is Evelyn Hartley."

Each syllable was enunciated with razor-sharp precision, leaving no room for doubt.

The moment "Evelyn Hartley" left her lips, the air in the restroom turned frigid.

Felicity and her companions gaped at Evelyn, their eyes widening in stunned disbelief as they took in her transformation. It was staggering.

The woman standing before them—confident, radiant, and effortlessly elegant—bore no resemblance to the timid, overlooked girl they had once mocked. It wasn’t just her appearance that had changed; her entire presence exuded power.

Evelyn’s gaze locked onto Felicity, her expression cool and unreadable. "Ms. Chamberlain," she began, her voice slicing through the silence, "now that I’m here, tell me—have I changed enough for you?"

Felicity’s face paled before flushing crimson with humiliation as she recalled her earlier insults.

Her lips quivered, her voice barely a whisper. "I—I didn’t mean what I said. It was just nonsense—"

"I know I was wrong," she stammered. "Please, forgive me!"

The other women rushed to chime in, their voices trembling. "We’re so sorry!" one blurted.

"We’ll never speak badly of you again!" the other added hastily.

Evelyn’s smile deepened, though her eyes remained icy. "Apologies are easy," she mused, tilting her head. "But they don’t feel very sincere, do they?"

Panic flickered across their faces as they exchanged nervous glances.

Lila, sensing an opening, stepped forward with feigned concern. "Evelyn, they didn’t mean it. You don’t have to—"

"Quiet," Evelyn cut in, her voice sharp as steel. "I wasn’t speaking to you."

Lila’s expression stiffened, though a smirk curled inside her.

Go ahead, Evelyn, she thought. Show them exactly how ruthless you can be.

Felicity swallowed hard before whispering, "Then... what do you want us to do?"

Evelyn’s smile turned razor-thin. "Since you all seem so eager to slander me," she said lightly, "why not start by washing out those filthy mouths of yours? The sink is right there."

Shock rippled through them, their faces blanching in humiliation. But the fear of what Evelyn might do if they refused outweighed their pride.

After a tense pause, they shuffled toward the sink, turning on the faucets with trembling hands.

"Harder," Evelyn’s voice snapped like a whip, making them flinch. "What’s the matter? No strength left? Do you need me to help?"

Their scrubbing grew frantic, the sound of running water filling the silence.

Evelyn watched, her satisfaction hidden behind an unreadable mask.

This was only the beginning.


###Chapter 99

Trembling with fear, the women scrubbed their lips with desperate vigor, the brutal punishment stretching on until their mouths were raw and throbbing.

At last, Evelyn raised a hand, her voice icy. "That's sufficient."

The three women stood before her, their hair disheveled, makeup ruined, lips swollen and crimson from the relentless scrubbing.

Evelyn tilted her chin up, her gaze unyielding. "Do as you please—defend Lila, slander me again, even spread this little incident to anyone who’ll listen. But remember this: I won’t retreat."

With that, she turned sharply and strode away, leaving behind a suffocating silence.

The moment Evelyn disappeared, the women sagged in relief, their breaths shaky.

"Are you okay?" Lila rushed forward, her face a mask of false concern as she handed them tissues.

Felicity gave a weak nod, though her fingers trembled as she dabbed at her ruined lips.

"I'll live," she muttered, wincing.

Lila sighed dramatically. "I'm so sorry. This is all my fault. I should’ve stopped her. Evelyn went too far."

Felicity shook her head. "It’s not your fault, Lila. We shouldn’t have spoken carelessly. Besides, we’re just unlucky Evelyn overheard us."

Another woman, still shaken, whispered, "Honestly, I’d rather endure this than have our families suffer the consequences."

Lila blinked, feigning ignorance. "What do you mean?"

"Lila, haven’t you heard what happened to the Reeves family?" Felicity lowered her voice, eyes darting around.

"What happened?" Lila’s tone was laced with false curiosity.

Felicity exhaled sharply. "Dylan was badmouthing Evelyn at a gala, and Mrs. Caldwell overheard. The Caldwells immediately cut all business ties with the Reeves family!"

Another woman chimed in, voice hushed. "It was that massive luxury resort deal. The Caldwells were ready to sign with the Reeves, but they pulled out the moment they heard what Dylan said. Now they’re searching for a new partner."

Lila’s face paled. She couldn’t believe it.

How could the Caldwells go to such lengths for Evelyn? Canceling a multi-million-dollar deal just to defend her? A wave of bitter envy crashed over Lila.

Why did the Caldwells value Evelyn so much? She was nothing but an illegitimate child of the Sterling family. Wasn’t it humiliating for them to associate with her?

Another woman added quietly, "After what happened to the Reeves, my father warned me to stay on Evelyn’s good side. He even suggested I befriend her—but at the very least, never cross her."

"Mine too," the third woman murmured. "Same exact warning."

Lila clenched her fists, her mind racing.

This wasn’t over.


###Chapter 100

Lila Sinclair leaned in, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "I had planned to use that incident to ruin her reputation, but now..."

"I don't think that's wise. I'm sorry, Felicity, but we need another approach."

Felicity Chamberlain's words were cautious, but Lila, though seething inside, kept her expression serene. She smiled sweetly, her tone dripping with false warmth. "Oh, Felicity, no need to apologize. Besides, I’ve already forgiven Evelyn. We’re sisters, aren’t we? How could I possibly hold a grudge?"

Her words were honeyed, but beneath them lay venom.

Today’s gathering had been meticulously orchestrated—a perfect stage to twist the narrative of her suffering, knowing full well these women thrived on gossip. Once the rumors spread, Evelyn’s reputation would be in tatters.

Lila had been confident in her plan. Even if the Caldwell family intervened later, it would be too late. The damage would be irreversible. And since she wasn’t the one spreading the whispers, no blame could be traced back to her.

But fate had other plans.

Running into Evelyn had shattered everything.

Now that Evelyn’s hidden status had been revealed, none of these women would dare cross her. Lila’s carefully constructed scheme crumbled in an instant, leaving her simmering with frustration.

After the tense encounter, Evelyn returned to the dining area without mentioning the incident to Diana. She simply resumed her meal in silence.

As they finished, Diana dabbed her lips with a napkin and turned to Evelyn with concern. "Evelyn, what really happened between you and Lila? You used to speak so highly of her—trusted her completely. What changed in these past three years?"

Evelyn met her gaze, her smile tinged with quiet bitterness. "I just saw things for what they were. Sometimes, those who claim to stand by you... don’t."

Her eyes drifted, lost in thought for a moment. "People’s hearts are complicated. I won’t be fooled again."

The weight behind her words made Diana frown, but before she could press further, Evelyn stood. "I have an afternoon shift at the hospital. Goodbye, Diana."

Without waiting for a reply, she gathered her things and left, her steps quick and decisive.

On her way back to the hospital, Evelyn’s phone buzzed. It was Leonard Grant, summoning her to a family dinner that evening—urgent, he insisted.

Curious, she agreed. Leonard rarely demanded her presence so firmly. Something significant must be happening.

After finishing her duties without delay, Evelyn drove straight to the Grant estate.

As she stepped inside and saw the faces gathered in the living room—three familiar yet unexpected figures—her expression shifted subtly.

Recognition flickered in her eyes.

So. They had returned.


###Chapter 101

The moment Damian Grant, Leonard’s eldest son, laid eyes on Evelyn Hartley, a flicker of confusion crossed his sharp features. "And this is…?" he asked, his tone laced with uncertainty.

Leonard chuckled warmly, his gaze shifting between them. "This is Evelyn. You don’t recognize her now, do you?"

Damian’s eyes widened in disbelief. "Evelyn?"

Evelyn offered him a small, polite nod before turning to the elegant woman seated beside him. "Rosalind," she greeted, her voice cool and composed.

The family of three before her consisted of Leonard’s eldest son, Damian, his daughter-in-law Rosalind Black, and his grandson Adrian Grant.

Damian and his sister, Georgina Grant, were Leonard’s children from his first marriage. After their mother’s passing, Leonard had remarried. His second wife, Margaret—nearly two decades his junior—had given birth to his youngest son, Nathan.

Damian had spent years living abroad, though the reasons were rarely discussed, while Georgina had married into a prominent family in Soling and seldom visited.

Rosalind acknowledged Evelyn with a measured nod, her surprise carefully concealed. Meanwhile, Adrian, seated beside his mother, studied Evelyn with a mix of awe and delight. The transformation in her appearance stunned him—she was breathtakingly beautiful, exactly his type.

"Evelyn," Adrian said, his voice dripping with something unreadable.

Evelyn met his gaze briefly, her expression icy, a glint of disdain flashing in her eyes. To her, Adrian was nothing more than a notorious playboy, infamous for his string of fleeting romances.

Rumors swirled that several of his ex-lovers had ended up pregnant, situations Damian had discreetly handled. In the past, Adrian hadn’t spared Evelyn a second glance, always regarding her with dismissive smirks.

Just as Damian opened his mouth to speak, the butler’s voice echoed through the hall, announcing Nathan’s arrival. The atmosphere shifted instantly, tension thickening the air.

Damian’s expression remained neutral, but a flicker of coldness darkened his gaze.

Nathan strode into the room, his demeanor calm, his sharp eyes sweeping over Damian’s family without a hint of surprise. He had expected their presence.

Damian rose first, forcing a polite smile. "Nathan, you’re back."

Nathan, however, met his brother’s forced warmth with an icy stare. His voice was razor-sharp. "Why are you back?"

The room plunged into an uncomfortable silence.

Three years ago, Nathan and Damian had been locked in a brutal power struggle. Damian’s defeat had led to his exile from the country.

Damian’s jaw tightened, his dark eyes lingering on Nathan, but he remained silent.

It was Rosalind who finally broke the tension. "Damian’s health hasn’t been the best lately. He underwent surgery not long ago. And with Leonard getting older, we thought it best to return and spend more time with him."

Leonard turned to Damian, concern etching his features. "You had surgery? What happened?"

"Nothing serious, Father. Just a minor procedure," Damian replied with a weary sigh. "I’m fine now. Though I must admit, I’m not as resilient as Nathan. Age catches up to you. Even a simple surgery felt like an ordeal."

He paused, his voice softening. "At this stage in my life, who knows how much time I have left? I don’t plan on returning to Grey Crest. I want to stay here—to take care of you."

The unspoken tension between the brothers crackled in the air, a silent battle of wills beneath the veneer of civility.

###Chapter 102

As Damian's words hung in the air, the grand living room fell into a heavy silence.

Leonard remained quiet, merely lifting his gaze to meet Nathan's. It was obvious this decision rested solely with Nathan. Years ago, during that pivotal incident, Leonard had vowed never to interfere in such matters again.

Nathan shattered the stillness with a low chuckle. "So, Damian, you're considering coming back?"

Damian nodded. "Yes. The years are catching up to me, and keeping pace with everything has become... challenging. I'd like to return and spend more time with Dad. He's getting older, and having family close would mean the world to him."

After a brief pause, he added, "As for my position at the company, you're in charge. Place me wherever you see fit."

Evelyn barely suppressed an eye roll. Damian was clearly playing the sentimental card by bringing up Leonard. Yet, his willingness to submit to Nathan's decision showed he was prepared to concede—at least on the surface.

Nathan's expression remained unreadable; Damian's words didn't seem to faze him in the slightest. He responded with a faint, almost indifferent smile. "If you're eager to return, Damian, then by all means, do so."

The moment the words left his lips, everyone—except Evelyn—stared at him in stunned silence. No one had expected him to agree so easily.

But Evelyn knew better. Nathan wasn’t finished.

In that same casual tone, he continued, "You'll start at Silvercrest tomorrow."

"Silvercrest?" Damian's face tightened. "That’s nothing but a failing subsidiary!"

Indeed, Silvercrest was a minor branch of the Black empire, notorious for its underperformance.

"Exactly," Nathan replied smoothly. "Is that a problem? Are you refusing the position?"

Damian’s eyes narrowed slightly, catching the unspoken challenge in Nathan’s tone.

He had been certain that, despite everything, Nathan would secure him a managerial role within Black Enterprises. Never had he imagined being relegated to a struggling, insignificant subsidiary!

Yet, after a tense pause, Damian forced a smile. "I’ll take it. Nathan, you’re the CEO. I trust your judgment and will follow your lead."

The two brothers locked eyes, the air between them crackling with unspoken tension.

Nathan had agreed to Damian’s return for two reasons. First, he was curious about Damian’s true motives. Second, he knew Leonard, despite his stoic exterior, deeply missed his eldest son. Margaret had once confided that she often found Leonard awake late at night, staring at an old photograph of him and Damian, his sighs heavy with regret.

Hearing the exchange, Leonard’s face lit up with genuine joy. "Wonderful! Then it’s settled. Now that we’re all together, let’s have dinner."

His happiness was palpable. Though he rarely drank these days, he instructed Winston to bring out a bottle of his finest wine—tonight was a celebration.

Dinner progressed in a surprisingly warm atmosphere. Midway through the meal, Adrian unexpectedly placed a piece of fish on Evelyn’s plate.

"Here, Evelyn. Try this."

Evelyn eyed the fish warily before, without hesitation, sliding it onto an empty plate nearby. "Sorry. I don’t eat fish."


###Chapter 103

Adrian Grant was taken aback by Evelyn Hartley’s blunt refusal. Though irritation flickered in his eyes, he forced a tight-lipped smile and muttered, "Fine."

Nathan Black shot his nephew a sharp, warning glare, his piercing gaze demanding an explanation.

After dinner, Nathan stepped outside for fresh air, Evelyn retreated to her room, and Damian Grant’s family lingered in the living room, enjoying Leonard Grant’s company.

Noticing Adrian’s relentless questions about Evelyn, Damian’s brows furrowed deeply. The moment Leonard excused himself to the restroom, Damian seized Adrian’s arm and dragged him aside. "Why the sudden interest in Evelyn? What game are you playing?"

Adrian’s lips curled into a roguish smirk. "Father, don’t you think Evelyn is absolutely breathtaking now?"

Damian’s expression darkened instantly. His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Listen carefully—you stay away from her. She’s Nathan’s wife."

Adrian’s grin only widened, mischief dancing in his eyes. "Exactly. She’s Nathan’s wife—my uncle’s beloved spouse. That’s what makes this so thrilling."

He leaned back, crossing his arms with a wicked gleam. "Imagine this—Evelyn falls madly for me, demands a divorce from Nathan, and swears she’ll marry no one else. Wouldn’t that be deliciously scandalous?"

For a heartbeat, Damian was speechless at his son’s audacity. Then his face twisted in fury. "Shut your mouth, you insolent brat! If your grandfather hears even a whisper of this, he’ll make sure you regret it for the rest of your miserable life!"

Adrian merely shrugged, unfazed. "Relax. We’ll just ensure he never finds out. Some things are best kept… discreet."

Damian’s jaw clenched. "Drop this madness. Now."

Rolling his eyes, Adrian waved him off. "Fine, fine. Message received."

With that, he sauntered back to the living room, leaving Damian seething. Yet, as silence settled, Adrian’s words planted a treacherous seed in Damian’s mind.

A slow, calculating smirk tugged at Damian’s lips before he followed his son inside.

That night, the Grant family remained at the Black estate. A soft knock interrupted Damian’s solitude. He opened the door to find a shadowed figure waiting. With a knowing glance, Damian stepped aside, allowing the man entry before leading him to the balcony.

The night air was crisp as the man bowed respectfully. "Sit," Damian commanded.

"Thank you, sir," the man murmured, taking a seat.

Leaning against the railing, Damian’s gaze turned shrewd. "Tell me—how are things between Nathan and Evelyn these days?"

The man hesitated, caught off guard by the question. After a beat, he cleared his throat. "Not well. They were set to finalize their divorce, but Leonard’s asthma attack delayed it. Still, both seem determined to proceed."

He paused, then added carefully, "Rumor has it Leonard struck a deal with Nathan. For one month, Nathan must comply with all of Leonard’s arrangements regarding Evelyn. If, after that, Nathan still wants the divorce, Leonard won’t interfere further. Then Nathan will be free to marry… whoever he truly loves."

###Chapter 104

Damian Grant's lips curled into a sly smirk. "The woman he loves?" His voice dripped with amusement. "That would be Serena Cole, wouldn't it?"

The man standing before him nodded. "Exactly. Years ago, Nathan Black nearly tore the family apart over her. But lately… he hasn’t mentioned her much."

Damian said nothing, though the glint in his eyes sharpened. If Serena still held Nathan’s heart, then as his elder brother, he would naturally… help him along.

After a few more questions, Damian dismissed the man. Alone, he pulled out his phone and typed a quick message: "Original plan postponed. New target acquired."

When Nathan returned to the bedroom, Evelyn Hartley was seated at the desk, absorbed in a book. At the sound of his footsteps, she glanced up. "Are you really okay with your brother coming back?"

Nathan strode deeper into the room, his voice rough. "Of course."

Evelyn rose, closing the distance between them, her brow furrowed. "Damian shows up out of nowhere, turns down opportunities abroad to stay in Owathe, and you just hand him a position in a subsidiary—which he accepts without hesitation. Doesn’t that strike you as suspicious? He clearly has an agenda, and it’s aimed at you. Yet you’re just… letting him?"

Nathan met her gaze, unfazed. A slow, knowing smile played on his lips. "Are you worried about me?"

The question caught Evelyn off guard.

Was she?

Maybe. She remembered the brutal feud between Nathan and Damian years ago—the sleepless nights, the whispered strategies, the two assassination attempts Nathan had barely survived. No proof had ever tied Damian to them, but neither of them doubted who was responsible.

Evelyn lowered her lashes, her voice steady. "I’m just curious."

"Curious?" Nathan chuckled, the sound dark with disbelief. His eyes gleamed with something unreadable. "Oh, I know he’s plotting something. But I’m curious too. Three years have passed—let’s see what new games he thinks he can play."

Evelyn exhaled silently. The tension in her shoulders eased. This wasn’t the same Nathan from three years ago. If he’d allowed Damian back, it meant he’d already calculated every risk.

She met his gaze again, shifting the subject. "One more thing—does your father already know what happened at the Sterling estate that night?"

She’d meant to ask yesterday, but Nathan hadn’t come home until long after she’d fallen asleep.

"Yes," Nathan answered flatly. "Victor Sterling dragged Lila straight to Leonard’s house to complain."

Evelyn suppressed a sigh. She’d suspected as much. Leonard Grant must have heard something—why else would he have confronted her earlier? What did surprise her, though, was Victor’s eagerness to throw her under the bus.

What a wonderful father.


###Chapter 105

Victor Sterling seemed determined to make her life a living hell. Evelyn Hartley knew that to him, only Lila Sinclair mattered. Whether she found happiness or drowned in misery was of no consequence to him.

When Nathan Black noticed the bitterness in Evelyn’s expression, his brows furrowed slightly. His tone was calm but firm. "My father wrote them a check for five hundred thousand. Medical expenses and a bribe to keep their mouths shut about the matter."

Evelyn’s eyes widened. "He did?"

She hadn’t expected Leonard Grant to do that. For a moment, she was speechless. The icy weight she had carried since the incident began to thaw. Warmth spread through her, softening the edges of her hardened heart.

Seeing the subtle curve of her lips, Nathan scoffed in disdain.

Her emotions were so damn fickle.

The Next Day
Grand Ins General Hospital, Cardiac Surgery Department

Every doctor in the department had been summoned for an emergency meeting. The night before, a high-risk elderly patient had been admitted, and now, the team gathered to assess the case and determine their next steps.

Dr. Dominic Pierce, the head of Cardiac Surgery, began his briefing with measured precision. "The patient, Walter Kingsley, is 85 years old. A year ago, during a routine check-up, he was diagnosed with Type B aortic dissection. We performed surgery at the time, sealing the tear with a stent. However, early this morning, he was rushed back in with severe chest pain. His blood pressure had spiked to 190, and further tests confirmed the dissection has progressed toward the heart—now a Type A aortic dissection."

He paused, letting the gravity of the situation sink in before continuing. "The CT scan shows involvement of the ascending aorta and the entire aortic arch. Additionally, a 5-centimeter aneurysm has formed. Given its rapid growth, the risk of rupture and sudden death is imminent. Surgery is non-negotiable."

A heavy silence settled over the room. The doctors exchanged uneasy glances, but no one dared to speak. Type A aortic dissection was notorious—a death sentence, even under the best circumstances. For an 85-year-old with hypertension and other complications, the odds were even more daunting.

The silence stretched until Vivian Cross finally spoke up. "Dr. Pierce, if you were to perform the surgery, what would the success rate be?"

Dominic’s frown deepened. The question clearly irritated him, but seeing the expectant stares, he reluctantly answered, "Thirty... No, forty percent." He had started to say thirty but adjusted, unwilling to admit just how dire the situation was.

The number did little to ease the tension. Forty percent was abysmal for a procedure of this magnitude.

"Dr. Pierce, don’t you think forty percent is too low?" Evelyn’s voice cut through the room, calm but unyielding.

Dominic’s sharp gaze snapped to her. He knew she was new—brought in under unusual circumstances. Rumor had it she had connections. She hadn’t gone through the standard examination process, yet Sebastian Holloway had assigned her directly to their team as a full-staff resident. That hadn’t escaped his notice.

Before Dominic could respond, Lila interjected, "Evelyn, Dr. Pierce is the best surgeon in this department. This surgery is incredibly complex. A forty percent success rate is already remarkable. Most wouldn’t even come close."

###Chapter 106

Dominic Pierce let out a derisive chuckle, his sharp gaze fixed on Evelyn Hartley. "What exactly are you implying? That you could lead this surgery?"

His voice dripped with sarcasm, but Evelyn remained unshaken.

A faint, knowing smile curved her lips. "I wouldn’t presume to suggest that, Dr. Pierce. However, I do know someone who could. If she took on this case, the success rate could exceed ninety percent."

A murmur of surprise rippled through the room. Evelyn’s bold claim ignited a spark of hope among the gathered doctors. Many already had an inkling of who she was referring to.

Dominic, however, scoffed sharply. "Ninety percent? That’s preposterous. Who is this supposed miracle surgeon?"

"Is it Star?" one doctor blurted out, barely containing his excitement.

Evelyn nodded. "Exactly—Star."

The room erupted in quiet exhilaration. "I knew it!" someone exclaimed.

"If Star takes this on, we have nothing to worry about. She’s more than capable!" another added.

As the murmurs of anticipation grew, Dominic’s expression darkened.

He knew exactly who Star was—the legendary surgical prodigy. Her reputation was so inflated that Dominic found it hard to believe she was as extraordinary as everyone claimed. There had been a time when her name dominated their department—endless discussions about her unparalleled skill, the impossible surgeries she’d conquered, the endless stream of patients begging for her expertise.

Lila Sinclair, sensing the shift in the room, interjected with a note of skepticism. "Even if Star could improve the success rate, think about the logistics. Getting her to agree to this surgery won’t be easy. And why should we outsource a case that belongs to our hospital?"

Dominic’s mood lifted slightly at Lila’s words, and a flicker of doubt crossed the faces of the other doctors.

"Exactly," someone muttered. "Star isn’t just sitting around waiting for our call!"

"I heard even Elsa Torres from Ascend couldn’t get Star to operate on her son," another added.

Evelyn, still composed, countered smoothly, "I understand your concerns. But Sebastian Holloway has connections with Star. She specializes in high-risk cases, and this one might just catch her interest."

The room buzzed with renewed excitement. "Wait—Sebastian Holloway knows Star personally? That’s incredible!" one doctor gasped.

"If that’s true, we might actually get to meet her!" another whispered eagerly.

Amid the rising enthusiasm, Dominic’s voice cut through like a blade. "I will be performing this surgery."

His tone brooked no argument, and the room fell silent, the other doctors exchanging uneasy glances.

Dominic pressed his lips together, his gaze steady. "Let’s be realistic here."

"First—can we even be sure Sebastian Holloway can convince Star to take this case? Second—if she does agree, how soon can she arrive? And third—do we have any concrete proof that her success rate is truly ninety percent?"

The room sank into contemplative silence.


###Chapter 107

When Dominic noticed this, a smirk tugged at the corners of his lips. This surgery was far too significant to simply relinquish. The patient was elderly—high-risk, complex—and the perfect opportunity to prove himself. Failure could be excused given the difficulty, but success would elevate his career to new heights. Most importantly, the patient, Walter Kingsley, was the father of the Director of Education.

Dominic was about to press his argument when the office door swung open, cutting the conversation short. A tall, authoritative figure stepped inside.

"Mr. Holloway, you're here."

"Mr. Holloway," the doctors chorused, rising to their feet in respect.

Sebastian Holloway wasted no time. "Walter Kingsley’s case is exceptionally complex. I forwarded his files to Star last night, and she’s agreed to take over. She’ll be arriving shortly with her team."

The room erupted in murmurs of disbelief and excitement.

"Oh my God! Is Star really coming? I can’t believe I’ll get to see her operate!"

"This is incredible! I’ve been waiting for this moment!"

While the others buzzed with enthusiasm, Dominic’s expression darkened. He turned to Sebastian, his voice laced with irritation. "Mr. Holloway, isn’t it unprofessional to hand over a case from our hospital to an outsider?"

Sebastian met his gaze evenly. "As long as the surgery is successful, does it matter who performs it?"

Dominic faltered for a moment before retorting, "But if something goes wrong, the hospital’s reputation will be at stake."

Sebastian offered a calm smile. "No need to worry. Star has personally reviewed the case and confirmed a ninety-eight percent success rate."

He then addressed the room. "Each department may nominate five individuals to observe the procedure."

Excitement surged through the gathered doctors.

"Please, Mr. Holloway, I’d love to observe!"

"Me too! I’ve studied all of Star’s techniques—this is a dream come true!"

Amid the clamor, Sebastian’s gaze briefly locked with Evelyn’s. Earlier that morning, around seven, he had sent her Walter’s case files. As a cardiothoracic surgeon himself, he understood the risks involved. Relief had washed over him when she agreed to lead the operation.

As the doctors debated who would get to observe, Evelyn slipped out unnoticed and made her way to the parking lot, where her team was already waiting.

Her assistant, Gabriella Vega, greeted her with fresh scrubs and a bright grin. "Finally, back in action! I’ve missed this."

Donovan Shaw, another assistant, nodded in agreement. "Same here."

Simone Laurent, the surgical instrument nurse, smirked. "Personally, I enjoy the breaks between surgeries."

Evelyn chuckled softly but said nothing.


###Chapter 108

The crisp rustle of fresh scrubs filled the air as Evelyn adjusted her disguise—wig perfectly in place, mask secured, and glasses perched on her nose. Every detail mattered.

Through a private entrance, the team of four moved like shadows toward the operating suite. In the sterile sanctuary of their exclusive prep room, Simone assisted Evelyn with the final touches—tying the surgical gown, securing the mask, adjusting the protective goggles, and smoothing the gloves over her slender fingers.

After the meticulous sterilization ritual, they entered the OR with practiced precision.

Next door, in the observation gallery, the selected physicians buzzed with barely contained excitement as the legendary Dr. Hartley’s team took their positions.

“That’s her? She looks barely out of med school!” one doctor whispered, eyes wide.

“I’ve read every paper she’s published, but seeing her in action? This is surreal,” another murmured, gripping his notepad like a lifeline.

“Her speed is unmatched. They say she operates like a metronome—flawless rhythm,” a third added, leaning forward.

Meanwhile, Dominic Pierce’s jaw tightened. At twenty-eight, he’d still been fumbling through his residency, yet here was Evelyn—younger than him—commanding an OR with the grace of a veteran. The whispers of her unbroken streak of successful complex surgeries gnawed at him.

Inside the OR, Evelyn’s voice was calm as she outlined the plan: aortic valve repair, sinus reconstruction, ascending aorta replacement, and total arch replacement. Once anesthesia took hold and the patient stabilized without complications, the dance began.

In the gallery, all chatter died. Every eye tracked Evelyn’s hands—each movement deliberate, each incision exact. The doctors barely breathed, unwilling to miss a single stitch.

Hours slipped by. Spectators shifted in their seats, muscles stiffening, but Evelyn’s focus never wavered.

“Heart rate steady.”

“BP holding.”

“Hemostatic clamp.”

Four hours in, Gabriella dabbed sweat from Evelyn’s brow. Yet her hands remained rock-steady, her concentration unbroken.

Then, the quiet command: “Begin closure.”

Donovan responded instantly, “On it.”

Just like that, the critical phase was over.

A stunned murmur rippled through the gallery.

“That’s it? Four hours?”

“Her precision—like watching a master violinist. No wasted motion.”

“No wonder they call her the best.”

As Donovan finished suturing and Evelyn stepped back, Dominic stood frozen. Words failed him. The sheer brilliance of her technique left him hollow with awe—and something darker, festering beneath.

###Chapter 109

The aftermath of the surgery was a blur of debriefs and hushed admiration, but Evelyn barely registered it. Her mind was already elsewhere—on the next case, the next life to save.

Yet as she peeled off her gloves, a familiar voice cut through the murmurs.

“Impressive work, Dr. Hartley.”

She turned. Nathan Black leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed, that infuriating smirk playing on his lips.

Evelyn’s spine stiffened. “I don’t recall inviting an audience.”

“Lucky for you, I’m hard to refuse.” His gaze flicked to the gallery, where Dominic still stood, staring. “Though I’m not the only one fascinated by your… technique.”

Her eyes narrowed. “What do you want, Nathan?”

He pushed off the door, stepping closer. “Dinner. Tonight. You operate like a machine—when was the last time you ate?”

A beat of silence. Then—

“Fine. But I pick the place.”

His grin widened. “Deal.”

As he sauntered away, Evelyn exhaled. She’d walked into that one.

But beneath the irritation, a traitorous thought flickered: This is a bad idea.

And yet—she couldn’t wait.

The moment Evelyn Hartley and Gabriella Vega stepped out of the private passage, having changed out of their surgical scrubs, a voice called out sharply behind them.

"Star."

Evelyn's fingers twitched at the sound. Slowly, she turned, her expression carefully blank.

Lila Sinclair stood there, her face alight with excitement, her manicured fingers clutching the hem of her white coat.

Evelyn’s glasses—crafted from specialized materials to alter the shape of her eyes—gave the illusion of rounder, softer features. Combined with the loose-fitting attire that concealed her figure, she was confident Lila wouldn’t recognize her.

Gabriella moved forward instinctively, shielding Evelyn slightly as she asked coolly, "Can we help you?"

Lila didn’t hesitate. "Star, you're my idol! I’ve admired you for years. It would be an honor—no, a dream—to become your apprentice. Please, will you take me under your wing?"

Evelyn nearly choked.

Lila Sinclair—her stepsister, the girl who had spent years belittling her—was now begging to be her student? The irony was so rich Evelyn had to bite the inside of her cheek to keep from laughing. Even Gabriella’s lips twitched, though she schooled her expression quickly.

"I don’t take apprentices," Evelyn said flatly.

Lila’s face fell, but she pressed on. "Please, just consider it! I graduated top of my class, I’ve assisted in dozens of surgeries—"

Evelyn held up a hand, silencing her. "Save your credentials. I don’t care."

Lila’s cheeks flushed. "But—"

"Even if I did take students," Evelyn continued, her gaze deliberately lingering on Lila’s badge, "you wouldn’t be one of them."

Lila stiffened. "Why not?"

Evelyn smirked. "Read your badge. The answer’s right there."

With that, she turned on her heel and walked away, Gabriella falling into step beside her.

Behind them, Lila stood frozen, her fingers curling into fists. She glanced down at the word emblazoned on her badge—Intern—and seethed.

She hated that title.

News of Star’s appearance at Grandview General Hospital spread like wildfire.

A single post detailing her four-and-a-half-hour aortic dissection surgery went viral within minutes. Attached was a photo—taken in the hospital parking lot—showing Star’s profile, her features slightly blurred, but Gabriella Vega beside her unmistakably clear.

The internet exploded.

"That’s Star?! She looks so young! Early twenties, max!"

"The rumors were true—she really is under thirty!"

"A literal genius. How is someone that young this skilled?"

Evelyn scrolled through the comments, lips curving in amusement.

Let them speculate.

The game had only just begun.

###Chapter 110

"Star! Is that really her? She actually came to Soling and performed surgery at Grandins General Hospital? I worship her! Damn, why did they take so long to release this news? If they'd posted earlier, we could've rushed to the hospital and caught her before she left!"

"Grandins General is elite! The fact that they secured Star speaks volumes about their reputation! Guess I know where I'm going if I ever need serious medical care!"

"Star is unreal! Type A aortic dissection is already one of the most complex surgeries with abysmal survival rates. And the patient was 85 with multiple comorbidities? Yet she wrapped it up in under five hours! She’s not just the best—she’s in a league of her own!"

"Anyone got Star’s contact? My father’s condition is critical. I’ll pay whatever she asks!"

"Same here! I need her email!"

For hours, the internet buzzed with desperate pleas to track down the enigmatic surgeon.

Meanwhile, in the CEO’s office of Blackstone Enterprises, Nathan Black was mid-conversation with Theodore Whitmore when the topic of Star came up.

"Star?" Nathan’s brow instantly furrowed.

"The very same—the surgical prodigy who turned you down. Twice," Theodore chuckled, amusement lacing his tone.

Nathan’s expression remained neutral, but the subtle tension in his jaw gave him away. Few dared refuse him, yet Star had done so without hesitation. Years ago, when Serena Cole’s mother faced a life-threatening heart condition, Nathan had sought Star out personally, convinced her skill was unmatched. His team had practically begged. Both times, she’d shut them down cold. It had infuriated him beyond measure.

"She operated at Grandins today?" Nathan asked, voice deceptively calm.

Theodore confirmed, "On an 85-year-old with a dissection. The head of cardiac there would’ve given the patient a 40% chance at best. Star? She reviewed the file, declared she could push it to 90%, and then delivered. Four and a half hours. Flawless." He paused, grinning. "Bold as hell, right? But she backed it up."

Nathan scoffed. "Bold doesn’t begin to cover it." Only someone with Star’s audacity would dare reject him—repeatedly.

Theodore added, "A photo leaked this time. Just her profile, masked and in glasses, but she looks young. Early thirties, max."

Nathan’s eyebrow lifted. Under thirty and already the most sought-after surgeon in the world? Unlikely.

"The hospital’s website crashed," Theodore continued. "Everyone’s scrambling to book her now."

Nathan wasn’t surprised. Chaos followed Star like a shadow. They wrapped up the call, but something nagged at him. On impulse, he pulled up the leaked photo.

His frown deepened. Even obscured, something about her posture, the way she held herself—it tugged at his memory. But no. He shook his head. Impossible. He was imagining things.

###Chapter 111

The golden hues of dusk painted the sky as Nathan casually leaned against the hallway wall, watching Evelyn approach. "I heard Star visited your hospital today?" he asked, his voice deceptively light.

Evelyn's eyes sparkled with genuine excitement. "She did! The entire department was buzzing about it!"

Nathan studied her reaction carefully. It was flawless—natural, unguarded. He exhaled inwardly, chiding himself for overthinking. A mere similarity in build meant nothing. Evelyn and Star couldn’t possibly be the same person.

As he fell silent, Evelyn’s smile remained steady, though her mind raced. Why had Nathan brought up Star? She forced herself to stay composed, unwilling to betray even a flicker of unease. Her thoughts drifted to an incident from last year…

Nathan’s assistant had reached out, requesting her expertise for a high-profile surgery in Askya. She had reviewed the case—routine, unremarkable. The wealthy always demanded the best for even the simplest procedures, and at the time, her reputation had been soaring. Without hesitation, she had declined.

Days later, Nathan himself had emailed her. Again, she refused.

Now, with him mentioning Star, she wondered if he had connected the dots. But his silence reassured her. Exhausted, she retired early.

Yet, hunger clawed at her in the dead of night. With a sigh, she padded downstairs to the kitchen. The fridge light flickered as she peered inside, unimpressed. Just as she was about to close it, a soft sound made her freeze.

She turned.

Adrian stood mere feet away, clad in a silk robe carelessly tied, his chest exposed. A smirk played on his lips.

"Midnight cravings, Evelyn?"

She ignored him, moving toward the cabinet where snacks were stored.

Undeterred, Adrian followed, crowding her space. "Mind grabbing something for me too?"

Evelyn didn’t dignify that with a response. She snatched a packet of cookies and shut the cabinet firmly. But when she turned, Adrian blocked her path.

Her voice was ice. "Move."

He tilted his head, feigning innocence. "So hostile. It’s just a small favor."

Her glare could have frozen lava. "Get it yourself."

Adrian’s smirk widened. "But you’re already here. Why not help me out?"

Evelyn didn’t answer. Instead, she stepped forward—fast—and drove her fist into his face.

The impact echoed. Adrian staggered back with a pained cry, clutching his nose. Without a backward glance, Evelyn strode past him.

###Chapter 112

Adrian’s muffled curses followed her up the stairs.

Evelyn didn’t slow down.

But halfway up, a hand seized her wrist—Nathan’s. His grip was firm, his expression unreadable.

"Care to explain?" he murmured.

Evelyn met his gaze evenly. "He was in my way."

Nathan’s eyes darkened. "That’s not what I meant."

Her pulse spiked. Had he seen through her?

Then his thumb brushed her knuckles—gentle, questioning. "You’re hurt."

Evelyn blinked. She hadn’t even noticed.

Nathan’s voice dropped lower. "Next time, let me handle him."

Before she could reply, footsteps sounded below. Adrian, glaring up at them, his nose already swelling.

Nathan didn’t release her wrist.

Adrian’s smirk returned, blood staining his teeth. "Well, isn’t this cozy?"

Evelyn tensed.

Nathan’s grip tightened—protective, possessive.

And Adrian’s eyes gleamed with something dangerous.

The game had just escalated.

Adrian Grant's cheek still burned from the slap, the sting of humiliation lingering beneath his skin. He hadn't expected Evelyn Hartley to retaliate so fiercely. He had assumed she would eventually submit—but instead, she had struck him with enough force to leave his pride smarting.

"Damn," he muttered under his breath, rubbing the tender spot. "This woman has fire."

Strangely, her defiance only intrigued him more. There was something thrilling about the idea of taming a woman who refused to be broken. A slow, cold smirk curled his lips as he whispered to the empty hallway, "This isn't over, Evelyn."

Meanwhile, Evelyn had already dismissed the encounter from her mind. After finishing her cookies, she returned to her room and slipped back into sleep as if nothing had happened.

The next morning, the Cardiac Surgery Department of Grand Hills General Hospital buzzed with activity. Evelyn walked alongside Vivian Cross as they made their rounds, stopping at each patient's room.

One patient, Franklin Middleton, leaned forward eagerly as they approached. "Dr. Cross, is it true that Dr. Star operated here recently?"

Vivian nodded. "Yes, that's correct."

Franklin's eyes lit up. "Can she perform my surgery too?"

The question sent a ripple of surprise through the other doctors present. Evelyn's gaze flickered briefly at the mention of Star, but Vivian remained unfazed.

Before yesterday, Vivian had only known Star by reputation. But after witnessing her surgical precision firsthand, she understood why the woman was internationally renowned. Star didn't just operate—she performed miracles.

So Franklin's request didn't shock her. If anything, it was expected.

"I'm sorry, Mr. Middleton," Vivian said gently, "but Dr. Star isn't available right now. She can't take your case."

Franklin wasn't deterred. "Please, ask your deputy director to contact her. Money isn't an issue—she can name her price!"

Vivian hesitated, caught off guard by his persistence. Sensing her struggle, Evelyn smoothly stepped in.

"Mr. Middleton, we appreciate your confidence in Dr. Star," she said with a reassuring smile. "But she specializes in particularly complex cases. Yesterday's patient was an 85-year-old with multiple complications—that's the kind of challenge she takes on. Your procedure, while serious, is well within Dr. Cross's expertise. She's an exceptional surgeon, and you'll be in excellent hands."

Another doctor chimed in, backing her up. "That's right. Dr. Cross is more than capable. There's no need to worry."

Franklin considered this, then finally nodded. "Alright, Dr. Cross. I trust you."

Vivian smiled. "Thank you, Mr. Middleton."

Elsewhere in the hospital, Dominic Pierce navigated his own rounds with his team. They entered another patient's room, where a middle-aged man stood by the bedside.

"Mr. Whitmore," Dominic began professionally, "your father's surgery is scheduled for tomorrow at nine. Does that work for you? If there are any concerns—"

Before he could finish, Harrison Whitmore raised a hand. "There's no rush."

###Chapter 113

Dominic Pierce immediately noticed the tension in Harrison Whitmore's posture. "Is something troubling you?" he asked, his voice laced with professional concern.

Harrison met Dominic's gaze unflinchingly. "I've heard rumors," he began, his tone measured. "Did Dr. Star perform a surgery here yesterday?"

A brief silence followed as Dominic processed the mention of that name. Then, with a slight nod, he confirmed, "Yes, that's correct."

Harrison didn't hesitate. "Inform Sebastian Holloway that if he can arrange for Dr. Star to handle my father's surgery, I will personally fund a state-of-the-art research facility for this hospital."

The air in the room grew thick with shock. Dominic's expression shifted dramatically, his lips parting slightly in disbelief. Around him, the medical team exchanged stunned glances. A research facility—just for one surgery? The sheer audacity of the offer left them speechless.

Lila Sinclair, standing nearby, cleared her throat. "Mr. Whitmore," she interjected carefully, "I'm afraid that might be difficult. Dr. Star is... selective about her cases." She knew better than anyone how particular the renowned surgeon was—her admiration for Star bordered on reverence.

After a pause, Lila added, "But Dr. Pierce here is exceptional. His skills are nearly on par with Dr. Star's. You can trust him completely."

An awkward cough from one of the other doctors punctuated her words.

Harrison merely chuckled, unfazed. "Just relay my proposal to Sebastian."

Recognizing his unyielding stance, Dominic and Lila reluctantly agreed to pass along the message.

Later, instead of returning to his office, Dominic stormed toward the hospital gardens, his agitation palpable.

Lila, quick on her feet, followed him with a cup of coffee in hand. "Dr. Pierce," she said gently, placing the cup before him. "Don't let Mr. Whitmore's words get to you. Honestly, I believe you're just as skilled as Dr. Star."

Dominic glanced at her, appreciating the sincerity in her voice, and managed a small smile. "No need to comfort me," he replied lightly, though the weight of the comparison still pressed on him. He wasn't naive—he knew the gap between himself and Star was undeniable.

Lila sighed. "This isn't your fault. It's my sister's doing. That surgery should have stayed within our hospital, but she had to bring Star into it. I wouldn’t be surprised if Sebastian only contacted Star because of her."

She hesitated before adding, "My sister idolizes Star. She talks about her constantly."

Dominic's expression darkened as her words sank in. He couldn't blame Star, but his frustration toward the two people who had dragged her into this—Evelyn Hartley and Sebastian Holloway—was undeniable.

Sebastian, his former colleague in the Cardiac Surgery Department, had always been more rival than ally. Their strained relationship had only worsened over the years. And Evelyn? She had secured her position at Grand Plains General through Sebastian's influence, earning Dominic's disdain from the start.

Noticing his shift in mood, Lila hesitated before speaking again. "Dr. Pierce, don't let it bother you. No matter what, you're still the best surgeon in this department."

###Chapter 114

Dominic didn’t respond right away. His sharp gaze darkened slightly, lost in contemplation.

After a long pause, his expression softened, returning to its usual composed demeanor. "Alright, Lila. Don’t worry about me. You can go back to work now," he said, his voice steady.

"Okay." Lila nodded, offering him a small, hesitant smile before slipping out of the room.

At noon, inside the private dining room of The Sapphire Bistro, Evelyn stepped in to find several people already gathered.

The moment Evelyn entered, a woman perched elegantly on the velvet sofa sprang to her feet, her face lighting up with excitement. "You’re here!" she exclaimed, her voice warm and effervescent.

Evelyn inclined her head politely. "Ms. Blake."

Cassandra Blake waved a manicured hand dismissively, her lips curving into a playful pout. "Oh, Evelyn, please! No need for formalities. Call me Cassandra."

Evelyn offered a faint smile but remained silent.

Cassandra’s family had distant ties to the Donovans—her grandfather and Marcus Donovan’s father had been brothers, making them fourth cousins by blood.

Evelyn had only met Cassandra once before, at her own engagement banquet. Though their interaction had been brief, Ethan had later filled her in on the Blake family’s history. Cassandra’s grandfather had once saved Ethan’s father’s life, forging an unbreakable bond between their families.

That morning, Cassandra had called out of the blue, inviting Evelyn to lunch. Out of courtesy—and a sense of familial obligation—Evelyn had accepted.

With an enthusiastic flourish, Cassandra guided Evelyn toward the sofa. "Evelyn, I’d love for you to meet my brother, Julian."

Evelyn turned her attention to the man seated nearby. He appeared to be in his early thirties, with striking features and an air of quiet authority.

"Julian, this is Evelyn," Cassandra announced cheerfully.

Julian Montgomery extended a hand, his smile polite but warm. "A pleasure to meet you."

Evelyn shook his hand briefly. "Likewise, Mr. Montgomery."

"Perfect! Now that everyone’s here, let’s eat!" Cassandra clapped her hands together, ushering them toward the lavishly set table.

Once seated, Cassandra dominated the conversation, her attention laser-focused on Evelyn. "Is it true you’re working in the Cardiac Surgery Department at Grand Oak General? That’s incredible! I’ve heard it’s nearly impossible for doctors under thirty to get hired there. You must be extraordinary!"

Cassandra’s eyes sparkled with admiration, her praise effusive. Evelyn felt the weight of her scrutiny, her scalp prickling under the intensity. She managed a light laugh, brushing it off. "You’re too kind. I’m just doing my job."

Before she could say more, Cassandra’s expression shifted abruptly. Her eyes welled with tears, and within seconds, she was covering her mouth, her shoulders shaking with quiet sobs.

Evelyn blinked in stunned silence.

Julian cleared his throat, leaning forward. "I apologize for her behavior," he said smoothly. "Cassandra recently went through a rather painful breakup. She’s still… processing it. This isn’t about you."

"I’m sorry, Evelyn," Cassandra sniffled, dabbing at her eyes with a napkin. "I lost control for a moment. My boyfriend of three years left me last night—for someone else. I just… I can’t believe it. And then I thought—if only I were as accomplished as you, maybe he wouldn’t have left me. I—"

Her words dissolved into another wave of tears.

###Chapter 115
What now?


Evelyn pressed her lips together, drawing in a slow breath. "Ending things with someone like that might actually be for the best," she murmured, her voice gentle yet firm.

But Cassandra only dissolved into fresh tears. "Evelyn—" She flung her arms around Evelyn’s neck, burying her face against her shoulder as sobs wracked her body.

Evelyn tensed at the sudden embrace. She hadn’t anticipated such an emotional outburst, leaving her momentarily paralyzed, unsure how to react.

Thankfully, Julian stepped in, rubbing Cassandra’s back in soothing circles. "Come on, Cass, that’s enough," he coaxed softly. "No more crying, alright?"

It took several long minutes before Cassandra finally pulled away, wiping at her tear-streaked face. "I’m so sorry, Evelyn," she rasped, her voice thick with emotion. "I didn’t mean to break down like that."

"It’s fine," Evelyn replied with an awkward smile. "You’re upset—it’s understandable."

"Thank you," Cassandra whispered, dabbing at her damp cheeks.

Then, as if struck by inspiration, she looked up with pleading eyes. "Evelyn… would you—would you come with me to a bar tonight? Just for drinks? I really can’t be alone right now."

Evelyn blinked, caught off guard by the abrupt request. "I’m sorry, but I already have plans," she said politely. Something about Cassandra’s clingy demeanor set her on edge—the desperate sobbing, the unexpected embrace. The mere thought of spending an entire evening consoling her over drinks made Evelyn’s skin prickle. No, it was better to decline. They weren’t close, after all. Cassandra would be better off with friends or family.

Predictably, Cassandra’s face fell. "Evelyn… do you not like me? Is there a reason you don’t want to spend time with me?"

Evelyn hesitated, momentarily speechless. Finally, she sighed. "It’s not that. I really do have other commitments."

Julian intervened smoothly, and Evelyn could have kissed him for it. "Cass, don’t pressure her. If you want company, I’ll go with you."

"Fine," Cassandra mumbled before turning hopeful eyes back to Evelyn. "But we can still meet up another time, right? Maybe for shopping or lunch?"

"If I’m free, sure," Evelyn agreed.

Cassandra brightened instantly. "Perfect!"

The rest of the meal passed with Cassandra chattering aimlessly, though her attempts to engage Evelyn in conversation were painfully obvious. It left Evelyn wondering—what was Cassandra really after? When she finally asked why they’d been invited to this meal in the first place, Cassandra merely shrugged. "I just wanted us to spend time together."

But Evelyn wasn’t convinced. Something felt off. Still, since Cassandra offered no further explanation, Evelyn let it go.

As they left the private dining room and headed toward the elevator, Cassandra suddenly suggested, "Evelyn, let Julian drive you back to the hospital."

Evelyn opened her mouth to refuse—until she glanced up and froze.

Nathan, Theodore, Dylan, and Serena were walking straight toward them, their strides purposeful. Nathan’s gaze flicked to Evelyn, lingering just long enough to make her pulse stutter before he looked away, his expression cold and dismissive.

Evelyn’s throat tightened. The words of refusal died on her lips. Instead, she forced a polite smile. "Alright. Thank you, Julian."

###Chapter 116

Julian Montgomery’s polite smile deepened, warm and inviting. “The pleasure is all mine.” With that, the three of them walked away together.

Evelyn Hartley didn’t glance back at Nathan Black. She refused to give him the satisfaction.

Once Evelyn and her companions had disappeared from sight, Nathan’s brows furrowed, his expression darkening with something unreadable.

Inside the elevator, Evelyn exhaled slowly, trying to steady her racing thoughts. As the silence stretched, an idea suddenly struck her. She turned to Julian and Cassandra with a practiced smile. “Oh, I just remembered—I drove myself here. There’s no need for you to escort me home, Mr. Montgomery.”

Evelyn mentally cursed herself for her earlier agreement. What had she been thinking, accepting Julian’s offer right in front of Nathan? What had she hoped to prove?

Cassandra smoothly interjected, “It’s no trouble at all, Evelyn. Julian can still drive you. We’ll arrange for someone to bring your car back to the hospital later.”

Evelyn shook her head. “That won’t be necessary. I prefer to drive myself.” She glanced at her watch. “I’m already running late, so I’ll head back to the hospital on my own.”

She flashed them a quick, polite smile. “Thank you for the kind offer, though. Goodbye.”

Before they could protest, she gave a small wave and strode away, her steps brisk and determined.

Cassandra watched Evelyn’s retreating figure with a slight frown before turning to Julian. “What do you think of her?”

Julian’s gaze remained thoughtful. “She’s guarded. Extremely so.”

Cassandra nodded, considering his words. “Understandable. We’re practically strangers to her. Give it time—she’ll lower her defenses after a few more meetings.”

She hesitated before asking, “Do you think our plan will work?”

Julian tilted his head, his expression unreadable. “Do you doubt me?”

Cassandra’s lips curved into a faint smile. “Not at all.”

“Good,” Julian replied, his voice laced with quiet confidence. “Leave it to me.”

Cassandra said nothing more.

Later that evening, Evelyn worked late, returning to the Black family estate well past eight. As she stepped into the bedroom, her eyes immediately landed on Nathan, seated at the desk, his presence cold and commanding.

Evelyn barely spared him a glance before turning away.

“Who was the man you had lunch with today?” Nathan’s voice sliced through the silence like a blade.

Evelyn’s tone was icy. “That’s none of your concern.”

Nathan’s expression darkened instantly. “None of my concern? Don’t forget, Evelyn—we’re still married. To the world, you’re my wife.”

Evelyn turned to face him, her gaze as sharp as frost. “And does being your wife mean I’m forbidden from dining with other men?”

“Of course,” Nathan snapped.

Evelyn let out a soft, mocking laugh. “Before you start dictating my actions, Mr. Black, perhaps you should examine your own. Were you thinking about your marital status when you were dining with Serena Cole?”

Nathan stiffened, momentarily speechless.

###Chapter 117

Evelyn's lips curled into a mischievous smirk as a daring thought sparked in her eyes. Tilting her head playfully, she teased, "Or... Could it be that seeing me with another man has made you jealous, Mr. Black?"

At her words, Nathan's reaction was immediate—uncontrolled and raw. He shot up from his seat, tension coiling through his body like a spring. A heartbeat later, he schooled his expression into one of cool indifference, though the flicker of irritation in his gaze betrayed him. His voice dripped with disdain as he scoffed, "Jealous? If it were Serena, perhaps. But you?"

His eyes raked over her dismissively. "Why would I waste a single emotion on someone who means nothing to me?"

Evelyn held his gaze, though regret already twisted in her chest the moment the question left her lips. She knew better than to expect jealousy from him. His words, though predictable, still stung. Yet she forced a laugh, masking the ache with practiced ease.

She stepped closer, her voice a low, daring whisper. "Really? Not even a flicker?"

Nathan didn’t retreat, his piercing stare unwavering. The light caught in her eyes, sharpening their challenge. For a fleeting second, his breath hitched.

Then, coldly, he replied, "Not a single one."

The silence between them stretched, thick with tension. Without warning, Evelyn rose onto her toes, her arms looping around his neck, and pressed her lips to his in a bold, defiant kiss.

Nathan froze, shock rooting him in place as her warmth seared against him. His first instinct was to push her away, his hands gripping her shoulders—but Evelyn clung tighter, pulling him in until there was no space left between them.

For one reckless moment, Nathan’s resistance crumbled. His eyes fluttered shut as the kiss deepened, the heat between them undeniable.

Then, just as suddenly, Evelyn broke away. Nathan staggered back, his eyes snapping open, confusion and realization warring in his expression. The spell shattered, leaving only cold clarity in its wake.

His face darkened with fury. "Evelyn! What the hell was that? Who said you could—"

She cut him off with a smirk, her voice laced with challenge. "You claim to feel nothing, yet you closed your eyes. Tell me, Mr. Black—was that disgust? Or enjoyment?"

Nathan’s jaw clenched, his knuckles whitening. Before he could retort, Evelyn added smoothly, "Denial doesn’t suit you."

With that, she turned on her heel and strode toward the bathroom, shutting the door behind her without a backward glance. Nathan stared after her, his expression stormy. A vein pulsed at his temple as his fist slammed onto the desk with a deafening crack.

"Damn her!"

###Chapter 118

Evelyn had kissed him. And not only had Nathan failed to push her away instantly, but worse—he had surrendered to the kiss, losing all control. How could he have been so weak against Evelyn? The memory of her mocking gaze mere moments before made his chest constrict with irritation.

Drawing a steadying breath, Nathan stormed out of the room with long, purposeful strides, his mood dark as thunder.

Inside the bathroom, Evelyn braced herself against the sink, her face burning crimson. She turned the faucet on and splashed icy water onto her skin repeatedly, willing the heat to fade.

What had she done? She had kissed Nathan. Boldly. Recklessly. And it had been her first kiss!

The realization sent another wave of humiliation crashing over her, her cheeks flaming even hotter. She gripped the edge of the sink, forcing herself to steady her breathing.

It had just been an impulsive act, born from sheer frustration with Nathan’s infuriating indifference and maddeningly cool demeanor. That was all.

She had only wanted to see if he would break—if the ice in his veins would thaw, even just a fraction. But rationalizing it did nothing to calm the frantic rhythm of her heart. Her fingertips brushed against her lips, still tingling from the warmth of Nathan’s kiss. Shaking her head, Evelyn stripped off her clothes and stepped into the shower. The cold water cascaded over her, gradually cooling her flushed skin and quieting the storm inside her.

That night, Nathan didn’t return to the room, and Evelyn, despite her exhaustion, found her thoughts too tangled to surrender to sleep. After what felt like an eternity, she finally drifted into a restless slumber.

The next morning, the shrill sound of her alarm jolted Evelyn awake. She bolted upright, fumbling to silence it, her face instantly burning. She had dreamed about Nathan last night. And not just about him—but about the two of them, tangled together in passion. The vividness of the dream made her ears flush with mortification. Shoving the thought away, she scrambled out of bed, freshened up, and dressed in a hurry. Skipping breakfast, she left the house and drove straight to the hospital.

Arriving early, she headed to the cafeteria to grab a quick meal. The moment she stepped inside, she sensed something off. Conversations stuttered to a halt as eyes flicked toward her, and gazes lingered as she walked to the counter. Evelyn frowned slightly, puzzled by the sudden attention. She quickly bought her breakfast and found an empty table.

As she began eating, murmurs from nearby tables caught her attention.

"That’s her, isn’t it? The new doctor from the Cardiac Surgery Department—Evelyn Hartley?"

"Yeah, that’s her."

"The one with ties to Mr. Holloway."

"She’s stunning, no doubt. No wonder she’s getting special treatment."

"It’s ridiculous. The rest of us had to pass the hospital’s residency exam. But for her? A pretty face is all it takes to secure a permanent position here."

"My cousin has tried twice to pass that exam! I thought this hospital was supposed to be fair. Guess not."

"Exactly. And I heard her grades in med school were barely passing. How competent can she really be?"

"Keep it down! If she hears you and complains to Mr. Holloway, we’re finished."

"Right, let’s just drop it."

Evelyn’s grip on her fork tightened, her appetite vanishing.

###Chapter 119
Evelyn Hartley took a slow sip of her morning coffee, her face an unreadable mask. A faint, knowing smirk played at the corners of her lips.

She blinked once, processing the situation. So, this was how it was going to be. Initially, only the Cardiac Surgery Department had known about her connection to Sebastian Holloway securing her position at Grand Oaks General Hospital. But now, thanks to some well-placed whispers, the rumor had spread like wildfire through every corridor and break room.

Yet, Evelyn remained unshaken.

After finishing her breakfast, she made her way back to her department. As she changed into her scrubs in the locker room, the door creaked open.

"Evelyn."

The voice belonged to Elise Thornton, a thirty-three-year-old resident on Vivian Cross's team. The two women had always shared a friendly dynamic.

"Elise."

Evelyn acknowledged her with a nod.

Elise stepped closer, lowering her voice. "There's been a lot of talk today—mostly about you. They're saying you only got this job because of Mr. Holloway, and people aren't happy about it."

Evelyn continued fastening her white coat, her expression cool. "I caught wind of it over breakfast."

"And?" Elise pressed, concern flickering in her eyes. "What do you think?"

Evelyn shrugged lightly, her composure unwavering. "Not much to think about. I just need to do my job."

Elise exhaled, impressed. "You handle pressure better than anyone I know. If it were me, I’d be a mess."

She glanced around before leaning in further. "I think Dr. Pierce might be behind this."

Evelyn turned to face her fully, interest sharpening at the mention of Dominic Pierce.

Elise kept her voice hushed. "You're new here, Evelyn, so you might not know this yet, but Dr. Pierce is brilliant in the OR—flawless, really—but he’s also stubborn as hell. Ever since you suggested Dr. Star for the Kingsley surgery, he’s had it out for you. And your ties to Mr. Holloway don’t help—he and Dr. Pierce have never gotten along."

She paused, then added, "Put those two things together, and it’s no surprise he’d hold a grudge. And with the rumors spreading like this? Someone’s definitely stirring the pot on purpose."

Evelyn gave a small, measured nod. "Thanks for the heads-up, Elise."

"Don’t mention it. We’re on the same team, after all." Elise offered a reassuring smile before slipping out.

Evelyn’s gaze darkened as she considered the implications. She had no doubt Lila Sinclair was involved in this orchestrated gossip. And if Lila and Dominic were working together, this was only the beginning.

She adjusted her coat one last time, then stepped out of the locker room, ready for whatever came next.

###Chapter 120

The office whispers followed Evelyn Hartley like a persistent shadow, a mix of curiosity and judgment lingering in every glance. Yet she walked through the corridors of Triumph Consortium with an air of unshakable indifference, her chin lifted just slightly—enough to make it clear she couldn’t care less about the rumors swirling around her.

Her colleagues exchanged uncertain looks. Was she truly unaffected, or was she just that good at hiding it?

Meanwhile, in the CEO’s office, Serena Cole stepped inside, clutching a carefully packed lunchbox. The scent of home-cooked food filled the space as she placed it on Nathan Black’s desk with practiced ease.

"Nathan," she murmured, her voice soft with concern. "You’ve been working nonstop. You should eat."

Nathan barely glanced up from the contract in front of him, his expression unreadable. "Serena," he said, his tone firm but not unkind, "you don’t need to bring me lunch anymore."

The smile on Serena’s lips froze. Her fingers tightened around the edge of the desk. "Did I… do something wrong?"

"No," Nathan replied, still not meeting her eyes. "But this isn’t necessary. It’s too much trouble for you."

Serena shook her head quickly, her dark eyes shimmering with something desperate. "It’s no trouble at all. I want to do this for you."

She bit her lip, her voice dropping to a whisper. "I know you and Evelyn aren’t divorced yet. I know how this looks. But I can’t help it, Nathan. I miss you. I just want to see you, even if it’s only for a little while."

A beat of silence.

Nathan exhaled, his jaw tightening. He didn’t respond to her confession, didn’t react at all. Instead, he simply said, "Let’s just eat."

Serena’s breath hitched. She had expected something—gratitude, warmth, even guilt. But this? This was worse than indifference. It was like she hadn’t spoken at all.

Before she could say another word, a sharp knock interrupted them.

"Come in," Nathan called.

Sophie Bennett, his secretary, stepped inside. "Mr. Black, Damian Grant is here to see you."

Nathan’s gaze flickered with something unreadable. "Let him in."

Sophie nodded and left, but not before casting a discreet glance at Serena.

Serena stood abruptly, her face pale. "I should go," she said, forcing a smile that didn’t reach her eyes. "I’ll bring lunch again tomorrow, okay?"

Nathan opened his mouth—perhaps to refuse—but Serena was already walking toward the door, her steps just a little too quick.

###Chapter 121

The moment the office door clicked shut behind her, Serena’s composure cracked.

She pressed a hand to her chest, her breath coming in short, uneven gasps.

Why wasn’t it working?

She had played her part perfectly—the devoted lover, the selfless caretaker. And yet, Nathan hadn’t so much as flinched at her confession.

A cold dread settled in her stomach.

If she couldn’t break through his walls soon, everything she had worked for would crumble.

And she refused to let that happen.

Not when she was this close.

Her fingers had just brushed against the cool metal of the doorknob when the door burst open from the outside. Evelyn stumbled backward, her breath catching in her throat. When she steadied herself, her eyes met those of the man who had just entered.

A chill ran down Evelyn's spine. Damian Grant certainly hadn't expected to find her here. "Miss Cole," he said, his lips curling into that infuriating smirk she knew all too well. "What a pleasant surprise."

Evelyn forced a polite smile. "Mr. Grant."

"Leaving so soon?" Damian arched a brow, his gaze flickering over her with amusement.

"Yes, I wouldn't want to interrupt your meeting with Nathan. Enjoy your chat."

Without waiting for his response, she slipped past him and hurried down the hallway, her pulse racing. Behind her, she heard Damian's low chuckle as he stepped into the office.

Meanwhile, Sophie Bennett watched from her desk as Evelyn practically fled toward the elevators. Suspicion flickered in her eyes. After a moment, she pulled out her phone and typed a quick message, her fingers moving swiftly.

Evelyn Hartley had just settled into bed when her phone buzzed. The screen lit up with Sophie's message. A cold smile curved her lips as she read:

Mrs. Black, I saw Serena Cole bringing lunch to Mr. Black at the office today.

Evelyn replied with a simple, "Noted. Thank you, Sophie."

Sophie's response was immediate. "No need to thank me. I'll keep you updated if she shows up again."

Evelyn hesitated, then typed, "Alright." She set her phone aside and exhaled, sinking back into the pillows.

For once, she had left work on time and returned to the Grant family estate. After dinner, she had accompanied Leonard on a brief walk before retreating to her room.

Now, as the clock ticked past 10:30 PM, Nathan still hadn't returned. Evelyn frowned. She hadn't seen him since last night. Was he avoiding her? The thought made her lips twitch.

Maybe he's too embarrassed to face me.

The idea amused her, but as the hours dragged on and Nathan remained absent, she eventually drifted to sleep, the question lingering in her mind.

The next morning, she woke to an empty room. Her eyes gleamed with quiet amusement.

Fine. If he wants to play games, I can play too.

Since she had the day off, she decided to prepare a thermos of soup and visit Triumph Consortium. She was curious—would Serena be there again?

When she arrived, Evelyn strode into Nathan's office without hesitation. He was engrossed in his work and barely glanced up before snapping, "I told you, no more—" His words cut off abruptly as his gaze landed on her. His expression froze for a split second before shifting into something unreadable. He quickly looked away, pretending to focus on his laptop. "What are you doing here?"

Evelyn held up the thermos. "I brought you lunch."

"Take it away," Nathan said curtly, still refusing to meet her eyes.

Evelyn chuckled softly, about to respond, when a sharp knock sounded at the door.

###Chapter 122

"Come in," Nathan said, his tone curt and businesslike.

The door swung open to reveal Serena, her face brightening with a practiced smile as she stepped inside. "Nathan, I thought you might—"

Her words died on her lips the moment she spotted Evelyn standing in front of Nathan’s desk. Evelyn turned toward her with a deceptively sweet smile.

"What a pleasant surprise, Miss Cole."

Serena’s smile stiffened, but she recovered quickly. "Oh, Evelyn. I didn’t expect to see you here."

"Of course not," Evelyn replied, her voice light but laced with subtle challenge. "I brought lunch for my husband."

At the word husband, Nathan flicked a glance at Evelyn, his expression unreadable. A heartbeat later, he returned his attention to his laptop, feigning indifference.

Serena pressed her lips together, her grip tightening around the insulated lunch bag in her hand.

Evelyn’s gaze dropped to the bag, and her eyebrow arched in amusement. "Miss Cole, don’t tell me you’ve also brought lunch for my husband?"

Serena hesitated, then forced a polite nod. "Yes. My mother insisted on making Nathan’s favorite soup. She asked me to deliver it."

Evelyn’s smile widened, her eyes glinting with mischief. "How thoughtful of her. Truly." She tilted her head, feigning contemplation. "What a coincidence—I made soup for Nathan today too. Now we have a dilemma. What do you suggest we do?"

Her gaze lingered on Serena, waiting.

Serena’s smile was brittle, her irritation barely contained. Before she could respond, Evelyn seized the moment.

"Since it’s such a kind gesture from your mother, Miss Cole, it would be a shame to let it go to waste." She paused, then added with faux innocence, "And as it happens, I haven’t eaten yet. Would you mind if I took this one instead?"

Serena’s composure cracked for a fraction of a second, her fingers twitching around the bag. The audacity of Evelyn to claim what she had painstakingly prepared for Nathan! But with Nathan watching, she couldn’t refuse outright.

Nathan observed the exchange with an inscrutable expression, his lips pressed into a thin line. He hadn’t expected Evelyn to be this bold.

Serena forced a tight smile. "Of course, Evelyn. Enjoy it."

Evelyn’s grin was victorious as she plucked the bag from Serena’s grasp. "Thank you." She sauntered to the coffee table, unpacking the meal with deliberate relish.

She took a deliberate bite, humming in exaggerated delight. "Mmm, absolutely divine."

Serena’s nails dug into her palms.

###Chapter 123

The tension in Evelyn Hartley's jaw was palpable as she struggled to contain her rising anger. "I'm delighted you like it," she managed through gritted teeth.

Nathan Black, observing Serena Cole's composed demeanor, couldn't help but smirk at the unfolding spectacle.

After a few deliberate bites, Serena looked up at Evelyn, her tone deceptively light. "Miss Cole, next time you decide to bring my husband lunch, perhaps you could extend the courtesy to Grand Oaks General Hospital. For me."

Evelyn blinked, caught off guard. Serena batted her lashes, feigning innocence. "Just a friendly suggestion. After all, wouldn’t it be unfortunate if rumors started circulating about you bringing meals to my husband? You wouldn’t want to be misunderstood, would you? Including one for me would only enhance your reputation—generous, considerate, rather than… Well, you know what I mean."

Her words dripped with honeyed venom.

Evelyn’s expression darkened, her fingers tightening around her clutch. She glanced at Nathan for support, but he merely gave Serena a fleeting glance before turning away, deliberately distancing himself from the confrontation.

Suppressing her frustration, Evelyn forced a brittle smile. "I should be going. Enjoy your meal."

She turned sharply, eager to escape the suffocating tension.

"Oh, let me walk you out, Miss Cole," Serena said, rising gracefully, her tone light yet unyielding.

Evelyn stiffened. "That won’t be necessary."

Serena closed the distance between them in three effortless strides. "Nonsense. You’re our guest, after all," she purred, her politeness edged with steel.

The elevator ride down was thick with silence, the air between them charged with unspoken hostility.

Once they reached the parking lot, Serena finally spoke, her voice casual but laced with warning. "Miss Cole, your recent behavior has been… concerning."

Evelyn’s composure faltered. She met Serena’s gaze, unease flickering in her eyes.

Serena tilted her head, feigning innocence. "How many times must I remind you to stay away from my husband? And yet here you are, delivering lunch to his office. Are you deliberately provoking me?"

Her tone remained cool, betraying none of the fire beneath.

Evelyn’s lips pressed into a thin line, her neck flushing. "Mrs. Black, I apologize if I overstepped. I was merely concerned Nathan might be skipping meals."

"His eating habits are none of your concern," Serena cut in sharply, her voice glacial.

Evelyn stiffened, her retort dying on her lips.

Serena’s gaze hardened. "If this continues, Miss Cole, I’ll have no choice but to bring this matter to the attention of the Reeves family."

A dangerous glint flashed in Evelyn’s eyes before she laughed, low and mocking. "Is that really necessary, Mrs. Black? In twenty days, you and Nathan will be divorced."

###Chapter 124

Evelyn emphasized the words "twenty days" with a mocking lilt to her voice.

Serena's expression remained unshaken. "So what?" she shot back, defiance dripping from every syllable. "Until Nathan and I are officially divorced, I'm still his wife. And you, Miss Cole, are nothing more than a homewrecker!"

A storm of emotions twisted Evelyn's delicate features as she glared at Serena. "Who are you calling a homewrecker, Mrs. Black? Nathan loved me first."

Serena's laugh was light, almost breezy, as she countered, "Nathan and I are still legally bound, our marriage recognized and protected by law. And you, Miss Cole? You're just a ghost from his past—nothing more."

Evelyn's lips trembled, pressing into a thin line as she struggled to refute the undeniable truth in Serena's words.

Serena's composure didn't waver, her poise unbroken. "Once the divorce is finalized, you're free to chase after Nathan all you want. Do whatever your heart desires then. But until that day comes, I expect you to respect my marriage and stay away from him."

Her serene expression suddenly sharpened, her gaze turning glacial as she delivered a cutting warning. "Miss Cole, consider this your only caution. If I catch you summoning Nathan at odd hours or delivering meals to him like today, I won't hesitate to act. Don't test me."

With that, Serena turned sharply on her heel and stepped into the elevator without so much as a backward glance.

Evelyn stood frozen in the hallway, the world around her blurring as Serena's words echoed relentlessly in her mind. Her face paled, then flushed with the heat of humiliation and fury. The sheer power Serena held over her—simply by virtue of being Nathan's lawful wife—gnawed at her like a relentless beast.

Because Nathan and Serena were still married, Serena had every right to act as she did. And Leonard—oh, how Evelyn's resentment toward him burned at that moment! But as her initial rage began to ebb, a sliver of realization crept in. Only twenty days remained until the divorce was finalized. She reassured herself silently—soon, the tables would turn.

Once she was Nathan's wife, once the law was on her side, she would ensure Serena tasted the same bitter humiliation she had suffered.

Just as the thought crossed her mind, her phone chimed, snapping her back to reality. She pulled it out and read the message, her face draining of color in an instant.

"Meet me tomorrow night at ten, Room 3202, Sumner Hotel. Don’t be late."

Evelyn's hands trembled as she clutched her phone, the words glaring back at her like an omen of doom.

The message was terse, devoid of warmth, and it sent a chill down her spine.

She recognized the number immediately—it was him, the last person she expected to hear from now, the one who could unravel her already precarious world with a single word.

Her pulse hammered in her chest, a cold sweat breaking across her forehead as she processed the gravity of the summons.

With an unsteady breath, she steeled herself and walked away, her mind racing with dark possibilities.

Meanwhile, Serena sat calmly at the coffee table in Nathan's office, her focus entirely on her meal as if the outside world had ceased to exist.

Nathan, seated at his desk, cast her a fleeting, indifferent glance before returning to his work.

###Chapter 125

The moment Evelyn finished her meal, she rose gracefully and approached Nathan’s desk, her piercing gaze fixed on him.

"Nathan," she began, her voice slicing through the quiet of the room, "are you avoiding me?"

Nathan’s fingers stilled over the keyboard for a fraction of a second before he resumed typing, his eyes never leaving the screen.

"Why would I avoid you?" His tone was flat, deliberately detached.

Unfazed, Evelyn tilted her head slightly, a knowing smirk playing at the corners of her lips. "Who knows? Maybe you're feeling shy."

A derisive scoff escaped him. "Shy? Don’t be absurd. It was just a kiss." His fingers paused again as he finally met her gaze, his voice laced with icy indifference. "Besides, being kissed by someone I have no feelings for doesn’t make me shy—it disgusts me."

The word disgusts hung in the air like a slap, but Evelyn’s expression remained unreadable. Instead, she offered a serene smile, her composure unshaken.

"My apologies if it disgusted you," she replied smoothly. "It won’t happen again. I’ll leave you to your work now."

Without waiting for a response, she turned on her heel and exited the room, the soft click of the door sealing her departure behind her.

Nathan leaned back in his chair, his gaze lingering on the door long after she had gone. His jaw tightened, betraying a flicker of something far more complicated than the cold indifference he had shown.

He didn’t want to admit it, but Evelyn had been right. He had been avoiding her.

Reaching for the thermos she had left behind, he unscrewed the lid and took a slow sip of the soup. The moment the flavor hit his tongue, he let out a quiet, humorless laugh.

He knew Evelyn’s cooking—or rather, the lack of it. This soup wasn’t hers.

"Claims she made it herself," he muttered under his breath. "Liar."

Evelyn’s phone rang just as she stepped through the front door of her apartment.

Sebastian’s name flashed on the screen.

"Hello?" she answered.

"You’ve heard the rumors circulating around the hospital, haven’t you?" Sebastian cut straight to the point, his voice laced with dry amusement.

Evelyn arched a brow. "You’re keeping tabs on them too, then?"

"Of course," he replied, his tone shifting to something more serious. "What do you make of all this?"

###Chapter 126

With a soft chuckle, her voice laced with casual indifference, Evelyn replied, "I'm curious to see how this plays out."

Nathan, momentarily caught off guard by her response, let out an amused laugh before saying, "Exactly! Let's see what their next move is. They won't back down now. I'm genuinely intrigued by what they're trying to accomplish."

Evelyn, ever composed, responded coolly, "I'll stay right here and observe closely."

"Good," Nathan replied, approval evident in his tone.

Then, as if struck by a sudden thought, he added, "Lately, my phone hasn't stopped ringing."

"All of them desperate for the star surgeon’s expertise, I assume?" Nathan teased, a playful glint in his voice.

Despite the jest, Evelyn’s expression remained unreadable.

She answered smoothly, "Only notify me if there’s an exceptionally complex case that requires my skills. Otherwise, I have no interest in routine procedures."

"Don’t worry," Nathan replied with a smirk. "I know how to handle it. You’re our ace—we won’t play our best card without good reason."

Evelyn let out a quiet laugh but didn’t indulge the topic further.

Soon after, she ended the call with Nathan.

Not long after, another call came through—this one personal—and her demeanor instantly brightened.

"You're coming back tomorrow?" she asked, her voice noticeably lighter.

"That’s right. Can I trust you to pick me up at the airport by 11?"

The warm, velvety voice on the other end belonged to a man.

Evelyn’s smile deepened. "For your return, I’d cancel everything. Don’t worry—I’ll be there."

"That’s what I like to hear. See you then," came the reply.

"See you tomorrow," Evelyn said before resuming her duties, her steps noticeably lighter.

That evening, Nathan returned home, but the two didn’t exchange a single word the entire night.

The next morning, Evelyn arrived at the hospital, her energy renewed after a full night’s rest.

Rumors about her still swirled relentlessly through the corridors, yet she remained unshaken, her professionalism unwavering.

Her colleagues, watching her composed demeanor, couldn’t help but admire her unflappable grace.

After completing her morning rounds, Evelyn took a brief leave to head to the airport.

She hadn’t waited long before a familiar deep, slightly rough voice called her name. "Evelyn."

Turning, she greeted the man with a radiant smile. "Alexander, welcome back!"

She moved toward him, her face lighting up at the sight of the strikingly handsome man approaching her.

Alexander Prescott was undeniably gorgeous—his features sharp, his presence magnetic.

###Chapter 127

Alexander Prescott opened his arms with a welcoming grin as his gaze settled on Evelyn Hartley.

Evelyn responded with a dazzling smile, stepping effortlessly into his embrace. Their bond was instant and profound, evident in the way Alexander's lips curved into a sunlit smile—warm, comforting, and utterly genuine.

When they finally pulled apart, Evelyn, still glowing from his presence, asked, "How long are you staying this time?"

Alexander's answer was firm, leaving no room for doubt. "I'm not going anywhere."

The simplicity of his declaration sent a ripple of delight through Evelyn. "That's amazing!" she exclaimed, her own decision aligning perfectly with his. "I've decided not to go back to Chixdon either."

A knowing smile played on Alexander's lips. "I know," he murmured, his voice soft yet assured.

"Let's get lunch," Evelyn suggested, eager to catch up.

Alexander nodded, but before he could respond, his phone buzzed.

"One second," he said, pulling it from his pocket.

Answering, he greeted, "Theodore."

Evelyn's curiosity flickered at the name, her brows lifting slightly as she tried to decipher the conversation from Alexander's end.

Whatever Theodore was saying on the other line, it amused Alexander, his expression shifting into something lighter.

"Yeah, just landed. I've got plans for lunch, but we can meet for dinner," Alexander said, his tone decisive. He glanced at Evelyn before adding, "Alright, we'll talk more tonight. See you then." With that, he ended the call.

Evelyn let out a soft laugh, shaking her head. "Theodore always has the worst timing, doesn't he?"

Alexander chuckled, slipping his phone away. "You're absolutely right," he agreed. "Now, where are you taking me for lunch?"

"Any cravings?" Evelyn asked, ready to indulge him.

Alexander shook his head, relaxed. "I trust your taste completely."

"Then follow me," Evelyn said, a playful lilt in her voice as she led the way to Harper's Bistro—a place Alexander had always loved.

As they stepped inside the familiar restaurant, Evelyn remarked, "It's been ages since you last came here. Let's see if the food still holds up to your memories."

Once seated, Alexander handed Evelyn a set of silverware—a small but telling gesture of his gentlemanly nature.

Settling in, he turned the conversation toward something more personal. "So, how are things between you and Nathan now? Have you finalized the divorce?"

Alexander had known both Theodore and Nathan for years, their friendship forged through shared experiences and the unspoken understanding that came with being part of Oakwood’s elite.

As the heir to the Prescott family—the second most powerful among the city’s eight influential dynasties—Alexander had always been a figure of quiet authority.

###Chapter 128

Evelyn had first met him through Nathan, and though Alexander had never joined the others in mocking Evelyn, they hadn't been particularly close back then.

Everything changed when Evelyn moved to Chixdon, where Alexander had been sent by his father to oversee their family business.

It was there, through a series of unexpected meetings, that their friendship deepened.

Hearing Alexander’s words, Evelyn shrugged, her voice steady. "Not yet. We were supposed to go to the courthouse that day, but Leonard was hospitalized, so the paperwork couldn’t be finalized."

Alexander arched a brow, his expression thoughtful. "Leonard really doesn’t want you and Nathan to divorce, does he?"

Evelyn didn’t hesitate. "I’ve already made my stance clear. After his birthday, I’m proceeding with the divorce no matter what."

Alexander studied her for a long moment, a flicker of concern in his gaze. "Are you really okay with this?"

Evelyn’s lips curved into a faint, almost wry smile. "Why wouldn’t I be? Nathan and I can barely tolerate each other. It’s better for everyone if we just end things. Then he can be with Serena without any obstacles."

Despite her composed tone, a shadow of something unreadable passed through her eyes—just for a second—before she schooled her expression back into indifference.

Alexander, still watching her closely, seemed to weigh her words. Was this truly her resolve, or was she just putting on a brave face?

Evelyn, sensing his scrutiny, rolled her eyes with mild irritation. "Why are you looking at me like that? Don’t tell me you’ve forgotten what I look like."

Alexander chuckled, his gaze drifting momentarily before he spoke, his voice measured. "Leonard would never allow Nathan to end up with Serena. Even if you two divorce, Leonard will make sure Nathan marries someone else—someone from a powerful family. It’ll never be Serena."

Evelyn tilted her head slightly, intrigued. "Why does Leonard hate Serena so much? If it’s about status, that doesn’t make sense. After all, he accepted me—an illegitimate child—without much fuss."

She had asked Dylan the same question before, but he hadn’t known the answer. Now, she wondered if Alexander might have some insight.

Alexander shook his head, his expression contemplative. "That’s still a mystery. When Leonard first found out Nathan was dating Serena, he didn’t seem bothered. He probably thought it was just a passing fling."

He paused, his brow furrowing slightly. "But somewhere along the way, his attitude changed. Suddenly, he was adamant that Nathan break up with her—no negotiation, no explanation. When Nathan demanded a reason, Leonard just said Serena wasn’t the right woman for him. But we all know that excuse doesn’t hold up."

Alexander’s tone darkened. "Nathan refused to back down, and Leonard only grew more stubborn. They reached a standoff. Then, when Nathan announced he wanted to marry Serena, Leonard lost it completely. He even had Serena kidnapped to force Nathan to give up on her."

Evelyn absorbed his words in silence, the weight of the revelation settling heavily in her chest.

###Chapter 129

Evelyn had never questioned Alexander about the past between Nathan and Serena before. In the past, even the mere mention of Nathan’s name had felt like ripping open a barely healed wound.

Alexander had always been careful, avoiding any mention of him around her.

But now, her perspective had shifted.

After a brief pause, Evelyn spoke, her voice measured. "It seems… Leonard must have uncovered something."

Alexander nodded in agreement. "Nathan suspected the same at first. But after an exhaustive search, he found nothing. That made him think Leonard might have erased all traces of what he’d discovered."

Evelyn’s sharp, calculating eyes narrowed further. "What secrets could Serena possibly be hiding?"

A thought seemed to strike Alexander, and he exhaled heavily. "Serena endured hell during those three years of isolation. She was under constant surveillance, cut off from any means of communication—no phone, no computer. She wasn’t even allowed to step outside except for a tightly monitored two-hour walk each day. At one point, her mental state deteriorated so badly she was diagnosed with severe depression and underwent extensive therapy."

Evelyn fell silent, her expression unreadable.

She hadn’t fully grasped the extent of Serena’s suffering until now.

Alexander’s voice grew somber. "It’s hard to fathom what Serena could have done to make Leonard despise her so much. But keeping someone locked away like that—it’s inhumane."

This was the first time he had ever discussed this with Evelyn.

Evelyn remained quiet, her mind drifting to the guilt Nathan must have carried all these years.

When Alexander noticed the subtle shift in her expression, his gaze flickered before he deliberately changed the subject. "Let’s move on. Any progress on your investigation into those unexplained hormones in your system?"

Evelyn snapped out of her thoughts. "Nothing yet. All the medication from my childhood was disposed of long ago. I had Gabriella check the calcium supplements I took later, but they were clean."

She frowned. "I still don’t understand how those hormones got into my body in the first place."

Alexander considered this before asking, "Do you have any suspects?"

"None," Evelyn admitted bluntly.

Alexander sighed. "Given your lifelong struggle with weight, if someone was secretly dosing you as a child, it would most likely be someone close—family. But I can’t imagine Eleanor or Diana ever doing something like that. They adore you."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Exactly why I’m stuck."

Alexander offered a reassuring smile. "Don’t rush it. This case is over two decades old. The truth won’t surface overnight."

"I know," Evelyn murmured.

She turned her attention back to the meal. "Let’s just enjoy dinner for now."

###Chapter 130

After their meal, Evelyn dropped Alexander off at the Prescott family estate before heading to the hospital to continue her duties.

That evening, in an intimate corner of an upscale restaurant, Alexander's return had sparked a lively gathering among friends who shared close ties with both him and Nathan.

Theodore kicked off the conversation with a mischievous grin. "Alright, Alexander, time to confess. Who was the mystery lunch date today?"

"You just got back, and instead of reuniting with us first, you were off dining with someone else? Suspicious," another friend chimed in teasingly.

"Come on, out with it. Are you seeing someone? Was it a romantic lunch?"

"It had to be a woman, right?"

Surrounded by their playful jabs, Alexander exhaled in mild exasperation. "She's just a very dear friend, nothing like what you're imagining," he clarified.

"A friend? Really?" one of them scoffed. "Since when do you ditch your friends for lunch over a friend? Aren't we all your friends here?"

"Just admit it—she's your girlfriend, isn't she? Why keep secrets from us?" another pressed.

Alexander shook his head slightly, opting for silence rather than further explanation. Arguing with them was pointless.

Nathan's deep, commanding voice cut through the banter. "Are you back for good this time?"

The playful atmosphere shifted instantly, all eyes now fixed on Alexander.

"I'm staying," he confirmed.

"That's fantastic! More time for us to catch up," Serena said with a bright smile, which Alexander returned with a nod.

"So, Alexander," Serena continued without missing a beat, "after nearly three years in Chixdon, have you found yourself a girlfriend yet?"

Alexander chuckled lightly. "No, I'm still searching for someone who truly understands my background here." His answer only fueled their curiosity further.

"Alright, then tell us—was the woman you had lunch with today your girlfriend?"

Alexander sighed quietly, unwilling to entertain the question.

Seeking to redirect the conversation, he turned to Nathan. "What about you, Nathan? How have things been lately?"

"I've been well," Nathan replied evenly.

Just then, Dylan interjected from the side, "Alexander, you might not know this, but there’s been quite a development with Nathan’s wife, Evelyn."

Alexander’s brows lifted in surprise. He hadn’t expected Dylan to bring up Evelyn.

"Oh?"

"She’s become quite close with the Caldwell family—practically part of their inner circle. Her social status has risen significantly," Dylan remarked, his tone laced with disapproval.

###Chapter 131

The murmurs in the room were barely concealed. "Who would've thought Evelyn Hartley would become so close to the Caldwell family? Marcus and Olivia practically treat her like their own daughter now," one guest remarked, swirling his wine glass.

"Times have changed. No one dares cross Evelyn anymore," another added with a knowing smirk.

"Exactly. Those who've offended her didn’t walk away unscathed."

A woman leaned in, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "Did you hear about her sister, Lila? She was out with friends who started badmouthing Evelyn in the restroom. Turns out, Evelyn was there too—heard every word. It was a disaster. She made those women slap themselves until she deemed it enough. When they finally left, they were all wearing masks, probably hiding swollen faces."

Nathan Black's expression darkened imperceptibly.

He knew Evelyn better than most—there had to be more to the story.

"Isn't that just abuse of power? Just because she's Ethan Caldwell's goddaughter doesn’t give her the right to act like that!" someone scoffed, clearly irritated.

"Absolutely! She’s gone too far this time."

Alexander Prescott opened his mouth to defend Evelyn, certain there was more to it, when Nathan’s icy voice cut through the chatter. "Reserve judgment until you know the full story."

The room fell into stunned silence.

Eyes darted between guests, disbelief evident. Nathan Black—defending Evelyn Hartley?

In the past, no matter how viciously they’d mocked her, he’d never so much as blinked. But now…

Serena Cole’s fingers tightened around her glass, her chest tightening with unease.

Nathan’s attitude toward Evelyn had shifted. He was protecting her.

The realization sent a sharp pang through Serena’s heart.

One of the men who’d been badmouthing Evelyn earlier cleared his throat nervously. "Y-Yes, of course, Mr. Black. My apologies. I shouldn’t have spoken out of turn."

Nathan dismissed him with a cold glance before taking a slow sip of his whiskey.

The tension in the room thickened.

Then, just as the silence became unbearable, another voice broke through.

"Speaking of Evelyn… I heard something interesting recently," a man said, his tone laced with intrigue. "Didn’t she join the Cardiac Surgery Department at Grandview General? Rumor has it she got in through her connection with the deputy director. Normally, everyone has to pass rigorous exams, but Evelyn? She waltzed right in—no tests, no interviews. Just a permanent position handed to her."

Dylan Reeves smirked, swirling his drink. "My uncle-in-law works there. He mentioned Lila—Evelyn’s sister—is still just an intern because she failed the entrance exam. Meanwhile, Evelyn had the deputy director’s assistant personally escort her on her first day."

The whispers grew louder.

Nathan’s jaw tightened.

He knew exactly what this was—another attempt to tarnish Evelyn’s reputation.

And he wasn’t about to let it slide.

###Chapter 132

The murmurs were cut short when Nathan set his glass down with deliberate precision. The sharp clink echoed through the room.

"Let me make one thing clear," he said, his voice dangerously calm. "If I hear another baseless accusation against Evelyn Hartley, there will be consequences."

A chill ran through the crowd.

Serena’s nails dug into her palms.

Since when had Nathan become Evelyn’s shield?

And why did that thought make her blood boil?

A smirk curled Dylan's lips, his eyes glinting with derision. "Evelyn's abrupt entry immediately stirred resentment among the other doctors since she skipped the usual merit-based selection. At the Caldwell family's banquet, Ethan mentioned Evelyn was joining Grandins General Hospital, and everyone practically hailed her as a prodigy—young, brilliant, and full of potential." He scoffed. "Looking back now, it's obvious the Caldwells pulled strings to get her in."

After a deliberate pause, he added, "Now, the situation has blown up. People are furious. Evelyn will likely be fired soon. And once dismissed from Grandins? Good luck finding another hospital willing to take her."

Nathan's sharp gaze darkened imperceptibly, his expression unreadable, though something dangerous flickered in his eyes.

He already knew from Lila how Evelyn had secured her position, but he hadn’t expected backlash this severe. Someone was clearly orchestrating this behind the scenes.

Serena turned to Nathan, her brow creased with concern. "Is it really that bad? Nathan, you have to step in and help her."

Dylan rolled his eyes. "Help? This is Grandins' internal affair. No one can interfere."

"I can't wait to see how this plays out," another man chimed in eagerly, his eyes alight with anticipation.

Alexander observed the smug expressions around him, his own face carefully neutral.

They wanted to see Evelyn fail? They’d be sorely disappointed.

He knew Sebastian was aware of Evelyn’s true identity. There was no way he’d let her be dismissed. If anything, he’d go out of his way to protect her.

"Enough about her," Dylan said dismissively, clearly eager to change the subject.

The group swiftly moved on, their chatter shifting to other topics.

After dinner, someone suggested heading to a bar, and the group, still buzzing with energy, agreed to continue the night at Nostalgia Lounge.

Coincidentally, Evelyn was there too.

Alexander spotted her first. A slow, knowing smile curved his lips before he turned to Nathan. "Evelyn's here. Should we invite her to join us?"

At his words, Nathan glanced in Evelyn’s direction but said nothing. His silence was answer enough.

"I'll get her," Alexander said, rising smoothly and making his way toward her booth.

When Evelyn noticed him approaching, surprise flickered across her face. "You guys are here too?" Her voice was light, laced with faint amusement.

Alexander nodded, offering her a warm smile. "Come join us."

###Chapter 133

For a fleeting second, Evelyn contemplated refusing.

But when her eyes flickered toward Serena and Dylan seated across the room, her hesitation dissolved.

"Absolutely," she replied after a measured pause.

She gave Alexander a brief nod before turning to Natalie. "Come on, Natalie. Let’s join them."

Natalie, always in sync with Evelyn, offered a subtle nod of agreement.

She understood that if Evelyn had accepted the invitation, there was a purpose behind it. Without another word, she followed.

The trio made their way to Nathan’s private booth on the second floor.

As Evelyn approached, her gaze inadvertently met Nathan’s. For a heartbeat, their eyes locked—charged with unspoken tension—before both swiftly looked away.

With Evelyn and Natalie now present, the atmosphere in the booth shifted, thick with unspoken friction.

Dylan, ever the instigator, his eyes gleaming with mischief, quickly devised a plan.

Leaning forward, he smirked at Evelyn. "Just sitting here is getting dull, don’t you think, Mrs. Black? How about we spice things up with a game?"

Evelyn arched a brow, her expression unreadable as she met his challenge. "What kind of game did you have in mind?"

Dylan snatched the dice cup from the table, giving it a theatrical shake. "Simple. We roll, and whoever gets the lower number drinks. Loser takes a shot."

A faint smirk tugged at Evelyn’s lips. "Sounds fair," she replied coolly.

The man beside Dylan grabbed a bottle of whiskey, pouring generous amounts into their glasses until the amber liquid nearly spilled over.

Evelyn’s gaze flickered to her glass, watching the whiskey swirl dangerously close to the rim.

Dylan noticed her hesitation and chuckled. "If it’s too much, Mrs. Black, we can always make it half a glass."

Evelyn’s fingers curled around the glass, her voice steady. "No need. A full glass is perfect."

"Excellent!" Dylan grinned, clearly relishing the challenge. "Let’s begin."

The first round commenced.

Evelyn rolled a three.

Dylan rolled a four.

"Beginner’s luck," Dylan taunted, setting the dice cup down with a smirk.

Without hesitation, Evelyn lifted her glass and downed the whiskey in one smooth motion, her expression never faltering.

###Chapter 134

The room fell into stunned silence for a heartbeat, everyone frozen by her audacious move.

"Damn, that's bold!" Dylan Reeves exclaimed, clearly impressed by Evelyn Hartley's fearless gesture.

Nathan Black's sharp gaze flickered with intrigue as he studied Evelyn before murmuring, "Let's keep going."

And so, the next round began.

This time, it was Dylan who lost.

Without hesitation, he threw back his shot in one smooth motion. But as the whiskey burned down his throat, his face twisted briefly in discomfort, his fingers tightening around the glass.

The game continued.

Before long, Evelyn had already downed five shots, while Dylan had only managed one.

The others watched in silent astonishment, their eyes wide with disbelief.

More specifically, they were stunned by Evelyn.

No one had expected her to be this fearless—or to handle her liquor with such effortless grace.

This wasn’t some watered-down cocktail—it was straight whiskey, and she had already polished off five shots.

Yet, her expression remained perfectly composed.

She didn’t even seem fazed.

Watching Evelyn drink with such ease, Nathan’s brows furrowed slightly, his dark eyes lingering on her, but he remained silent.

"Bravo, Mrs. Black," Dylan said with a low chuckle, clearly entertained. He grabbed the dice cup again, eager to continue. "Come on, let’s keep this going!"

"Wait," Evelyn suddenly said, her voice cool but firm, halting the game.

Dylan arched a brow, a teasing smirk playing on his lips. "What’s wrong, Mrs. Black? Getting cold feet? Or are you afraid you can’t keep up?"

Evelyn merely tilted her head, a slow, dangerous smile curving her lips as she met his gaze. "I just think drinking shot by shot is getting boring. Why don’t we raise the stakes?"

With that, she casually slid an unopened bottle of whiskey onto the table between them. "One final round. Winner takes all. Loser drinks the entire bottle. What do you say?"

Her words hung in the air like a challenge, and for a moment, the entire booth fell into shocked silence.

Everyone stared at her, their expressions a mix of disbelief and awe.

Was Evelyn serious?

That was a full bottle of whiskey.

And she wanted the loser to drink it all?

This wasn’t just a game anymore.

This was war.

###Chapter 135

Nathan's jaw clenched, his piercing gaze fixed on the whiskey bottle.

He was visibly stunned by Evelyn's bold challenge.

A whole bottle of whiskey?

Had Evelyn lost her mind?

Nathan, who had been silently observing the exchange, suddenly frowned. His voice was low and edged with disapproval as he turned to Evelyn. "Evelyn, do you even realize what you're suggesting?"

Was she seriously proposing such a reckless bet?

Or was this all part of some calculated scheme? Did she intend to get herself drunk just to manipulate the situation? The thought flickered through Nathan's mind, and his eyes narrowed slightly, as if he had just uncovered her hidden motives.

But Evelyn paid him no attention, her focus entirely on Dylan.

A mischievous smirk curled her lips as she taunted him, her voice dripping with mockery. "What's wrong, Mr. Reeves? Scared you'll lose? Or maybe you just don't have the guts to go through with it?"

She threw his own words back at him, her tone light but laced with challenge.

The crowd around them erupted in jeers and encouragement.

"Come on, Dylan! Don't chicken out now!"

"Yeah, if Evelyn's willing, why can't you?"

The pressure mounted, and Dylan's expression darkened with frustration.

He had walked right into a trap.

His original plan had been to get Evelyn drunk, but he hadn't expected her to escalate things like this.

Now, he was cornered.

Backing down would mean losing face, and he couldn't let Evelyn—or anyone else—think he was weak.

Besides, after everything that had happened so far, he was confident he could win this final round.

Taking a deep breath, Dylan finally spoke, his voice firm. "Fine. One last round to decide the winner."

Evelyn's smirk widened. "Let's get to it, then."

Without hesitation, she snatched up the dice cup, shaking it with practiced ease.

This time, both of them took their time, the tension thickening with every movement.

The sharp clack of the dice cups hitting the table echoed through the room.

Dylan peeked at his roll first, exhaling in quiet relief as he lifted his cup.

He had rolled a five.

###Chapter 136

"That's an impressive roll. You're bound to win this round!" someone nearby exclaimed, clearly awed.

Evelyn, however, didn’t even glance at her dice.

With a slow, deliberate motion, she lifted the cup.

Every pair of eyes in the booth snapped toward the dice, the tension so thick it could be cut with a knife.

"Oh my God!"

A ripple of shock spread through the crowd.

Dylan’s expression twisted in disbelief.

Evelyn had rolled a six.

Damn it!

A smug smile curled Evelyn’s lips as she raked her fingers through her shoulder-length auburn waves, her eyes gleaming with triumph. "Looks like fortune favors me tonight."

Natalie and Alexander exchanged knowing glances, amusement flickering in their eyes.

From the very beginning, Natalie hadn’t been worried about Evelyn’s losing streak.

She knew better—Evelyn had been playing the long game, deliberately losing to lure Dylan into this high-stakes bet.

Nathan observed the scene unfold, his dark gaze locked onto Evelyn, unreadable yet intense.

A flicker of doubt crossed his mind.

Was that six sheer luck, or was there more to it? Was Evelyn actually skilled at this?

Dylan’s face went rigid the moment Evelyn revealed her roll, his jaw tightening as he stared at the dice in stunned silence.

Without a word, Evelyn reached for the bottle of whiskey and slid it toward Dylan with icy calm. "Mr. Reeves, bottoms up."

The booth plunged into heavy silence.

No one dared to speak, the air thick with tension.

Just the sight of the full bottle made everyone shift uncomfortably.

They all knew downing that much whiskey wouldn’t be easy.

Finally, Serena’s voice cut through the quiet, laced with false concern. "Mrs. Black, it’s just a game. No need to take it so seriously, right? A whole bottle seems… excessive, don’t you think?"

Evelyn chuckled softly, her gaze never leaving Dylan. "Mr. Reeves, are you scared to drink, or just unwilling?"

She tilted her head slightly, her smirk turning razor-sharp. "But don’t worry—I’m reasonable. Here’s an alternative: go downstairs, stand on the stage, and shout three times, ‘I’m a coward.’ Do that, and you won’t have to touch this bottle."

At her words, both Dylan’s and Serena’s faces darkened.

The others exchanged uneasy glances, unsure how to react to such a brutal ultimatum.

Evelyn’s demand was simple—yet utterly ruthless.

###Chapter 137

Calling him a coward in front of everyone?

No man with an ounce of pride would ever submit to such humiliation—most would rather down the whiskey than endure that kind of public disgrace.

Dylan, his jaw clenched tight with the weight of his pride, forced a strained smile and said, "Mrs. Hartley, you're reading too much into this. I'll drink it."

"A bet is a bet," he declared, his voice steady despite the tension coiling in his gut. "And I always honor mine."

With that, he grabbed the bottle and tipped it back, the amber liquid burning a path down his throat.

The room fell silent except for the sound of Dylan swallowing, each gulp amplifying the suffocating tension in the air.

The others watched, their own throats tightening in sympathy, silently praying he wouldn’t collapse before finishing.

After only a few deep swallows, Dylan set the bottle down, his fingers trembling slightly.

A wave of discomfort crashed through him, the whiskey igniting a fire in his stomach. His face flushed crimson, but he gritted his teeth, refusing to show weakness.

Serena’s eyes darkened with concern, her gaze darting to Nathan, silently begging him to intervene.

"Nathan—" she started, her voice barely above a whisper.

But before she could finish, Nathan cut her off with a sharp, "Quiet. Don’t distract him."

Serena’s face paled, her heart sinking like a stone.

Was Nathan really going to stand by and watch Dylan suffer like this?

Her nails dug into her palms, frustration and helplessness twisting inside her.

The seconds stretched into an eternity, the air thick with unspoken tension.

Dylan continued drinking in measured gulps, his movements growing slower, more deliberate, until finally—the bottle was empty.

With one last shaky exhale, he turned the bottle upside down, proving he had drained every last drop.

Evelyn’s sharp, delighted applause shattered the silence. "Bravo!" she cheered, clapping her hands with theatrical enthusiasm. "Well done, Mr. Reeves! A man of his word—how refreshing!"

Dylan didn’t respond, his face now a deep, unnatural red.

Those nearby quickly guided him to the sofa, where he collapsed onto the cushions, his vision swimming as the room spun around him.

His stomach churned violently, his throat scorched raw, every breath like inhaling flames.

"Dylan, are you okay?" Serena’s voice trembled, her hands hovering over him, unsure whether to touch him or not.

Dylan managed a weak nod, his voice hoarse. "I’m—"

But before he could finish, his body betrayed him.

A violent spasm wracked his stomach, and with no warning, he doubled over, vomiting violently onto the floor.

###Chapter 138

The impact hit him like a freight train, twisting his gut into knots. A wave of nausea surged through him, and before he could stop it, everything in his stomach came rushing up in a violent heave. The sharp, acrid stench of whiskey filled the cramped booth, making the air thick and suffocating.

Evelyn watched Dylan's pitiful state with a smirk curling at the corners of her lips. Her eyes gleamed with cold amusement, never leaving his hunched-over form.

With effortless grace, she rose from the plush sofa, smoothing out the fabric of her dress. "Well, that was entertaining," she mused, flicking a glance toward Natalie. "Shall we?"

"Absolutely!" Natalie chirped, bouncing to her feet with a mischievous grin.

Their exit was nothing short of triumphant—light steps, heads held high, the unspoken victory hanging between them. The bet had been won, and the satisfaction was delicious.

"Dylan, are you okay?" Serena asked softly, pressing a glass of water into his trembling hands.

He took it with unsteady fingers, the cool liquid a small mercy against the fire in his throat. After several more dry heaves, he finally managed to catch his breath. His face was a mess—tears, sweat, and humiliation streaked across his usually composed features. The rage simmering beneath the surface was unmistakable. He had intended to put Evelyn in her place, and instead, she had turned the tables on him effortlessly. Was this karma? Or had he simply underestimated her?

Nathan sat motionless, his expression unreadable, but the faintest flicker of amusement danced in his dark eyes. The entire spectacle had been… unexpectedly entertaining.

"Dylan," one of his friends muttered, voice low with unease. "Maybe you should stay away from Evelyn from now on. There's something about her…"

"Yeah," another chimed in. "I'm starting to think she let you win earlier."

Dylan wiped his mouth with a crumpled napkin, his glare sharp enough to cut glass. "Stop talking nonsense. It was just whiskey."

His jaw clenched. "Next time, I'll make sure she regrets this."

The others exchanged wary glances but wisely kept silent. The air was thick with tension, and no one wanted to provoke him further.

Serena was about to speak when her phone buzzed. Her fingers froze mid-air as she read the sender’s name. Her breath hitched.

Again.

The same unknown number from yesterday.

Her pulse spiked as she typed out a reply, forcing her fingers not to shake. "Who is this? I don’t know you. Why should I meet you?"

The response came instantly. "Serena, are you sure you won’t come? Do you really think you can handle the consequences if you don’t?"

Her stomach dropped. The blood drained from her face, leaving her pale and shaken. She bit her lip hard enough to draw blood before typing back, "Fine. I’ll see who you really are."

With that, she shoved her phone away and turned to Nathan and Alexander. "I have to go. Make sure Dylan gets home safely, okay?"

Alexander nodded. "Don’t worry. We’ve got him."

Serena didn’t look back as she hurried out, her mind racing with dread.

###Chapter 139

Evelyn swiftly rose to her feet and exited, her steps quickening as she moved toward the door. Natalie and Serena, not lingering much longer, soon followed suit.

Having downed several glasses of whiskey earlier, Evelyn’s stomach twisted uncomfortably, a stark reminder of her indulgence. Upon arriving at the Grant family estate, she made a beeline for the kitchen, intent on brewing a soothing cup of honey water to settle her queasy stomach.

But before she could reach her destination, she collided with Adrian, who was emerging from the hallway. The moment their eyes met, her expression darkened.

Damian and Rosalind hadn’t stayed at the Grant residence, but Adrian had chosen to remain, claiming he wanted to spend more time with Leonard.

"You're back already, Evelyn?" Adrian’s voice carried a hint of amusement as he arched a brow at her.

Evelyn didn’t so much as glance his way, striding past him toward the kitchen. Undeterred, Adrian trailed after her, his footsteps light but persistent.

"Had a bit too much to drink tonight?" he mused, leaning against the counter as she rummaged through the cabinets. "Looking for honey water to settle your stomach? Let me make it for you."

Evelyn froze, then turned to face him, her gaze sharp as ice. "Don’t bother. Just stay out of my way." With that, she turned back to her task, her tone leaving no room for argument.

Adrian chuckled, crossing his arms as he watched her. "Come on, Evelyn. No need to be so cold."

Ignoring him, Evelyn focused on stirring the honey into the warm water, her movements precise.

Unfazed, Adrian continued, "Look, whatever issues exist between my father and Nathan—that’s their business. I’m not my father. There’s no reason for you to treat me like this."

He paused, studying her with a more earnest expression before adding with a smirk, "Honestly, I’d really like to be friends with you."

At that, Evelyn’s hand stilled for the briefest moment, her mind briefly thrown off balance.

Slowly, she turned her head to meet his gaze. "All I want is for you to stay away from me." Friends? The idea was laughable. She couldn’t fathom associating that word with someone like Adrian.

Her expression frosty, Evelyn picked up her cup, preparing to leave. But Adrian smoothly blocked her path, refusing to budge.

Evelyn lifted her chin, her voice dangerously calm. "If you don’t want a repeat of last time, I suggest you move. Now."

The memory of her fist connecting with his jaw flashed between them, and Adrian’s smirk faltered. He hesitated, the air thick with tension, before finally stepping aside.

Without sparing him another glance, Evelyn swept past him, her strides purposeful. As she disappeared down the hall, Adrian exhaled, a slow, intrigued smile curving his lips. There was something undeniably thrilling about the way she dismissed him—like he was nothing.

Back in her room, Evelyn set her cup down before heading to the bathroom for a quick shower. By the time she emerged, Nathan had already returned. She gave him a brief nod before settling onto the sofa, sipping her honey water.

Nathan wasted no time. He crossed the room and sat across from her, his voice low and rough. "What’s going on at the hospital? What are these rumors I’m hearing about you?"

###Chapter 140

Evelyn arched a delicate brow, suspicion flickering in her emerald eyes. Then, with a playful smirk dancing on her lips, she countered, "Oh? Since when did you care about my well-being, Mr. Black?"

Nathan let out a derisive scoff, his piercing gaze sharpening with disdain. "If you get fired, it won’t just be your reputation in ruins—it’ll tarnish the Black family’s name too." His voice dropped to a glacial whisper. "If you’re truly incompetent and only got this position because of Sebastian’s favoritism, do us all a favor and resign now. Spare us the embarrassment." His words were merciless, slicing through the air like a blade.

Evelyn exhaled slowly, a soft, almost amused chuckle escaping her. "How generous of you to worry about my career, Nathan. But really, don’t trouble yourself."

With that, she set down her half-finished honey water and rose gracefully, turning to leave. Nathan’s eyes tracked her retreating figure, a spark of intrigue flashing in their depths. Her reaction wasn’t that of someone drowning in scandal—she moved with the confidence of a woman who had already outmaneuvered her enemies. His frown eased slightly as the realization settled in.

The Next Day – Director’s Office, Grand Pines General Hospital

"Reginald, you asked to see me?" Sebastian strode in, his demeanor as composed as ever.

Reginald Vaughn, the hospital director, slid a letter across his desk. "Read this."

Sebastian unfolded the paper, his lips curling into a cold smirk as he scanned the contents. An anonymous complaint—accusing him of nepotism, of securing Evelyn’s position through unethical means. The writer demanded an investigation, threatening to expose the "corruption" if the hospital failed to act.

Reginald studied him carefully. "Care to explain?"

Sebastian’s voice remained steady. "You and I both know Evelyn’s credentials. I consulted you before bringing her on board. Her unique circumstances were never a secret."

Only Sebastian and his assistant, Trevor, knew Evelyn’s true identity—the legendary surgeon known as Star.

Reginald sighed, rubbing his temples. "I remember, but I didn’t expect this backlash. The rumors are spreading like wildfire. We can’t ignore this. You need to address it."

Sebastian nodded. "Consider it handled."

"Good. Just make sure it’s done properly."

"Of course." With that, Sebastian turned on his heel and left.

Cardiac Surgery Department

When Sebastian arrived, the doctors exchanged uneasy glances.

"Mr. Holloway, is something wrong?" one of them ventured, confusion lacing his tone.

Sebastian’s voice was firm. "Gather every on-duty doctor and the department head. Now."

"Yes, sir."

Minutes later, the team assembled in the conference room. Evelyn leaned back in her chair, a knowing glint in her eyes. So the snake has finally struck.

Sebastian took his place at the head of the table. "Since you’re all here, let’s begin." His gaze swept over them, unreadable. "By now, I’m sure you’ve all heard the rumors circulating about Evelyn’s employment." He paused, his tone turning razor-sharp. "So tell me—does anyone here have a problem with me?"

Silence.

Then—


###Chapter 141

The tension in the room was palpable as the doctors exchanged uneasy glances, but no one dared to speak. Dominic Pierce broke the silence with a low, mocking chuckle.

"Mr. Holloway, how could you even ask such a thing? You're the deputy director of this hospital. Who would dare challenge your authority? You're being paranoid."

Sebastian Holloway's sharp gaze flickered toward Dominic for a brief moment before he looked away. After a deliberate pause, he continued, his voice measured. "Perhaps I phrased it poorly. What I meant to ask was... Do all of you believe Evelyn Hartley secured her position at Grand Hills General Hospital solely because of my influence, and not her own merit?"

The other doctors shifted uncomfortably, their silence speaking volumes. Dominic, sensing an opportunity, finally spoke up, his tone dripping with false concern.

"That's exactly what I've been thinking! Mr. Holloway, you know better than anyone how Evelyn got here. She bypassed the standard hiring process entirely—no exams, no evaluations. Just a direct appointment."

"Of course, people are going to resent that. This hospital has always valued fairness and skill above all else. Without proven ability, no one deserves a place here. Take my student, Lila Sinclair, for example. She's been here for over a year and is still just an intern because she hasn't passed the qualifying exam. Harsh? Maybe. But those are the rules. And rules exist for a reason."

He paused, his eyes narrowing as they landed on Evelyn, his voice laced with barely concealed disdain. "But her? She waltzed in with your backing, not only securing a position but a permanent one at that. How is that fair?"

Sebastian's lips curved into a faint, knowing smile. "So, Dominic, what do you propose we do about it?"

A glint of triumph flashed in Dominic's eyes. "Simple. Let Evelyn perform a solo surgery using our department's virtual surgery system. If she succeeds, her competence is undeniable, and no one can question her again. If she fails..."

Sebastian arched a brow. "If she fails?"

Dominic leaned forward, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "Then she resigns immediately. And as for you, Mr. Holloway... you forfeit your year-end bonus. Fair, don't you think?"

The room went deathly silent. The audacity of Dominic's demand was staggering—Sebastian's bonus was no small sum. Yet, the deputy director remained unreadable, his expression giving nothing away.

Evelyn suppressed a smirk. Dominic had just played his hand—bold, reckless, and utterly transparent.

Sebastian finally spoke, his tone deceptively mild. "And what surgery did you have in mind for Evelyn, Dominic?"

Dominic didn't hesitate. "A type-B aortic dissection. It's minimally invasive but complex enough to test a surgeon's true skill."

A ripple of shock passed through the room. While type-B dissections were less dangerous than type-A, they were still high-stakes procedures—especially for a resident who had never operated solo before.

The doctors exchanged uneasy glances. This wasn't just a test.

It was a trap.

###Chapter 142
The request was clearly calculated—a deliberate attempt to push Evelyn into an impossible situation. This wasn't just a test of skill; it was a trap designed to humiliate her and, by extension, undermine Sebastian's authority.

Lila's lips curled into a smirk as she glanced at Evelyn. There was no way a resident could handle a Type-B aortic dissection alone. This was a guaranteed failure.

She hadn't expected Dominic to escalate things so quickly after her subtle prodding. His boldness was almost impressive.

Yet, Evelyn remained eerily composed, her expression unreadable, as if the entire discussion held no relevance to her. The other doctors exchanged glances, silently admiring her unshakable poise.

"Isn't this procedure a bit advanced for a resident?" Sebastian asked lightly, though his tone carried an edge of challenge.

Dominic nodded thoughtfully. "It is demanding, yes. But this is Grand Ins General—we expect excellence. A higher difficulty only makes the evaluation more meaningful, don’t you agree?" His reasoning was polished, difficult to counter.

"Fine. I accept." Sebastian's sudden agreement sent a ripple of shock through the room. The doctors stiffened—had he lost his mind?

Dominic's eyes gleamed with triumph, but before he could speak, Sebastian cut in.

"However," Sebastian continued, his gaze briefly flickering to Lila before locking onto Dominic again, "Evelyn won’t be the only one performing. Lila will take on the same surgery."

Lila froze, her face draining of color. What? Why was she being dragged into this?

Dominic's expression darkened. "Mr. Holloway, that’s unreasonable. Lila is merely a contract intern."

Sebastian smiled, calm yet razor-sharp. "Is it? Look around this hospital—how many department heads have a contract intern shadowing them indefinitely? She’s failed the qualifying exam twice. By protocol, she should have been dismissed months ago." He paused, letting the weight of his words settle. "Since you’re so insistent on fairness, shouldn’t the same standards apply to her?"

The room fell silent. Grand Ins prided itself on strict regulations, and Sebastian had just weaponized them.

Dominic’s confidence wavered for the first time. He had no rebuttal.

Lila shot him a frantic look, her earlier smugness replaced by panic. She had only wanted to watch Evelyn crash and burn—how had the spotlight turned on her?

Evelyn’s lips curved slightly as she observed Lila’s distress. Karma was swift.

###Chapter 143

The tension in the room was thick enough to cut with a scalpel when Sebastian Holloway's voice sliced through it, deliberate and final. "If this is going to be a test, then both Evelyn Hartley and Lila Sinclair will perform the surgery. If Lila wins, she’ll bypass the exams and become a resident physician here, effective immediately. As for Evelyn…" His gaze hardened. "She’ll leave this hospital permanently, her name struck from any future consideration for employment."

A ripple of shock spread through the gathered staff. But Sebastian wasn’t finished. He continued, his tone laced with challenge, "To make this more interesting, I’ll donate my entire year-end bonus to charity as a gesture of goodwill—and I’ll also give you, Dominic, one month of my salary."

Dominic Pierce’s eyes gleamed with sudden interest. Lila’s face brightened, her confidence swelling at the prospect of victory. But just as they both began to savor the thought, Sebastian’s next words doused them like ice water.

"However," he said smoothly, "if Evelyn wins, she’ll be promoted to attending physician. Lila will resign, and Dominic—you’ll donate your year-end bonus and give me one month’s salary."

Evelyn’s breath caught. Her head snapped toward Sebastian, confusion and disbelief warring in her chest. What? When had she ever agreed to this? From the moment she joined the hospital, she had made it clear—she wanted to remain a resident physician, nothing more. Now, it was obvious Sebastian was playing a dangerous game, manipulating both her and Dominic. The realization made her jaw tighten.

Sebastian flicked a glance at Evelyn. When he caught the sharpness in her expression, a flicker of unease crossed his features, but he masked it instantly. Straightening, he turned back to Dominic, his face unreadable as he waited for a response.

Dominic and Lila exchanged uneasy looks. The stakes were tempting, but the risks were just as high.

After a long pause, Dominic spoke, his voice edged with caution. "And what if neither of them completes the surgery successfully?"

Sebastian didn’t hesitate. "The surgery will be scheduled for a week from now. If neither succeeds by then, they’ll get another chance. The first to complete it successfully will be declared the winner."

Dominic’s brow furrowed. He wasn’t done negotiating. Leaning forward, he pressed, "Even if Evelyn succeeds, she hasn’t been here long enough to qualify for an immediate promotion to attending physician. Hospital policy requires—"

Sebastian cut him off with a quiet chuckle, his eyes glinting. "Our hospital has always valued skill over tenure. If Evelyn can successfully perform a type-B aortic dissection on her own, are you really suggesting she doesn’t deserve the title?"

Dominic fell silent, his mind racing.

He weighed the risks. Refusing now would leave him with fewer options. If he backed down, Sebastian would never let Evelyn operate alone. And, as Sebastian had pointed out, Lila’s position was already precarious. By hospital rules, she shouldn’t even still be here. Forcing Evelyn into this was the only way to corner Sebastian.

Losing a year-end bonus would hurt Sebastian financially, but more importantly, Dominic saw this as his chance to expose Sebastian’s incompetence to the board. Once the shareholders lost faith, removing him would be effortless.

As for Evelyn’s chances of success? Dominic smirked inwardly. There was no way she could pull it off.

"Fine," he said at last, his voice firm. "Let’s do this."

###Chapter 144

Sebastian Holloway wasn’t the least bit surprised by Dominic Pierce’s response. His expression remained unreadable as he gave a slight, acknowledging nod. “Then it’s settled. The petition will take place in a week.”

With that, Sebastian stood and left without another word. Throughout the entire exchange, neither Evelyn Hartley nor Lila Sinclair had been consulted—not that their opinions mattered now. This was no longer just a petty rivalry between Evelyn and Lila. It had escalated into a high-stakes power struggle between Sebastian and Dominic.

Dominic rose from his seat as well. “Alright, everyone, back to work. Lila, with me.”

Lila’s face was ghostly pale as she followed Dominic out of the room, her mind still reeling.

When they reached Dominic’s office and the door clicked shut behind them, Lila’s composure shattered. Her hands trembled as she blurted out, “Dr. Pierce, how could you agree to Mr. Holloway’s proposal? I—I—” She swallowed hard, her voice cracking before she exhaled sharply, her shoulders slumping in defeat. “What am I supposed to do now?”

Dominic remained infuriatingly calm. He understood her panic perfectly. “Given the circumstances, if I hadn’t agreed, this issue would have dragged on indefinitely. I had no choice but to accept.”

Lila bit her lip, her face draining of color as she voiced her deepest fear. “But… I’ve never performed a type-B aortic dissection surgery on my own before! There’s no way I can do this!”

She knew her limits all too well—she hadn’t even assisted in a major surgery yet, let alone one this complex. With only a week to prepare, how could she possibly succeed?

Dominic chuckled softly, his tone unexpectedly encouraging. “Everyone starts somewhere, Lila. Every surgeon has faced this kind of challenge. Do you really want to stay an intern forever?”

He leaned back in his chair, giving her a reassuring look. “Relax. I’ll teach you everything you need to know. Even if you aren’t ready in a week, it’s fine. Your sister won’t succeed either, so you’ll have time to practice. All you need to do is perform the surgery successfully before she does.”

Lila’s tense shoulders eased slightly as she considered his words. After a moment, she had to admit—Dominic had a point.

If she couldn’t pull it off, Evelyn certainly wouldn’t be able to. At least Lila had spent over a year at Grand Plains General, observing countless surgeries under Dominic’s meticulous guidance. In terms of both skill and experience, she was undeniably superior to Evelyn.

The thought brought her a sliver of relief.

Dominic, noticing the shift in her expression, added, “And think about it—if you succeed, you’ll be promoted to a full-fledged resident without even taking the exams. Isn’t that exactly what you’ve been working toward? This is your chance. Don’t you want to seize it?”

Lila pressed her lips together, a spark of determination igniting in her eyes. “Don’t worry, Dr. Pierce. I will succeed—no doubt about it.”

Dominic’s lips curved into a satisfied smile. “That’s what I like to hear. I have complete faith in you.”

After a brief pause, he continued, “For the next few days, don’t come to work. Focus entirely on training.”

“Understood.” Lila nodded firmly.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the hospital, Evelyn stepped out of the office and found a quiet corner to call Sebastian.

###Chapter 145

"How could you do that, Sebastian?" Evelyn's voice cut through the line, sharp with irritation the moment the call connected.

On the other end, Sebastian let out an uneasy laugh, his discomfort palpable. "Evelyn, I know I messed up. I broke my word. But what choice did I have? You saw how things were—I had to agree!"

Evelyn exhaled sharply, her tone laced with frustration. "Fine, you agreed. But why in the world did you have to suggest promoting me to attending physician?"

Sebastian’s voice turned firm. "What was I supposed to do? Let them trample all over us without putting up a fight?" His conviction was unwavering, as if his decision had been the only logical one. "If we're making this interesting, there needs to be stakes. Rewards, consequences—basic rules of engagement."

Evelyn arched a brow. "You could’ve just offered up your bonus," she countered coolly.

Sebastian hesitated, then chuckled awkwardly. "Uh… That didn’t exactly occur to me at the time."

"Oh, really?" Her voice dripped with skepticism.

"I swear, it's the truth!" he insisted. "Look, the bet’s been made, and the wheels are already in motion. Complaining now won’t change anything."

After a brief pause, he added, "Tell you what—to make up for this mess, I owe you a favor. Fair enough?"

Reluctantly, Evelyn realized there was no point dwelling on it further. She exhaled, resigning herself to the situation.

Sebastian’s tone shifted, turning serious. "The director received an anonymous complaint today, accusing me of favoritism. He’s demanding I address it properly. I know Dominic’s behind this, and I won’t let him walk away unscathed. He’s getting dragged into this mess."

Evelyn’s interest piqued. An anonymous complaint? No wonder Sebastian was so worked up.

"Now, this isn’t just about you and Lila anymore—it involves Dominic and me too," he continued. "When the time comes, don’t hold back."

"Understood. Don’t worry," Evelyn replied, her voice steady and assured. Mercy was the last thing on her mind when it came to Lila.

Sebastian’s tone softened slightly. "I have no doubts about your skills with a type-B aortic dissection. But the virtual surgery system might be new to you. You should practice."

"No need," Evelyn said smoothly. "I’ve used the virtual surgery system plenty of times before."

Sebastian paused, realization dawning. Of course—how could he forget who Evelyn’s mentor was? For someone like her, the system was child’s play.

"Alright then. That eases my mind," he said, relieved.

After exchanging a few more words, Evelyn ended the call and returned to her office.

News of the upcoming competition between Evelyn and Lila using the virtual surgery system spread like wildfire through the hospital. Speculation ran rampant, with most placing their bets on Lila. After all, she had been under Dominic’s expert guidance for years, while Evelyn—well, to most, she was just a pretty face with no real substance. Only a select few believed Evelyn stood a chance.

But Evelyn paid no mind to the whispers. She carried on with her work, unbothered by the storm brewing around her.

###Chapter 146

The phone buzzed on Evelyn's desk, Leonard Grant's name flashing across the screen. She exhaled sharply before answering. "Join Nathan for dinner tonight," he said, his tone leaving no room for negotiation. Though irritation prickled beneath her skin, she agreed. She knew Leonard too well—if she refused now, he’d only orchestrate another "coincidental" meeting later. Better to get it over with.

Just as she was packing up for the day, her phone rang again. This time, it was Cassandra Blake.

"Evelyn! Let’s grab dinner tonight," Cassandra chirped, her voice bright with enthusiasm.

"Sorry, I already have plans," Evelyn replied evenly.

Cassandra’s curiosity was immediate. "Plans? With who?"

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her phone. "Someone you wouldn’t know," she said, her voice cool.

A beat of silence. Then, a hasty apology. "Oh—sorry, I didn’t mean to pry. It just slipped out."

"It’s fine," Evelyn said, though her tone suggested otherwise.

Cassandra hesitated before pushing forward. "Well… what about after dinner? We could hit up the Velvet Lounge?"

"Busy then too," Evelyn declined, her politeness edged with finality.

The line went quiet, the silence stretching uncomfortably. Evelyn almost thought the call had dropped until Cassandra’s voice came through, softer now, tinged with uncertainty. "Evelyn… do you not like me?"

Evelyn pinched the bridge of her nose. She hated being put on the spot like this. "You’re overthinking it," she murmured, though the words felt hollow.

Another pause. Then, tentatively: "Then… tomorrow night?"

Evelyn hesitated. Cassandra’s next words rushed out, laced with vulnerability. "Look, I don’t have many people I can really talk to. Even though we haven’t known each other long, I like you. I’d love if we could be friends. But if I’m bothering you—just say so, and I’ll back off."

Evelyn sighed. She didn’t dislike Cassandra, but their worlds barely overlapped. Still, there was no harm in one dinner. "Alright," she relented. "Tomorrow works."

Cassandra’s voice brightened instantly. "Really? That’s—that’s great! So you don’t think I’m annoying?" Before Evelyn could respond, she barreled on. "Perfect! See you tomorrow!"

"Mm," Evelyn hummed, a faint smile tugging at her lips despite herself.

The restaurant Leonard had chosen was upscale, the kind with dim lighting and waiters who moved like shadows. A private room, of course. When Evelyn stepped inside, Nathan was already there, lounging in his chair like he owned the place.

"Order whatever you want," he said, barely glancing up.

Evelyn arched a brow. "How generous."

Nathan’s lips quirked. "I try."

The air between them crackled with unspoken tension.

###Chapter 147

After Evelyn settled into her seat, Nathan smoothly pushed the menu toward her. She scanned it briefly, selecting two dishes before sliding it back to him.

Once their orders were placed, silence stretched between them. After what felt like an eternity, Evelyn finally spoke. "Next time your father insists on us having dinner together, you don’t have to come."

Nathan arched a brow, his lips quirking into a faint smirk. "If I don’t, you’ll just run straight to Leonard and complain, won’t you?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply, irritation flickering in her eyes. "Fine. Then I won’t go either. Happy?"

Nathan studied her, his expression unreadable. She met his gaze evenly, her face betraying nothing. For some reason, her calmness only fueled his frustration.

Leaning back slightly, he let out a low chuckle, amusement lacing his tone. "Do you really think my father wouldn’t find out if we skipped? His reach is… extensive."

Evelyn hesitated, realizing he was right. Leonard Grant had eyes everywhere.

Nathan tilted his head, his voice dropping to a teasing murmur. "What’s the matter? Afraid of spending time with me?" His lips curved into a smirk. "Or… are you worried you might actually start liking me?"

Evelyn’s eyes widened before she scoffed, rolling them dramatically. "Nathan Black, your ego is truly something else."

He smirked. "Am I wrong?"

She traced the rim of her glass, her tone light but edged with challenge. "If anything, I’m doing you a favor. The more time you spend with me, the harder it’ll be for you to resist falling for me." She sighed theatrically. "And then you’ll regret ever suggesting divorce."

Nathan let out a derisive laugh. "That’s one thing you’ll never have to worry about."

Evelyn’s smile faded. "Good."

The conversation died there. The silence between them thickened as their food arrived, the tension almost palpable.

When they finished, they rose to leave. But just before they reached the exit, the door swung open on its own. Evelyn frowned—until a high-pitched squeak echoed through the air.

Her blood ran cold.

A swarm of mice—at least half a dozen—scurried inside, darting straight toward them.

Evelyn shrieked, her body moving before her mind could catch up. In a flash, she launched herself at Nathan, arms and legs locking around him like a vise.

Nathan staggered slightly at the sudden impact, instinctively securing his grip around her waist.

###Chapter 148

The moment Nathan processed what had just occurred, his expression darkened. His voice was low and commanding. "Get down."

"I—I can't! There are rats! They're everywhere!" Evelyn's voice trembled as she clung to him desperately, her body pressed tightly against his. Her fingers dug into his shoulders, as if letting go would mean being devoured by the scurrying creatures below.

Nathan frowned, glancing around the dimly lit room. Sure enough, small shadows darted across the floor. "They're just rodents," he muttered, baffled by her terror.

Before she could respond, the lights flickered—then died completely.

Evelyn let out a sharp cry, burying her face against his neck, her arms tightening around him like a vice. The warmth of her body, the faint floral scent of her hair—it all hit Nathan at once, stirring something unfamiliar in his chest.

For a moment, he froze. Then, irritation flickered across his features. "Evelyn. Get. Down." He reached to pry her legs from around his waist.

Her grip only tightened. "No! Please, Nathan—don't make me!" Her voice cracked, edged with genuine fear.

The raw panic in her tone made him pause. He exhaled sharply, studying her trembling form in the darkness. With a resigned sigh, he adjusted his hold on her, shifting her weight more securely in his arms.

Nathan moved toward the door, intending to leave—only to find it locked.

His jaw clenched. There was no doubt who was behind this. The rats, the power outage, the locked door—Leonard's doing, without question. Was the man really this petty?

"W-What's wrong?" Evelyn whispered, sensing his tension.

"The door's locked from the outside," Nathan said flatly.

Her breath hitched. "No—" The thought of being trapped here, with those creatures skittering around, sent a fresh wave of terror through her. She squeezed her eyes shut, her pulse racing.

Nathan had planned to set her down to make a call, but the sheer distress in her posture made him hesitate. Instead, he fished his phone from his pocket with one hand, dialing Leonard's number.

The line rang endlessly. No answer.

Of course.

Nathan exhaled, glancing down at Evelyn. "He's not picking up. Looks like we're stuck here for a while."

Evelyn bit her lip, frustration and fear warring in her expression. After a beat, she whispered, "Nathan… can you put me on the table?" She couldn't bear the thought of him holding her indefinitely, not knowing when they'd be freed.

Nathan hesitated, then turned on his phone's flashlight, illuminating the room. In one swift motion, he carried her to the dining table and set her down on a chair.

The moment her feet touched the surface, Evelyn curled into herself, hands clamping over her ears. The sound of tiny claws scratching against the floor echoed in her mind, dragging her back to a memory she'd fought to forget—elementary school, that day—

Her breath came in short gasps as panic clawed its way up her throat.

###Chapter 149

Nathan's brows furrowed deeply as he took in Evelyn's trembling form, a rare flicker of concern breaking through his usual composed demeanor. Just a few rodents—how had he underestimated their effect on her?

He dialed the Black family estate, but the line remained unanswered. After a brief hesitation, he called Winston. This time, the call connected.

Before Winston could speak, Nathan's sharp voice cut through. "Winston, tell my father to unlock the private room. Now."

"Evelyn isn't well," he added coldly, the phone on speaker. Leonard's voice crackled through immediately, laced with urgency. "What happened? Is she alright?"

Nathan glanced at Evelyn, his jaw tightening. "Thanks to your little game, she's curled up on a chair, shaking like she's been struck by lightning."

Leonard's tone shifted, a hint of remorse creeping in. "It's that bad?"

Nathan let out a humorless chuckle. "What do you think? Open the damn door."

"Fine, fine," Leonard relented, guilt seeping into his words. "I'll have it unlocked right away." The line went dead.

Within moments, the sound of a lock turning echoed through the private room, followed by the soft click of the door swinging open.

Nathan turned back to Evelyn, his gaze softening as he bent to lift her into his arms. Startled, she instinctively wrapped her arms around his neck, her body rigid with lingering fear. Without a word, he carried her out, his steps steady and deliberate.

Once outside, he didn't pause. He took her straight to the elevator, refusing to set her down even as they descended to the parking garage. Gently, he placed her in the passenger seat of his car.

Evelyn released her grip, her palms clammy, her breathing still uneven.

"Thank you," she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper.

Nathan didn't respond. He shut the door quietly before sliding into the driver's seat and starting the engine.

The drive was silent, tension hanging thick between them.

Evelyn remained lost in thought, her body still tense, her gaze distant. Nathan couldn't help but wonder—what had happened to her? What trauma had left her so terrified of something so small?

When they finally pulled into the Black estate's garage, both stepped out, the weight of the night pressing down on them. Evelyn's legs wobbled slightly as she walked, her eyes darting nervously to the ground as if expecting another unwelcome surprise.

Noticing her unease, Nathan softened his tone. "There's nothing here. You're safe."

Evelyn swallowed hard, her lips pressed into a thin line, her nerves still frayed.

As they entered the house, Leonard rose from the living room sofa, concern etched across his face. "Evelyn, are you alright?"

Her face was still pale, exhaustion shadowing her eyes. She met his gaze, her voice quiet but firm. "Leonard, don't ever do that again."

He nodded quickly, sincerity in his tone. "I promise. It won't happen again."

###Chapter 150

Nathan’s voice softened, laced with concern as he spoke. “Evelyn, you should go upstairs and rest now.”

Evelyn gave a faint nod, her lips barely moving as she murmured, “Alright, I’ll head to the bedroom.”

“Go ahead,” Leonard replied.

Once Evelyn had disappeared up the stairs, Leonard turned to Nathan, pulling him aside with a lowered voice. “Is Evelyn truly that terrified of mice?”

Nathan’s expression darkened as the memory of Evelyn’s panic in the private room flashed through his mind. “Yes,” he said flatly. After a beat, he added in a quieter tone, “It’s not just a simple fear. There’s something deeper—something traumatic behind it.”

Leonard sank onto the sofa, guilt twisting his features as he muttered, “This is my fault. I should’ve realized how severe it was. She’s mentioned it before, but I never thought…”

Nathan arched a brow, his voice dripping with dry amusement. “You really stooped low this time, didn’t you?”

“Shut it!” Leonard shot him a sharp look. “I don’t care what methods I use as long as they work.”

His plan had been simple—create a moment of fear to push Evelyn into Nathan’s arms. He had hoped that in her panic, she would instinctively seek Nathan’s protection, bringing them closer. But he hadn’t anticipated the depth of Evelyn’s terror.

Nathan let out a quiet scoff, his piercing gaze locking onto Leonard as he raised an eyebrow. “Old man, your birthday is in less than three weeks.”

Leonard caught the unspoken threat in his words, his expression shifting into something darker. “What’s the rush? There’s still time.”

Nathan merely gave a dismissive snort before standing and heading for the stairs without another word.

Leonard remained seated, his brow furrowed in frustration. He had no experience playing matchmaker, and now he was at a loss. If only he could make Nathan fall for Evelyn—then the idea of divorce would vanish entirely. He needed a better plan.

In the dead of night, Evelyn jolted upright in bed, a scream tearing from her throat. “No!” she gasped, her body trembling as she fought off the remnants of her nightmare. Her breaths came in short, ragged bursts as she tried to steady herself. It was just a dream…

The bedside lamp flicked on, and Nathan stirred, blinking sleepily at her. Even in the dim light, he could see the pallor of her face, the sheen of sweat on her skin.

“Evelyn,” his voice was rough with sleep, deep and grounding. “Why are you so afraid of mice?”

The quiet question hung in the air, making Evelyn’s pulse stutter. Maybe it was the rare gentleness in Nathan’s tone that loosened her tongue, or maybe she just needed to voice the fear that had haunted her for years.

Hugging her knees to her chest, she spoke softly, her voice barely audible. “When I was in elementary school, I was bullied for being overweight and for the birthmark on my cheek. In third grade, a group of classmates locked me in the school’s storage room…” She swallowed hard, her breath hitching. “There were dozens of mice in there. I was trapped with them—terrified and alone—for an entire night.”

The moment the words left her lips, Nathan’s expression shifted, something dark and unreadable flashing in his eyes.

###Chapter 151

Third grade.

Evelyn had just turned ten years old at the time.

A child that young, locked in a pitch-black, cramped space with dozens of rats for an entire night.

"What happened after that?" Nathan asked, his voice rough with barely restrained emotion.

Evelyn's fingers curled slightly around the edge of the blanket as she answered, her voice quiet but steady. "Afterward, my mother stormed into the school and made a scene. She threatened to take it to the press. The school panicked and expelled the students who locked me in there."

She paused, her gaze drifting to the window as the memory played behind her eyes.

She could still remember the way Grace had clutched her, sobbing, before grabbing a kitchen knife, ready to hunt down the people responsible.

Thankfully, Eleanor had stopped Grace before things escalated.

Evelyn exhaled slowly, pushing the blanket aside and slipping out of bed. "You should get some rest," she murmured to Nathan before padding silently to the balcony.

She sank into the swing chair, the cool night air brushing against her skin.

Nathan lay back down, but sleep eluded him, his mind replaying Evelyn’s words.

Half an hour later, Evelyn returned, her movements light as she slid back under the covers.

Eventually, Nathan drifted off, but Evelyn remained awake, the weight of the past pressing heavily on her chest.

The next day, at work, Evelyn stifled yet another yawn, exhaustion tugging at her.

"Rough night?" Vivian asked as they finished their rounds, her sharp eyes missing nothing.

Evelyn blinked, startled by the question, then offered a tired smile. "Yeah," she admitted.

"Make sure you rest," Vivian said, her tone firm but not unkind. After a beat, she added, "I’ve compiled some case studies on type B aortic dissections. Come with me to get them."

Evelyn’s brows lifted in surprise. She’d always assumed Vivian disliked her, yet here she was, going out of her way to help.

"Thank you, Dr. Cross," Evelyn said, her gratitude genuine.

Vivian’s response was characteristically clipped. "Study them. You’re on my team now. Don’t disappoint me when the time comes."

"I won’t," Evelyn promised, flipping through the files as soon as she received them. The detailed notes and surgical breakdowns made her appreciate Vivian’s unexpected support even more.

Then, her phone buzzed.

The caller ID gave her pause.

After a brief hesitation, she answered.

It was Grace, inviting her to lunch. Without questioning it, Evelyn agreed.

At noon, she arrived at the restaurant. When she stepped into the private room, Grace was already waiting.

 
###Chapter 152

"Evelyn, you're here!" Grace greeted her with a radiant smile, reaching out to clasp her hand warmly. "I've already ordered. Come, sit with me."

Grace guided Evelyn to the table, her eyes narrowing playfully as she said, "It's been too long since I've seen you. Why haven't you visited me lately?"

"I've been drowning in work," Evelyn explained, settling into the chair.

Grace gave a small nod. "Yes, I've heard the whispers around the hospital." Evelyn remained silent, her gaze steady.

After a pause, Grace hesitated before asking softly, "Evelyn, I need to know—did you really get into Grandview General Hospital because of your connection to the deputy director?"

A faint, knowing smile touched Evelyn's lips as she met Grace's eyes. "What do you think?" she countered.

Grace shook her head, uncertainty flickering in her gaze. "I truly don't know."

The smile on Evelyn's face slowly faded. She knew exactly what Grace was implying. Even though Grace claimed ignorance, Evelyn could tell she believed the position had been handed to her through favors.

Grace sighed, her tone softening. "It's not that I don't trust you, Evelyn. It's just… Grandview General is one of the most prestigious hospitals. Getting in isn't easy. Everyone says their doctors are the best. After graduation, you were a housewife at the Sterling estate, not interning at major hospitals. Then, after returning from Chixdon, you landed a job at Grandview directly. It's just… hard to understand."

Evelyn's expression remained unreadable. "There's no need to explain further. I just want to know—did you invite me to lunch today just to ask about this?"

"Of course not, darling. I just care about you deeply," Grace replied quickly, her voice laced with concern.

Evelyn let out a cold laugh, her tone dripping with sarcasm. "Oh? Is that so? For a moment, I thought you called me here because you heard about my competition with Lila. Maybe you wanted to ensure I let her win."

She turned to Grace, her smile sharpening with irony. "But now, I see… I must have misunderstood you, Mom."

Grace's face froze at Evelyn's words, her lips pressing into a thin line. Evelyn watched the hesitation in Grace's eyes, her own smile faltering.

After a beat of silence, Evelyn scoffed, her voice thick with derision. "So… You did come here to tell me to let Lila win, didn’t you?"

Grace's lips trembled before she finally spoke, her voice unsteady. "Evelyn, I know this is difficult, and I know you'll be disappointed in me. But… I'm doing this for both of us. Your father mentioned that if Lila loses, she’ll be dismissed from Grandview and never rehired. The consequences are too severe." She paused, her voice shaking. "If Lila were dismissed for any other reason, we could handle it. But if it’s because she lost to you… it would be different. Do you understand?"

"No, I don’t!" Evelyn's face darkened, her voice rising with frustration.

Tears welled in Grace's eyes as she met Evelyn's gaze. "Evelyn… I'm so sorry. This is all my fault."

Evelyn cut her off sharply. "Mom, I’ll ask you one thing. You only considered that Lila shouldn’t be dismissed because of me. Did you ever think about what happens if I lose? If I lose, I’ll be dismissed too. I’ll never be rehired. And once I’m out of Grandview, no other hospital will take me."

As she spoke, Evelyn’s eyes locked onto Grace’s, her voice heavy with an emotion Grace wasn’t prepared for.

###Chapter 153

Evelyn's eyes widened slightly in disbelief. "Is... Is it truly that dire?"

Grace remained silent, her quietude speaking volumes more than any words could.

After a prolonged pause, Evelyn's voice quivered as she whispered, "But... But that's precisely why Lila can't lose! If she does, Diana will hold it against you, and your father—he'll be livid, beyond reasoning. Grace, I'm pleading with you, please let Lila win this time. Even if... Even if it means you'll be expelled from the hospital, I'll take care of you. I'll support you for the rest of your life. And you still have Nathan, don’t you? Nathan and his father—surely they won’t let you struggle to find work."

Grace reached out and clutched Evelyn’s hand tightly, her expression desperate and imploring.

A crushing wave of disappointment constricted Evelyn’s chest, suffocating her. No matter how Grace tried to justify it, the truth was glaring—Grace wanted her to sacrifice her own future for Lila’s sake. How utterly preposterous!

Evelyn stared at Grace, the storm inside her making it impossible to discern whether she was more wounded or disillusioned.

After drawing a slow breath, Evelyn spoke, each syllable sharp as a blade. "You told me never to outshine Lila before, and I obeyed. You said I shouldn’t surpass her in anything, that I should always remain beneath her, and I complied. Now, with this competition—one that could shape my entire future—you want me to yield again?"

Then, unexpectedly, a faint smile curved Evelyn’s lips—but it wasn’t one of joy. It was a smile that concealed more anguish than any tears could reveal.

Evelyn continued, her voice steady yet brittle, "Mother, I have to ask... Are you truly my mother, or Lila’s?"

At Evelyn’s words, Grace’s face drained of color.

Grace had never imagined Evelyn would say something so cutting. Each word struck like a dagger to her heart.

Her voice trembled. "Evelyn... You... You’ve truly wounded me with those words. I never thought you’d doubt me like this!"

Evelyn couldn’t help but scoff softly at Grace’s reaction. She had wounded her? Did Grace even realize the scars she had etched into Evelyn’s heart over the years? The countless moments of pain and betrayal that had accumulated like layers of dust?

Grace, still frantic, pressed on, her voice shaking. "I know... I know what I’m asking is unfair. But I... I have no choice. It’s for our future, for both of us."

Evelyn’s expression remained icy, her features unyielding. Grace’s desperate pleas left no mark on her resolve.

Seeing this, Grace’s sorrow deepened. She knew her attempts at remorse had only widened the chasm between them.

Then, abruptly, a sharp crack echoed through the room. Grace had struck herself across the face, the sound reverberating like a blow to Evelyn’s soul.

Evelyn’s gaze snapped up in shock, her eyes widening.

Grace’s face crumpled with guilt. "It’s all my fault. I’ve been useless my entire life."

"Not only am I a failure, but now I’ve dragged my daughter into this mess." Tears spilled from her eyes as she sniffled. She lifted her gaze to Evelyn once more, her voice breaking as she sobbed, "Evelyn, I’ve made up my mind. Do what you believe is right. I won’t ask you to promise anything anymore."

But Evelyn saw through her mother’s words. Despite the tears, despite the sorrow, Grace still wanted her to let Lila win. At that moment, Evelyn found the entire situation absurd—utterly meaningless. The realization drew a faint, bitter smile from her as she spoke plainly. "You don’t need to torment yourself anymore. I promise—I’ll let Lila have her way."

###Chapter 154

At Evelyn's words, Grace's eyes widened in shock, a flicker of disbelief crossing her delicate features. "Eleanor, you... You..."

But after a stunned silence, Grace quickly composed herself, her voice softening like silk. "Eleanor, I told you there was no need for that. Just do what feels right to you."

Evelyn's expression remained as cool as winter frost, unwavering. "I've made my decision, and I won't go back on it." She paused, the weight of her words settling between them before continuing, her tone steady. "You got what you wanted. Whether we finish this meal or not doesn't matter anymore. I'm heading back to the hospital now. You can stay and enjoy your lunch."

With that, she stood, her movements sharp and decisive.

"Eleanor!" Grace's voice cracked as she reached out, her fingers wrapping around Evelyn's wrist. Her eyes shimmered with unshed tears as she pleaded, "I've missed you so much. Please, stay. Have lunch with me."

Evelyn didn’t spare her a glance.

Her face remained impassive as she replied coolly, "No. I'm not in the mood for this. I need time alone."

She effortlessly freed her wrist from Grace's grasp, picked up her designer handbag, and turned on her heel.

"Eleanor—" Grace's voice trembled, but Evelyn didn’t look back. Her resolve was steel. Staying would only make things worse for both of them.

Once inside her car, Evelyn sank into the leather seat, tilting her head back against the headrest. She closed her eyes, the weight of the day pressing down on her like a storm cloud. She couldn’t quite name the emotions churning inside her—anger, resentment, but also something softer, something that ached.

Despite everything Grace had done, despite the years of betrayal and pain, Evelyn could never bring herself to truly hate the woman who had given her life. Memories of Grace’s rare moments of tenderness surfaced, dulling the sharp edges of her bitterness.

Then, her phone rang, shattering the silence.

Evelyn glanced at the caller ID, and instantly, her expression brightened. She answered without hesitation.

"Eleanor."

A warm, melodic voice greeted her.

"Grandma!" Evelyn's face lit up, her voice brimming with joy. "When are you coming to Owathe? You've been traveling forever. Are you back in the country?"

When Evelyn had first returned, she’d called Eleanor Sinclair, her beloved grandmother, offering to bring her to Owathe. But Eleanor had been on an extended trip with close friends, and the reunion had been delayed.

"Yes, darling, I'm back! Just arrived today," Eleanor replied cheerfully.

"I'll come pick you up," Evelyn said eagerly.

"No need, my dear. Isabelle will accompany me. I’ll head to Owathe after resting for a few days."

Evelyn hesitated. "With Isabelle there, I do feel better... but I still want to see you. I’ve missed you so much."

Eleanor’s voice softened, laced with affection. "You don’t need to trouble yourself, sweetheart. I know how busy you are. Isabelle will take good care of me. Just wait for me patiently."

###Chapter 155

Evelyn hesitated for a moment before letting out a soft sigh. "Fine, but hurry up, or I swear I'll come get you myself!"

"Alright, alright," Eleanor chuckled warmly.

After a brief pause, she asked gently, "Evelyn, sweetheart, have you been happy since coming back? If something's troubling you, don't bottle it up. I'm always here to listen."

Evelyn's breath hitched, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. "I'm fine, Grandma. Really, don't worry about me."

Though Evelyn tried to sound convincing, Eleanor caught the faint tremor in her voice. She decided not to press further—some things were better discussed in person. They exchanged a few more words before Eleanor ended the call.

Without wasting a second, Eleanor dialed another number.

"Mom?" Grace's voice was laced with surprise.

"Did you do something to upset Evelyn?" Eleanor demanded, cutting straight to the point.

Grace stiffened, her pulse quickening. "No! Of course not! Why would you think that?"

"I just spoke to her. She didn't sound like herself," Eleanor said, her tone firm.

Grace exhaled sharply, forcing a laugh. "Mom, you're overreacting. I haven't done anything to her."

Eleanor's voice turned icy. "Grace, I won't interfere with whatever schemes you're running with that family—that's your business. But mark my words, if I find out you're using Evelyn as a pawn for your ambitions, there will be consequences."

Grace swallowed hard, her fingers tightening around her phone. "Did you hear me?" Eleanor pressed.

"Yes, Mom. Loud and clear," Grace muttered, her voice barely above a whisper.

"Good. Don't forget it," Eleanor snapped before hanging up.

Grace bit her lip, her mind racing.

Meanwhile, in the luxurious VIP ward of Grand Hills General Hospital, Serena pushed open the door and stepped inside.

"Dylan," she called softly, relief coloring her voice.

"Serena," Dylan replied, sitting up straighter. He frowned as he noticed her uneven steps. "What happened? You're limping."

Serena froze for a split second before forcing a smile. "Oh, just a little stumble yesterday. It's nothing serious—already feeling better."

Dylan nodded, though concern still flickered in his eyes. Before he could say more, Serena quickly changed the subject. "How about you? Any improvement?"

"I was ready to leave yesterday," Dylan said, throwing his hands up in exasperation. "But my mother, being her usual dramatic self, insisted I stay longer."

After the incident at the bar, Dylan had thought the worst was over—especially once the nausea subsided. But that night, crippling stomach pain and cold sweats had sent him rushing to the hospital.

Serena laughed softly. "Aunt Cassandra does worry a lot."


###Chapter 156

Dylan merely scoffed in response, his mind drifting momentarily. Serena, sensing the shift in his mood, ventured cautiously, "Perhaps we should step back from Evelyn for now."

His reaction was immediate, laced with bitterness. "You want to quit now? This is only the beginning. No, we're not backing down that easily."

Serena's voice softened with worry. "It just feels like every time we face her, we end up worse off."

Dylan's expression darkened as memories of their past encounters with Evelyn flashed through his mind.

Once, he had been the one to torment Evelyn, who had no choice but to endure in silence. Now, the roles had reversed. He let out a derisive laugh. "Don't worry. Like I said, this is just the start," he murmured, his eyes narrowing slightly.

Frustration simmered within him as he wrestled with his emotions. He despised Evelyn, but what disgusted him more was the realization that he harbored feelings for her. Shaking off the thought, he refocused on the conversation. "You'll see, Serena," he said, his voice a mix of determination and resentment. "Evelyn's time at Grand Oaks General Hospital is running out. She won't be so arrogant for much longer."

Serena frowned, perplexed. "What do you mean?"

Dylan leaned in, lowering his voice. "Uncle Dominic told me the surgery Evelyn is handling is way beyond her expertise. It's almost guaranteed she'll be dismissed soon."

Serena blinked, processing his words, her eyes flickering with unease. After a pause, she sighed. "But every time I see Evelyn, I can't shake this fear. Just the other day, when I brought food to Nathan, I ran into her, and she threatened me again."

Dylan stiffened. "Really? You never mentioned that."

Serena's gaze dropped. "What difference would it make? It already happened. Besides..." She hesitated, then continued quietly, "She wasn't entirely wrong. She and Nathan are still married, and I'm just his ex."

Dylan's voice was firm. "Don't let her words get to you. Their marriage doesn't define your place in Nathan's heart. What matters is who he truly cares about."

Serena met his eyes, her expression uncertain. "But do you really think I still matter to him?" she whispered.

"Of course. Isn't it obvious?" Dylan answered without hesitation.

Serena fell silent, her face unreadable. Sensing her turmoil, Dylan gave her shoulder a reassuring squeeze. "Don't overthink it, Serena. Trust me. I'll make sure Nathan ends things with Evelyn and marries you. Just leave it to me."

Serena nodded slowly. "Alright. I trust you."

Dylan smiled, his mind already racing with plans.

Meanwhile, Evelyn's day had been overshadowed by her earlier confrontation with Grace. She had planned to hit the Dream Club with Cassandra but canceled, lacking the energy for socializing. All she wanted now was a drink. Initially, she considered calling Natalie, but with her away on business, she dialed Alexander instead.

Alexander suggested a high-end restaurant, hoping good food might lift her spirits.


###Chapter 157

"Cheers," Evelyn said, raising her whiskey glass and clinking it against Alexander's. She downed the amber liquid in one swift motion and immediately refilled her glass.

"Another," she declared, polishing off three glasses in rapid succession. As she reached for a fourth, Alexander swiftly intercepted her hand. "Hold on, that's enough! You'll be flat on your back if you keep this up."

Evelyn waved him off with a careless flick of her wrist. "Relax. I can handle my liquor."

"Even if you can, this isn't the way to do it," Alexander warned, his brow furrowing. After a beat, he asked softly, "What's really going on?"

With a bitter laugh, Evelyn confessed the looming competition with Lila. Alexander's expression darkened. "What happened after you agreed to face her? Has your father spoken to you?"

Evelyn shook her head slightly. "No. It's my mother..."

A sardonic smile twisted her lips as she continued, "She wants me to let Lila win."

"What?" Alexander's shock was palpable. "Your mother actually said that? She expects you to just... throw the competition?"

Evelyn nodded. "Exactly. Ridiculous, right?"

Alexander was momentarily speechless, struggling to process the absurdity. Finally, he demanded, "But why? Why would she ask that of you?"

Evelyn's gaze dropped to her glass. "She said if Lila gets expelled because of our rivalry, it'll only make things worse for both of us at home."

Alexander absorbed her words before sighing. "I get her concern, but that doesn't make it right. Does she even realize what losing would mean for you?"

"Oh, she knows," Evelyn replied, exhaling sharply before recounting Grace's disheartening words.

When she finished, Alexander let out a dry chuckle. "She's only looking out for herself, isn't she? But has she considered your reputation? If you lose now, the gossip will explode. You can't agree to this!"

Evelyn smirked, a glint of mischief in her eyes. "I already told her I'd let Lila have her way."

Alexander's frown deepened. "Evelyn! Have you lost your mind?"

Her sly grin widened. "Why so serious? I said I'd let her win. But the how... that's up to me."

Understanding dawned on Alexander, and he burst into laughter. "Now that sounds like you." He grabbed his glass and raised it. "Alright, since you're clearly in a mood, let's drink until you forget this nonsense."

The weight of her mother's betrayal pressed heavily on Evelyn, and alcohol seemed the easiest escape. She knocked back another glass, her usual composure slipping as the liquor took hold.

Soon, she was standing on the sofa, a fake flower in one hand and a vase as her makeshift microphone. "Hello, everyone! Let's get this party started! Hands up!" she shouted, her inhibitions long gone.

###Chapter 158

Alexander couldn't help but burst into laughter at the sight before him. It was the first time he'd seen Evelyn so uninhibited, and it was unexpectedly amusing.

Suddenly, Evelyn turned to him with a playful glare. "You! Yes, you, standing there like a statue. Why aren't your hands up? Join me—don’t just stand there watching!"

Caught off guard, Alexander pointed at himself, torn between disbelief and amusement. "Me?"

"Yes, you! Hands up—let’s see some enthusiasm!" Evelyn demanded, her voice ringing with infectious energy.

Alexander froze for a moment, baffled. It was clear now—Evelyn was completely drunk. She didn’t even recognize him anymore, not bothering to call him by name.

"Come on! Or do I have to come over there and make you do it myself?" she challenged, her impatience growing.

Seeing no point in arguing with a tipsy Evelyn, Alexander finally raised his hands, waving them half-heartedly with a resigned smirk.

"That’s more like it!" she cheered, clearly satisfied.

Alexander hoped her excitement would fade soon, but instead, Evelyn’s energy only intensified. She had him clapping, singing along, and at one point, even attempting a ridiculous dance move.

Realizing this couldn’t go on much longer, Alexander sighed, picked up Evelyn’s discarded heels, and scooped her up from the couch.

"Alright, superstar, time to go," he said.

"How dare you!" Evelyn protested, her playful outrage peaking as she tugged at his hair and pinched his ear. "You brute! Put me down!"

"Ow—easy there!" Alexander winced, quickening his pace toward the door.

Just as he reached the hallway, he nearly collided with Nathan, who had stepped out of the opposite room unexpectedly.

Alexander halted abruptly, caught off guard by the sudden encounter. Nathan, equally surprised, took in the scene—Evelyn in Alexander’s arms, both looking slightly disheveled—and his expression darkened instantly.

His voice was icy as he demanded, "What’s going on here?"

Before Alexander could explain, Evelyn, still in his arms, cupped his face with drunken delight. "You’re handsome! What’s your name? Maybe you can be my new boyfriend," she slurred, her words laced with teasing mischief.

The hallway fell silent.

Alexander glanced at Nathan, his expression a mix of awkwardness and resignation. He had no idea how to explain this.

Nathan’s assistant, standing behind him, quickly averted his gaze but couldn’t resist stealing a glance at his boss. Nathan’s expression was stormy, his jaw clenched.

Nathan’s voice was sharp as he repeated, "Explain. Now."

Alexander exhaled. "Nathan, it’s not what it looks like. We were just having dinner, and Evelyn drank too much because she was upset."

But the tension in the air was already thick enough to cut with a knife.

###Chapter 159

Nathan's piercing gaze locked onto Alexander, his jaw tightening visibly. "Since when are the two of you close enough for private dinners?" His voice was laced with frost, the air between them turning brittle.

Alexander offered a placating smile, though tension coiled beneath the surface. "Evelyn and I... we're friends."

The word friends lingered, heavy with unspoken implications.

Nathan's brow furrowed, suspicion darkening his expression. Friends? Since when? And why was this the first he was hearing of it?

Evelyn, slumped against Alexander's side, was clearly too intoxicated to explain. Nathan clenched his fists, deciding to let it go—for now. Instead, he stepped forward, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "Hand her over. Now."

Alexander didn't argue. Carefully, he shifted Evelyn into Nathan's arms, her body limp and uncoordinated.

Evelyn groaned, her face scrunching in discomfort. "Stop jostling me!" she slurred, flailing an arm—only to accidentally smack Nathan square across the cheek.

A muscle in Nathan's jaw twitched. He glared down at her, his voice a low, threatening growl. "Behave, or I swear you'll regret it."

The sharpness in his tone momentarily sobered her. Her glossy eyes welled with unshed tears, making her look heartbreakingly fragile.

Nathan exhaled sharply, irritation warring with something softer. Without another word to Alexander, he adjusted his grip on Evelyn and turned away.

Alexander quickly handed Evelyn's forgotten shoes to Nathan's assistant, Gordon, who nodded and hurried after them.

The walk to the car was uneventful—until Evelyn, suddenly revived by the night air, scrambled into the back seat with drunken enthusiasm.

Thud.

"Ow!" She yelped, clutching her head after smacking it against the car roof. She curled into a miserable ball, whimpering.

Nathan watched, the corner of his mouth twitching despite himself. "Serves you right," he muttered, though his tone lacked its usual bite.

Up front, Gordon sat ramrod straight, eyes fixed determinedly ahead, while the driver pressed the accelerator harder, eager to escape the chaos.

Just as they thought she might settle, Evelyn perked up again, her energy renewed.

By the time they arrived at the Grant estate, Nathan had half a mind to toss her over his shoulder like a sack of potatoes.

Evelyn, however, had other ideas. She blinked up at him, her cheeks flushed, and giggled. "Wow, you're really strong. And so handsome. Someone should wife you up."

Nathan ignored her, focusing on getting her inside without further disaster.

The moment Leonard Grant spotted Nathan carrying Evelyn into the living room, he shot to his feet, shock written across his face. "Nathan? What on earth happened? Why are you two together?"

###Chapter 160

Before Nathan could utter a word, Evelyn, still tipsy and brimming with mischief, blurted out, "Hey, mister! That beard of yours is epic! Is it even real?"

With a playful smirk, she reached out and gave Leonard's beard a firm tug.

"Ow!" Leonard yelped, jerking back in surprise.

Rubbing his chin, he stared at Evelyn with wide, incredulous eyes. His expression was a perfect mix of shock and discomfort.

"It hurts? That means it's real! This is hilarious!" Evelyn giggled, clapping her hands in delight.

Leonard's face twisted between pain and bewilderment, drawing a faint smirk from Nathan. Evelyn was the first person audacious enough to yank Leonard’s beard—and live to tell the tale.

"Is she drunk?" Winston asked, his eyebrows nearly disappearing into his hairline.

"Extremely," Nathan replied, his voice rough.

"Let’s get her upstairs to rest. I’ll have someone prepare some sobering soup," Leonard said, cautiously stepping back to maintain a safe distance from Evelyn.

Nathan nodded silently before scooping Evelyn into his arms and carrying her to her room.

Once inside, he unceremoniously dropped her onto the bed.

"Oof!" Evelyn groaned as she rolled across the mattress, momentarily dazed. But the second the room stopped spinning, her chaotic energy returned. She snatched a bedsheet, draped it dramatically over her shoulders, and wobbled toward the desk.

Using her hands and feet, she clambered onto the desk, standing tall like a triumphant superhero. "Fear not, citizens! For I am... the Spectacular Spider Queen!" she declared, swaying slightly.

Nathan watched her antics with a mix of exasperation and reluctant amusement—Evelyn was undeniably entertaining in this state.

"Woo-hoo! Time to fly!" she cheered, wobbling dangerously at the edge of the desk.

Nathan’s eyes widened in alarm when he realized she was about to jump. "Evelyn!" he barked sharply.

Startled by his tone, she froze mid-motion and blinked at him owlishly.

Nathan strode forward. "Get down. Slowly."

"No jumping," he warned, his voice firm but laced with concern.

Evelyn grinned dopily at him. "Watch me soar!" she declared before launching herself off the desk.

Nathan moved faster than thought, lunging forward to catch her mid-air. She crashed into his arms, immediately wrapping herself around him like an overenthusiastic koala.

"Evelyn! What the hell were you thinking? That was reckless!" Nathan snapped, his jaw tight with frustration.

Just as he spoke, a sharp pain flared at his neck. Nathan hissed, his brows knitting together.

Evelyn had bitten him.

Hard.

"Evelyn," he growled, irritation simmering in his voice as he deposited her onto the sofa. "You’re going to regret that."

Evelyn merely giggled, thoroughly pleased with herself.

###Chapter 161

A sharp knock at the door shattered the moment.

Nathan answered it to find Winston Graves standing there, holding a steaming bowl of soup. Taking the bowl, Nathan turned and handed it to Evelyn, who was now perched on the edge of the sofa. "Drink this," he ordered, his voice firm but not unkind.

Evelyn straightened her posture, trying to appear composed despite the lingering haze of alcohol. "Okay," she murmured before downing the soup in three quick gulps.

Setting the empty bowl aside, she wiped her mouth with the back of her hand—then let out an embarrassingly loud belch.

Before Nathan could react, she flopped face-first onto the couch, completely spent.

Nathan stared at her for a long moment, torn between exasperation and reluctant amusement. With a sigh, he scooped her up effortlessly and carried her back to bed.

Exhausted from the night’s antics, Evelyn was already fast asleep, her breathing deep and even. Nathan draped a blanket over her before retreating to the bathroom.

Standing in front of the mirror, he examined the faint but unmistakable bite mark on his neck—a stark reminder of Evelyn’s drunken recklessness.

"Unbelievable," he muttered under his breath, shaking his head.

The Next Morning

The shrill alarm jolted Evelyn awake, her head pounding as if someone had taken a hammer to it.

She groaned, pressing her palms against her temples. What the hell had happened last night? Had she been in a fight?

Slowly, the fog in her mind cleared, and fragments of the previous night resurfaced.

Her eyes widened in horror.

Oh.

Oh no.

That drunken idiot—that had been her.

Evelyn buried her face in her hands, silently screaming. She wanted to melt into the mattress and never resurface.

The bathroom door clicked open, and Nathan stepped out, freshly showered. The moment he saw her curled up in mortification, a smirk tugged at his lips.

"Well, well. The diva finally graces us with consciousness."

Evelyn bit her lip so hard she nearly drew blood. She couldn’t even look at him—not after the way she’d shamelessly referred to herself as a superstar last night.

Taking a deep breath, she forced herself to meet his gaze, her expression carefully neutral.

"I… apologize for last night. I had too much to drink and lost control."

Nathan strolled toward her, stopping just inches away. He crossed his arms, his dark eyes gleaming with amusement.

"Oh, this should be good. Go on."

###Chapter 162

"I have just one question," Nathan said, his voice low and rough with amusement. "When exactly did you turn into a spider woman?"

Evelyn's carefully constructed composure shattered in an instant. A flush of anger and humiliation spread across her face as she flung the covers aside and bolted for the bathroom at breakneck speed.

The scent of alcohol clung to her so strongly now that it nearly overwhelmed her own senses.

By the time she finally emerged, Nathan was already gone.

Evelyn exhaled in relief.

But the moment she descended the stairs and spotted Leonard, the memories of last night came rushing back, and she nearly choked on her own mortification.

She approached him with an awkward smile. "Leonard, I—I'm so sorry about last night. I had too much to drink and made a complete fool of myself."

Leonard only laughed, his eyes crinkling with warmth. "Oh, don't worry about it! Happens to the best of us."

Then, his expression softened into something more serious. "Though, I must say, drinking that much isn't wise. Try to be more careful next time."

"I will," Evelyn promised quickly.

"Good! Now, come join me for breakfast," Leonard said cheerfully.

Evelyn shook her head. "I can't—I'm already running late for work. I'll grab something at the hospital. See you later!"

Without waiting for a response, she hurried out the door.

That afternoon, Evelyn's phone buzzed with a call from Victor.

She answered with barely concealed impatience. "What is it?"

"Come home for dinner tonight," Victor commanded.

Evelyn's reply was sharp. "If you have something to say, say it now." Every invitation from Victor was just an excuse to berate her for something. She always left those dinners seething.

"Your aunt Victoria and her family are visiting," Victor said.

Evelyn's frown deepened. That made her even less inclined to go. But after a brief hesitation, she relented. "Fine. I'll be there." She hung up before he could say another word.

After her shift, Evelyn drove straight to the Sterling estate.

When she arrived, Victoria Sinclair and her family were already seated in the parlor. Evelyn greeted them politely.

Victoria gasped dramatically, her eyes widening. "Good heavens! Is this really Evelyn?" Victor had warned her about Evelyn's transformation, but nothing could have prepared her for this.

Celeste, Victoria's daughter, gaped openly. "Wait—Evelyn, did you get plastic surgery?"

Victoria shot her a sharp look. "Celeste, manners." She turned back to Evelyn with a saccharine smile. "Evelyn has always been lovely. She was just a bit heavier before, so her features weren't as noticeable."

Evelyn tilted her head slightly, studying Victoria with cool detachment.

###Chapter 163

"You can't blame me for pointing it out!" Celeste huffed, crossing her arms. "The transformation is just too shocking to ignore."

At that moment, Victor clapped his hands sharply to gather everyone's attention. "Now that we're all present, let's move to the dining room. Dinner is served."

"Finally," someone muttered as the group filed into the lavish dining hall and took their seats.

The meal was halfway through when Victoria suddenly turned to Evelyn with a saccharine smile. "Your father mentioned you've grown quite close to the Caldwell family. Is that true?"

Evelyn arched a delicate brow, her voice smooth as silk. "Yes, that's correct."

Victoria's face lit up instantly. "Wonderful! The Caldwells are currently seeking partners for their new venture. Gregory's company is very interested. Since we're family, why don’t you put in a good word with Mr. Caldwell for him?"

A quiet scoff escaped Evelyn’s lips. So this is the real reason for the sudden warmth.

Everything clicked into place—Victoria’s rare defense of her earlier, the uncharacteristic kindness. Victoria had always looked down on her, the illegitimate daughter of Victor Sterling, barely worth a second thought.

But now that she needed a favor, false sweetness dripped from her words.

Evelyn maintained her composed smile. "I'm afraid I can't help you with that, Aunt Victoria."

Victoria’s brows furrowed, irritation flashing in her eyes. "What do you mean? You’re practically family to them! It’s just a small request."

Evelyn’s expression didn’t waver. "I don’t involve myself in the Caldwells' business affairs. Please don’t put me in this position."

Victoria’s face darkened, her tone laced with venom. "How quickly people forget their roots when they climb higher. Fine. If you won’t help your own family, then so be it."

Evelyn remained silent, her gaze steady and unyielding. She refused to dignify the jab with a response.

Frustrated by the dismissal, Victoria whirled toward Victor. "Aren’t you going to say anything about this?"

Victor’s jaw tightened at Evelyn’s defiance, but then he remembered—Grace had already tried and failed to sway her regarding the Caldwells. If even her own mother couldn’t persuade her, Victoria stood no chance.

Before he could speak, Diana’s voice cut through the tension.

"Business matters shouldn’t involve the younger generation. Victoria, don’t pressure Evelyn."

Victoria blinked, stunned by Diana’s unexpected defense. She hadn’t seen that coming.


###Chapter 164

With those words from Diana, what else could Evelyn say? She forced a tight-lipped smile and murmured, "Alright, Diana, I won't mention it again."

And just like that, the topic was buried, never to resurface.

After dinner, the family gathered in the living room, exchanging lighthearted chatter. Evelyn, however, was already searching for an excuse to slip away.

That was when Lila, mischief dancing in her eyes, suddenly piped up. "Evelyn, Celeste mentioned wanting to check out a bar. Why don’t we take her to The Velvet Lounge tonight? What do you think?"

Victor, ever the opportunist, seized the moment to keep the atmosphere lively. "Great idea. Sitting around here is boring. Go out and have fun—my treat."

Evelyn hesitated for only a heartbeat.

Having already turned down Victoria earlier, she knew refusing Celeste’s invitation would come across as too harsh. They were still family, after all, and there was no point in making things more uncomfortable than they already were.

With a quiet exhale, she nodded. "Fine. Let’s go."

And so, Evelyn, Lila, and Celeste headed to The Velvet Lounge.

But what Evelyn hadn’t anticipated was that the moment they settled into their booth, they’d bump into someone she knew all too well…

At the sound of that voice, Evelyn’s brows knitted slightly. She turned, and just as she’d expected, there stood Cassandra and Julian.

"Evelyn! What a surprise seeing you here!" Cassandra beamed, her delight unmistakable.

Evelyn offered a polite nod but kept her silence.

"Evelyn, who are they?" Lila asked, her sharp eyes scanning Cassandra and Julian. Their designer outfits screamed wealth and status.

Evelyn answered coolly, "They’re distant relatives of Marcus Donovan—Cassandra Blake and Julian Montgomery."

The mention of "Marcus Donovan" and the surname "Blake" sent a visible spark of interest through both Lila and Celeste.

Ever the social butterfly, Lila was the first to extend a hand. "Ms. Blake, Mr. Montgomery, it’s such a pleasure. I’m Evelyn’s sister, Lila Sinclair."

She gestured to Celeste. "And this is our cousin, Celeste Sinclair."

"A pleasure," Celeste added smoothly, her tone polished.

After a brief pause, Lila leaned in, curiosity dripping from her words. "Ms. Blake, Mr. Montgomery, are you meeting anyone here tonight?"

"No, just the two of us," Cassandra replied, her smile warm—though Evelyn caught the flicker of something unreadable in her gaze.

"Then why don’t you join us?" Lila suggested, her eyes alight with excitement. "The more, the merrier!"

She then turned to Evelyn, her voice suddenly sweetened with faux consideration. "Evelyn, you don’t mind, do you?"

Evelyn’s expression darkened, the weight of the situation pressing down on her. What could she say now that the invitation had already been extended?

###Chapter 165

"Of course, I don’t mind," Evelyn replied, her tone smooth but laced with the faintest hesitation.

With that, the group settled into the plush booth together.

As Cassandra and Julian joined them, Lila and Celeste immediately shifted their focus, their gazes sharpening with interest as they zeroed in on the siblings. They effortlessly took control of the conversation, tossing out topics like practiced socialites.

At one point, Cassandra’s voice sliced through the chatter. "Oh, you mean Ethan? Hold on—I’ll call him right now." She pulled out her phone, fingers flying across the screen as she dialed.

"Ethan, it’s me. Evelyn and I are at The Velvet Lounge. You should come join us."

A soft hum of approval escaped Cassandra’s lips as she listened, nodding along to whatever Ethan said on the other end. "Perfect! We’ll wait for you."

She hung up and turned to Lila and Celeste, a satisfied smile curling her lips. "He’ll be here soon."

Celeste’s face brightened, her eyes gleaming with something dangerously close to triumph.

Evelyn, observing the exchange, felt her brows knit together. What was that look on Celeste’s face? What game was she playing now?

The subtle shift in the air left Evelyn unsettled.

Nearly an hour later, Ethan finally arrived.

"Ethan!" Cassandra waved eagerly, her voice bubbling with excitement.

Ethan acknowledged her with a curt nod before striding toward the booth—without hesitation, he slid into the seat beside Evelyn.

"Ethan," Evelyn greeted him, warmth softening her voice.

Just as Ethan opened his mouth to respond, a saccharine voice cut through the air.

"Ethan, may I call you by your first name?" Both Evelyn and Ethan turned. It was Lila who had spoken.

Evelyn barely suppressed a smirk at the audacity of the question.

Ethan, of course, knew exactly who Lila was. His gaze frosted over as he delivered a razor-sharp reply. "No, you may not."

Lila flinched, her cheeks flushing pink with humiliation. She stammered, "I-I’m sorry, Mr. Caldwell. I just thought… since Evelyn is so close to your family now, our families are practically connected. I assumed we could be… familiar."

Ethan’s response was a single, icy scoff, his expression darkening.

He fixed Lila with a look so cutting it could slice steel. "The Caldwell family is close to Evelyn—not the Sinclairs. I trust you understand the difference."

Lila’s face drained of color. The insult was unmistakable—the Caldwells recognized Evelyn alone, and the Sinclairs had no place in that equation.

The tension in the booth thickened to suffocating levels. Lila looked ready to melt into the floor, while even Cassandra and Julian shifted uncomfortably.

###Chapter 166
Celeste's burning gaze remained fixed on Evelyn. How could Evelyn simply sit there, allowing Ethan to publicly humiliate Lila like that? Weren't they supposed to be family? Was Evelyn finding some twisted amusement in this spectacle? Was she secretly reveling in Lila's discomfort?

Celeste's contempt for Evelyn grew deeper as she studied her cousin's composed expression.

Lila forced a brittle smile, her voice tight with suppressed anger. "Yes, I understand perfectly."

The tension around the dinner table thickened like fog, yet Ethan and Evelyn appeared completely unaffected. They sat close, engaged in quiet conversation, utterly indifferent to the discomfort radiating from others.

Celeste, however, wasn't about to let this slide. With a practiced smile and a wine glass in hand, she approached them, her movements deliberately graceful.

"Mr. Caldwell," she purred, "I'm Evelyn's cousin, Celeste Sinclair. What an absolute pleasure to finally meet you."

"Would you honor me with a drink?" she asked, tilting her head coquettishly.

Ethan glanced up, his expression unreadable. After a brief hesitation, he lifted his glass. He reasoned that since Celeste was Evelyn's cousin, outright rejection would be impolite. Besides, Evelyn hadn't mentioned any particular animosity between them, so their relationship must have been at least civil.

Celeste's smile widened as their glasses touched. But at the precise moment of contact, her fingers "slipped," sending dark red wine cascading onto Ethan's immaculate black trousers.

"Oh my God! Mr. Caldwell, I'm so terribly sorry!" Celeste gasped theatrically, snatching a napkin and reaching toward his lap with exaggerated concern.

Ethan's face darkened instantly as he blocked her hand with a sharp movement.

Evelyn smoothly handed him a fresh napkin, her voice calm but firm. "Ethan, the restroom is just down the hall."

"Right," Ethan accepted the napkin and strode away without another glance at Celeste.

Undeterred, Celeste made to follow him. "Please, Mr. Caldwell, let me make this right!" she called after him, taking several quick steps.

"Stay where you are," Evelyn's voice cut through the air like ice. "Where exactly do you think you're going?"

Celeste froze, feigning innocence. "I just wanted to help Mr. Caldwell. It was my mistake after all."

Evelyn nearly rolled her eyes at the transparent act. "That won't be necessary. Return to your seat," she commanded, her tone leaving no room for argument.

"But I—" Celeste bit her plump lower lip, putting on her best distressed expression.

"Now," Evelyn's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper.

Under the watchful eyes of Cassandra and Julian, Celeste had no choice but to comply, though resentment burned in her eyes as she slunk back to her chair.

Twenty minutes later, Ethan returned, his trousers cleaned and nearly dry.

The moment he settled back into his seat, Celeste was at it again, her voice dripping with false remorse. "Mr. Caldwell, I can't apologize enough for my clumsiness."

"It was entirely my fault. I'm usually much more coordinated," she simpered.

Ethan remained silent, clearly unwilling to engage.

"If you're still upset, you're welcome to pour your drink on me," Celeste offered boldly, pushing a fresh glass toward Ethan with a challenging smile.


###Chapter 167
Ethan's brows knitted together as he studied Celeste for a long moment, his voice edged with irritation. "That won't be necessary. Just keep your distance."

Tears pooled in Celeste's eyes before spilling over, her expression the picture of pitiful vulnerability as she sat there, trembling.

Evelyn barely suppressed an eye roll at the display.

Did Celeste really have to put on such an exaggerated performance? The way she was carrying on, anyone who didn't know better would think they'd outright bullied her!

"What's with the waterworks, Celeste?" Evelyn snapped, unable to hold back any longer. "Ethan didn't even say anything harsh. Why the dramatic breakdown?"

"I—I just... I feel so terrible. I made a mistake," Celeste hiccuped between sobs, dabbing at her tears with a delicate hand.

Then, she turned those watery eyes toward Ethan, her voice trembling. "I'm truly sorry, Mr. Caldwell. I'm just... emotional. You must think I'm ridiculous."

"Enough. Return to your seat," Ethan bit out, his tone laced with impatience as he waved her off dismissively.

"Come on, Celeste," Lila interjected smoothly, taking Celeste's arm to guide her away. "Don't worry. Mr. Caldwell isn't the type to hold grudges."

Meanwhile, Cassandra and Julian exchanged a look of pure disbelief at Celeste's theatrics. It was painfully obvious what she was trying to pull—absurd didn't even begin to cover it.

Evelyn had been curious about Celeste's intentions, but the girl's next move made everything crystal clear.

It didn't take long before Celeste was "drunk"—or at least, pretending to be.

Flushed cheeks, unsteady steps, and a giggly demeanor—she played the part perfectly.

At first, she simply danced around the room, belting out off-key lyrics. Harmless enough, if obnoxious.

But then, she zeroed in on Ethan.

With a tipsy grin, she swayed toward him, her voice dripping with faux innocence. "Hey there, handsome. You look... familiar. Let me get a better look at you."

Before anyone could react, she reached out to touch his face.

Ethan caught her wrist mid-air, his grip firm.

Celeste yanked her hand back with an exaggerated wince. "Ouch! That hurt! You're so mean!" She pouted, thrusting her hand toward him again. "Now you have to kiss it better!"

"That's enough, Celeste!" Evelyn snapped, her patience wearing thin.

By now, only a blind fool wouldn't see Celeste's blatant interest in Ethan.

The irony? Evelyn distinctly remembered Victoria once boasting that Celeste could outdrink anyone in their family.

Yet tonight, after barely two sips, Celeste was suddenly "wasted"?

Please.

This was nothing but a calculated act—a pathetic attempt to get close to Ethan under the guise of drunkenness.

Ignoring Evelyn completely, Celeste batted her lashes at Ethan. "Why so quiet? Am I too far? Let me fix that."

She took an unsteady step forward—

###Chapter 168

Celeste was just about to fling herself into Ethan's arms when a hand shot out and yanked her back by the collar of her dress.

"Oof!" Celeste gasped as the fabric tightened around her throat.

"My apologies, Ethan," Evelyn said smoothly, still gripping Celeste's collar. "It seems my cousin has had a bit too much to drink. I'll take her home now."

Ethan gave a curt nod, his expression icy.

Naturally, his displeasure wasn't directed at Evelyn.

Evelyn offered a polite nod to Cassandra and Julian before dragging Celeste out of the room.

"Hey! Who do you think you are?" Celeste hissed, struggling against Evelyn's grip. "Let go of me! I said, let go!"

But Evelyn ignored her protests and quickened her pace.

Lila scrambled to her feet and hurried after them.

It wasn't until they reached the parking lot that Celeste finally dropped the act and snarled, "Let go of me, Evelyn!"

Evelyn released her immediately, stopping in her tracks and folding her arms.

Celeste straightened her dress with furious jerks, then took a deep breath, ready to unleash her anger.

"Done pretending?" Evelyn cut in sharply before Celeste could speak.

Evelyn stood with her arms crossed, looking down at Celeste with undisguised contempt.

"What's that supposed to mean?" Celeste snapped, her eyes blazing.

Evelyn tilted her head, feigning innocence. "Mean? I'm just curious. Weren't you completely wasted a minute ago? How did you sober up so fast?"

Celeste scoffed, done with the charade. "Since you already know I was faking it, why the hell did you drag me out here? Didn't you see what I was trying to do?"

With Celeste laying her cards on the table, Evelyn didn't bother with subtlety either. "Oh, I know exactly what you were trying to do," she said with a cold smile. "And there's no way I was going to let it happen."

"And why not?" Celeste demanded.

"Because Ethan already has a girlfriend," Evelyn stated flatly.

Celeste let out a mocking laugh. "Please. I'm not as clueless as you think. I know Mr. Caldwell and his girlfriend broke up."

She had, in fact, gotten this little tidbit from Cassandra earlier.

Evelyn frowned, but before she could respond, Lila chimed in, "Come on, Evelyn. Everyone deserves to chase their own happiness. Celeste likes Mr. Caldwell—what's wrong with her trying to get closer to him? You're her cousin, and he's your friend. If they end up together, wouldn’t that strengthen the bond between our families? What’s the harm in that?"

Evelyn let out a dry chuckle, glancing between the two women. "Ethan and his girlfriend might be on a break, but they still care about each other deeply."

###Chapter 169

"The only thing keeping them apart is their stubborn pride."

Evelyn's piercing gaze locked onto Celeste as she delivered the brutal truth. "And let's be crystal clear—Ethan would never in a million years be interested in someone like you."

She knew Celeste Sinclair inside out—a shallow, manipulative social climber who'd made a name for herself as a ruthless mean girl back in their school days. Ethan Caldwell deserved far better than that.

And if, by some twisted miracle, Ethan ever showed even a flicker of interest in Celeste, Evelyn vowed silently to dismantle whatever sick fantasy Celeste had conjured. She wouldn't let Ethan fall into that viper's trap.

"You—!" Celeste's face flushed crimson, her nails digging into her palms.

After a tense pause, she forced a slow breath, squaring her shoulders with false bravado. "You don't know that unless I try!" she shot back, chin lifted in defiance.

Evelyn didn't hesitate. "Save yourself the humiliation. You're chasing a delusion."

Celeste's expression darkened like a storm rolling in. "So what, you're refusing to help me win him over?"

A cold smirk curled Evelyn's lips. "That's exactly what I'm saying."

Her voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Let me spell it out for you, Celeste. Stay away from Ethan. And if I catch you using me—or anyone else—to slither your way into his life again?" She leaned in slightly, eyes glinting. "You'll regret it."

With that, she turned sharply and strode off, leaving Celeste fuming.

Celeste let out a frustrated scream, stomping her heel against the marble floor.

Whirling on Lila, her eyes wild, she demanded, "Did she just threaten me?!"

Lila pressed her lips together, shifting uncomfortably. "She didn't mean it like that," she offered weakly.

"Don't lie to me!" Celeste snapped. "She's terrified I'll get close to Ethan!"

Something unreadable flickered in Lila's gaze before she sighed dramatically. "It's strange, though. Evelyn acts like she owns him. When I mentioned wanting an introduction, she shut me down instantly. Almost like..." She trailed off meaningfully.

Celeste's eyes narrowed. "Like what?"

Lila feigned hesitation before whispering, "Like she's guarding something precious."

A slow, ugly realization dawned on Celeste. "You think Evelyn has feelings for him?"

Lila gasped, covering her mouth. "No! They're practically family! And Ethan's taken—not to mention Evelyn's married. She wouldn't dare..."

Celeste let out a bitter laugh. "Wouldn't she? Apples don't fall far from the tree." Her lips curled in disgust. "With a mother like hers, what else could we expect?"

Lila stayed silent, but her smirk said everything.

###Chapter 170

After a moment of contemplation, she voiced her thoughts. "I believe Celeste's attachment to Mr. Caldwell is more about ownership than actual affection. She simply can't bear the idea of him being with anyone else."

Lila Sinclair responded with a sharp edge to her voice. "Whether it's possessiveness or love, if she won't stand by me, then she's my enemy!" She paused, her gaze piercing as she studied Evelyn. "You're with me, aren't you?"

Evelyn offered a faint, diplomatic smile. "You and Celeste are both family to me. I care for you equally."

Celeste's laugh was cold, dripping with disdain. "You're too naive, Evelyn. Too gentle. Has Celeste ever treated you like a sister? Why waste your kindness on someone who wouldn't spare you a second thought?"

Without waiting for a reply, Celeste spun on her heel and marched toward their waiting car.

As Celeste turned away, Evelyn's expression darkened with suppressed fury, her fingers curling into fists. But just as quickly, she smoothed her features into calm composure and hurried after her.

At the Black family estate.

Evelyn had just reached the second-floor landing when she nearly collided with Nathan stepping out of his study.

Nathan arched a brow at her presence. After a brief pause, his gaze sharpened, his voice low and rough. "You've been drinking."

Evelyn blinked, caught off guard by his sudden attention. She kept her tone even. "Yes."

Nathan's jaw tightened. "You know exactly how you behave when you're drunk. Yet you chose to drink today."

Evelyn stiffened, her pride flaring. "I can hold my liquor perfectly fine. A few drinks are nothing to me."

Nathan let out a derisive scoff.

The sound brought back memories of past humiliations—stumbling, laughing too loudly, leaning into him with flushed cheeks. Her eyes flashed with defiance. "That was a one-time exception!"

Nathan gave her a brief, dismissive glance before turning away.

As he retreated, Evelyn gritted her teeth, silently vowing never to let herself lose control in front of him again.

Just as she moved toward her room, Nathan's voice stopped her. "Evelyn."

She turned, meeting his gaze.

Nathan studied her, his expression unreadable. Then, coolly, he cut to the chase. "What exactly is your relationship with Alexander?"

The question caught her off guard. Memories surfaced—Alexander helping her that night, Nathan's cold fury when he'd taken her from his arms.

She kept her voice steady. "We're just friends."

"Friends," Nathan repeated, his tone flat. His gaze didn't waver. "Everyone knows Alexander and I are close. If you're seen getting too cozy with him, think about what that says about me—about the Black family."

Evelyn's brows drew together. "What are you implying?"

Nathan didn't mince words. "Stay away from him."

###Chapter 171

Evelyn met his gaze without flinching, her tone unwavering. "And what if I refuse?"

Nathan's piercing eyes darkened, his expression turning glacial in an instant.

A slow, knowing smile curved Evelyn's lips. "Mr. Black, you're constantly seen with Serena. Yet you ignored my request to stay away from her. If you can't follow your own rules, what gives you the right to demand that of me? Isn't that hypocritical?"

Nathan's jaw tightened, his silence heavy.

Then, a thought struck Evelyn. She tilted her head, her voice laced with challenge. "Or is it that seeing me with another man bothers you? Does it make you jealous, Mr. Black? Or angry?"

A flicker of irritation crossed Nathan's usually impassive face, as if her words had struck a nerve. Yet, his composure remained intact, his emotions expertly masked.

A moment later, his lips curled into a cold smirk. "Associate with whomever you please. Just ensure you don’t disgrace the Black family name or embarrass me."

With that, he brushed past her, heading toward the bathroom.

Evelyn stood frozen, her heart twisting. She hadn’t expected his words to sting, yet they did.

After a deep breath, she turned and retreated to another bathroom to shower.

Later, stepping onto the balcony, she called Ethan.

"Home already?" His deep, velvety voice greeted her.

"Yeah," she replied softly.

A pause. Then, she added, "Ethan, I'm sorry about today's mess."

His chuckle was light, dismissive. "Why apologize? You didn’t cause it."

"Still, I was the one who brought them along," she said, frustration creeping into her voice.

"You can't control others' actions," he reassured her.

After a beat, he asked, "Does your cousin have feelings for me?"

It had been obvious—Celeste’s infatuation was impossible to miss.

"Yeah," Evelyn admitted, embarrassment coloring her tone.

Ethan laughed, the sound edged with amusement.

She quickly added, "But don’t worry. I’ve made it clear she shouldn’t bother you. If she tries using me as an excuse to get close to you again, tell me immediately."

"I will," he promised.

Then, his voice turned firm. "And even if she tries, she won’t get near me."

Relief warmed Evelyn’s voice. "Good."

After a moment, she continued, "Could you let Marcus and Olivia know I’ve been swamped with work? I’ll visit them as soon as I can."

###Chapter 172

"Of course," Nathan responded.

They exchanged a few more words before Evelyn ended the call and stepped back inside.

Once in her room, she sank onto the bed, closed her eyes, and let exhaustion pull her under.

In the dead of night, the sharp vibration of her phone jolted her awake.

Blinking against the darkness, she fumbled for her phone, squinting at the caller ID. Her brows knitted together. Without hesitation, she answered.

"Hello…?"

"Evelyn…" Grace's voice was thin, strained, barely audible.

"What's wrong?" At the sound of her mother's distress, Evelyn shot upright, her pulse quickening.

"I—I don’t feel right. Can you come? Please." Grace’s plea was laced with something raw, something urgent.

"Hold on. I'm leaving now." Evelyn hung up, already throwing off the covers.

She flicked on her phone’s flashlight, the harsh light cutting through the dark as she hurried toward the walk-in closet.

A soft click broke the silence. The lamp on Nathan’s side of the bed glowed to life.

"It’s the middle of the night. Where are you going?" His voice was rough with sleep, yet still carried that deep, velvety edge that always sent a shiver down her spine.

"My mother isn’t well. I need to go." She didn’t pause, didn’t explain further, already pulling out clothes.

Nathan’s expression darkened, a shadow of concern flickering across his face. He said nothing as she dressed swiftly and moved toward the door.

Evelyn didn’t glance back, didn’t acknowledge the tension coiling in the air between them. She simply left.

Nathan scowled, irritation and something else—something he refused to name—twisting in his chest. She was capable. Independent. So why did the thought of her rushing out alone at this hour unsettle him?

Gritting his teeth, he shoved off the bed. Snatching his phone from the nightstand, he dialed.

The line connected instantly.

"Mr. Black." His assistant’s voice was alert despite the hour.

"Evelyn just left. Track her." The command was sharp, leaving no room for debate.

A beat of silence. Then, cautiously, "Should we ensure Mrs. Black’s safety?"

Nathan’s jaw tightened. "Just monitor where she goes. That’s all." He ended the call before any more questions could be asked.

He told himself it wasn’t about her. If something happened to Evelyn, Leonard might spiral, his health at risk. That was all.

Satisfied with his own reasoning, Nathan turned off the lamp and lay back down.

Sleep, however, didn’t come easily.

###Chapter 173

At the Sterling mansion, Evelyn Hartley strode through the grand foyer and headed straight for Grace Monroe’s bedroom.

"Evelyn, you came..." Grace’s voice was barely a whisper as she blinked her eyes open weakly. Her face was drained of color, her lips dry, and her breathing shallow.

Evelyn moved to the bedside, pressing the back of her hand against Grace’s forehead. The heat radiating from her skin confirmed her suspicions.

"You’re burning up," Evelyn murmured.

"So that’s why I feel so lightheaded," Grace rasped, her fingers trembling against the sheets.

"Just lie still," Evelyn instructed.

After adjusting Grace’s pillows, she stepped out briefly to retrieve the medical kit. Returning, she slipped a thermometer under Grace’s arm and waited. Moments later, she checked the reading.

"Your fever is dangerously high," Evelyn said, rummaging through the kit for antipyretics.

Once she found the medication, she helped Grace swallow it with a sip of water. Then, she fetched a cooling pad from the refrigerator and pressed it gently against Grace’s forehead.

Methodically, Evelyn dampened a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol and began dabbing it along Grace’s arms and neck, the sharp scent filling the air.

Grace watched her through half-lidded eyes, her throat tightening with emotion.

"Evelyn... I’m so sorry..."

Evelyn didn’t pause, her expression unreadable. "You’re my mother. Taking care of you when you’re sick is natural. There’s nothing to apologize for."

Grace exhaled shakily. "That’s not what I meant..."

Evelyn’s fingers stilled for just a second before she resumed her task, deliberately ignoring the unspoken weight behind Grace’s words. But Grace pressed on, her voice thick with remorse.

"I know you resent me, Evelyn. And I don’t blame you—I resent myself too. If I had been stronger, if I had come from a better family... maybe I wouldn’t have left your father. Then you wouldn’t have had to grow up as the illegitimate daughter, always forced to step aside for Lila. Never allowed to outshine her in anything."

Tears spilled down Grace’s hollow cheeks. "Every time I think about it, it breaks my heart. You’ve suffered so much because of my weakness, Evelyn. This is all my fault..."

Her frail hand suddenly grasped Evelyn’s wrist, forcing her to stop.

Evelyn met Grace’s watery gaze, her own emotions flickering beneath a carefully constructed mask. For a long moment, she struggled to find the right words.

Finally, she said quietly, "Talking about this now won’t help either of us. You need to rest. You’re not well."

Grace shook her head weakly. "But knowing you blame me... it’s unbearable."

Evelyn studied her, then asked bluntly, "Would it be easier if I lied and said I don’t?"

###Chapter 174

Hearing this, Grace was momentarily stunned, her lips parting slightly but no sound escaping.

Evelyn continued, her voice steady, "If it makes you feel better, then yes, Mom, I don’t blame you for any of this. Just focus on getting better and let go of these thoughts."

Grace’s cheeks flushed with embarrassment, her eyes flickering with guilt. Over the years, Evelyn had come to understand that Grace was inherently fragile—a woman who shied away from conflict, who always chose the path of least resistance. It wasn’t surprising. Evelyn had recognized this trait in her mother long ago.

What was the point of holding a grudge? This was simply who Grace was. And even if Evelyn did resent her, what would it change? Grace was still her mother, the woman who had raised her. Acceptance was the only choice she had.

"Evelyn…" Grace started, her voice trembling, but Evelyn cut her off gently.

"Let’s call it a night. You need rest. I’ll stay right here with you."

Evelyn finished wiping Grace’s fevered skin with a damp cloth, ensuring she was comfortable before tucking the blankets around her.

Grace didn’t argue. She simply nodded and closed her eyes.

That night, Evelyn kept vigil at Grace’s bedside, tending to her every need. It wasn’t until the first light of dawn that Grace’s fever finally broke.

When Grace awoke, Evelyn helped her sip a bowl of warm broth and made sure she took her medication. Only then did she allow herself to retreat to her own room for some much-needed sleep.

But by midday, Grace’s soft voice pulled her from her exhausted slumber.

Evelyn rubbed her bleary eyes and pushed herself up on one elbow. "What’s wrong? Are you feeling worse?"

Grace shook her head. "No, I’m better now. But your father… he’s back."

She hesitated before adding, "He wants to speak with you. He says it’s urgent."

Evelyn’s jaw tightened in irritation. "Didn’t you tell him I was up all night? Can’t this wait?"

The abrupt awakening had left her with a pounding headache.

Grace lowered her voice. "I told him, but he insisted. He has another commitment later and needs to speak with you now. He said you could go back to sleep afterward."

Evelyn’s frustration simmered dangerously close to the surface.

"Fine," she snapped. "Give me a minute."

Grace nodded. "He’s waiting in the study."

Then she slipped quietly out of the room.

Evelyn dragged herself out of bed, hastily pulling on a robe before heading toward the study. What could possibly be so urgent that Victor couldn’t wait until she’d had proper rest?

When she entered the study, the dark circles under her bloodshot eyes were impossible to miss.

Victor took in her exhausted appearance but remained impassive, gesturing toward the sofa with a detached air. "Sit down," he commanded.

###Chapter 175

Once Evelyn was seated, she lifted her gaze to meet Victor's, silently waiting for him to speak.

Without any pleasantries, Victor began, "Lila told me about last night's incident at the bar."

Evelyn's brows twitched at the mention, but she remained silent, her expression unreadable.

After a deliberate pause, Victor pressed, "What do you think about Celeste's interest in Ethan? What are her true intentions?"

A faint, mocking smile curled Evelyn's lips. "That's nothing but a delusion. She'll never capture Ethan's heart."

Victor's face darkened instantly, displeasure flashing in his eyes.

"Ethan is single, and so is Celeste," he countered sharply. "Why shouldn't they be together? Yes, Ethan is a prize, but Celeste has her own merits."

Unwilling to drag out the conversation, Evelyn cut straight to the point. "What exactly are you trying to say?"

Victor composed himself, his tone turning earnest. "I believe Lila was right. If Ethan and Celeste were to be together, it would strengthen the bond between our family and the Caldwells. You should support Celeste in this."

Evelyn let out a derisive laugh. The absurdity of his suggestion was almost laughable.

"I made myself clear last night," she said coolly. "Ethan has already set his heart on someone else. Celeste and him? Impossible. She needs to give up this ridiculous fantasy."

Victor's jaw tightened. "How can you be so sure Ethan won’t fall for her? If she tries and fails, fine. But giving up without even trying? That’s not fair."

Evelyn didn’t waver. "There’s no point in trying."

Victor’s expression darkened further, suspicion creeping into his gaze.

"Unless…" His voice dropped dangerously low. "You have feelings for Ethan yourself?"

Evelyn’s eyes flashed with icy fury. "That’s absurd," she snapped. "Why would you even suggest something so ridiculous?" The mere idea was preposterous. Had he lost his mind?

Victor pressed on. "If you don’t have feelings for him, then why oppose this? Their union would benefit our family."

Evelyn scoffed, her tone dripping with disdain.

"So, just because I don’t support this, I must be interested in him? By that logic, if someone wanted to pursue you and I objected, would that mean I have feelings for you?"

Victor faltered, momentarily speechless, his face darkening with frustration.

Before he could gather his thoughts, Evelyn stood abruptly. "Let me make this clear one last time. I won’t help Celeste pursue Ethan. She shouldn’t even think about using me to get close to him. If there’s nothing else, I’m leaving."

She turned to go, but Victor’s voice stopped her.

"Wait!"

Evelyn paused, turning back with an impassive expression.

###Chapter 176

"Your competition with Lila is coming up, isn't it?" Victor Sterling abruptly shifted the conversation.

Evelyn Hartley met his gaze, her voice cool and measured. "What exactly are you implying by bringing that up?"

Victor picked up his coffee cup from the table and took a deliberate sip, his tone dripping with condescension. "Just keep a good attitude and do your best. There’s no shame in losing to Lila."

Evelyn’s eyes sharpened, her stare cutting through him. "And why are you so certain I’ll lose to her?"

Victor’s lips curled into a mocking smirk. "Isn’t it obvious? You’ve never surpassed Lila before. What makes you think graduating from university changed anything? Do you really believe you’ve suddenly become smarter?"

A flicker of realization passed through Evelyn’s gaze. The pieces clicked into place—Grace hadn’t asked her to throw the competition because of Victor’s orders. That had been Grace’s own decision.

The weight of that betrayal settled heavily in Evelyn’s chest, a bitter mix of disappointment and hurt tightening around her heart.

As silence stretched between them, Victor continued, his tone dismissive. "Like I said, losing to Lila isn’t a disgrace. You’re sisters, after all. There shouldn’t be any resentment between you. And if things don’t work out at Grand Pines General, I’ll make sure you have a position somewhere else. So don’t stress—just take it easy."

He chuckled, the sound laced with derision. "No matter how hard you try, the outcome will probably stay the same anyway."

Victor had always underestimated Evelyn. Even now, knowing she worked at Grand Pines General, he assumed it was only through the Caldwell family’s influence. He held no real expectation that she could challenge Lila.

In his mind, Lila would always come out on top.

Evelyn’s lips curved into a faint, humorless smile. Of course. To Victor, his golden child Lila would always be superior.

How could he have possibly instructed Grace to convince Evelyn to lose?

Evelyn regarded him with an impassive expression. "Are we finished here? May I leave now?"

Victor’s irritation flared at her detached demeanor, her blatant indifference to his opinions. But seeing no point in prolonging the conversation, he waved her off with a dismissive flick of his hand. "Go ahead."

Without another word, Evelyn turned and walked out. She headed straight to her room, swiftly gathered her things, and prepared to leave.

"Evelyn, you barely rested. Where are you going now?" Grace asked softly, concern lacing her voice.

Evelyn met Grace’s gaze, emotions swirling in her eyes. After a brief pause, she inhaled deeply. "I have something to take care of. I’m going out."

She didn’t wait for Grace’s response, striding out of the house without looking back.

Instead of returning to the Black estate, Evelyn drove straight to the Caldwell residence. Thankfully, she had the day off. After the exhaustion of the previous night, she couldn’t imagine trying to work in such a state.

When Olivia Sinclair saw Evelyn, she greeted her warmly.

###Chapter 177

"Look who finally decided to show up—our little workaholic."

Evelyn offered a tired smile. "This workaholic desperately needs sleep after pulling an all-nighter."

Olivia's expression softened instantly. "Then we'll keep it short. Go upstairs and rest."

"Thanks," Evelyn murmured gratefully before heading up to her room.

Meanwhile, at The Harlequin Eats, Alexander and Nathan sat across from each other, the air between them thick with unspoken tension. Alexander smirked, swirling his wine glass. "This isn't just a casual lunch, is it, Nathan?"

Nathan's lips curled slightly, his voice low and deliberate. "No. There's something I've been meaning to ask you."

He set his fork down, locking eyes with Alexander. "What exactly is going on between you and Evelyn?"

Alexander hesitated, then gave a small, knowing smile. "Well... How should I put this?"

Nathan's fingers tightened around his glass. That hesitation—it confirmed his suspicions.

After a beat, Alexander continued, "Let's just say Evelyn and I are very close friends. For now."

"For now?" Nathan repeated, the words heavy with implication.

Alexander nodded. "Exactly. Who knows what the future holds?"

The underlying message was clear.

Nathan's gaze darkened, but before he could respond, Alexander pressed further.

"Speaking of the future—when are you planning to finalize your divorce?"

Nathan's jaw tensed. "Why do you ask?"

Alexander leaned back, feigning nonchalance. "Just concerned. You two are important to me. Naturally, I care about how things unfold."

Nathan's eyes narrowed. "Is that really all?"

They stared each other down, the silence stretching until Alexander finally exhaled.

"Fine. I won't lie to you." He straightened, his expression turning serious. "Over the years, I've realized... I have feelings for Evelyn."

Nathan's grip on his glass turned white-knuckled. A surge of fury burned through him, sharp and unexpected. He had suspected it, but hearing it aloud—

Worse, a gnawing unease settled in his chest. If Alexander loved Evelyn, did she feel the same?

Alexander studied Nathan's stormy expression before continuing carefully. "I know it's wrong to want a friend's wife. But feelings aren't something we control, are they? Besides..." He paused. "We both know you never loved her. You were the one who asked for a divorce the moment Serena came back. So tell me—is it really so unforgivable if I care for her?"

The challenge hung in the air, sharp as a blade.

###Chapter 178

Nathan Black stood in tense silence, his piercing gaze fixed on Alexander Prescott as the latter carefully laid out his perspective. Alexander's voice carried genuine emotion, his words carefully chosen to convey sincerity to his longtime friend. Yet Nathan's expression remained unreadable, his jaw set in a hard line that suggested his mood wouldn't shift anytime soon.

After what felt like an eternity, Alexander suddenly straightened, realization dawning on him. "Wait—am I mistaken?" He hesitated briefly before voicing the thought aloud. "Nathan... have you developed feelings for Evelyn?" His voice softened as he added, "If that's the case, I'll bury my own feelings for her. I would never interfere between you two."

The moment the words left Alexander's lips, Nathan stiffened as if struck. His reaction was visceral—like a man whose most guarded secret had been ripped into the open.

"Impossible!" he snapped, his voice rough with defensiveness. "I could never have feelings for Evelyn!"

The denial was sharp, almost too forceful.

Alexander studied him for a long moment before something unreadable flickered in his eyes. "Good," he said, his expression brightening unnaturally. "Then you have nothing to worry about. I won't act on my feelings while you're still married. But once the divorce is finalized..." He trailed off, a wistful smile playing on his lips. "I intend to pursue her properly."

Nathan's fingers curled into fists at his sides, his knuckles whitening. A storm of emotions raged behind his cold exterior—frustration, irritation, something deeper he refused to name.

After a suffocating silence, Nathan's voice dropped dangerously low. "Does Evelyn know how you feel?"

Alexander shook his head. "She doesn't." He hesitated, then added, "And I'd prefer it stays that way. If she found out now, it would only complicate things. You two are still legally bound, after all." His gaze turned earnest. "Keep this between us, Nathan."

Nathan said nothing, his silence more telling than any response.

Sensing his reluctance, Alexander tilted his head. "Does the idea of me pursuing Evelyn bother you?"

A cold scoff escaped Nathan. His lips curled in derision as he met Alexander's gaze head-on. "Why would it? Once my father's birthday passes, Evelyn and I will be divorced. After that, she's free to be with whoever she chooses." His tone was cutting, as if he was trying to convince himself as much as Alexander.

Alexander's brows lifted briefly before he relaxed, a knowing smirk tugging at his lips. "Glad to hear it." He leaned in slightly, his voice laced with playful challenge. "In that case, maybe you could arrange more opportunities for us to meet?"

Nathan's eyes darkened to an icy black. The air around him turned frigid. "Don't push me."

Alexander laughed, raising his hands in mock surrender. "Alright, alright. I'll back off." His grin remained, teasing. "Happy now?"

The tension between them crackled, unspoken words hanging heavy in the air.


###Chapter 179

A heavy silence settled between them after their conversation. Nathan returned to his meal, his expression darkening with each bite. What was wrong with the chef today? Every dish tasted off, as if deliberately designed to irritate him.

Midway through lunch, curiosity overpowered Nathan’s frustration. He set down his fork and fixed Alexander with a piercing gaze. "Tell me, Alexander. What is it about Evelyn that draws you in? What makes her so special?"

Alexander’s lips curved into a knowing smile, his eyes distant with thought. "It’s not something I can easily put into words. Even if I tried, you wouldn’t truly grasp it unless you saw her the way I do. You’d have to spend time with her—really see her—to understand the little things that make her extraordinary."

Nathan’s lashes lowered, shielding the flicker of emotion in his eyes. His silence was impenetrable, leaving Alexander to wonder what thoughts lay beneath that composed exterior.

Noticing Nathan’s reaction, Alexander exhaled in quiet relief. "I have to admit, I’m glad you don’t have feelings for her. Otherwise, I wouldn’t stand a chance."

Nathan remained still, his expression unreadable.

With a casual shrug, Alexander added, "Because, well… Evelyn has feelings for you. If you ever returned them, I’d be out of the running before the race even began."

For the briefest moment, something shifted in Nathan’s expression—too quick to decipher. Then it was gone.

Lunch ended without further discussion. The two men parted ways, returning to their respective offices, the weight of unspoken words lingering between them.

At Blackstone Enterprises, the atmosphere was thick with tension. Employees moved cautiously, their voices hushed, as if a single misstep might shatter the fragile peace.

Everyone knew.

Nathan Black was in a terrible mood.

On the top floor, outside the CEO’s office, his sharp voice cut through the quiet like a blade.

"'Sorry' isn’t a solution. If you can’t handle basic responsibilities, then you have no business leading a department. I expect a viable proposal on my desk by tomorrow evening—or you can clear out your desk permanently."

Minutes later, the head of the marketing department emerged, shoulders slumped in defeat.

The assistants exchanged nervous glances.

The senior secretary swallowed hard. "You see that? Mr. Black is not in a forgiving mood today. Stay sharp. One wrong move, and you’re out."

The others nodded quickly, murmuring in agreement.

One assistant leaned in, whispering, "It’s strange, though. He was fine this morning. What happened at lunch to set him off like this?"

Another shook her head. "I’ve never seen him this… volatile before."

The senior secretary shot them a warning look. "Enough chatter. Back to work."

With that, the group dispersed, each returning to their tasks with renewed caution.

###Chapter 180

At the Donovan estate, Evelyn Hartley stirred awake to find the evening light fading through her window. A glance at the clock told her it was well past seven. Feeling significantly refreshed after her nap, she made her way downstairs, where she found Marcus Donovan, Olivia Sinclair, and Ethan Caldwell already gathered in the dining room.

"Good evening, Marcus, Olivia, Ethan," Evelyn greeted them, stifling a small yawn behind her hand.

"Long night?" Olivia inquired, her curiosity evident as she studied Evelyn's tired but composed expression.

Evelyn nodded. "My mother had a high fever last night. I stayed up to take care of her."

"I see," Olivia murmured, offering no further comment.

As dinner progressed, Marcus suddenly turned to Evelyn, his tone measured. "Evelyn, is Gregory Sinclair your aunt’s husband?"

The question caught her off guard. She hesitated for a brief moment before answering, "Yes, he is. Why do you ask?"

Marcus leaned back slightly in his chair. "He visited my company today, introduced himself as your aunt’s husband, and expressed interest in a potential collaboration."

Evelyn’s lips thinned in irritation. She couldn’t believe Gregory had the audacity to use her name to approach Marcus. The nerve of that man!

Before she could respond, Marcus continued, his gaze steady. "Evelyn, does your aunt’s family treat you well?"

A dry laugh escaped her. "Why? If they treated me wonderfully, would you agree to work with them?"

"Of course," Marcus replied without hesitation, his sincerity catching her by surprise.

For a moment, Evelyn was taken aback. Then, a small, touched smile curved her lips. She tilted her head. "And does Gregory’s company meet your usual standards for partnerships?"

Marcus exhaled, his expression unreadable. "To be honest, his company falls short. But if his family is good to you, I’d consider giving him a chance."

Evelyn shook her head, her voice firm. "Then don’t bother, Marcus. Just reject him outright."

Marcus raised a brow. "Hmm?"

Ethan, who had been quietly observing, interjected with a knowing smile. "What Evelyn means is that her relationship with the Sinclair family is… strained. There’s no need for you to entertain Gregory’s proposal on her behalf."

Marcus turned back to Evelyn. "Is that true?"

"Yes," she confirmed, her expression resolute.

In truth, "strained" was an understatement. The Sinclair family had always treated her with disdain, speaking to her in harsh tones and making their contempt for her painfully clear.

Ethan’s lips quirked slightly. "It’s rather obvious. If Evelyn had a good relationship with them, Gregory wouldn’t have needed to approach you himself—she would have introduced him to you."

Evelyn’s earlier eye roll at the mention of Gregory’s name hadn’t gone unnoticed.

Marcus considered this for a moment before nodding. "Then I’ll have my assistant formally decline his proposal tomorrow."

Evelyn exhaled in quiet relief. At least one headache had been avoided.

###Chapter 181

A sly smirk curled Evelyn's lips as she heard about Gregory Sinclair's visit to Marcus Donovan. A flicker of mockery danced in her piercing gaze.

Did the Sinclair family truly believe they could manipulate Marcus just by dropping her name? How utterly laughable!

Did they expect her to repay their cruelty with kindness?

But Evelyn was no saint. She never forgot how they had treated her—and she certainly wasn't about to help them now.

She remembered every kindness shown to her. And her enemies? Oh, she remembered them even more vividly.

That evening, the dinner was filled with warmth and laughter.

Afterward, Evelyn strolled through the estate gardens with Olivia, the cool night air brushing against their skin. Then, her phone buzzed—a message notification.

Glancing at the screen, she saw it was from Alexander Prescott.

"Meet me at the Midnight Lounge. We need to talk."

Her fingers flew across the screen. "About what?"

"Just get here. You’ll see. Hurry."

"Fine," she replied.

Tucking her phone away, Olivia tilted her head. "Everything alright?"

"Just a friend who needs to speak with me at the club," Evelyn answered.

"Then you should go. Don’t worry about me."

Evelyn shook her head with a soft smile. "No rush. Let’s finish our walk first."

Olivia simply nodded, accepting her decision.

Once they returned to the mansion, Evelyn grabbed her clutch and headed out.

The Midnight Lounge was dimly lit, its atmosphere thick with the hum of hushed conversations and clinking glasses. Pushing open the door to the private room, she found Alexander lining up a shot at the pool table, entirely absorbed in his game.

Noticing her arrival, he smirked and extended a cue stick. "Care to join?"

Evelyn set her bag aside and took the cue, positioning herself for the next shot. With a sharp crack, the ball sank cleanly into the pocket.

"Impressive," Alexander remarked, clapping lightly.

She leaned over for another attempt, but this time, the ball veered off course.

Alexander stepped forward, lining up his own shot. As he took aim, he said casually, "Had lunch with Nathan today."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around the cue, but she remained silent, her expression unreadable.

###Chapter 182

The pool cue slid smoothly between Alexander's fingers as he took his shot. "He asked me about my relationship with you," he said casually, the balls clicking sharply against each other.

Evelyn kept her expression carefully blank as she lined up her next move.

With a faint smirk, Alexander delivered his next bombshell. "I told him... that I have feelings for you."

A loud clack echoed through the room as Evelyn's shot went wide, sending the cue ball straight into the pocket.

She gaped at him, stunned. "Have you completely lost your mind?"

Alexander leaned his cue against the rack and strolled toward the plush leather sofa.

Still reeling, Evelyn followed, sinking down beside him. "Why on earth would you lie to Nathan like that?" she demanded, running a hand through her hair in exasperation.

She knew Alexander didn’t actually have feelings for her—she’d accidentally stumbled upon the truth about someone else he cared for deeply.

Raising an eyebrow, Alexander met her gaze. "I was doing you a favor."

Evelyn frowned. "Explain."

A mischievous glint lit his eyes. "Don’t you want to know if Nathan would get jealous? Stirring up a little competition might lead to... interesting revelations."

Evelyn scoffed, shaking her head. "Jealous? Please. He doesn’t feel anything for me. Why would he care?"

Alexander’s lips curved into a knowing smile. "Are you sure about that?"

Evelyn narrowed her eyes, suspicion flickering across her face.

"Why not test it?" Alexander pressed. "What if he does react?"

She looked down, fingers tightening around the edge of the sofa. "And if he does... what then? Does it even matter?"

Alexander’s expression turned serious as he leaned forward. "If he’s jealous, it means he has feelings for you." He exhaled slowly. "Evelyn, think about it. Are you really over him? This could be your chance to find out the truth. Don’t you want to know?"

Silence stretched between them as Evelyn considered his words. Could Nathan really be jealous over her? Would it even change anything?

After a long pause, she let out a soft laugh, her eyes glinting with mischief. "But won’t this put you in an awkward position?"

Alexander grinned, shrugging. "A small price to pay if it leads to your happiness."

He could see the unspoken agreement in her eyes. Beneath her carefully constructed indifference, Evelyn still cared for Nathan.

As both Nathan’s loyal friend and Evelyn’s confidant, Alexander wanted nothing more than to see them happy—preferably together. If a little push could help them finally confront their feelings, he was more than willing to play his part. And if Nathan truly didn’t feel anything... well, at least Evelyn would have closure.

Evelyn bit her lip, a small smile tugging at the corners of her mouth. "So... when you told Nathan you had feelings for me... what was his reaction?"

###Chapter 183

Alexander chuckled, leaning back against the plush leather couch. "I asked Nathan point-blank if he'd mind me pursuing you. Know what he said? 'Do whatever you want.'"

Evelyn's lips curled into a bitter smile, her fingers tightening around her glass. The irony wasn't lost on her.

Alexander studied her reaction before adding casually, "Though, let's be honest—Nathan's pride could fill this entire room. Even if he did care, he'd never admit it."

Evelyn said nothing. Alexander didn’t know Nathan the way she did.

"Enough of this," Alexander declared, snatching up the tablet to scroll through the karaoke playlist. His fingers paused on "I Only Care About You," and he tossed her the mic with a grin. "You kill this song every time. Humor me."

She rolled her eyes but took the microphone anyway.

Halfway through the chorus, an idea struck Alexander. He pulled out his phone, discreetly recording Evelyn as she sang—her voice rich with emotion, her gaze distant, lost in the lyrics. With a smirk, he sent the video straight to Nathan.

Nathan was still at the office, reviewing contracts, when his phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen, his expression darkening when he saw Alexander’s name. He tapped the video.

There she was—Evelyn, bathed in the dim glow of the karaoke lounge, lips parted as she sang:

"Time may pass quickly, but my focus remains on you alone..."

Her voice was hauntingly beautiful, wrapping around him like silk. He hadn’t known she could sing like that.

Then reality crashed in.

She was with Alexander. Now.

His jaw clenched. Before he could react, another message popped up:

Alexander: "Just so you know, Evelyn’s with me. I’ll drop her home later. If Leonard asks, cover for me, yeah?"

Nathan’s grip on his phone turned white-knuckled. He slammed it face-down on the desk.

Alexander, blissfully unbothered by Nathan’s silence, kept singing with Evelyn until they switched to a game of pool. They were tied at three rounds each when Evelyn’s phone rang.

She pulled it from her pocket, her breath hitching slightly at the caller ID. Swiping to answer, she pressed the phone to her ear.

"Hello?"

"Where are you?" Nathan’s voice was low, rough with something she couldn’t place.

###Chapter 184

"I'm at the Dream Club," Evelyn replied, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. "What's going on?"

"Stay there. I'm coming to get you. Dad told me to pick you up." Nathan ended the call before she could protest.

Evelyn stared at her phone, baffled.

Alexander Prescott sauntered over, amusement dancing in his eyes. "Trouble in paradise?"

She exhaled sharply. "Nathan just called out of nowhere. Said Leonard asked him to pick me up."

Alexander smirked, checking his watch with deliberate nonchalance. "Funny. Forty minutes ago, I texted him saying you were with me. Guess he didn’t take that well."

Evelyn blinked. First, she hadn’t expected Alexander to provoke Nathan behind her back. Second—was Nathan really here because of Leonard, or was it because she was alone with Alexander?

"Hold that thought," Alexander said, pulling out his phone and dialing Nathan’s number. He put it on speaker before Nathan could even greet him.

"Nathan! Seriously? I asked you to cover for me with Leonard, and now you’re swooping in to steal Evelyn?"

A pause. Then Nathan’s voice, clipped and controlled. "I only saw your message after Dad called."

Alexander shot Evelyn a knowing look, his grin widening. "Sure, sure. Listen, why don’t you save yourself the trip? I’ll drop her off at the Grant residence. We can all meet there."

"I’m already on my way," Nathan said, his tone leaving no room for argument. "I have work to finish after this. No time for detours."

Alexander sighed dramatically. "Fine. Your loss."

The line went dead.

Pocketing his phone, Alexander turned to Evelyn with a triumphant glint in his eyes. "You really think he only saw my text after Leonard called?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together, refusing to rise to the bait.

"Ask Leonard when you get home," Alexander suggested, leaning in. "Find out if Nathan’s using him as an excuse—or if he just couldn’t stand the thought of you with me."

Evelyn’s expression remained neutral, but the seed of doubt had been planted.

Less than thirty minutes later, she stepped out of the club and into the parking lot, where Nathan’s sleek black car idled impatiently. She slid into the passenger seat, barely clicking her seatbelt before Nathan accelerated sharply.

"So," Nathan said, his grip tightening on the steering wheel. "How was your little date with Alexander?"

Evelyn’s lips curved into a teasing smile. "Wonderful. He’s charming, comes from an excellent family, and has an incredible physique—"

Nathan’s jaw clenched. "Physique?"

###Chapter 185

Nathan's jaw tightened as he turned to face Evelyn, his icy gaze piercing through her. "How would you know that?"

"By observing, obviously," Evelyn replied with a casual shrug, her tone light but deliberate.

A vein throbbed visibly at Nathan's temple.

Observing? How the hell had she gotten close enough to study Alexander's physique in detail?

Nathan's expression darkened, his voice dropping to a dangerous low. "And just how did you manage to observe that?"

Evelyn blinked, a flicker of amusement dancing in her eyes. "Well… That’s confidential."

Her teasing lilt carried just enough implication to suggest something scandalous, though internally, she remained perfectly composed.

How had she seen it? Simple—she had looked. What else was there to it?

It wasn’t as if she’d seen Alexander undressed or anything.

The car jerked to a sudden stop, tires screeching against the pavement.

Nathan’s face burned with barely restrained fury, his eyes stormy with emotion.

Gritting his teeth, he bit out, "Evelyn, have you no shame? We are still legally married!"

Evelyn’s pulse fluttered at the raw intensity in his voice.

She met his gaze head-on, arching a brow. "And how, exactly, am I shameless?"

A mischievous thought crossed her mind, and the corner of her lips quirked up. "What’s gotten into you, Mr. Black? Why so worked up?"

Nathan stiffened momentarily before his eyes narrowed. "Who were you with earlier?" he asked, his tone deceptively casual as the car merged back onto the highway.

"Alexander," Evelyn answered smoothly, knowing full well Nathan already had the answer.

Silence settled between them. Just when Evelyn assumed the conversation was over, Nathan suddenly spoke again. "So, what do you think of him?"

Evelyn’s earlier remark had forced him to acknowledge the unsettling intensity of his own reaction.

Regaining his composure, he forced a cold smirk. "Worked up? Hardly. I just find your behavior disgraceful. Once we’re divorced, you can ogle whoever you please. But as long as you’re still my wife, I expect you to maintain some dignity. Don’t embarrass my family."

By the end, his voice had turned sharp, leaving no room for argument.

Without waiting for her response, Nathan restarted the engine and resumed driving.

Outwardly, he appeared perfectly controlled, but inside, frustration burned through him. He despised how easily Evelyn could unravel his composure—how she had begun to wield such influence over his emotions. It was unacceptable.

Meanwhile, Evelyn remained unfazed, casting him a sidelong glance before turning her attention to the passing scenery outside the window, her expression unreadable.

The rest of the drive passed in heavy silence.

###Chapter 186

The sleek black car pulled up to the grand Black family estate, its tires crunching over the pristine gravel driveway. Evelyn stepped out, smoothing the wrinkles from her dress, while Nathan followed with his usual detached demeanor.

Inside, Leonard Grant was sprawled across the plush sofa, engrossed in a late-night talk show. The moment he heard the front door open, his face lit up.

"You're back!" Leonard called out, his voice warm with affection.

Evelyn offered him a polite smile. "Good evening, Leonard."

Nathan barely spared his father a glance. "I have work to finish in the study."

Leonard frowned. "Still buried in paperwork? You just got home!"

Nathan turned, his expression icy. "If you hadn’t insisted I fetch her, I would’ve been done by now."

Leonard’s eyes narrowed. "You ungrateful brat! Since when is picking up your own wife such a burden?"

Without another word, Nathan strode up the staircase, his polished shoes clicking against the marble steps.

Evelyn’s chest tightened. So, it had been Leonard’s idea—not Nathan’s.

She had let herself hope, just for a second.

But reality was quick to remind her—Nathan Black didn’t care.

The realization stung more than she wanted to admit.

What she didn’t know, however, was that while Leonard had been the one to order Nathan to retrieve her, it hadn’t been his idea.

A maid—Beatrice Whitmore—had casually mentioned Evelyn’s late shift to Leonard over tea, planting the seed that led to his command.

And Beatrice?

She had her own motives.

"Leonard, I think I’ll retire for the night," Evelyn said softly.

Leonard nodded. "Rest well, dear."

Upstairs, Evelyn showered, the hot water doing little to ease the weight in her chest. When she stepped out, the bedroom was empty.

Then, her phone buzzed.

Alexander Prescott’s name flashed on the screen.

She answered.

"Well?" His voice was eager. "Did you ask Leonard?"

Evelyn exhaled. "Yes. It was his idea."

"Really?" Alexander sounded surprised. Then, after a pause, he added, "Don’t give up. We’ll figure out Nathan’s true feelings eventually."

Evelyn stayed silent. Suddenly, the whole thing felt exhausting.

What was the point of chasing affection that clearly didn’t exist?

After a few more hollow reassurances, she ended the call.

###Chapter 187

The next morning, Evelyn woke to an empty bed.

Nathan had never come back.

Again.

She dressed mechanically, her reflection in the mirror showing dark circles under her eyes.

Downstairs, Leonard was already at the breakfast table, reading the newspaper.

"Good morning, Evelyn," he greeted warmly.

"Morning," she murmured, forcing a smile.

Just then, Nathan entered, impeccably dressed, his expression unreadable.

Evelyn’s pulse jumped—but he didn’t even glance her way.

Instead, he grabbed a coffee and turned to Leonard. "I have a meeting. I’ll be late."

Leonard frowned. "Again? You just got home!"

Nathan ignored him, striding toward the door.

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her teacup.

Then—

"Evelyn."

Nathan’s voice, sharp and unexpected, made her flinch.

She looked up.

His dark eyes locked onto hers.

"Don’t wait up."

And just like that, he was gone.

The silence that followed was deafening.

Leonard sighed. "That boy…"

Evelyn stared at her untouched breakfast, her appetite gone.

She had a sinking feeling today would be just like yesterday.

And the day before that.

And the day before that.

Endless.

Hopeless.

But then—

A knock at the door.

The butler stepped in, holding an envelope.

"Mrs. Black," he said, bowing slightly. "This arrived for you."

Evelyn frowned. "For me?"

She took it, her name elegantly scripted across the front.

No return address.

Her fingers trembled as she opened it.

Inside was a single, typed sentence:

"You deserve better."

Her breath caught.

Who sent this?

And—more importantly—

Why?

Evelyn tossed her phone onto the nightstand and collapsed onto the plush mattress.

After a sleepless night and only catching a few restless hours earlier, exhaustion weighed heavily on her. She turned off the lamp, letting darkness envelop the room, and within moments, she was pulled into a deep, dreamless slumber.

When she stirred awake, golden morning light spilled through the curtains. Rubbing her eyes, she dressed quickly and headed to the hospital, bracing herself for another grueling shift.

The emergency ward was chaotic—patients flooded in, and Evelyn barely had a moment to breathe until her lunch break finally arrived.

Meanwhile, at the Sterling estate, with Diana absent for the day, Grace seized the opportunity to visit.

Dinner was a tense affair, with only Victoria’s family, Victor, and Grace seated at the long dining table.

Celeste’s lips curled in barely concealed disdain as she glared at Grace. But with Victor—the head of the household—remaining silent, she bit back her venom.

Then, in the middle of the meal, Victoria let out a derisive scoff, drawing all eyes to her.

Her voice dripped with scorn as she announced, "Evelyn’s engagement to Marcus Donovan was supposed to elevate our standing. We all thought we could finally benefit from her connections. And yet—"

Victor’s brow furrowed. "What are you implying?"

Victoria slammed her fork down. "This morning, Marcus’s assistant rejected Gregory’s business proposal outright. They claimed his company wasn’t ‘suitable’ for collaboration. That’s just an excuse! Clearly, the Donovans don’t value Evelyn at all. Even after Gregory introduced himself as her uncle, they still turned him down!"

Victor’s jaw clenched, but he said nothing.

What right did Gregory—merely Evelyn’s aunt’s husband—have to demand favors? Not even Victor, her own father, had earned any respect from the Donovans because of her.

Victoria sneered. "Evelyn thinks she’s untouchable now, clinging to the Donovans’ power. But the truth? She’s nothing but a joke to them."

Grace couldn’t stay silent. "From the start, Evelyn made it clear she wouldn’t interfere in the Donovans’ business affairs."

Victoria’s sharp gaze snapped to her. "And who gave you permission to speak? Know your place!"

Grace flinched, immediately lowering her head.

With a cold laugh, Victoria added, "Evelyn wishes she had the influence to meddle. But let’s be honest—does she?"

Grace shrank further into her seat, too intimidated to respond.

Then Victoria turned to Victor, her tone turning pointed. "Victor, have you spoken to Evelyn about Celeste’s situation yet?"

A shadow crossed Victor’s face. "She refused."


###Chapter 188

"What?" Victoria Sinclair's eyes widened in shock as she stared at Victor Sterling, her disbelief palpable. "She actually refused you even after you spoke to her personally? Victor, does your own daughter have no respect for you?"

Victor's face darkened at her words, humiliation burning through him. "You know her circumstances have changed," he snapped. "She has the Caldwell family backing her now—what exactly am I supposed to do? I can't force her to do something she doesn't want to."

Victoria let out a derisive laugh. "The Caldwell family's support? Please. Whether they truly stand behind her is still up for debate."

Victor clenched his jaw, frustration simmering beneath the surface.

At that moment, Victoria's sharp gaze shifted to Grace Monroe, who had been silently eating her meal at the side of the table.

"Grace," she called, her voice dripping with false sweetness.

Grace looked up, meeting Victoria's cold stare. "Yes? What do you need?"

Victoria leaned forward slightly, enunciating each word with deliberate emphasis. "Your daughter—she should listen to you, shouldn't she?"

Grace immediately understood what Victoria was implying.

Swallowing nervously, she pressed her lips together before answering, "It's... complicated. I've tried talking to Evelyn multiple times, but she doesn’t take my advice anymore."

After a brief hesitation, she added quickly, "She’s grown now. She has her own opinions, and she rarely follows my guidance."

Victoria’s expression turned icy at Grace’s explanation.

Her lips curled into a sneer. "So you're telling me you won’t help me with this?"

Grace shook her head. "It’s not that I don’t want to help, but honestly, there’s nothing I can do."

Victoria’s eyes hardened, her voice cutting like a blade. "Enough excuses! Just answer me—will you help or not?"

Taking a deep breath, Grace squared her shoulders. "I’m sorry, but I really can’t."

Despite her fear of Victoria, Grace refused to back down on this.

"Wonderful! Absolutely wonderful!" Victoria’s laughter was laced with fury.

She whirled toward Victor, gesturing sharply at Grace. "Look at this, Victor! Not only is Evelyn defying us, but now even this nobody dares to refuse me!"

Victor scowled, his voice thick with irritation. "Evelyn isn’t the obedient girl she used to be. She doesn’t listen to me or Grace, so pressuring Grace is pointless. Let it go! If Celeste is really interested in Ethan, she should pursue him herself. If she succeeds, it’ll be because of her own efforts. At the end of the day, it all depends on Ethan’s feelings, doesn’t it? Even if Evelyn stepped in, if Ethan doesn’t return Celeste’s feelings, nothing will change!"

Grace nodded quickly in agreement.

Seeing Victor defend Grace only fueled Victoria’s rage. "Victor, you—" She could hardly believe he was siding with his mistress instead of her.

Bristling with fury, she turned back to Grace and snapped, "Get me a bowl of soup. Now."

###Chapter 189

Victor Sterling frowned, his voice laced with irritation. "We have staff for that. Why should Grace have to fetch anything?"

Grace Monroe offered him a soft, reassuring smile. "It's alright, Victor. I don't mind."

She excused herself and made her way to the kitchen, fully aware that Victoria Sinclair's request was nothing more than a petty power play.

Moments later, Grace returned, carefully placing a bowl of soup in front of Victoria.

The moment Victoria's fingers brushed the bowl, she recoiled dramatically, hissing in exaggerated pain. "Grace! This is scalding! Are you trying to burn me?"

Grace suppressed a sigh. She had tested the soup herself—it was warm, not hot. Certainly not enough to cause injury.

Biting her lip, Grace replied calmly, "I checked the temperature. It shouldn't be too hot."

Victoria's eyes narrowed into slits, her voice sharp as a blade. "Oh? So now you're calling me a liar?"

Grace inhaled deeply, keeping her composure. "What would you like me to do?"

A cruel smirk twisted Victoria's lips. "What do I want?" she repeated mockingly.

Then—

In one swift motion, Victoria snatched the bowl and upended it over Grace's head. The lukewarm liquid cascaded down her hair, soaking her shoulders and dress.

Victoria leaned back, satisfaction gleaming in her eyes. "Well? Now you tell me—was it hot or not?"

The dining room plunged into stunned silence. No one moved. No one spoke.

Grace blinked, her fingers trembling as she touched her damp hair. Disbelief and fury warred within her. "How... how could you?"

Victoria set the empty bowl down with deliberate force, her voice dripping with venom. "What's that look for? Want to hit me?"

"Victoria, that was beyond cruel!" Victor's chair screeched as he shot to his feet, his face dark with rage. He strode to Grace's side, pulling out a handkerchief to gently dab at her ruined dress. His glare burned into Victoria. "This isn't hot. It's barely warm!"

Victoria crossed her arms, unfazed. "I say it's hot. What are you going to do about it?"

Victor's jaw clenched. "Apologize. Now."

A mocking laugh escaped Victoria. "Apologize? To her? Have you lost your mind, Victor? Or do you think I have?" Her voice turned icy. "I would never apologize to a mistress."

Victor's expression hardened. "Enough, Victoria. This ends now."

But Victoria stood her ground, defiance in every line of her body. "Oh, so the truth is too much for you? Grace knew you were married. She still had your child behind everyone's backs."

Her gaze flicked to Diana Prescott, who sat quietly, her face unreadable. "Diana tolerates her out of kindness, but that doesn't make Grace any less shameless."

The tension in the room thickened, suffocating.

Grace's hands curled into fists, her nails biting into her palms. She opened her mouth—

But before she could speak, a new voice cut through the silence.

"Actually," came the cool, measured tone, "I think you're the one who should be apologizing."

All eyes turned to the doorway.

Standing there, arms crossed and expression unreadable, was—

###Chapter 190

"So what if I bully her? Just breathing the same air makes me sick! I've lost my appetite!"

Victoria Sinclair rose abruptly, her chair scraping against the marble floor. As she swept past Grace Monroe, she halted, her glacial stare piercing through the trembling woman. "Pathetic whore."

The words dripped with venom before she stormed out, the dining room door slamming behind her. Gregory and Celeste scrambled after her without a backward glance.

Silence swallowed the room. Only Victor Sterling, Grace, and a petrified maid remained. The maid kept her gaze fixed on the floor, as if wishing to vanish.

Grace's composure shattered. Tears spilled freely down her cheeks, her fingers clutching the edge of the table for support.

Victor hesitated, then pulled her into his arms. "Grace, I'm sorry. This shouldn't have happened. Victoria had no right—"

Grace wrenched away, her voice raw. "She's right. I am despicable. I destroyed your family. This is all my fault."

"Grace—"

She shook her head violently, covering her face as she fled the room.

"Grace!" Victor called, but she was already gone.

His expression darkened. This time, Victoria had gone too far.

Grand Hills General Hospital

Evelyn Hartley frowned at her buzzing phone. "Beatrice? What's wrong?"

Beatrice Whitmore, a longtime maid of the Sterling household, had been one of Evelyn's few allies during her time there.

"You need to know what happened today," Beatrice said gravely.

Evelyn's grip tightened. "Tell me."

"Your mother came for lunch. Victoria ambushed her."

At the mention of her aunt, Evelyn's blood ran cold. "Details. Now."

Beatrice recounted the scene—Victoria's calculated cruelty, Grace's quiet dignity crumbling under the assault.

"Your mother left in tears," Beatrice murmured. "Victoria was vicious. Deliberately so."

Evelyn's nails bit into her palm. "And Victor?"

"He defended her immediately. Demanded an apology. But you know Victoria—she'd rather die than admit fault."

A beat of silence. Then Evelyn asked quietly, "Victoria wanted her to pressure me, didn't she? Did my mother refuse?"

"Flat out," Beatrice confirmed. "Said she'd never manipulate you, no matter what. That's what set Victoria off."

Evelyn exhaled slowly. The line between loyalty and recklessness had just been crossed.

###Chapter 191

Evelyn exhaled slowly, her voice softening as she spoke, "Alright. Thank you for telling me this, Beatrice."

"You're welcome," Beatrice replied, her tone noticeably lighter.

"I'll let you get back to work."

"Okay." Evelyn ended the call, but the tension in her body remained, coiled tight like a spring. She gripped her phone so hard her knuckles turned white, her mind a tempest of fury.

Victoria Sinclair! That woman had truly gone too far this time. Evelyn understood perfectly—this wasn’t just an attack on Grace; Victoria had deliberately targeted her mother to get back at her. Unable to confront Evelyn directly, she had taken her petty vengeance out on Grace instead.

The thought of the humiliation Grace had endured today sent a dark shadow flickering through Evelyn’s eyes. At the same time, she hadn’t expected Grace to refuse Victoria. She had assumed Grace would cave instantly, desperate to appease the Sinclair matriarch before coming to plead with her.

But Grace hadn’t.

A complicated swirl of emotions tightened in Evelyn’s chest. She didn’t know how to process this. Drawing a deep breath, she steadied herself.

Then, with icy resolve hardening her gaze, she pulled out her phone and dialed.

In the plush privacy of a high-end coffee shop, the door clicked open. Victoria swept in, her designer handbag swaying with every arrogant step. She settled onto the velvet sofa across from Evelyn, her lips curling into a mocking smirk.

"At this hour, you invite me for coffee instead of dinner?" she drawled, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "How utterly charming."

Evelyn’s expression remained impassive. Just the sight of Victoria’s smug face was enough to kill any appetite she might have had.

"I heard about what happened at lunch today," Evelyn began, her voice cool and measured.

Victoria’s smirk deepened into a sneer. "Oh? And what do you plan to do about it? Here to defend your pitiful mother, the shameless mistress?"

Leaning back, Victoria crossed her legs and folded her arms, her gaze brimming with disdain. "Go on, Evelyn. Show me what you’ve got."

A knock interrupted the tension as a waiter entered, placing a steaming cup of coffee in front of Evelyn before discreetly exiting.

Evelyn rose slowly, lifting the cup with deliberate calm. Without a word, she tilted it over Victoria’s perfectly styled hair.

And poured.

The scalding liquid cascaded down, drenching Victoria’s head.

Victoria froze, her face contorting in shock. A shrill scream tore from her throat as she shot to her feet.

"EVELYN!" she shrieked, her voice cracking with fury. "YOU LITTLE BITCH! HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?"

Disheveled, her makeup running in black streaks, coffee dripping from her ruined hair, Victoria looked nothing like the poised socialite she pretended to be.

Evelyn, still eerily composed, set the empty cup down and picked up a napkin. She dabbed her fingers with deliberate grace, her lips curving into a faint, almost imperceptible smile.

###Chapter 192

"You dumped a bowl of soup on my mother, Victoria," Evelyn said coolly. "Now, I've poured coffee on you. Fair's fair. We're even."

Her voice was soft, yet each word cut like a blade, delivered with chilling precision.

"You—" Victoria sputtered, rage burning in her eyes as she raised her hand to strike.

But before the slap could land, Evelyn caught her wrist effortlessly.

Victoria's face twisted further, teeth clenched as she hissed, "Let go! Evelyn, release me this instant!"

Evelyn tightened her grip briefly before shoving Victoria back with deliberate force. The momentum sent Victoria stumbling, collapsing onto the sofa in an undignified heap.

"How dare you!" Victoria shrieked, scrambling up, chest heaving.

Evelyn merely returned to her seat, reclining with an air of indifference. Her icy gaze locked onto Victoria's.

"Victoria," she began, voice measured, "you should be grateful that soup wasn't boiling. If it had been..."

Her tone dropped, sharp as winter frost. "Then what I poured on you today wouldn't have been lukewarm coffee."

Victoria's glare didn't waver, though her fingers trembled as she snatched a napkin, dabbing at the sticky streaks on her face. Her breath came fast, shallow.

After a moment, she steadied herself, forcing a mocking laugh. "Oh, look at you now. The Caldwells have your back, so suddenly you think you're invincible."

Evelyn smirked, leaning forward. "If you know they support me, then take my advice—don't test me."

Victoria barked a laugh, eyes glinting with derision. "You really think the Caldwells care about you? If they did, why refuse Gregory's proposal? They know he's your uncle. Yet they didn't give him—or you—an ounce of consideration."

Evelyn's expression remained unreadable. She tilted her head slightly, lips curving. "Want to know why they refused him?"

Victoria's smirk faltered, uncertainty flickering across her face.

Evelyn's voice was soft, lethal. "When Gregory went to meet Marcus, Marcus told me immediately. He even asked if I wanted to hand you the project." Her gaze hardened. "I said no. So Marcus rejected him outright."

Victoria's face drained of color.

"No," she whispered, shaking her head. "That's impossible!"

Evelyn didn't blink. "Believe what you want. But remember this—cross me again, and next time, it won't just be coffee."

Victoria's hands clenched, but for the first time, fear flickered beneath her rage.

###Chapter 193

"Victoria," Evelyn began, her voice laced with venom, "you should get on your knees and beg for my mother's forgiveness. Or else—"

Victoria scoffed, her temper flaring. Evelyn wanted her to apologize to that wretched woman? Never. She would rather die than lower herself.

"Is that a threat?" Victoria snapped, her voice sharp as a blade. "What could you possibly do to me?"

Evelyn smiled, cold and calculated. "Oh, I won't lay a finger on you," she said smoothly. "But the Sinclair Corporation? That's another matter entirely. One word from me, and your family's empire might just crumble."

She was playing dirty, using her influence to bend Victoria to her will. But fairness had gone out the window the moment Victoria crossed the line.

Victoria's face darkened, her eyes narrowing into dangerous slits. "You wouldn't dare."

Then, a smirk curled her lips. "You think you have that kind of power? Just because you say so?"

Evelyn shrugged, feigning indifference. "Believe what you want. But ask your dear brother about Dylan and the Reeves family. He’ll tell you everything."

Her smile turned icy. "Then, you can decide whether groveling is beneath you or not."

Victoria's hands clenched into fists, her nails digging into her palms. "Dream on!" she spat. "I will never apologize to that homewrecker!"

A dangerous glint flashed in Evelyn's eyes. She could unleash her fury, but instead, she paused—remembering something far more devastating.

"Oh, Victoria," she purred, her voice dripping with mock sympathy, "you seem to have forgotten your own sordid past. Do you remember how you trapped Gregory into marriage?"

Victoria's face drained of color. "W-What are you talking about?"

Evelyn leaned in, her voice a lethal whisper. "Let me remind you. You saw Gregory—young, handsome, engaged—and you wanted him. So, you drugged him. You slept with him, then showed up at the Sinclair mansion, pregnant and demanding he marry you."

Victoria's lips trembled, her breath coming in short gasps.

Evelyn continued, her tone laced with disdain. "And let’s not forget how you ruined his engagement. Quite the scandal, wasn’t it, Aunt Victoria?"

Victoria’s face twisted in rage. "Lies! Who told you this?"

"Lies?" Evelyn smirked. "According to Lila, it’s the truth. Your dear brother confessed everything to her while drunk."

Victoria’s blood ran cold. "You’re saying Victor betrayed me?"

It had been Lila who revealed the truth to Evelyn. At the time, Evelyn had been furious—until she realized Lila’s true target wasn’t Victoria at all. It had been Grace.

Victoria seethed, silently cursing Lila and Victor. Before she could retort, Evelyn delivered the final blow.

"You clawed your way up as a homewrecker, and now you dare judge others?" Evelyn laughed, cold and mocking. "Tell me, Aunt Victoria, are you really any better than my mother?"

Victoria’s composure shattered.

###Chapter 194

Evelyn often found herself baffled by the arrogance of those around her. Take Victoria and Dylan, for example. Neither had achieved their social status through honorable means, yet they never hesitated to hurl insults at her, as if tearing her down would somehow absolve their own tainted reputations.

Did they truly believe that belittling her would cleanse their own sins?

Before Victoria could retaliate, Evelyn stood abruptly, snatched her bag, and strode toward the exit.

As Evelyn walked away, Victoria's face twisted in fury. That little wretch! She refused to believe a single word Evelyn had said. The idea that the Caldwell family would extend favors to someone like Evelyn—who wasn’t even blood-related—was utterly preposterous!

Once outside the café, Evelyn made her way to the parking lot and pulled out her phone, dialing a familiar number.

"Leonard," she said, her voice steady, "I won’t be home for dinner tonight. I might stay at the Caldwell residence. My mother... she’s not doing well. She needs me."

There was a brief pause before Leonard responded, "Understood. I’ll send Nathan to accompany you."

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her phone. "That’s not necessary. I can manage on my own."

Leonard’s tone softened. "Don’t dismiss the idea so quickly. Seeing you and Nathan together might lift her spirits. Trust me on this."

Evelyn hesitated, then relented. "Fine. I’m at the café near the plaza."

"I’ll have him meet you there," Leonard replied before ending the call.

Evelyn slid into the driver’s seat of her car and waited. Forty minutes later, Nathan’s sleek black car pulled up beside hers. Without a word, she climbed in, and they set off toward the Caldwell estate.

The silence between them was thick, but Evelyn broke it first. "Did I pull you away from something important?"

Nathan scoffed, shooting her a sidelong glance. "What if you did?"

Evelyn tilted her head, feigning innocence. "Then I suppose I’d have to apologize."

A dry chuckle escaped him. After a beat, his voice turned serious. "What’s going on with your mother?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "Victoria humiliated her. I can only imagine how devastated she is right now."

Nathan said nothing, but the tension in his grip on the steering wheel spoke volumes.

When they arrived at the Caldwell estate, Evelyn scanned her fingerprint to unlock the gates. The house was eerily dark, not a single light on. She flicked on the foyer lights, but Grace wasn’t in the living room.

Worry gnawing at her, Evelyn hurried to Grace’s bedroom. The door creaked open, revealing a heartbreaking sight—Grace lay curled on the bed, her body trembling with silent sobs.

"Mom," Evelyn whispered, her voice thick with emotion as she sat beside her.

###Chapter 195

Grace’s tear-streaked face turned toward Evelyn, her eyes red-rimmed and swollen. "She called me worthless," Grace choked out. "In front of everyone."

Evelyn’s chest tightened. She reached out, brushing a strand of hair from Grace’s face. "She’s wrong. You’re the strongest person I know."

Grace shook her head, fresh tears spilling over. "I’ve spent my whole life trying to prove myself to them, and it’s never enough."

Nathan lingered in the doorway, his expression unreadable. Then, without a word, he turned and walked away.

Evelyn barely had time to wonder where he was going before he returned, holding a steaming cup of tea. He handed it to Grace. "Drink this. It’ll help."

Grace blinked up at him, startled by the unexpected kindness.

Evelyn’s breath caught. For the first time, she saw something in Nathan’s eyes she couldn’t quite name—something softer than his usual cold detachment.

Grace took the cup with trembling hands. "Thank you," she murmured.

Nathan merely nodded before stepping back, his gaze flickering to Evelyn. "She needs rest. Let’s give her some space."

Evelyn hesitated, but Grace gave her a weak smile. "Go. I’ll be alright."

Reluctantly, Evelyn followed Nathan out of the room. The moment the door closed behind them, she turned to him. "Why did you do that?"

Nathan arched a brow. "Do what?"

"Act like you care."

A shadow crossed his face. "Maybe I do."

The words hung between them, heavy with unspoken meaning.

Evelyn’s pulse quickened. Was this another one of his games? Or was there something more beneath that icy exterior?

Before she could respond, Nathan’s phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen, his expression hardening. "I have to go."

And just like that, the moment shattered.

Evelyn watched him leave, her mind racing. What had just happened? And why did it feel like everything between them had shifted?

Downstairs, the front door clicked shut.

Grace’s quiet sobs echoed through the silent house.

And Evelyn was left standing in the hallway, more confused than ever.

Grace Monroe slowly turned her head at the sound of Evelyn Hartley's voice, revealing tear-stained cheeks glistening under the dim bedroom light.

Evelyn's heart twisted painfully at the sight. Her emerald eyes darkened with a dangerous mix of concern and simmering anger.

Grace sat curled on the edge of the bed, her usually vibrant blue eyes swollen and bloodshot from hours of crying. The tip of her nose was an angry red, her delicate fingers clutching a crumpled tissue.

"Evelyn... what are you doing here?" Grace rasped, her voice raw as she hastily wiped her face.

"I came to see you," Evelyn murmured, stepping closer. After a beat, she added softly, "And Nathan... he came with me."

Grace froze. Her breath hitched. "Mr. Black is here?"

Evelyn nodded, a knowing smirk playing on her lips. "Waiting right outside."

"Oh god—" Grace scrambled off the bed, frantically smoothing her wrinkled blouse and patting down her disheveled hair. "We can't make him wait. Not after everything..."

The moment they stepped into the living room, Grace's gaze landed on Nathan Black lounging on the leather sofa. Her pulse spiked. Despite being married to Evelyn for years, this marked his first visit to her modest apartment.

"Mr. Black," Grace greeted stiffly, fingers knotting together. Even Victor Sterling—who moved in far higher social circles than her—would never dare address the Black empire heir so casually. She certainly wouldn't presume.

Nathan glanced up, his piercing gray eyes briefly flickering with something unreadable before giving a curt nod. His gaze lingered on Grace's puffy eyes and trembling hands. A muscle ticked in his jaw. What the hell did that woman say to break her like this?

Evelyn guided Grace onto the sofa before fixing her with a steady look. "I know what Victoria did."

Grace's fragile composure shattered. She turned away, a fresh wave of tears spilling over. "She—she went too far, but... some of it was true."

Evelyn's laugh was razor-sharp. "That hypocrite clawed her way up using every dirty trick in the book. She doesn't get to judge anyone." Leaning forward, she gripped Grace's shaking hands. "Listen to me. You owe Victoria nothing. Next time she opens her venomous mouth? You slap her. Curse her out. Make her regret ever looking at you sideways."

A wicked glint flashed in Evelyn's eyes as she tilted her head toward Nathan. "And if she tries retaliation? Well... my husband does enjoy crushing arrogant socialites." She batted her lashes at Nathan, tone dripping with playful challenge. "Don't you, darling?"

Nathan's fingers stilled around his whiskey glass. The air thickened.

Grace held her breath, watching the silent battle between them with wide, hopeful eyes.

Nathan exhaled sharply through his nose. That infuriating woman had boxed him into a corner—and she knew it. He should've scoffed. Should've walked out. Instead, after a loaded pause, he muttered, "Yeah."

The single syllable hung between them like a promise.

###Chapter 196

Though his voice was barely above a whisper, it carried clearly through the room, reaching both women.

Grace Monroe's face lit up with relief, her tear-filled eyes shimmering like morning dew. "Alright, I understand now," she murmured, her voice trembling with emotion.

Evelyn Hartley stole a lingering glance at Nathan Black, her heart skipping an unexpected beat at the gratitude shining in her eyes. Something unfamiliar stirred within her, but she quickly turned her attention back to Grace.

Picking up a tissue, Evelyn leaned in and gently dabbed at Grace's tear-streaked cheeks. "Mom, you don’t have to cry anymore," she said softly, her voice laced with tenderness.

Grace sniffled, her lips quivering as she managed a fragile smile. "These are happy tears, darling," she whispered, her voice thick with emotion.

Evelyn exhaled quietly, a flicker of resignation crossing her features. Seeing Grace like this twisted something inside her—protective instincts warring with a deep, unspoken sorrow.

Once Grace's tears were wiped away, she straightened slightly, regaining her composure. "Mr. Black, Evelyn," she began hesitantly, "have you two eaten? I could make something for you."

"I'll handle it," Evelyn interjected, already rising to her feet. Without waiting for a response, she strode toward the kitchen, leaving Grace and Nathan alone in the spacious living room.

Grace sat stiffly for a moment, her fingers twisting nervously in her lap. Despite being in her own home, Nathan’s commanding presence made her feel oddly out of place, as if she were the guest here.

The silence stretched, thick and uncomfortable, until Grace finally broke it. "Mr. Black," she ventured carefully, "how... how are things between you and Evelyn now?"

The question hung heavily in the air. Nathan’s expression shifted imperceptibly, his lips pressing into a firm line before he answered in a low, rough voice, "It's fine."

Grace nodded, her expression softening. "As Evelyn’s mother, all I want is for her to be happy. She’s suffered so much because of my mistakes—endured ridicule, hardship... I failed her." Her voice wavered, fresh tears welling in her eyes. "Now, as long as she finds happiness, that’s all I care about."

Nathan remained silent, offering no reassurance. He knew what Grace wanted—a promise that he would protect Evelyn, that he would ensure her happiness. But that was a vow he couldn’t—wouldn’t—make. So he let the quiet stretch between them, unbroken.

Grace frowned slightly at his lack of response, unease flickering across her face. Gathering her courage, she pressed on. "Mr. Black, you should know... Evelyn has only ever liked two people in her life. You—"

Nathan’s gaze sharpened, his brows drawing together. "Two?" he interrupted, his voice edged with something dark.

Grace blinked, startled by his sudden intensity. "Yes," she confirmed cautiously. "When Evelyn was fifteen, she came home one day and told me she had a crush on a boy. She said he was extraordinary—so much so that she wanted to become someone worthy of him."

Nathan’s eyes darkened, an unreadable shadow passing over his expression. The look he gave Grace was heavy with something unspoken—something almost dangerous.

###Chapter 197

Nathan stood frozen for a moment, his mind reeling. He had never imagined that Evelyn had been hiding a secret first love all this time.

Grace noticed the shift in his expression and immediately regretted bringing up the story in front of him. She forced a light laugh, quickly adding, "But after that, she never mentioned him again. I’m sure she forgot all about him. Besides, the person she loves most is you, Mr. Black."

Nathan let out a quiet scoff, his lips curling into a faint, humorless smile, but he remained silent.

Grace opened her mouth as if to say more, then hesitated, biting back her words.

An uncomfortable silence stretched between them.

Meanwhile, at the Sterling estate, the front door burst open, revealing Victoria Sinclair in complete disarray. Her hair was tangled, her clothes wrinkled, and the faint scent of coffee clung to her skin.

Victor’s eyes widened in shock. "Victoria, what happened to you?" he demanded.

Celeste rushed forward, her brows knitting in concern. "Mom, why do you smell like coffee? What the hell happened?"

Victoria let out a bitter laugh, collapsing onto the sofa with a dramatic huff. She shot a sharp glare at Victor, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "Why don’t you ask your precious niece about that?"

Victor blinked, confused. "Lila did this to you?"

But Celeste’s expression darkened with realization. "It was Evelyn, wasn’t it?"

Victoria’s face twisted with fury, her teeth clenched. "Of course it was Evelyn! She’s just as unbearable as her mother—that homewrecking—"

Victor’s frown deepened, a shadow passing over his face at the insult.

Victoria continued, her voice sharp with indignation. "Grace ran crying to Evelyn, claiming I bullied her. And then Evelyn had the nerve to invite me out, dump coffee on me, and threaten me! She demanded I apologize to her mother—or else, she said, I’d face consequences!"

"What?" Celeste’s voice rose in outrage. "That’s insane! How dare she treat you like this? You’re her aunt!"

Victor remained silent, his expression unreadable. On one hand, Evelyn’s actions were undeniably excessive—disrespecting family was unacceptable. But on the other, he understood her motives. She was protecting her mother. How could he condemn her for that?

"Victor," Victoria snapped, her sharp tone cutting through the tension. "Don’t you have anything to say?"

"What do you want me to say?" Victor replied evenly.

Victoria’s eyes flashed with fury. "Your daughter humiliated me. You should discipline her—make her kneel and apologize!"

Victor met her gaze steadily. "If you apologize to Grace, I’ll make sure Evelyn apologizes to you."

Victoria shot to her feet, her face contorted with disbelief. "What did you just say? You’re siding with that woman over your own sister? Have you lost your mind? What would Diana think?"

###Chapter 198

Victor Sterling's expression turned to stone, his voice icy with determination. "The situation with Grace and Evelyn are entirely different matters. Victoria, you were in the wrong regarding Grace. You owe her an apology."

Victoria Sinclair crossed her arms defiantly, her chin jutting forward. "In your dreams! I will never apologize to that shameless homewrecker!"

"You—!" Victor's temper flared, his voice rising before he caught himself, fists clenched at his sides.

Victoria ignored his fury, standing her ground unshaken. The air between them thickened, heavy with unyielding tension as neither backed down.

After a long silence, a flicker of thought crossed Victoria's face. She turned to Victor, curiosity lacing her tone. "Victor, tell me—what exactly happened to Dylan's family after he crossed Evelyn?"

Victor's eyes widened slightly, caught off guard. For a moment, he seemed stunned, but then realization dawned. His lips pressed into a thin line as he weighed his response.

His tone sharpened, probing. "What are you implying? What exactly do you want to know?"

Victoria exhaled dramatically, rolling her eyes. "How should I know? Evelyn told me to ask you," she snapped impatiently.

Victor tilted his head slightly, nodding as if pieces were falling into place. "So it's about that incident," he murmured. "During one dinner, Dylan..."

He recounted the events in a measured tone, factual and devoid of embellishment, ensuring Victoria understood every detail.

As his words sank in, Victoria's face paled. Her breath hitched, coming in uneven gasps before she whispered, voice trembling, "No... that can't be true! Absolutely impossible!"

Her wide, disbelieving eyes locked onto Victor's as she continued, desperation creeping into her voice. "Victor, you're lying to me! You and your daughter are conspiring just to force me to apologize to Grace!"

Victor's expression remained unshaken. He met her gaze steadily. "If you don't believe me, ask around yourself. This has been the talk of the town—plenty of people know."

Victoria was momentarily speechless. Her throat worked as she swallowed hard, her internal struggle plain. Deep down, she knew Victor wouldn't fabricate something like this just for an apology. But accepting the truth was another matter.

If what Victor said was true, and considering how much the Caldwell family valued Evelyn, it wasn't far-fetched that they would cut ties with her family—or worse, sabotage existing partnerships.

The realization hit Victoria like a physical blow. Her throat went dry, even swallowing an effort under the weight of her thoughts.

Beside her, Celeste stood frozen, shock mirroring her mother's. She was at a loss for words, processing the revelation. Who would have thought Evelyn wielded such power now?

After a brief glance at them, Victor stood, straightening his jacket. His tone was calm but firm. "I've said what I needed to say. What you do next is up to you. But don't wait until Evelyn takes matters into her own hands before realizing your mistakes. By then, it might be too late to apologize or make amends."

###Chapter 199

Without another word, Nathan turned on his heel and strode upstairs, leaving behind a shaken Victoria and a visibly distressed Celeste in the suffocating silence.

At Grace Monroe's residence, Nathan appeared to have an unusually hearty appetite. Perhaps it was the carefully prepared meal that suited his taste, but he ate more than usual tonight, even going for seconds.

Evelyn noticed this subtle change and allowed a small, satisfied smile to tug at her lips. She had deliberately prepared several of Nathan's favorite dishes—a quiet gesture of gratitude for his earlier intervention.

After dinner, she loaded the dishwasher, wiped down the countertops, and returned to the living room with a tray of freshly cut fruit.

The three of them—Nathan, Evelyn, and Grace—sat together on the plush sofa, idly snacking on fruit while a drama played on the television. The atmosphere was unexpectedly serene, a rare moment of harmony settling over them.

As the clock neared ten, Grace broke the comfortable silence with a gentle smile. "It's getting late. You two should head back."

Evelyn glanced at her mother before replying, "Mom, I'll stay the night. I want to keep you company."

Then, turning to Nathan, she added casually, "You can go ahead."

"Alright," Nathan responded with a brief nod, his tone even.

Grace, observing the exchange, didn't refuse Evelyn's offer. Instead, she suggested, "Evelyn, why don't you walk Mr. Black out?"

Evelyn hesitated for a moment, tempted to decline—after all, seeing Nathan out seemed unnecessary. But then she remembered how he had stood by her earlier. Swallowing her reluctance, she gave a slight nod. "Fine, I will."

The two left Grace's apartment and stepped into the elevator together.

The hum of the descending elevator filled the silence between them, but Nathan was the first to speak, his deep voice laced with quiet curiosity. "How exactly did your aunt hurt your mother?"

Evelyn blinked, surprised by his interest. After a brief pause, she recounted the entire incident, her voice steady but edged with lingering anger.

Nathan listened intently, his brows drawing together as the details unfolded. Victoria's actions, as Evelyn described them, were undeniably cruel. But when Evelyn mentioned how she had retaliated by throwing coffee at Victoria, Nathan's expression shifted. A faint smirk tugged at the corner of his lips—amused, yet unsurprised. He had expected nothing less from Evelyn. She wasn’t one to let slights against her or her loved ones slide.

Evelyn exhaled sharply, her tone firm. "I won't debate who was right or wrong between my parents. Even if my mother made mistakes, as her daughter, I have no right to judge her. But she’s always given me everything—treated me like the most precious person in her life. So, no matter what happened in the past, I won’t let anyone hurt her now."

Nathan’s gaze remained steady as he replied calmly, "You did what you had to."

Hearing his approval, Evelyn’s lips curved into a small, confident smile. "Exactly. Victoria got exactly what she deserved."

Nathan let out a quiet chuckle, the sound barely audible, and said nothing more.

When the elevator doors slid open, they stepped out into the crisp night air, walking side by side toward Nathan’s car. Just as they neared the vehicle, Nathan slowed his pace. He turned his head slightly, his voice low and rough in the quiet. "I heard..."

###Chapter 200

"There was someone you had a crush on when you were young?"

The question caught Evelyn completely off guard. She halted mid-step, her head whipping around to meet Nathan’s piercing gaze. Her long lashes fluttered in bewilderment as she countered, "Someone I had a crush on? What are you talking about?"

Nathan’s eyes held hers, a teasing glint dancing in their depths. "Forgotten already? When you were fifteen, you liked someone."

At his words, Evelyn’s memory flickered to life. Her gaze wavered slightly before she pressed her lips together, suspicion creeping into her tone. "Did my mother tell you this?"

"Yes," Nathan replied smoothly, his hand slipping casually into his pocket. His voice dripped with sarcasm as he added, "So, where is this person now? Why did you stop liking him?"

Evelyn studied him with a guarded expression, her thoughts racing. After a brief hesitation, she answered coolly, "We’re still in touch."

Nathan’s expression darkened instantly.

Still in touch?

Damn it.

A storm of emotions churned inside him. How could she claim to love him while keeping ties with someone from her past? The thought burned through him like wildfire. Was she trying to juggle two men at once?

His gaze turned icy, his voice sharp with biting sarcasm. "Oh, impressive, Evelyn. Married and still keeping close ties with another guy? Aren’t you afraid you’re playing with fire?"

Evelyn, however, remained unshaken. She tilted her head slightly, defiance flashing in her eyes. "You’re no less impressive, Mr. Black, considering you’re still in touch with Serena," she shot back smoothly.

Nathan froze, momentarily stunned by her unexpected counter.

Evelyn didn’t miss the flicker of tension in his posture or the way his jaw clenched. She raised her chin, staring him down without flinching. Her voice was deliberate, cutting through the silence like a blade. "Besides… Do you even care if I’m maintaining a close relationship with another guy now, Mr. Black?"

The question struck a nerve.

Nathan’s brows furrowed tightly, frustration and confusion warring in his gaze. He realized, once again, that his reaction had been too intense.

After a tense pause, he let out a cold laugh, his tone bitter. "We’re about to have a divorce. Why would I care about that?"

A sharp pang twisted in Evelyn’s chest—disappointment? Resignation? She quickly masked it, shrugging lightly as she averted her eyes. "That’s good to hear," she replied evenly.

Nathan’s gaze remained locked on her, his silence speaking volumes.

A few more steps brought them to his car. Evelyn stopped, her voice steady but distant. "I’ll head back now. Bye."

She didn’t wait for his response, turning on her heel and walking away without another word.
###Chapter 201

Nathan's piercing gaze followed Evelyn's retreating figure, his jaw tightening as shadows danced across his stormy expression.

A heartbeat later, he schooled his features into an impassive mask, slid into his sleek black car, and vanished into the night.

That evening, Evelyn stayed with Grace. While her mother slept peacefully, Evelyn tossed and turned, her mind restless. Sleep didn’t claim her until well past two in the morning.

The next day, after hurriedly preparing for work, Evelyn stepped out, her thoughts already consumed by the day’s demands.

Grace, meanwhile, savored the quiet morning. After freshening up, she settled at the kitchen table, touched by the simple but thoughtful breakfast Evelyn had left for her.

Just as she took her first bite of toast, her phone buzzed—Victor’s name flashing across the screen.

At noon, Grace entered the private dining room of an upscale restaurant, only to freeze mid-step.

Victor sat at the table, flanked by Victoria and her family.

Grace’s smile faltered. Victor had only mentioned lunch with her—not a word about Victoria’s presence. Had she known, she would’ve refused outright.

Hesitating in the doorway, Grace debated turning back when Victor shot Victoria a pointed look. "Go on," he urged, his voice firm.

Victoria’s lips twisted in displeasure, but with visible reluctance, she pushed back her chair and approached Grace. Her stormy expression made Grace instinctively retreat a step.

"Grace, don’t be afraid," Victor interjected quickly.

Victoria stopped just short of Grace, her posture rigid as she bent into a stiff, half-hearted bow. Through gritted teeth, she forced out, "I’m sorry," each syllable dripping with resentment.

Grace’s eyes widened.

Was Victoria apologizing to her?

Before Grace could process the surreal moment, Victoria straightened abruptly, her sharp laugh slicing through the tension. "Well played, Grace," she sneered, venom lacing her words. "You’ve raised quite the daughter."

The words hung between them—more bitter than sincere. Without waiting for a response, Victoria spun on her heel and stalked back to her seat.

Grace blinked, confusion knitting her brows.

"Grace, sit," Victor said, gesturing to the empty chair beside him.

Once seated, Victor leaned in, his voice low. "It was Evelyn. She confronted Victoria yesterday and demanded she apologize to you."

Grace’s breath caught.

So that was why Victoria’s attitude had shifted so drastically.

Evelyn had done this—for her.

###Chapter 202

Grace could only speculate about the lengths Victoria might have gone to in order to make this happen. She suspected her daughter Evelyn must have employed some carefully calculated strategy to intimidate or coerce Victoria. Otherwise, there was no conceivable way Victoria would have ever apologized to her.

The realization sent a surge of emotion through Grace, her heart swelling with gratitude.

Across the table, Victoria clenched her jaw, her dark eyes burning with suppressed rage. Her fingers dug into the edge of her seat, fighting the overwhelming urge to hurl the dishes at Grace. But she didn’t dare—not now. She was terrified of provoking Grace. More importantly, she feared Evelyn.

Her recent investigations had confirmed what Gregory had told her—the Caldwell family had abruptly severed their business ties with the Reeves family, all because of Evelyn.

Victoria had even heard whispers about others in high society who had foolishly crossed Evelyn. Those individuals had been reduced to humiliating acts—public apologies, groveling—just to shield their families from Evelyn’s retaliation. The more Victoria dwelled on it, the more resentment festered inside her. It was clear now that Evelyn hadn’t been bluffing. She held the power to dismantle the Reeves family’s financial stability with a single word.

Bitter thoughts churned in Victoria’s mind. Life had a cruel way of turning the tables. Who would have imagined that the illegitimate child she had once scorned and dismissed could now dictate the fate of her family’s empire?

If she had known this day would come, she would have treated Evelyn very differently from the start.

Grace savored her meal with a contentment she hadn’t felt in years, while Victoria sat in seething silence.

Later that evening, after returning home, Grace picked up the phone and dialed Evelyn’s number.

"Mom? What is it?" Evelyn’s voice was calm, laced with mild curiosity.

Grace exhaled slowly, her tone a mix of astonishment and delight. "Evelyn, today at lunch, your Aunt Victoria apologized to me."

On the other end of the line, Evelyn’s lips curved into a faint smirk. A soft chuckle escaped her. "How did it feel? Did you enjoy it?"

Grace pressed a hand to her mouth to stifle her laughter, nodding vigorously as if Evelyn could see her. "Absolutely. It was incredible. Seeing Victoria swallow her pride isn’t something that happens every day."

"As long as it made you happy," Evelyn replied, her voice tinged with quiet amusement.

Grace’s expression softened, her voice thick with emotion. "Evelyn… thank you. Thank you for standing up for me."

Evelyn’s tone remained steady, unwavering. "I told you before—I won’t let anyone hurt you."

Grace’s chest tightened at her daughter’s resolute words, tears welling in her eyes. She was deeply moved.

After a brief pause, Evelyn’s voice lowered, gentle yet probing. "Mom… why didn’t you agree to help Victoria back then?"

If Grace had agreed to assist Victoria—or rather, Celeste—things might have unfolded differently. Even if her efforts had been futile and Victoria had still berated her, perhaps the cruelty she endured wouldn’t have been so relentless.

###Chapter 203

After Evelyn's question, Grace hesitated, her expression flickering with uncertainty. Finally, she spoke, her voice laced with remorse.

"Because I didn't want to fail you again."

Evelyn was taken aback, her breath hitching at the unexpected answer.

Grace exhaled deeply before continuing, "Evelyn, after everything that happened with Lila, I know I failed you. It broke your heart—and mine too. But I couldn't change it. I always felt I owed Lila and Diana. Every chance I got to repay that debt, I took it, hoping it would ease the guilt eating at me. But in doing so, I ignored your feelings. That was my mistake, and for that, I'm truly sorry."

Evelyn's chest tightened as she listened, her lips parting slightly, but no words came out.

Grace's voice steadied, firmer now. "But I don't owe Victoria anything. And I refuse to let her be the reason I hurt you again. Even if my refusal enraged her, I couldn’t bring myself to agree."

A rush of warmth spread through Evelyn—relief, happiness, something tender and fierce all at once. She pressed her lips together before speaking, gentle but firm. "From now on, Mom, if anyone dares to hurt you, you tell me."

Grace chuckled, lighter than before. "Understood."

"Good. With you on my side, I'm not afraid of anything anymore."

Evelyn nodded, a small smile tugging at her lips. "I should get back to work."

"Go ahead. Take care of yourself."

"I will."

The call ended, and Evelyn returned to her tasks.

Later, as she sipped water at her desk, her phone buzzed again. The name on the screen made her frown. Why is he calling?

She answered, tone cool. "What do you want?"

"You handled your mother’s situation well," Victor’s voice came through, smooth and measured.

Evelyn froze, pulling the phone away to stare at the screen as if it might explain this bizarre moment. Praise from Victor Sterling? That was rarer than a blue moon.

Before she could respond, he continued, "But throwing coffee in your aunt’s face? That was excessive."

A bitter smirk curled her lips. "Excessive? I just gave her what she deserved. So it’s fine for her to dump food on my mother’s head, but I’m the one who crossed a line?"

Silence. Then Victor sighed, resignation creeping into his tone. "She’s still family. You shouldn’t have disrespected her like that."

Evelyn’s smile vanished, her expression hardening.

###Chapter 204

Evelyn had no patience for another lecture. She cut straight to the chase, her voice sharp. "Just tell me why you really called."

Hearing her blunt tone, Victor didn't bother with pleasantries. "Your Aunt Victoria has already apologized to your mother. Now, it's your turn to apologize to her."

Evelyn's eyes widened for a fraction of a second before she tipped her head back and laughed—hard.

She nearly doubled over, the absurdity of his demand hitting her like a slap. Apologize to Victoria? Was he serious? What next—should she grovel at her feet too?

Victor frowned at her reaction, irritation flickering across his face. "There's a clear distinction here. Yes, your aunt was wrong in how she treated your mother, but she's made amends. You, on the other hand, threw coffee in her face. She's your elder, Evelyn. Where's your respect?"

His voice dripped with self-righteous conviction.

"She deserved it," Evelyn shot back. "My elder? Please. Does she act like one? You actually expect me to apologize to someone like her? What kind of delusional world are you living in, Dad?"

Victor opened his mouth to argue, but Evelyn cut him off. "If that's all you called for, we're done here. I have better things to do." She ended the call before he could respond.

Seconds later, her phone buzzed again—Victor calling back, no doubt furious. She ignored it. Arguing with him was a waste of breath.

Time flew, and soon, the day of the long-awaited competition between Evelyn and Lila arrived. The hospital was electric with anticipation.

Every doctor and nurse not on duty crowded into the auditorium. The massive split-screen at the front displayed two live feeds—one of Evelyn in the neurosurgery simulation pod, the other of Lila in cardiac surgery.

"Who do you think will win?"

Whispers erupted instantly.

"Lila, obviously. Dr. Pierce has been training her nonstop. She stays late every night practicing."

"Exactly. Meanwhile, Evelyn clocks out right on time. Mr. Holloway hasn’t given her any special coaching. Hard work beats talent, and Lila’s put in the hours."

Dylan sat in the back row, a smirk playing on his lips as he listened. He’d brought Serena specifically to watch Evelyn crash and burn. That arrogant woman always thought she was untouchable. He couldn’t wait to see her humiliated—losing the competition and getting kicked out of Grand Oaks General.

Pulling out his phone, he started a live stream and shared the link in his group chat.

###Chapter 205

"Listen up, everyone! The competition is about to begin! Today, we'll witness who gets to keep their position at Grand Hills General Hospital."

One by one, the group members clicked the live stream link, and within moments, Dylan's broadcast had gathered a modest but eager audience.

On the massive screen, Evelyn's setup came into view. Dressed in full surgical attire, she adjusted her smart glasses before securing the high-tech watch linked to the virtual surgery system. The moment it powered on, a crisp notification flashed:

"Welcome to the Virtual Surgery System."

The same message appeared on the auditorium screen, now synced to Evelyn’s perspective, giving the spectators a real-time view of the procedure through her eyes.

Within minutes, Lila Sinclair was also connected. As both surgeons stood ready, the competition officially commenced.

A sharp electronic tone pierced the air—the signal to begin.

The virtual display illuminated with the case details: a simulated patient suffering from a Type B aortic dissection.

Evelyn moved first, her strategy centered on a minimally invasive stent graft procedure—a technically demanding technique requiring flawless precision. Through a small femoral artery incision, she would guide the stent to reinforce the damaged aorta.

At first, both surgeons appeared equally competent—their movements deliberate, their focus unshaken.

But halfway through, Lila began to struggle.

Dominic Pierce noticed immediately. His sharp gaze darkened as he watched Lila falter, his fingers tightening around the edge of his seat. The unease coiling in his chest was undeniable.

He knew the truth. During training, Lila had only managed one successful session—a fluke, by most accounts. Since then, she hadn’t completed the procedure correctly even once.

Outwardly, Dominic projected confidence, but internally, doubt gnawed at him. Still, he wasn’t overly concerned. He doubted Evelyn would succeed either.

In his mind, if both failed today, time was still on his side. He could continue training Lila, refining her skills until she mastered the technique.

"Look at Evelyn’s hands—steady as a rock."

"Unbelievable. Not even a tremor."

"I think she might actually pull this off."

"Don’t jump to conclusions. Anything can happen. We won’t know until the very end."

###Chapter 206

The whispers reached Dylan, who was live-streaming the event on his phone. His fingers tightened around the device, knuckles turning white as tension coiled through his body.

Meanwhile, in the CEO’s office of Triumph Consortium, the mood was starkly different.

"Nathan, did you catch that?" Alexander nudged Nathan’s arm with a smirk, watching him closely for any reaction. "Those doctors are saying Evelyn actually has a chance to win this time."

He looked smug, thrilled that the odds were tipping in Evelyn’s favor. Today, Alexander had one mission—to force Nathan to watch the competition with him. He had even gone as far as bribing a nurse at Grand Oaks General Hospital to set up a live feed.

Despite Nathan’s obvious disinterest, Alexander had planted his tablet squarely on Nathan’s desk, refusing to take no for an answer.

Nathan’s expression remained unreadable, his gaze cool and detached, as if Alexander’s enthusiasm barely registered.

Then—BANG!

A sharp noise erupted from the live feed, slicing through the tension in the room. The sudden sound made Evelyn’s hands jerk, causing a small but critical misstep in her procedure.

"Oh no! Evelyn just messed up!" someone gasped in the audience.

"What the hell was that noise?" another voice demanded.

"And why did it only happen on Evelyn’s side? Lila’s station wasn’t affected at all," a third person muttered, suspicion lacing their tone.

The tension thickened as rapid knocking suddenly pounded against Evelyn’s simulation room door.

"Who the hell is knocking right now?"

Evelyn didn’t flinch. She merely glanced up, her voice steady as she addressed the instrument nurse. "Sophia, go check what’s happening."

Sophia Reynolds hesitated, frowning. "But the procedure—"

"I’ve got it. Go," Evelyn assured her, already correcting her earlier mistake with practiced precision.

Sophia nodded reluctantly before heading to the door.

Outside stood a young boy, clutching a basketball and looking sheepish.

The audience watching the live feed heard him say, "Miss, I’m so sorry! My basketball hit your door by accident. I wanted to apologize."

Sophia barely spared him a glance. "It’s fine. Just leave—we’re in the middle of something."

But the boy shook his head stubbornly. "No, Miss! My parents taught me that if I do something wrong, I have to make it right. I apologized to you, but I need to say sorry to everyone inside too. Please let me in—just for a second!"

Before Sophia could stop him, the boy darted forward, trying to slip past her.

Her pulse spiked as she threw out an arm to block him. "Absolutely not! You can’t go in there. I said we’re busy—now leave!"

###Chapter 207

Her voice was laced with urgency, sharp enough to cut through the tension in the corridor, but the boy didn’t back down. "Miss, I need to go in there and apologize. Just let me through—I swear I’ll be quick. I won’t cause any trouble."

Before Evelyn could react, he sidestepped her, lunging for the door.

Panic surged through her. She grabbed the handle and yanked it shut with a deafening bang that reverberated down the hallway. Now, both of them stood locked outside.

Inside the auditorium, the abrupt slam sent a ripple of murmurs through the gathered medical staff.

"This is bad," someone whispered, their voice tight with alarm. "The virtual surgery room is locked, and the instrument nurse doesn’t have fingerprint access. Unless Evelyn opens it herself, the nurse can’t get in. But she’s mid-surgery—she can’t just stop!"

"Dr. Black is in surgery too—he can’t help."

"Then it’s over. The nurse is stuck outside!"

"Who is that kid? Why is he so desperate to get in there? Do you think this was planned?"

"Without the nurse, how is Evelyn supposed to finish? No one can handle a surgery like this alone."

Uneasy glances darted between the crowd, the tension thickening like a storm cloud. One thing was clear: Evelyn was set up to fail.

The frantic whispers, transmitted through the nurse’s phone, reached Nathan and Alexander.

Alexander’s jaw clenched. "That wasn’t an accident. Someone sent him to sabotage her."

Nathan’s piercing gaze darkened, his expression unreadable. He said nothing, but his mind raced with one burning question: Could Evelyn hold her nerve and pull this off?

In the auditorium, unnoticed by most, Dominic Pierce’s lips curled into a smirk. He leaned toward Sebastian Holloway beside him, voice dripping with mock sympathy. "Mr. Holloway, at this rate, it seems Dr. Hartley doesn’t stand a chance."

Sebastian remained impassive. "The surgery isn’t over yet, Dr. Pierce. Let’s not jump to conclusions."

Dominic chuckled but didn’t argue. In his mind, Evelyn was already finished.

Behind them, Dylan Reeves exchanged a knowing glance with Serena Cole, their shared satisfaction barely concealed before they turned back to the screen.

The room fell silent, every eye locked on the live feed.

Inside the simulation room, Evelyn’s hands were steady as steel. Not a single tremor betrayed the pressure bearing down on her. Her focus was absolute, her movements precise as she corrected her earlier mistake—almost done.

"Look at her composure," someone murmured in awe. "To stay this calm under these circumstances…"

"Her hands haven’t faltered once," another agreed. "She’s handling this like a pro."

###Chapter 208

The moment Lila's concentration faltered, everything unraveled. Unlike Evelyn, she couldn't recover from her mistake.

Panic seized her, and within seconds, the simulation emitted three sharp beeps. "Surgery Failed."

The words flashed across Lila's screen, sending shockwaves through the audience.

"Lila failed!" someone gasped.

"That was a recoverable error. If she'd stayed calm, she could've fixed it."

"She lost her nerve—that's what ruined her. Clearly, she lacks experience. Still, making it this far is impressive."

"Now, it all depends on Evelyn."

Dominic Pierce's smug expression wavered as Lila's failure registered. His jaw tightened, a shadow of unease flickering in his eyes. But just as quickly, he leaned back in his seat, forcing composure. Even if Lila had failed, it wouldn’t matter—Evelyn would too. He was certain of it.

At worst, this round would end in a tie, buying him time to prepare for the next match.

Ten minutes later, Lila entered the auditorium, her face drained of color, shoulders slumped in defeat.

Dominic felt a spike of irritation, but he swallowed it. Scolding her now was pointless. Instead, he motioned for her to sit beside him and said, "You did better than before. But your mindset needs work. Panicking ruins everything—you have to stay composed. Understand?"

Lila pressed her lips together and nodded.

After a beat, she turned to him, regret darkening her gaze. "I'm sorry, Mr. Pierce. I... I let you down."

Dominic exhaled sharply. "It's fine. Just don’t make the same mistake again."

But Lila’s anxiety lingered. "Will there even be a next time for me?"

Her eyes flicked to the screen, where Evelyn was still operating. A knot of dread twisted in her stomach.

Dominic smirked and gestured toward the display. "Look. She's alone now."

The realization hit Lila like a slap. "What’s happening?" she whispered, confusion knitting her brows.

Dominic’s smile deepened, but he said nothing.

Lila studied his confidence, and slowly, her tension eased.

She turned her attention back to the screen, watching in silence. Minutes crawled by. Evelyn’s movements were swift but precise, her hands steady.

Then, Dominic’s and Lila’s faces paled simultaneously.

Was Evelyn actually going to succeed?

Just then—

"She did it!"

"She actually finished!"

...

###Chapter 209

"Oh my God! Evelyn actually did it! Despite all the interruptions during the procedure, she completed the surgery successfully—all by herself!"

Evelyn was still finishing up the final steps of the operation, but the auditorium had already erupted into cheers and excited gasps. The atmosphere was electric, buzzing with disbelief and admiration.

A few seconds later, the words "Surgery Successful" flashed across Evelyn’s screen.

"No… That’s impossible! How?!" Dylan Reeves shot up from his seat, his face twisted in shock. Beside him, Serena Cole looked equally stunned. Neither had expected Evelyn to pull this off.

And they weren’t the only ones struggling to process what had just happened. Dominic Pierce and Lila Sinclair sat frozen in their seats. Dominic’s expression darkened like a brewing storm, while Lila’s face turned ghostly pale.

Lila’s mind raced. Evelyn actually succeeded? How?!

Now, she was going to lose everything. Grand Hills General Hospital would never hire her again. The realization hit her like a tidal wave, drowning her in despair. How could Evelyn have done it?

This was an incredibly delicate and complex surgery! How had Evelyn managed it alone?

Before long, all eyes turned toward Sebastian Holloway, seated at the center of the front row. He stood slowly, a folder in hand, and made his way to the stage.

Standing behind the podium, he pulled out several sheets of paper and spoke into the microphone.

"These are admission test results. When I recruited Evelyn to join this hospital, I sought approval from our director, Mr. Reginald Vaughn, to have her take the test early. It was agreed that her score would determine whether she would be accepted as a staff member. The test was administered in front of myself, Mr. Vaughn, and several hospital shareholders. Her score was determined on the spot."

He paused, letting the weight of his words settle.

"I’m sure many of you are curious about her results. Elena, please come up and announce them."

"Yes, Mr. Holloway." A female doctor named Elena Vasquez stood and hurried to the stage. When she took the papers from Sebastian, her eyes immediately darted to the score written on the first page.

Her breath hitched.

This can’t be real.

Evelyn had—

"Elena, snap out of it! What did she score?"

Jolted by the impatient murmurs from the crowd, Elena swallowed hard.

"A perfect score. Evelyn… She didn’t make a single mistake."

Silence.

Then—

"A perfect score? Are you kidding me?"

The whispers exploded into a frenzy.

###Chapter 210

"This is impossible!"

"No one has ever achieved a perfect score at Grandcrest General Hospital! It's never happened before!"

"My God, Evelyn is unbelievable! How did she manage that?"

At that moment, no one dared question Evelyn Hartley’s abilities. Instead, they gazed at her with awe, as if she were some kind of prodigy. This wasn’t just a theoretical exam—it included practical assessments too. The fact that Evelyn had flawlessly executed every task meant she hadn’t made a single mistake.

Lila Sinclair, Dominic Pierce, Dylan Reeves, and Serena Cole remained frozen in their seats, their faces etched with shock.

The idea that Evelyn had scored perfectly on the hospital’s notoriously difficult entrance exam was beyond comprehension. Lila, who had taken the test twice before, could barely manage half the answers correctly. Yet Evelyn…

Lila’s mind reeled. Back in medical school, Evelyn had always been at the bottom of the class, constantly looking up to her. How had she suddenly surpassed her so completely? Had she unlocked some hidden talent?

No one even entertained the thought of cheating. The exam papers were secured under biometric locks requiring the fingerprints of Liam Vaughn, Sebastian Holloway, and eight other board members. Without all ten, access was impossible.

This level of security only made Evelyn’s perfect score even more astonishing. The entire auditorium was stunned into silence.

"I will display Evelyn’s exam papers in the hospital’s Hall of Honor," Sebastian announced, breaking the tension. His gaze then shifted to Dominic, a smirk playing on his lips. "Dr. Pierce, Lila, I believe we should return to the Cardiac Surgery Department now."

Lila’s face drained of color. Was this it? Was she about to be fired? The thought of being forced out of Grandcrest General Hospital was unbearable.

Sebastian’s words snapped everyone back to reality.

They had almost forgotten—this had been a challenge between Evelyn and Lila. The loser would be dismissed from the hospital, permanently barred from returning.

With reluctant steps, Dominic and Lila followed Sebastian out of the auditorium.

Meanwhile, Alexander Prescott had just ended a video call, his face alight with pride. "I knew it! Evelyn was destined to succeed."

Nathan Black, standing nearby, frowned slightly. He hadn’t expected this outcome either.

He knew how grueling the exam was. Merely passing was enough to secure a position at Grandcrest—yet many failed. But Evelyn hadn’t just passed. She had aced it.

After this, no one could ever doubt her abilities or accuse her of using connections to get ahead.

The game had changed.

And Evelyn Hartley had just proven she was a force to be reckoned with.

###Chapter 211

Evelyn stepped out of the virtual surgery suite, her muscles tense from the intensity of the procedure. Sophia, who had been pacing anxiously outside, rushed forward, her face a storm of guilt and worry.

"I'm so sorry, Evelyn! I messed up—I shouldn't have locked the door. After I finally got rid of that little brat, I tried to find Dr. Caldwell, but he was in surgery. I couldn’t get him to unlock it in time."

Evelyn gave her a small, reassuring smile. "If you hadn’t shut that door, that kid would’ve barged right in. You did the right thing."

Sophia exhaled shakily, then bit her lip. "So… did you… finish the surgery successfully?"

She had been stuck outside without her phone, completely in the dark about how the competition had gone.

At the question, Evelyn let out a dramatic sigh, her expression shifting into one of weary resignation.

Sophia’s face fell instantly. "Oh no—it’s all my fault! I ruined everything!"

Seeing her friend’s distress, Evelyn couldn’t keep up the act. A grin broke across her face. "Got you! Of course I finished it. Successfully."

"Seriously?" Sophia’s eyes widened, hope flaring back to life.

Evelyn nodded, mischief dancing in her gaze. "Would I lie to you?"

Sophia groaned and playfully swatted her arm. "You’re terrible! Don’t scare me like that!"

Laughing, Evelyn looped her arm through Sophia’s. "Come on, let’s head back to the department."

As they walked toward the elevator, Sophia frowned. "I wonder if Lila managed to complete hers too. If she did, you’d be tied."

Evelyn’s lips curved slightly, but she didn’t respond.

Then, a thought struck her. "That kid earlier—who was he?"

Sophia rolled her eyes. "Ugh, don’t even get me started. He’s the deputy director of Neurosurgery’s son. Whenever the guy can’t find a babysitter, he drags the kid here. But of all days, he had to show up today?"

Evelyn’s smile turned icy, a knowing glint in her eyes. She didn’t believe for a second that the boy’s appearance had been accidental.

What were the odds that he’d show up right as she was performing surgery? And that out of all the doors in that hallway, his basketball would slam into hers?

She kept those thoughts to herself, though. "Let’s go," she said simply.

When they returned to the Cardiac Surgery Department, they found nearly everyone gathered around the large conference table—except for the doctors on duty.

The moment they stepped inside, the room erupted into applause.

###Chapter 212

"Congratulations on completing the surgery, Evelyn!"

"Thank you," Evelyn replied with a confident smile as she took her seat.

At that moment, Sebastian Holloway addressed the room, his gaze sweeping over everyone present. "In today's competition, Evelyn successfully completed the surgery, while Lila failed. According to the agreed terms, Lila will be dismissed from Grand Pines General Hospital, and Dr. Pierce will forfeit his annual bonus and donate one month's salary to me. Most importantly… Evelyn is now officially promoted to attending physician. Any objections?"

Silence. No one dared protest—not after Evelyn had proven her skill beyond doubt. She had earned her place at Grand Pines through sheer talent, leaving no room for argument.

Lila and Dominic Pierce’s expressions darkened, their defeat written plainly across their faces.

"Mr. Holloway!" Lila suddenly burst out, desperation clawing at her voice. "Please reconsider. Don’t fire me. I’ll do anything—I’ll even withdraw from the hospital exams for the next two years. Just let me stay."

Pride abandoned, she clung to the last shred of hope. Leaving Grand Pines wasn’t an option—not when she had worked so hard to get here.

Sebastian’s lips curled into a cold smile. "Miss Sinclair, we all agreed to the terms. Are you backing out now that you’ve lost? That’s hardly fair."

Lila paled. "No! I’m not—I just… I’m asking for leniency. That’s all."

Sebastian ignored her plea and turned to Evelyn instead. "What do you think, Evelyn?"

Lila stiffened, her breath hitching. The irony was unbearable—her fate now rested in the hands of the sister she had always underestimated.

Evelyn studied Lila, a faint smirk playing at her lips.

"You really want to stay at Grand Pines, don’t you?" she asked, her tone deceptively light.

A beat of silence. Then, with mock sympathy, she continued, "As your sister, how could I not help you?"

Lila’s eyes widened, hope flickering—until Evelyn raised a hand, silencing her before she could speak.

"But," Evelyn’s voice turned sharp, "a bet is a bet. Without consequences, this competition would be meaningless, wouldn’t it? I can’t let my reputation be tarnished for nothing." She leaned forward, her gaze unyielding. "So here’s my offer: You can stay… as an intern. No promotions. No exams. Ever."

The room went deathly still, the weight of her words sinking in.

Lila’s face twisted in horror. To be trapped as an intern indefinitely—no advancement, no future—was worse than being fired.

###Chapter 213

Lila Sinclair was quick to mask her fury, replacing it with a wounded, pitiful expression.

Her voice trembled with feigned hurt as she whispered, "Evelyn, isn't this... a little excessive?"

Evelyn Hartley tilted her head, her wide eyes the picture of innocence. "Excessive? You were the one who insisted on staying at the hospital. I merely proposed a solution. If you find it unfair, perhaps you should consider resigning now."

Her lips curled into a razor-sharp smile, slicing through Lila's composure like a blade.

For a fleeting second, Lila's mask slipped. She was speechless. The realization struck her—Evelyn wasn't offering kindness. This was calculated humiliation.

She had two choices: endure indefinite disgrace as a perpetual intern, or walk away in total defeat.

Then, Sebastian Holloway's commanding voice cut through the tension. "Evelyn's terms are more than reasonable. Lila, the decision is yours. Take the night to think it over. I expect your answer by tomorrow morning. Meeting adjourned."

Without waiting for a response, Sebastian stood and strode out. The others followed, rising in unison.

One by one, they turned to Evelyn, offering warm congratulations. Each word was another stab at Lila's pride.

Beneath the table, her fists clenched until her knuckles turned white. Jealousy and resentment burned inside her, threatening to erupt.

Unable to bear another second, Lila fled the hospital early. She locked herself in her bedroom the moment she got home, collapsing into uncontrollable sobs.

When Diana Prescott called Victor Sterling to relay the news, he rushed home immediately.

"Lila, open this door!" Victor demanded, knocking urgently. "What happened? Why are you crying like this?"

Diana stood behind him, her brow furrowing as realization dawned. "Lila," she called, voice sharpening, "wasn't today your evaluation against Evelyn? Did you... lose?"

The question hung heavily in the air. Victor's expression darkened in understanding.

His knocks grew more insistent. "Lila, is that it? Did Evelyn beat you? Open up and tell us!"

Minutes ticked by before the door finally creaked open.

Lila emerged, her face blotchy and eyes swollen from crying. The moment she saw Diana, she crumbled.

She threw herself into her mother's arms, sobbing uncontrollably.

"Mom," she choked out between ragged breaths, "I lost. Evelyn humiliated me. I lost everything!"

Diana and Victor exchanged stunned glances.

So it was true.

Their daughter had been utterly defeated by Evelyn Hartley.

###Chapter 214

"It's okay, sweetheart. One setback doesn't define you," Diana murmured, rubbing soothing circles on Lila's back. "Come, let's go downstairs and discuss this properly."

The three of them descended to the living room, the air thick with tension.

Sniffling, Lila recounted the morning's events, her voice shaky with emotion.

Diana listened carefully, her expression composed, while Victor's face twisted in disbelief.

"Evelyn actually won?" Victor blurted out. "How? Did she—did she play dirty?"

Diana shot him a sharp glare. "How could you even suggest that? Evelyn is your daughter too."

Victor shifted uncomfortably, avoiding her gaze. He simply couldn't wrap his head around it.

Turning back to Lila, Diana asked, "So, have you been dismissed from Grandview General?"

Lila dabbed at her damp lashes with a tissue. "Not yet. Evelyn gave me two choices. If I want to stay, I can only remain as an intern—no more exams, no chance of promotion. The other option is to leave."

A heavy silence settled over the room before Victor exploded, "What kind of ultimatum is that? That's outrageous! Don't worry, Lila, I'll call Evelyn right now and—"

"Stop!" Diana's firm voice cut through his anger.

Victor turned to her, bewildered.

"Think before you act," Diana said with a sigh.

Reluctantly, Victor lowered his phone, though his expression remained stormy.

Diana's gaze softened as she studied Lila. "Tell me, darling, what do you think about this?"

Lila hesitated, her fingers twisting the tissue. "I don’t want to leave Grandview. I fought so hard to get there! But… I can’t stay as an intern forever. Evelyn’s offer is just a way to humiliate me. She’s gone too far!"

"Then leave Grandview and find another hospital," Diana said calmly, her tone pragmatic. "Owathe has plenty of reputable institutions."

Lila bit her lip. "But… but I—"

"But you don’t want to leave Grandview, yet you refuse to accept the terms," Diana finished for her, her gaze unwavering. "Do you honestly think you can have both?"

Lila faltered, her lips parting, but no words came out. She looked away, defeated.

After a long pause, she whispered, "It wasn’t even my idea. My mentor—I just—"

Diana’s voice turned icy. "If you didn’t agree with the bet, you should have refused from the start. By going along with it, you accepted the consequences. Now that you’ve lost, you want to blame others? Lila, is this the kind of integrity I raised you with? Someone who runs from accountability?"

Lila’s lips trembled, fresh tears spilling over, but she said nothing.

###Chapter 215

Victor Sterling's chest tightened as he watched his daughter in such distress. "Don't speak like that, Lila," he murmured, his voice gentle but firm. "Grace is already upset enough."

"You don't have to—"

"Enough!" Diana Prescott snapped, cutting him off. "And don’t even consider calling Evelyn. She did nothing wrong here. In fact, she was gracious enough to offer Lila another chance. A bet is a bet. Lila must accept the consequences. Do I really need to spell this out for you?"

Victor fell silent, his shoulders sagging under the weight of Diana’s words. She turned back to Lila, her gaze unwavering.

"Now," Diana said, her tone steady, "tell me, Lila. What’s your decision? Will you stay at Grandview General Hospital under Evelyn’s conditions, or will you leave?"

Lila’s sobs quieted. She sniffled, her eyes fixed on the polished floor as she weighed her options.

What hurt the most wasn’t the loss—it was her mother’s refusal to take her side. Not only had Diana refused to defend her, but she had also openly supported Evelyn, insisting she had done nothing wrong.

A spark of resentment flared in Lila’s chest, though she kept it carefully hidden.

Leaving Grandview General Hospital wasn’t an option. It was the premier medical institution, frequented by the city’s elite. The resources, the prestige, the connections—it was the perfect place to build her career.

Even if she had to endure the humiliation of being an intern indefinitely, she wouldn’t walk away. If she played her cards right, she could still find a way to climb the ranks.

The thought reignited her determination. She wouldn’t let this opportunity slip through her fingers.

"I want to stay at Grandview," Lila finally said, her voice steadier now despite the lingering tremor.

Diana’s eyes narrowed slightly. "Are you certain? You won’t regret this later and blame Evelyn—or anyone else?"

Lila flinched at the pointed question but quickly nodded. "Mom, I know I was wrong," she said softly, her tone almost pleading. "I shouldn’t have spoken against my mentor or Evelyn. I… I was just overwhelmed. I let my emotions control me."

"I said things I didn’t mean. This is my fault. I lost because I wasn’t good enough. I understand that now."

Diana’s expression softened. "Acknowledging your mistakes is the first step to growth," she said. "Since you’ve made your choice, I’ll support you."

Lila nodded, resolve hardening in her chest. "Thank you, Mom. I’ll go to my room now."

"Go ahead," Diana replied.

As Lila disappeared upstairs, Diana turned to Victor, her expression sharpening. "You’ve coddled her too much," she said sternly. "She’s lost all sense of accountability because of it. What you call love is only harming her."

Victor sighed, his shoulders slumping further. "I see that now," he muttered, offering no defense.

###Chapter 216

The sudden ringing of his phone cut through the tense silence. Glancing at the caller ID, he stepped away to answer.

"Hello."

"Victor, how did the competition between Evelyn and Lila go?" Grace's voice was laced with curiosity, though there was an edge to it.

Victor's jaw clenched, his tone dripping with barely restrained fury. "Evelyn won."

"What?" Grace's shock was palpable. "Evelyn won?" She blinked rapidly, as if trying to process the impossible. Evelyn had promised her she would let Lila win!

Victor's laugh was bitter. "None of us saw this coming, but it's the truth. Evelyn won, and Lila lost. And as if that wasn't enough, Evelyn gave Lila an ultimatum—stay at the hospital as a permanent intern or leave entirely. Generous, isn't it?"

Grace fell silent, the weight of his sarcasm pressing down on her.

After a long pause, she muttered, "I have to go. We'll talk later." Before Victor could respond, she ended the call. Without hesitation, she dialed another number—this time, Evelyn's.

The phone rang. And rang.

No answer.

Grace tried again, her fingers tightening around her phone. Still nothing.

Frustration mounting, she fired off a text: Call me back as soon as you see this.

Evelyn had seen it all—the calls, the message. She had ignored them deliberately. She knew exactly what Grace wanted to discuss, and right now, she had zero interest in rehashing the competition.

Leaving her phone untouched, she turned her attention elsewhere.

That evening, at the lavish Moonlight Lounge, Alexander hosted a celebration in Evelyn's honor. He had gone all out, filling the private room with colleagues and acquaintances, all there to toast Evelyn's victory.

When Evelyn arrived, the room was already buzzing with forced cheer. She kept her expression neutral, though her sharp eyes noted the insincerity in most of the smiles.

"Everyone, a toast!" Alexander announced, raising his glass with a practiced grin. "To Evelyn, our newly promoted attending physician!"

"Congratulations!"

"Cheers!"

The room erupted in polite applause, though only a handful of people seemed genuinely happy for her. The rest were merely there out of obligation—to Alexander, not to her.

Dylan, lounging in a shadowed corner, swirled his drink lazily. His lips curled into a smirk as he drawled, "Funny, isn't it? Evelyn gets the promotion, but you're the one throwing the party, Alexander. Makes you wonder who's really celebrating what."

A few uneasy glances flickered his way.

Alexander, however, remained unruffled. "Evelyn and I are close friends. Even Nathan knows that."

At the mention of his name, Nathan looked up. His expression was unreadable, but the tension in his shoulders betrayed his displeasure. Why had Alexander organized this? To an outsider, it might look like they were the couple, not Evelyn and him.

Not that it mattered, Nathan reminded himself. He didn’t care what Evelyn did. So why did the sight of Alexander standing so close to her make his blood boil?

###Chapter 217

A hushed murmur broke the silence. "I see," someone whispered.

Another voice piped up, "Dr. Hartley, you're so young and already an attending physician at Grandview General Hospital. That's truly remarkable!"

Dylan scoffed, leaning forward with a sneer. "Remarkable? Hardly. Winning some flashy virtual surgery competition doesn’t prove anything. It’s laughable that Sebastian promoted you over it, Evelyn. Has he lost his grip on reality? Simulations aren’t the same as real surgeries. Just because you aced a fake operation doesn’t mean you won’t crack under pressure in a real one."

He let the words linger before adding mockingly, "Sure, you passed the entrance exam. Congratulations. But the real test is in the OR. When you start botching real procedures, Sebastian will regret his impulsive decision."

Tension thickened in the air. No one rushed to Evelyn’s defense. Many silently agreed with Dylan—virtual surgeries, no matter how advanced, couldn’t replicate the stakes of real life.

Nathan watched from the sidelines, his expression unreadable. Even he couldn’t deny the challenges Evelyn would face.

But Evelyn remained unshaken. She met Dylan’s gaze with a cool, cutting smile. "Mr. Reeves, perhaps you should worry about your own affairs. If you have time to spare, remind your uncle Dominic to settle his debt soon."

Dylan’s face darkened instantly, fury flashing in his eyes. Because of Evelyn’s victory, Dominic had lost a fortune—his year-end bonus and a month’s salary. The thought alone made Dylan’s blood boil.

Dominic was even angrier, but there was nothing he could do.

Before the tension could escalate, Alexander smoothly intervened. "Alright, enough of this. Let’s lighten the mood. How about a game?"

"Truth or Dare!" someone suggested eagerly. "With new rules to make it interesting!"

The group quickly agreed, the atmosphere shifting as the game began.

At first, the dares were harmless—playful challenges like push-ups over someone lying on the floor or an impromptu dance performance. Laughter filled the room, and the mood stayed light.

But as the night wore on, the dares grew bolder. Kissing for a full minute. A striptease in front of everyone.

In one round, two men were dared to kiss. The unlucky participant immediately forfeited, downing three shots of whiskey instead while the group cheered.

"Who’s the King this round?" someone called out.

Theodore grinned, mischief in his eyes. "That would be me."

###Chapter 218

After a brief silence, he declared, "The person holding the five of hearts must princess-carry the one with the eight of hearts and perform twenty squats."

"That's... unexpectedly sweet!" someone squealed.

"Alright, who's got the five?" another asked.

"I do," Alexander Prescott replied smoothly, tossing his card onto the table with a lazy flick of his wrist.

The moment he spoke, Evelyn Hartley's voice cut through the chatter. "And I have the eight." She placed her card down with a faint, knowing smile.

Nathan Black, who had been lounging in detached silence, suddenly turned his head toward Evelyn. His gaze sharpened, a shadow flickering in his dark eyes for just a second.

"Damn," someone muttered under their breath.

The air thickened with tension. Everyone's eyes darted between Evelyn and Nathan, trying to decipher their reactions. It was just a game—a ridiculous, flirty dare. It wasn’t supposed to matter.

But then again, when had anything between those two ever been simple?

The awkwardness dissolved into laughter and playful taunts.

"Let’s see what you’ve got, Alex!"

"Twenty squats? You sure you can handle that?"

Alexander and Evelyn exchanged a brief, loaded glance before he smirked.

"You think I can’t?" He pushed to his feet, rolling his sleeves up his forearms. "Watch me."

Evelyn rose as well, her movements elegant but deliberate.

Nathan’s jaw tightened when he saw her compliance. Alexander not refusing was one thing, but Evelyn—why was she going along with this?

"Come here, Evie," Alexander teased, spreading his arms dramatically, earning a round of laughter.

Without hesitation, Evelyn stepped into his embrace, letting him scoop her up effortlessly. Alexander held her with practiced ease, his arms secure around her as he adjusted his grip. The sight of them together—her draped in his arms, his confident smirk—drew whistles and cheers.

"Start counting!" Alexander called.

"One!" the crowd chanted.

Nathan’s fingers curled into a fist.

This was unbearable.

Just as Alexander bent his knees for the first squat, Nathan’s rough voice sliced through the noise.

"I’ll drink for Evelyn. They don’t have to do this."

Silence.

Every head turned toward him. His expression was unreadable, but the tension in his shoulders was unmistakable. Without waiting for a response, Nathan grabbed three glasses of whiskey from the table and downed them one after another, the burn searing his throat. He slammed the last empty glass down with a sharp clink.

The room erupted into murmurs. No one had expected that.

Evelyn’s pulse stuttered. Confusion and something warmer—something dangerous—fluttered in her chest. Was Nathan… jealous?

Across the room, Serena Cole’s face darkened. She stared at Nathan, shock and hurt twisting her features. Did he really care that much about Evelyn?

###Chapter 219

Jealousy seared through Serena's veins like liquid fire. Her sharp gaze flicked toward Evelyn, eyes narrowing to slits. What spell had Evelyn cast on Nathan lately? What underhanded tactic had she used to bewitch him so completely?

"Nathan, I don’t think you can drink for her," Dylan's voice cut through the tension.

"That’s right—no substitutions!" Dylan’s reminder jolted Alexander’s memory, and he quickly chimed in.

As Alexander spoke, he shot Nathan a pointed look. But Nathan remained unreadable, his expression carved from ice. The corner of his mouth lifted slightly as he countered, "That rule was never established at the start."

Dylan faltered, at a loss for words. Alexander exhaled in defeat. "Fine, fine. You win this round. But from the next round onward, no one drinks for anyone else!"

With deliberate care, Nathan set Evelyn down. As Alexander retreated to his seat, he tossed Evelyn a playful wink. She caught it, pressing her lips together to suppress a smile.

The game resumed, each round escalating in audacity, filling the room with raucous laughter. Several dares left them breathless, clutching their sides as they gasped for air between fits of giggles.

Then, in one fateful round, Dylan drew the King card. Slapping it onto the table, he announced with a wicked grin, "The holder of the six of hearts must sit in the lap of the eight of hearts, wrap their arms around them, and... share a full-minute kiss. And yes—tongue is mandatory."

"Whoa!"

"Leave it to Dylan to raise the stakes!"

"Oh my God, this is going to be legendary!"

The room erupted in anticipation, everyone eager to see how this would unfold.

Evelyn sighed softly before placing her card on the table. "Looks like I’m the six of hearts."

"Mrs. Black strikes again," someone teased.

"So, who’s got the eight?"

The murmurs swelled with curiosity. After Nathan’s earlier interference, no one expected this dare to proceed. He had stopped Alexander from making Evelyn do squats—surely he wouldn’t allow someone else to kiss her now. Besides, who would dare with Nathan watching?

"I do."

A deep, velvety voice sliced through the chatter.

Every head turned in unison. Shock rippled through the crowd.

Nathan was holding the eight of hearts.

Evelyn’s tension dissolved instantly. Meanwhile, Serena’s face twisted in disbelief. This couldn’t be happening. Were Nathan and Evelyn really about to kiss—right here, in front of everyone?

Her nails dug into her palms as she stared at Nathan, waiting for him to refuse.

But Nathan’s expression betrayed nothing.

"Come on, Evelyn, don’t keep us waiting!" Natalie nudged her with a mischievous grin.

Evelyn’s eyes flashed with resolve. She wouldn’t back down—not with Serena watching. This was her husband, after all.

With effortless grace, she rose from the sofa and approached Nathan. Retreat was not an option.

###Chapter 220

The air was thick with tension as Evelyn waited for Nathan's response. She would respect his decision if he refused the dare. But as she stepped forward, standing inches away from him, Nathan remained silent.

He wasn't going to say no.

A thrill shot through Evelyn. Without hesitation, she closed the distance between them, settling onto his lap and looping her arms around his neck. Nathan's gaze locked onto hers, dark and unreadable, yet the rapid pulse at his throat betrayed him.

Evelyn leaned in, her lips just a breath away from his—

"Stop!" Serena's sharp voice sliced through the moment.

Evelyn's brows knit together as she turned to glare at the interruption.

"I'll drink for Nathan. He doesn't have to do this," Serena declared, her voice trembling with forced bravery.

Lila let out a derisive laugh. "Rules are rules. No substitutions."

Serena bit her lip, her eyes darting to Nathan in silent pleading. "But—but I—"

Evelyn cut her off with an icy smile. "Nathan drank for me earlier because he's my husband. That's his right. But you?" Her gaze raked over Serena with disdain. "What exactly are you to him?"

The question hung in the air like a blade. Serena paled, her fingers twisting together as she looked to Nathan for support. He merely glanced at her, his expression indifferent, before turning back to Evelyn.

A smirk curled Evelyn's lips. She reached up, cupping Nathan's face, and pulled him toward her. Their lips met—soft at first, then firmer.

Nathan stiffened momentarily, his eyes widening in surprise before they darkened with something deeper. Evelyn's heart hammered, but she refused to falter, keeping the kiss deliberate, controlled.

"Hold on!" Natalie's voice broke through. "That doesn't count!"

Evelyn pulled back just enough to shoot her a glare.

Natalie crossed her arms. "One arm around his neck, Evelyn. And it's supposed to be a full minute—with tongue."

Evelyn exhaled sharply but obeyed, tightening her grip around Nathan. This time, when she kissed him, she didn't hold back. Her tongue teased at the seam of his lips, and just as she hesitated—

Nathan responded.

His hand slid to the back of her neck, pulling her closer as his mouth moved against hers with slow, deliberate intent. The kiss deepened, his tongue tangling with hers in a way that sent sparks down her spine.

Evelyn froze, her breath catching. His touch was unexpectedly possessive, his movements calculated to unravel her. The room seemed to fade away, the only sound the rapid beat of her own pulse.

Lost in the moment, she nipped lightly at his lower lip, earning a low hum from him.

Across the room, Serena's fists clenched, her nails biting into her palms. Jealousy burned through her like wildfire. She wanted to rip Evelyn away, to scream, to do something—but she had no right.

Dylan, meanwhile, scowled. His carefully planned game had spiraled out of control, and he didn't like it one bit.

###Chapter 221

"Time's up! That's enough!" Nathan's voice cut through the charged atmosphere, sharper than intended.

No one had been keeping track, but his words snapped everyone back to reality. The room buzzed with sudden awareness—they were still playing a game. Yet, in those stolen seconds when Evelyn and Nathan had been lost in each other, it hadn’t felt like a game at all.

The moment their lips met, the world had dissolved into silence, leaving only the two of them suspended in a breathless, intimate bubble. No one dared interrupt.

When Evelyn finally pulled away, her breath was uneven, her cheeks flushed a delicate pink. The lingering warmth of the kiss spread through her like sunlight.

Nathan’s gaze darkened as he studied her, his jaw tightening almost imperceptibly. The sight of her—lips slightly parted, lashes fluttering—sent an undeniable heat coursing through him.

Evelyn rose gracefully from his lap and returned to her seat, but Natalie was already leaning in, eyes sparkling with mischief. "So," she whispered, nudging Evelyn’s arm, "how was it?"

Evelyn feigned indifference, though her pulse betrayed her. "It was just a game. Nothing special."

Natalie smirked. "Oh, really? Then why are you blushing?"

Evelyn stiffened, the heat in her cheeks intensifying. "I’m not blushing. It’s just warm in here."

Natalie nodded solemnly, her tone dripping with exaggerated sympathy. "Of course. So warm. Maybe we should turn the air conditioning on."

Evelyn shot her a glare. "You’re impossible."

Natalie’s laughter filled the space between them.

After a few more rounds, Alexander finally called an end to the night. "Stay if you want—drinks are on me," he offered generously.

Evelyn and her friends decided to leave. The car ride home was thick with unspoken tension. Neither she nor Nathan spoke, the silence between them humming with something electric.

Only when they were alone in their room did Evelyn finally break it.

"Nathan," she began hesitantly, meeting his gaze. "Earlier, when Alexander had to hold me for those squats… why did you drink for me instead?"

Nathan stilled. The memory of Alexander’s hands on Evelyn flashed in his mind, igniting a flicker of irritation. His voice was low when he finally answered.

"I wouldn’t let another man put his hands on my wife in front of everyone."

Evelyn blinked. "Is that the only reason?" Her voice was soft, searching.

Nathan held her gaze, his expression unreadable. "What other reason would there be?"

Evelyn’s lashes lowered briefly before she looked back at him, studying him intently.

###Chapter 222

"Perhaps..." she hesitated, her voice barely above a whisper. "You didn't like seeing another man touch me. Maybe..." A nervous tremor laced her words, though she hadn’t fully realized it yet. "Maybe you were jealous."

Nathan’s dark eyes flickered, his Adam’s apple bobbing as he swallowed hard. For a split second, his usual composure cracked.

Then, with a smirk that didn’t quite reach his eyes, he straightened his shoulders and scoffed, "You flatter yourself, Evelyn. Why would I ever be jealous over you?"

Without giving her a chance to reply, he turned sharply and strode into the bathroom, his footsteps clipped and purposeful.

Evelyn watched him go, a slow, knowing smile curving her lips.

In the past, whenever she’d teased Nathan about jealousy, he’d always laughed it off with that infuriatingly arrogant smirk. But this time...

His reaction had been different. Defensive. Almost flustered. The way he’d walked away—too fast, too stiff—like he couldn’t get away from her fast enough.

Standing there, the ghost of a smile still playing on her lips, a thrilling possibility took root in Evelyn’s mind. Was Nathan hiding something? Could it be that, for once, she was right?

The thought made her grin widen, warmth blooming in her chest.

Neither of them spoke another word that night. Later, after a long, soothing shower, Evelyn slipped into bed and let sleep claim her.

The next morning, she woke feeling refreshed, ready to face whatever the day brought.

At Grandview General Hospital, Cardiac Surgery Department, Chief Physician’s Office

Dominic Pierce leaned forward, his sharp gaze fixed on the determined woman standing before him.

"Lila," he said slowly, "are you absolutely sure about this?"

Lila Sinclair lifted her chin. "Yes, Dr. Pierce. My decision is final."

Dominic exhaled, leaning back in his chair. His fingers tapped against the armrest as he considered her. After a long pause, he finally nodded. "Fine. If this is what you want, I won’t stop you. I’ll teach you everything I can. In a few years, when this mess blows over, I’ll personally speak to Mr. Vaughn about securing you a permanent position."

His emotions were conflicted. On one hand, he resented Lila. Her loss in the recent competition had cost him dearly—both financially and professionally. Her mistake had handed an advantage to Evelyn, and part of him couldn’t help but blame her.

On the other hand, guilt gnawed at him. He’d been the one to push Lila into that reckless bet with Sebastian, ignoring her doubts. Now, because of it, she was stuck as an intern, her reputation in tatters.

But in Dominic’s mind, the real villains were Sebastian and Evelyn. Evelyn had aced the hospital entrance exam with a perfect score—why hadn’t she revealed that sooner? And why hadn’t Sebastian mentioned it? If he’d known, he never would’ve agreed to the bet.

Conveniently, Dominic chose to forget the inconvenient truths—that Sebastian’s assistant had mentioned Evelyn’s perfect score when she first joined, and it was Dominic who had dismissed it as a lie. It was also Dominic who had rallied the staff to accuse Sebastian of favoritism and demand the competition in the first place.

But selfish men rarely saw their own faults.

Lila gave a stiff nod. "Thank you, Dr. Pierce."

###Chapter 223

Dominic Pierce rose from his chair, his voice crisp. "Let's go to the main office. The morning meeting starts soon."

Evelyn Hartley followed him without a word.

The conference room buzzed with quiet murmurs as Dominic announced Evelyn's decision to stay at Grand Hills General Hospital. No one batted an eye—everyone had already pieced together how things would unfold.

Once dismissed, the team scattered to begin their rounds.

Evelyn completed hers swiftly and returned to her office, sinking into her chair. She pulled up a research article on her screen, fingers flying across the keyboard—until her phone shattered the silence.

A glance at the caller ID made her breath hitch. After a beat, she answered.

"Evelyn, do you have a moment? I'm in the hospital garden. Could you meet me?" Grace Monroe's voice was soft but insistent.

Evelyn exhaled. "I'll be right there."

She found Grace beneath a sprawling oak, its leaves casting dappled shadows over her troubled expression.

"Mom," Evelyn greeted.

Grace turned, frustration lacing her tone. "Did you even read my message yesterday?"

"I did," Evelyn admitted. "But I was occupied."

A pause. Then Evelyn's gaze sharpened. "Is this about Lila?"

Grace sighed. "It is. Explain to me why you went back on your word."

Evelyn's composure didn't waver. "I didn't. I agreed to let Lila have her chance—not to hand her victory." A faint smirk curled her lips. "When she lost the competition and faced expulsion, I intervened. Now she's staying, just as she wanted. Isn't that what I promised?"

Grace faltered. Was Evelyn twisting words, or had she misunderstood all along? She'd assumed Evelyn would concede—that Lila would win after their conversation. Reality had proven her wrong.

Evelyn studied her mother's conflicted face. "Are you angry with me?"

Grace met her gaze. Silence stretched between them before she finally spoke. "Not angry. Just afraid. Afraid Diana will blame you for this."

Evelyn's voice was steel wrapped in velvet. "I don't care what others think. My conscience is clear."

Grace exhaled, shoulders slumping. Arguing was pointless. Then, as if struck by irony, she chuckled. "Well, it's done."

Her smile was bittersweet. "You won. No use dwelling on it. So—congratulations, Evelyn. You played it well."

###Chapter 224

Evelyn smiled softly. "Thank you, Mom."

The air between them lightened as they talked a little longer. Eventually, Grace left, leaving Evelyn alone with her thoughts. Walking back to her office, Evelyn exhaled in quiet relief. She had braced herself for Grace’s anger, but her mother’s unexpected calm had caught her off guard. Knowing Grace wasn’t upset with her lifted a weight off her shoulders.

Settling back at her desk, Evelyn refocused on her work, her mind finally at ease.

Meanwhile, Nathan was swamped with an unusually hectic day. By evening, he still hadn’t made it home for dinner. Just as he was about to shut down his computer and call it a night, his phone buzzed. The name flashing on the screen gave him pause—Dylan.

“Nathan,” Dylan’s voice came through, steady but edged with concern. “Serena and I are at the Velvet Lounge. Can you come?”

Nathan’s first instinct was to refuse. But before he could respond, Dylan continued, “Serena’s in a bad state. She’s been drinking nonstop since last night. Nothing I say gets through to her. She’s drowning herself in alcohol, and I’m worried she might spiral.”

Nathan’s grip tightened around his phone. Dylan hesitated before adding, “I think she’s on the verge of a breakdown.”

The words sent a jolt through Nathan. His tone turned sharp. “I’ll be there in ten.” Hanging up, he grabbed his keys and headed straight for the Velvet Lounge.

When he pushed open the door to the private booth, he found Dylan wrestling a whiskey glass from Serena’s grasp. “Serena, enough,” Dylan said firmly. “You’re going to make yourself sick.”

The sound of the door drew Dylan’s attention. Relief washed over his face when he spotted Nathan. “Thank God you’re here,” he muttered.

At the sound of Nathan’s name, Serena froze. Slowly, she turned to look at him, her eyes shimmering with a storm of emotions.

Nathan crossed the room and sat beside her, his voice low. “Serena, is this really how you want to handle things?”

The moment their eyes met, hers welled up. She bit her lip, her voice trembling. “Nathan,” she whispered, “why did you kiss Evelyn during the game last night? Why didn’t you stop her?”

Nathan went still. Why hadn’t he refused Evelyn? The truth was, he wasn’t sure. Maybe he hadn’t wanted to humiliate her in front of everyone. Maybe, with Alexander watching, he’d played along to send a message. Or maybe—just maybe—some part of him hadn’t wanted to refuse her at all.

The uncertainty kept him silent.

To Serena, that silence was a knife twisting in her chest. Her voice cracked. “Nathan… does this mean you have feelings for her now?”

Nathan met her gaze, his expression unreadable. He took a long moment before answering softly, “No.”

But Serena didn’t feel relief. If anything, her heart sank deeper. Because that hesitation—that pause—told her everything she needed to know.

###Chapter 225

In the past, whenever Serena asked Nathan such a question, he would answer without hesitation, his voice firm and unwavering. But tonight, the silence stretched between them, thick and suffocating. His hesitation was answer enough. Even if he hadn’t fallen for Evelyn yet, Serena knew—something had shifted. Evelyn was no longer just another woman in Nathan’s eyes. And that realization tore through her like a blade.

She wasn’t the only one who noticed. Dylan’s jaw tightened, his dark eyes flickering with something unreadable, though he remained silent.

Serena didn’t press further. She was too afraid of the answer—too afraid of the words that might shatter what little remained of her heart. Instead, she reached for the bottle of whiskey on the table, pouring herself another glass. Maybe if she drank enough, the pain would dull. Maybe she wouldn’t feel anything at all.

"Stop, Serena," Nathan commanded, his voice rough with frustration.

She only smiled bitterly, lifting the glass to her lips. "Let me have this, Nathan. If I’m drunk, I won’t have to think. I won’t have to feel."

Nathan’s fists clenched at his sides, but he didn’t argue. The air between them grew heavier, suffocating. Serena kept drinking, her hands trembling with every pour. She didn’t stop until the world blurred around her.

Dylan, watching her with growing alarm, finally snapped. "Nathan, do something! She’s going to kill herself at this rate!"

Nathan moved toward her, but before he could take the glass from her hand, Serena doubled over, retching violently. Then, with a shuddering gasp, she collapsed onto the sofa, unconscious.

"Serena!" Both men lunged forward.

"What the hell happened? Is she okay?" Dylan demanded, panic lacing his voice.

Nathan’s expression darkened as he scooped her into his arms. "Hospital. Now."

Without another word, he carried her out, Dylan hot on his heels, his face etched with worry.

At Silvercrest General Hospital…

After the examination, the doctor approached them with a grim expression.

"Alcohol poisoning," he said. "We’ve induced vomiting, but her condition is still unstable. She’ll need to stay overnight for observation. If there are no complications, she can leave tomorrow."

The words settled like a weight between them. Nathan and Dylan exchanged a tense glance.

"Thank you, Doctor," Dylan muttered.

The doctor nodded and left, leaving them in the sterile, suffocating silence of the hospital hallway.

Moments later, Serena was wheeled into a private room. Dylan stood by her bedside, staring at her pale, fragile form beneath the harsh fluorescent lights. His fists clenched at his sides, guilt and frustration warring inside him.

Finally, he turned to Nathan, his voice low and grave.

"There’s something you should know."

Nathan’s gaze sharpened. "What?"

Dylan exhaled sharply. "Earlier today… one of the maids found fresh cuts on Serena’s thighs. Knife wounds."

###Chapter 226

Nathan's expression darkened instantly at Dylan's words. His gaze shifted to Serena, lying motionless on the hospital bed, her fragile form barely visible beneath the stark white sheets. Dylan's voice was thick with exhaustion as he continued, "She's relapsed, Nathan. After all this time, I thought she had overcome it—that her depression was finally under control. But I was wrong..."

Nathan's jaw tightened, his fingers curling into fists at his sides.

Dylan's tone sharpened. "Nathan, you've been pulling away from her. You know how perceptive she is. She notices every slight change in your behavior, every moment of hesitation. And lately, you've been..." He trailed off, then exhaled sharply. "You've been focusing too much on Evelyn. Whether you realize it or not, you're tearing Serena apart. How do you expect her to handle that?"

Stepping closer, Dylan's frustration was palpable. "All Serena has ever wanted is to be with you—to be your wife. She's waited years for your divorce, for you to finally choose her. But what has she gotten? A version of you who's drifting further away, who's suddenly preoccupied with someone else. How could she not break?" Dylan's voice dropped to a near whisper. "So I need to ask you directly—are you still planning to divorce Evelyn? Will you marry Serena afterward?"

The question hung heavily between them, but Nathan remained silent, his brows drawn together in deep contemplation.

After a long pause, Nathan finally spoke, his voice low and controlled. "Go home, Dylan. I'll stay with Serena tonight."

Dylan's chest constricted at Nathan's evasion. A flicker of unease and anger burned in his gut. Had Nathan truly developed feelings for Evelyn?

Clenching his fists, Dylan forced himself to stay composed. He wasn't sure if his anger was for Serena's sake or his own. Knowing he wouldn't get a straight answer, he exhaled sharply and turned to leave.

But after a few steps, he stopped and glanced back. His eyes locked onto Nathan's, his voice laced with warning. "You made a promise to Serena. Don't forget that. She's sacrificed too much, waited too long. If you break her heart..." He swallowed hard. "I don't know if she'll survive it."

Without waiting for a response, Dylan strode out of the room.

The silence that followed was suffocating. Nathan stood still for a long moment, staring at the closed door. Then, slowly, he approached Serena's bedside and sat down. Her face was pale, her breathing shallow. He felt concern for her—the kind one might feel for a dear friend—but nothing more.

Dylan's words echoed in his mind. Serena's relapse, her pain, her years of devotion—it all pressed down on him. He had given her his word, and he intended to keep it.

Yet, beneath the surface, an unsettling truth gnawed at him. His thoughts had been straying toward Evelyn more often than they should. She had begun to occupy his mind in ways that unsettled him.

This had to stop. His divorce from Evelyn was inevitable, and afterward, he would marry Serena. Starting now, he resolved to put distance between himself and Evelyn. He couldn't let her disrupt his focus any longer.

Just then, his phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen, his sharp eyes narrowing at the caller ID.

Evelyn.

After a brief hesitation, he answered. "Yes?"

"Nathan, it's late. Are you still at work?" Evelyn's voice, soft yet steady, carried through the phone.

The sound of it sent an unexpected ripple through him.

He exhaled slowly.

This was going to be harder than he thought.

###Chapter 227

The moment the words reached Nathan's ears, his expression darkened. His voice was icy as he retorted, "Do I need to report my every move to you?"

Evelyn felt a sharp pang in her chest, her throat tightening. Before she could respond, Nathan added coldly, "There's nothing left to say." Then, the line went dead.

Evelyn stared at her phone, the screen now black. A storm of questions swirled in her mind. What had caused this sudden shift in Nathan? Had she done something wrong? It made no sense. If he didn’t want to come home, fine. He could stay away for good.

Frustrated, she silenced her phone, tossed it onto the nightstand, and turned off the lamp. But sleep refused to come. She tossed and turned for what felt like hours, her mind restless. By 3 AM, Nathan still hadn’t returned. She bit her lip, resisting the urge to call him again, and forced herself to close her eyes.

Eventually, exhaustion pulled her under, though she wasn’t sure when. When her alarm blared the next morning, her gaze immediately flicked to the untouched bed across the room. He hadn’t come home—or at least, not to their room. A fresh wave of irritation surged through her as she took a deep breath.

Without wasting another second, Evelyn freshened up and left for the hospital.

In the VIP ward of Grand Pines General Hospital, Serena Cole stirred awake, her eyes fluttering open. Surprise flickered across her face when she spotted Nathan asleep on the sofa, but it quickly melted into delight.

"Nathan," she murmured softly.

He stirred, instantly alert, and moved to sit beside her bed. His voice was rough with sleep as he asked, "How are you feeling? Any discomfort?"

"No, I'm fine," Serena replied, shaking her head gently.

Nathan nodded, his tone steady. "Stay one more night for observation. If all goes well, you can leave tomorrow."

"Okay," she whispered, her gaze lingering on him. After a beat, she sighed softly. "It would be perfect to wake up to your face every morning."

Nathan remained silent, his expression unreadable.

After a pause, Serena spoke again. "Nathan… were you here all night?"

Instead of answering, his voice turned firm. "Don’t drink like that again."

Serena lowered her eyes, absorbing his quiet but stern warning.

Nathan watched her closely before adding, his voice softer but no less serious, "I made you a promise. I intend to keep it."

The weight of his words settled between them, heavy with unspoken meaning.

Serena’s face lit up instantly, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears. "Nathan, hearing you say that makes everything worth it," she breathed, her voice thick with emotion.

But beneath her joy, Nathan felt an invisible pressure constricting his chest.

"I have to go," he said abruptly, standing and avoiding her gaze. "Get some rest."

"Alright," Serena murmured. "But you should rest too."

###Chapter 228

Nathan turned on his heel and strode out of the room without a backward glance.

Serena watched him leave, a victorious smirk curling her lips. Despite Evelyn's attempts to win Nathan's affection, Serena was certain her own carefully crafted strategies would bring him back to her.

At the Cardiac Surgery Department of Grand Ins General Hospital, an unexpected visitor arrived just before lunch.

Evelyn studied the man standing before her with thinly veiled impatience. "Mr. Reeves," she said coolly, "what do you want?"

Dylan, momentarily entranced by the sight of Evelyn's striking features, felt his pulse quicken. "How about lunch, Evelyn?" he suggested smoothly.

She scoffed. "Unnecessary. Just say what you came to say." Their relationship wasn't close enough for casual meals—she had only dined with him once before to extract information.

Unfazed, Dylan arched a brow. "Ah, I see. Now that you have the Caldwell family's backing, I suppose you're above such invitations."

Evelyn's patience frayed. "Is there a point to this, or are you just wasting my time?"

His smirk faltered at her sharp tone. "At that party," he began, voice laced with mockery, "when Nathan stepped in and kissed you, you must have been thrilled, right?"

Evelyn met his gaze evenly, refusing to rise to the bait.

After a deliberate pause, Dylan continued, "Well, the next day, Nathan made it clear to Serena. He only intervened because it would reflect poorly on him if his wife was seen getting too cozy with another man. That kiss? Just to save you from embarrassment. Don’t read too much into it."

Evelyn's voice was ice. "Why would you care how I interpret it? It’s none of your concern."

Dylan’s expression darkened. "Nathan didn’t come home last night, did he?" He leaned in slightly. "Do you know where he was? Or who he was with?"

Evelyn’s fingers twitched, but she held her silence.

Dylan’s lips curled. "He spent the night with Serena. She wasn’t feeling well."

A flicker of something—hurt, anger—crossed Evelyn’s face before she schooled her features. Her knuckles whitened as she clenched her fists. So, Nathan hadn’t returned because he’d been comforting Serena. The game night must have shaken her enough to summon him.

The realization left a bitter taste in Evelyn’s mouth. She almost laughed at her own foolishness. She didn’t doubt Dylan’s words—verifying them with Nathan would be easy.

As the color drained from Evelyn’s face, Dylan felt a twisted satisfaction, though it was tinged with an odd discomfort.

He exhaled sharply. "That kiss meant nothing, Evelyn. Serena has always been the one Nathan loves."

Evelyn’s gaze snapped up, sharp as a blade. "I’m well aware of Nathan’s feelings for Serena. You don’t need to defend her—it only makes her seem desperate."

Dylan’s brows furrowed. "Desperate? That’s ridiculous! What reason does Serena have to feel insecure?"

###Chapter 229

What game is Dylan really playing? And why does Evelyn’s indifference unsettle him more than her anger?

Meanwhile, Nathan’s absence speaks louder than words—but whose side is he truly on?

The battle lines are drawn, but the war is far from over...
Here's the rewritten version with all the requested changes while maintaining the original story structure and character dynamics:
Evelyn arched an eyebrow with deliberate nonchalance. "Could it be because Nathan has been paying me unusual attention lately, making Serena feel threatened? That's the real reason you're here, isn't it, Dylan? If Serena were truly confident in her relationship with Nathan, why would she need to constantly parade their love before me?" She crossed her arms, her voice turning icy. "After Leonard's birthday celebration, Nathan and I will dissolve our marriage. He'll marry her then. That's always been the plan, correct?"

Dylan recoiled as if struck, his mouth opening and closing like a fish out of water. After an awkward beat, he recovered with a sneer. "She's merely ensuring you don't misinterpret Nathan's recent... kindness. What if when the time comes, you suddenly change your mind? Use Leonard as leverage to trap him?"

A bitter laugh escaped Evelyn's lips. "That's between Nathan and myself, Mr. Reeves. Not your concern." Her emerald eyes flashed with warning. "Unless there's something else? No? Then I believe we're done here." Without granting him a chance to respond, she brushed past him, her heels clicking sharply against the marble floor.

Watching her retreating figure, Dylan clenched his fists, irritation bubbling beneath his polished exterior. The message had been delivered - there was nothing more to say.

Though Evelyn maintained perfect composure, Dylan's words had struck deeper than she'd ever admit. At lunch, sleep eluded her despite exhaustion weighing heavy on her limbs. When her alarm finally chimed, relief washed over her - the afternoon's relentless workload would provide welcome distraction.

By day's end, Evelyn collapsed into her office chair, muscles protesting. Returning to the Black estate, she noted Nathan's continued absence. It wasn't until the grandfather clock struck ten that she heard the front door groan open.

Rising from the sofa, Evelyn approached cautiously. "Nathan, are you free tomorrow?"

He barely glanced her way, removing his cufflinks with practiced indifference. Earlier, Eleanor had finally confirmed her visit to Owathe after repeated delays. The call had sparked rare excitement in Evelyn's chest.

"My grandmother's coming to town," she continued, forcing lightness into her tone. "I thought perhaps we could-"

"I don't have time for family gatherings." Nathan's interruption came like a guillotine's drop. His glacial gaze pinned her in place. "Nor will I attend any future ones." A cruel smirk twisted his lips as he added, "My presence at the last was purely to appease my father."

Evelyn's breath hitched, the unfinished sentence dying on her lips. His rejection landed like a physical blow, each word a fresh laceration. She'd assured Eleanor he'd come - had actually believed it herself. What a fool she'd been.

Humiliation burned through her veins, but she schooled her features into careful neutrality. After a measured pause, she inclined her head. "Understood, Mr. Black. It won't happen again."

###Chapter 230

With those words, she turned back to the couch and resumed reviewing her documents, her fingers tracing the lines of text with practiced ease.

Nathan watched her composed figure, his jaw tightening with unspoken frustration.

Even though he had been the one to reject Evelyn, an unsettling discomfort lingered in his chest, refusing to fade.

He reminded himself—again—that he had made the right choice.

Their divorce was inevitable. There was no reason to let their connection deepen any further.

Besides, he had already let her affect him far more than he should have these past few weeks.

Determined to regain control, Nathan strode into the bathroom, splashing icy water onto his face. The cold shock helped, if only a little.

Meanwhile, Evelyn sat alone, her long lashes casting delicate shadows as she stared blankly at the papers in her lap.

A wry smile curved her lips.

How foolish she had been.

She had actually invited Nathan to join her and Eleanor for dinner.

Were they even that close?

Their marriage was nothing more than a facade.

She shouldn’t have asked if he was free tomorrow.

Still, she knew Eleanor would be disappointed when she realized Nathan wouldn’t be coming.

That night, sleep eluded both of them.

The next morning, Evelyn took the day off.

When she arrived at Eleanor’s residence, her spirits lifted instantly at the sight of her grandmother.

Her face brightened, and she rushed forward without hesitation.

"Grandma!" she called, throwing her arms around the older woman.

"Easy there, darling," Eleanor laughed, gently patting Evelyn’s back.

"I missed you so much," Evelyn murmured, clinging like a child.

Eleanor’s warm smile melted the last of Evelyn’s lingering sadness.

At that moment, nothing else mattered.

"I missed you too, my dear," Eleanor said softly.

From the side, Grace sighed with amusement. "Alright, Evelyn, you’re not a little girl anymore. Let go of your grandmother before you suffocate her. She and Isabelle must be starving by now. Let’s eat."

Reluctantly, Evelyn pulled away and turned to the young woman standing beside Eleanor.

"Isabelle," she greeted warmly.

"Evelyn," Isabelle replied with a gentle smile. "You’re even lovelier in person."

Evelyn returned the smile but said nothing.

She and Isabelle went way back. Years ago, Isabelle had been her neighbor—a quiet girl whose parents’ constant fights often left her wandering the streets, searching for scraps of food.

Moved by pity, Eleanor had invited Isabelle to eat with them.

And when tragedy claimed Isabelle’s parents, Eleanor had taken her in without hesitation.

###Chapter 231

After exchanging warm greetings, Evelyn Hartley drove the group to The Crimson Spoon.

Once settled in a private dining room, Eleanor Sinclair glanced around expectantly. "Evelyn, where's Nathan?"

Evelyn hesitated, a flicker of discomfort crossing her features before she forced a bright smile. "He's buried under work and couldn't make it this time." She kept her tone casual. "Running a corporation isn't easy, you know."

Eleanor nodded, her expression understanding, though the faint shadow of disappointment didn't escape Evelyn's notice.

Sensing it, Evelyn leaned in playfully. "What's this? Are you upset because Nathan didn't come? Do you like him more than me now, Grandma? I'm wounded."

Eleanor's lips curved into a smile, and she gave Evelyn an indulgent look. "Since when did you become so childish? You're far too old for this."

"I'll never be too old to be your favorite!" Evelyn retorted with a mock pout.

Eleanor chuckled, shaking her head. "Alright, alright."

"You will always be my favorite."

"That's more like it," Evelyn said, grinning.

She noted with satisfaction that the disappointment had vanished from Eleanor's face. The topic of Nathan was dropped, and they moved on to enjoy their meal, the room soon filled with lively chatter.

Meanwhile, at Blackstone Industries, Nathan's phone buzzed.

He glanced at the screen—Dylan Reeves. With a sigh, he answered.

"Nathan," Dylan's voice came through, strained. "I need a favor. Take Serena out to dinner. Now."

Nathan's brows furrowed, irritation flashing in his eyes.

Dylan exhaled heavily. "Serena hasn't eaten properly in days. She picks at her food, barely managing a few bites. If this continues, she'll collapse. Her therapist says her condition is deteriorating. We have to intervene. If you sit with her, she’ll eat. Otherwise, her health—both physical and mental—is at risk."

Nathan’s expression darkened, a storm of frustration and reluctant obligation brewing within him. He couldn’t deny his role in this mess. Serena’s spiral into depression years ago had been partly his fault, and now, with her relapse, the guilt was a noose around his neck.

Refusing wasn’t an option. And that knowledge only soured his mood further.

"Fine. I’ll handle it," Nathan bit out before ending the call abruptly.

For a long moment, he sat in silence, the weight of obligation pressing down on him. Then, with a sharp exhale, he dialed Serena’s number.

Hearing Nathan’s invitation, Serena barely contained her triumph. The moment the call ended, a smug smile curled her lips. Dylan’s plan had worked flawlessly. As always, the mention of her "worsening condition" had yanked Nathan’s guilt strings. It was a card they played often—one that never failed.

Nathan and Serena sat across from each other in an elegant, dimly lit restaurant. Serena, though inwardly elated, maintained a carefully crafted facade of listlessness, pushing food around her plate. Across from her, Nathan barely touched his meal, his expression unreadable.

###Chapter 232

"Nathan," Serena murmured, her voice laced with concern as she studied his tense profile. "Is everything alright?"

Nathan's expression remained unreadable, his tone clipped. "I'm fine. Just eat."

Serena hesitated, her fingers tightening around her fork. "If you're swamped with work, you don't have to force yourself to dine with me. I can manage on my own." Her cautious gaze flickered over him, as if afraid her words might provoke irritation.

A muscle twitched in Nathan's jaw. He knew he shouldn’t let his foul mood ruin the evening—especially since he had been the one to invite her. With effort, he softened his tone. "It's nothing. Eat."

Serena nodded, offering a tentative smile. "Alright. You should eat too." She picked up a piece of honey-glazed pork rib and placed it on his plate.

Nathan stared at it, his mind drifting to memories he had tried to suppress.

Honey-glazed ribs.

Evelyn’s favorite.

The first time they had dined here, she had devoured nearly the entire plate, leaving him with only one piece. The thought of her now sent a sharp pang through his chest. Where was she? What was she doing?

By the time the meal ended, the rib remained untouched. Nathan stood abruptly, striding toward the door of the private dining room. Just as he pushed it open, the door across the hallway swung open as well.

"Grandmother, isn’t the food here incredible? I knew you’d love it."

That voice—sweet, melodic, achingly familiar—sent Nathan’s pulse spiking. His entire body stilled as he turned toward the sound.

Evelyn stepped into the hallway, her arm linked with an elderly woman’s. She finished speaking and glanced up—only to freeze when her eyes locked with Nathan’s.

Time seemed to stop.

Her breath hitched.

Of all the people she could have run into, she hadn’t expected him.

Before she could react, another voice—light, cheerful—cut through the silence. "Nathan, the lobster was divine. We should come here more often."

Serena emerged from behind him, her smile bright.

The air between them turned brittle.

Evelyn’s gaze flickered from Nathan to Serena, her mind scrambling for composure. Her lips parted, but no words came. Instead, a cold weight settled in her chest, draining the color from her face.

Nathan had told her he was too busy—too busy to meet her family, too busy for her.

Yet here he was, dining with Serena.

The realization struck like a blade.

Perhaps it wasn’t about who he was with—but who he wasn’t choosing to be with.

A bitter laugh threatened to escape her throat, but she swallowed it down.

Nathan’s chest tightened as he took in Evelyn’s pallid expression.

###Chapter 233

A storm of emotions raged inside him.

The air grew thick with tension as Eleanor, Grace, and Isabelle, standing protectively beside Evelyn, turned their piercing gazes toward Nathan and Serena.

Isabelle was the first to break the suffocating silence, her voice trembling slightly. "Nathan? Wait... Evelyn, didn't you say he was occupied? Too busy with work to join us for dinner?"

Her words trailed off, swallowed by the heavy quiet that followed.

Nathan's eyes flickered to Eleanor, who stood rigid beside Evelyn.

For the first time in his life, panic clawed at his chest.

Now he understood—Evelyn had invited him yesterday because her grandmother was in town.

Damn it.

He hadn’t known.

If he had, he would never have refused her.

He knew how much Eleanor meant to Evelyn.

But he...

He had coldly dismissed her invitation.

Regret burned like fire in his veins.

Evelyn bit her lip, her expression frozen in quiet humiliation.

At that moment, she wished the ground would swallow her whole.

Her mind spun, cursing the cruel twist of fate.

Of all places, why did Nathan have to bring Serena here?

Eleanor’s face darkened as her sharp eyes flicked between Nathan and Serena.

But her first concern was Evelyn.

Before anyone could speak, Serena stepped forward, her lips curving into a practiced, apologetic smile.

Her tone was deceptively light as she said, "My apologies, Mrs. Sinclair. I had no idea Nathan had prior commitments. Had I known, I wouldn’t have insisted on dining with him today."

Evelyn felt the words like a slap.

Her cheeks flushed hot, even as her face paled.

Nathan opened his mouth, urgency sharpening his voice. "Eleanor—"

But Eleanor cut him off with an icy glare. "Evelyn, it’s clear where his priorities lie. Let’s not waste another second of his precious time."

She gripped Evelyn’s hand firmly. "Come. We’re leaving."

Without hesitation, Evelyn followed, refusing to glance back at Nathan.

Grace and Isabelle offered him curt nods before trailing after them.

###Chapter 234
The moment they left, the hallway plunged into an eerie silence.

Nathan stood motionless for a heartbeat before turning to face Serena, his gaze as sharp as shattered glass.

Serena’s breath caught in her throat, a sudden wave of panic prickling her skin like icy needles.

Never before had Nathan looked at her with such frigid intensity!

Her voice trembled as she rushed to explain, "Nathan, I—I only wanted to clarify things earlier. I thought it would help if Mrs. Grant knew I was the one who invited you to dinner this time, not the other way around."

But Nathan’s expression only darkened, his displeasure radiating like a storm cloud.

To him, who had extended the invitation was irrelevant.

With a voice like winter frost, he said, "I have work to attend to. I’m leaving." Without another word, he turned and strode away.

"Nathan—" Serena called after him, but he didn’t so much as glance back.

Her fingers curled into fists at her sides as she watched his retreating figure.

After a moment, her lips pressed together—then twisted into a faint, satisfied smirk.

The fact that Evelyn had witnessed everything was enough to send a dark thrill through her.

The drive back to Sterling Manor was thick with tension.

Evelyn sat rigid behind the wheel, her knuckles bone-white against the leather steering wheel.

Her mind was a whirlwind of thoughts.

Originally, she had purchased a separate estate for Eleanor in Oakridge, but Grace had insisted her mother stay with them at Sterling Manor.

Isabelle, seated in the back, hesitated before finally breaking the silence. "Evelyn… that woman with Nathan earlier. She’s his ex, isn’t she?"

Evelyn’s grip tightened briefly before she forced herself to relax.

After a pause, she answered softly, "Yes."

Isabelle bit her lip. "What’s their relationship like now—?"

Before the question could linger, Eleanor smoothly interjected, "Evelyn, that restaurant truly had exceptional cuisine. You must take me there again."

Evelyn glanced at her grandmother, gratitude flickering in her eyes.

She smiled. "Of course. Whenever you’d like."

Isabelle recognized the deliberate diversion but chose not to press further.

The remainder of the drive passed with light chatter, carefully skirting any mention of Nathan or Serena.

Upon arriving at Sterling Manor, Eleanor waited until she and Evelyn were alone in her suite before speaking.

Her expression was grave. "Evelyn. What’s really going on between you and Nathan?"

Evelyn’s lips parted, then closed.

Should she deflect? Or—

###Chapter 235

The weight of the day's events pressed heavily on Evelyn's shoulders. There was no use hiding the truth any longer. "Grandmother..." she began, her voice steady yet laced with resignation. "I wasn't honest with you before. Nathan and I... We made a decision months ago. After his father's birthday this year, we're filing for divorce."

Eleanor's expression shifted, a quiet sorrow replacing her usual warmth. She sank onto the edge of the bed with a sigh, her hands clasped tightly in her lap.

Evelyn hurried to reassure her. "Please don't be upset."

But Eleanor shook her head, her voice soft but firm. "I'm not upset, my dear. I'm heartbroken for you. I've always known how you felt about Nathan, no matter how hard you tried to pretend otherwise."

Evelyn's carefully constructed composure cracked. She looked away, her fingers twisting in the fabric of her dress. "You're right," she admitted, her voice barely above a whisper. "It hurts. But some things... they just aren't meant to be, no matter how much you wish they were. I held on for six years, hoping something would change. But it never did. Letting him go... it's the right choice. For both of us."

Eleanor studied her granddaughter, searching for any sign of doubt. "Are you certain about this, Evelyn? This isn't a decision to make lightly."

Evelyn lifted her chin, forcing a small, determined smile. "Yes. After his father's birthday, it's over. Don't worry about me, Grandmother. I'll find someone better—someone even more dashing, I promise."

Eleanor let out a soft chuckle despite herself, shaking her head. "Looks aren't what matter, child. What matters is finding someone who truly loves you, who cherishes you the way you deserve."

"I know," Evelyn replied, her voice steadier now. "And I will."

Eleanor's eyes sparkled with defiance as she huffed. "If Nathan wants a divorce, then it's his loss! Let him spend the rest of his life regretting it! He'll realize what a fool he's been soon enough!"

Evelyn laughed softly at her grandmother's fierce loyalty, nodding in agreement. "Oh, he will. Without a doubt."

Eleanor sighed, her expression softening. She reached for Evelyn's hand, giving it a gentle squeeze. No more words were needed.

After a quiet dinner at Serena's and a peaceful evening stroll through the nearby gardens with Eleanor, Evelyn finally returned to the Black family estate. The house was silent when she stepped inside.

Nathan was already there.

He sat at his desk, papers spread before him, but the moment her footsteps echoed in the hall, his head snapped up. Their eyes met—just for a fleeting second—before he looked away.

The air between them was thick, heavy with everything left unsaid.

Neither spoke.

Neither moved.

The silence stretched, suffocating.

###Chapter 236

Evelyn averted her gaze first, turning her head sharply as she strode toward the bedroom.

"Nathan," his voice cut through the silence, halting her steps. There was an unfamiliar hesitation in his tone.

She stopped but didn’t turn around.

The scrape of his chair against the floor told her he had risen. Then came the measured footsteps, closing the distance between them. When he stepped into her line of sight, she met his eyes—cool, composed, and utterly detached.

"Mr. Black," she said evenly, her voice as smooth as ice. "Was there something you needed?"

Nathan’s lips parted slightly. "About earlier—" he began, his voice rough, as if the words were clawing their way out.

Evelyn didn’t let him finish. "Don’t trouble yourself," she interrupted, her smile polite but distant. "I’ve already spoken to my grandmother. She won’t be extending any more dinner invitations. And as for the divorce, we’ll proceed as planned after your father’s birthday. You have nothing to worry about."

Her expression was serene, almost indifferent.

She even managed a faint, practiced smile.

Inside, she felt nothing—no anger, no sorrow, just a quiet, resolute acceptance.

Nathan, however, felt as though the ground had shifted beneath him. His chest tightened, his breath coming in shallow bursts.

This was what he had wanted, wasn’t it?

He had orchestrated every step to lead them here. So why did it feel like a blade twisting in his ribs?

Evelyn tilted her chin up, meeting his turbulent gaze without flinching. "I’m sure you’re busy," she murmured, her tone light. "I won’t keep you any longer."

With that, she turned on her heel and disappeared into the bathroom.

Nathan stood frozen, staring at the closed door long after she had vanished behind it. Then, with a sharp exhale, he strode out of the room.

They didn’t exchange another word that night.

The next evening, Evelyn invited Natalie and Alexander to the Velvet Lounge.

When they arrived, they found her seated at the bar, several empty glasses lined up in front of her.

Natalie and Alexander exchanged a glance, their brows furrowing in silent concern.

###Chapter 237

"What's the matter, Evelyn?" Natalie was the first to notice something was off. "Why are you drinking like this?"

Evelyn let out a bitter laugh, swirling the amber liquid in her glass. "Oh, nothing serious. I just finally realized how utterly delusional I've been all this time."

She recounted the events of the previous day in excruciating detail, each word laced with self-deprecation.

The more Natalie and Alexander listened, the deeper their frowns grew.

Alexander, in particular, was baffled.

How had things come to this?

That night at the bar, Nathan’s actions had clearly shown he cared for Evelyn—so why...?

"You know what’s hilarious?" Evelyn’s voice dripped with irony as she narrowed her eyes. "I actually thought—just for a second—that Nathan might have felt something for me. Even a tiny bit. But looking back now? I was a complete fool."

The truth was, both Alexander and Natalie had believed Nathan harbored some affection for Evelyn before.

So this sudden turn of events left them stunned.

Evelyn downed another shot, wiping her lips carelessly with the back of her hand. "I should’ve given up on Nathan ages ago. Should’ve stopped lying to myself that this marriage could ever mean anything."

Natalie and Alexander exchanged another glance.

Neither liked seeing their friend like this.

Alexander sighed, unable to decipher what was going through Nathan’s mind.

He had once thought he understood the man—but reality had proven him wrong.

"What did your grandmother say about all this?" Natalie asked gently.

This time, Evelyn’s smile was tinged with sorrow. "She knows everything now. And she supports the divorce completely. She just hopes I’ll find someone who truly loves me someday." She exhaled sharply. "From now on, I’m done with delusions. My attitude toward Nathan? It’s changing for good."

Alexander heard the finality in her voice. She had truly given up on Nathan.

He leaned in, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder.

"Evelyn," he said seriously, locking eyes with her, "are you absolutely sure about this?"

Unbeknownst to them, Dylan Reeves sat in a shadowed booth across the room, his gaze fixed on their interaction with unsettling intensity.

From his angle, the innocent exchange between Evelyn and Alexander looked far more intimate than it was.

Alexander had leaned in so close that Dylan was convinced he was about to kiss her.

Without hesitation, Dylan pulled out his phone and snapped a photo of the scene.

###Chapter 238

Nathan's expression darkened as he studied the photo in his hands.

Could it be that Alexander Prescott also had feelings for Evelyn?

The mere thought sent a surge of irritation through him.

Without hesitation, he forwarded the photo to Dylan, along with a sharp message:

"Guess who I just spotted at The Velvet Lounge tonight. Not sure what’s going on, but Alexander and Evelyn seem awfully cozy. Any idea what’s happening between them?"

After hitting send, Nathan tossed his phone onto the coffee table with a frustrated sigh.

Meanwhile, Evelyn fell silent at Alexander’s question.

After a long pause, she finally nodded. "Yes. My decision is final."

This time, she meant it.

She was exhausted—exhausted from hoping, from waiting, only to have her heart broken again and again.

Maybe it was better this way. No expectations meant no disappointment.

Alexander lowered his gaze, his thoughts unreadable, his expression carefully blank.

Elsewhere, Dylan’s phone buzzed with Nathan’s message. The moment he saw the photo, his jaw clenched.

Alexander and Evelyn.

What the hell were they doing together?

Did they really need to sit that close just to talk? From the angle of the photo, it almost looked like they were about to—

His grip tightened around his phone.

Though Alexander’s broad frame obscured most of Evelyn in the picture, Dylan still caught a glimpse of her blouse.

He recognized it instantly—the same one she had worn that morning.

And whether by accident or design, Natalie Brooks was completely cut out of the frame, leaving Dylan with the impression that Evelyn and Alexander were alone in that dimly lit lounge.

With a sharp exhale, Dylan slammed his phone onto his desk.

His pulse roared in his ears.

Minutes stretched into hours.

By the time the clock struck eleven, Nathan could no longer resist the urge to call her.

The line rang endlessly before she finally picked up.

"What do you want?" Evelyn’s voice was ice.

"What time are you coming home?" Nathan demanded, his tone low and rough.

"That’s none of your concern, Mr. Black," she shot back.

Then—before he could respond—she hung up.

Nathan stared at his phone, fury burning through him.

How dare she?

To Be Continued...
###Chapter 239

The good news was, he hadn’t heard any loud music on her end just now.

Evelyn must have left the club already.

But if she wasn’t heading home, where the hell was she planning to stay the night?

Nathan’s eyes darkened with suspicion.

He snatched his phone again and dialed Alexander’s number this time.

“Hello?” Alexander answered, sounding slightly bewildered by Nathan’s call at this ungodly hour.

“Where are you?” Nathan demanded, his voice sharp.

“At home,” Alexander replied cautiously.

“Where’s Evelyn?” Nathan pressed, his tone leaving no room for evasion.

Alexander’s brows knitted together. “You’re looking for Evelyn? Why are you calling me instead of her?”

“Answer the damn question!” Nathan snapped, ignoring his deflection.

Alexander pressed his lips together, hesitating for a split second—just long enough for a soft, unmistakably feminine moan to drift from beside him.

The sound carried clearly through the phone.

Nathan’s expression twisted instantly. “Whose voice was that?” he growled.

Stay tuned for updates at g?lnσν???s?c?m

“Uh… Oh, that? You must be hearing things,” Alexander cleared his throat, his voice laced with poorly concealed amusement.

After a deliberate pause, he added smoothly, “Evelyn isn’t here with me. Anyway, my phone’s dying. Gotta go.”

Without giving Nathan a chance to respond, he ended the call and powered off his phone, his movements swift and deliberate.

He cast a sideways glance at the television.

The moan had actually come from the show playing in the background, but Alexander had deliberately avoided clarifying—just to see how Nathan would react.

Deep down, he couldn’t shake the feeling that Nathan cared more about Evelyn than he let on.

He’d sensed it in Nathan’s clipped words, seen it in the way his jaw tightened whenever Evelyn’s name came up.

What he couldn’t figure out was why Nathan was suddenly acting this way now.

It didn’t make sense.

Shaking his head, Alexander tossed his phone onto the bedside table to charge and headed for the shower.

After a quick rinse, he toweled off his damp hair, his stomach growling in protest.

Deciding to whip up something simple, he padded downstairs to the kitchen.

Just as the water began to boil for pasta, the doorbell rang—sharp, insistent, and relentless.

Alexander sighed, turning off the stove. He already had a sinking suspicion who was on the other side.

With a quick twist of the lock, he pulled the door open—only to be met with a fist flying straight at his face.

###Chapter 240
The punch landed with brutal precision on his left cheekbone, the sickening crack echoing through the foyer as Nathan stumbled back, his shoulder slamming against the wall.

Alexander hadn't seen it coming.

Nathan Black erupted into the penthouse like a hurricane, his emerald eyes blazing with primal fury, the tendons in his neck standing out in sharp relief. He barely glanced at Alexander as he took the marble stairs three at a time, his Italian loafers leaving scuff marks on the polished steps.

Wiping the blood from his split lip with the back of his hand, Alexander let out a low whistle. "Jesus Christ," he muttered, rolling his aching jaw. The coppery taste of blood filled his mouth - Nathan hadn't pulled that punch one bit.

The elevator dinged ninety seconds later. Nathan descended like Death himself, his Armani suit wrinkled, his voice glacial. "Where's Evelyn?"

Alexander massaged his throbbing cheekbone. "Do you really think she'd be here? She texted me she's staying at Natalie's tonight."

Nathan's knuckles turned white around the banister. "Then explain," he bit out, each word sharp enough to draw blood, "why I heard moaning during our call."

"The new K-drama Vivian recommended," Alexander said smoothly, reaching for the remote to turn off the flat-screen where a shirtless actor was indeed pinning a woman against a wall.

Nathan's gaze could have frozen hell over. "Bullshit. You hung up like you'd been caught with your pants down."

"My battery died at 2%," Alexander shrugged, tossing his dead phone onto the coffee table with a clatter. "Like I told you three times already."

The silence between them crackled like live wires.

Nathan's chest rose and fell rapidly, the adrenaline still coursing through him. Then suddenly - like a puppet with its strings cut - his shoulders slumped.

"Fuck." He dragged both hands down his face, his wedding band glinting under the chandelier. When he looked up, the storm in his eyes had dulled to something more vulnerable. "I... Christ, Alex. I'm sorry."

Alexander tossed him an ice pack from the wet bar. "Sit down before you pass out."

Nathan collapsed onto the Chesterfield sofa, the ice pack pressed to his bruised knuckles instead of his face.

"You've taken bullets without flinching," Alexander said quietly, pouring two fingers of Macallan. "When Leonard's men kidnapped Serena, you negotiated like it was a fucking board meeting. But this?" He pushed the glass into Nathan's shaking hand. "This is new."

The amber liquid trembled as Nathan brought it to his lips. Somewhere in the penthouse, a grandfather clock ticked towards midnight.

###Chapter 241
Nathan was lost in thought.

Before he could respond, Alexander cut him off, his voice smooth but laced with curiosity. "Or perhaps I should rephrase my question. Why did you rush here in such a hurry, burst into my home, and confront me like this? What exactly were you suspecting? Did you hear that sound earlier and immediately assume it was Evelyn? Did you think she was here with me?"

Nathan remained silent, his expression unreadable.

Alexander exhaled deeply, the weight of the moment pressing down on him. "Nathan, are you absolutely certain you don’t harbor any feelings for Evelyn at all?"

At the question, Nathan’s pupils contracted slightly, his composure flickering for just a second.

After a long pause, he finally lifted his gaze, his dark eyes unreadable, his lips parting as he answered, "Of course not. I don’t feel anything for her."

Alexander didn’t hesitate. "Then how do you explain your behavior just now?"

Nathan’s eyes narrowed, sharp and cutting. "Regardless of anything else, Evelyn is still my wife. If she… If she were to betray me like that, it would be unacceptable. This isn’t about her. It’s about my pride. That’s the only reason I reacted the way I did."

A quiet scoff escaped Alexander as he shook his head. "Nathan, be honest with yourself. If you truly didn’t care about Evelyn, if she meant nothing to you, would it really matter who she was with? At most, you’d feel disgusted, maybe irritated. But this kind of fury? This intensity? That’s not the reaction of someone who’s indifferent."

He glanced at the clock on the wall, a knowing smirk tugging at his lips. "Twenty-seven minutes."

Under normal circumstances, it took an hour to reach his estate from the Black family mansion. Yet Nathan had made it in less than half that time. "Would you really push yourself that hard for someone you claim not to care about?"

Alexander’s words struck like a blow, landing deep in Nathan’s chest.

His brow furrowed, irritation flashing across his face as if Alexander had exposed something he wasn’t ready to acknowledge.

Clenching his jaw, Nathan snapped back, defiance sharpening his tone. "Evelyn is my wife. That’s why this is different! If she actually did something like that, it would tarnish the Black family’s reputation. I won’t allow that to happen!"

Alexander’s lips parted slightly, but no words came out.

Instead, he studied Nathan carefully, his expression a mix of complicated emotions.

It was impossible to tell whether Nathan truly didn’t recognize his own feelings—or if he did and was simply refusing to admit them.

Then, something seemed to click in Alexander’s mind, and a sly smile curved his lips.

He nodded slowly, his tone light but loaded with meaning. "Well, if that’s the case, then all the better. Nathan, rest assured, I’d never betray you—not before you and Evelyn finalize your divorce. And honestly, since your divorce is imminent, I don’t mind waiting a little longer. I’ve been patient for years already."

At Alexander’s words, the veins in Nathan’s temple pulsed visibly, the anger that had momentarily subsided roaring back to life within him.

###Chapter 242

Nathan exhaled sharply, pushing himself up from the couch with measured movements. "I'm leaving," he stated tersely, his voice tight with barely contained frustration.

As he turned to go, his gaze flicked to Alexander, and he added stiffly, "Don't neglect your injuries."

"Got it," Alexander replied with a careless wave, his usual nonchalance unchanged.

Without another word, Nathan strode out of Alexander's apartment, his footsteps quick and purposeful.

The next morning, at the Brooks family estate.

Rain pattered steadily against the windows, soaking the grounds in a relentless downpour.

After breakfast, Natalie arranged for the family driver to take Evelyn to work.

As Natalie walked Evelyn to the front steps, she smiled warmly. "Tell your grandmother that once I have some free time, I’d love to invite her over for dinner."

"Of course," Evelyn answered with a small nod.

She glanced at Natalie and added, "You should head back inside now. It’s chilly."

Natalie opened her mouth to reply but froze mid-step, her words dying in her throat as her eyes locked onto the sleek car parked in front of the house.

Noticing Natalie’s sudden stillness, Evelyn followed her gaze—and her breath caught at the sight of the striking black Bentley Mulsanne idling at the curb.

Her pulse stuttered in recognition.

The driver’s door swung open, and Nathan stepped out, his tall frame cutting an imposing silhouette against the dreary backdrop of rain.

With deliberate grace, he shut the door and strode toward them, his polished Oxford shoes splashing lightly through the puddles.

When he stopped in front of Evelyn, his piercing gaze bore into hers. "I’ll drive you to work," he said, his voice low but firm.

Evelyn didn’t hesitate. "That won’t be necessary. Natalie’s driver is taking me. There’s no need for you to trouble yourself, Mr. Black."

Natalie crossed her arms, her tone dripping with sarcasm. "Exactly, Mr. Black. You’re far too busy with your important business dealings to spare time for Evelyn. Why bother now? We wouldn’t dream of inconveniencing you."

Nathan ignored Natalie’s jab, his attention fixed solely on Evelyn, his expression unreadable.

Evelyn met his gaze evenly. "If your father asked you to do this, I’ll simply tell him you drove me. You don’t actually have to."

Nathan’s response came unexpectedly, his voice rough but steady. "This has nothing to do with my father."

Evelyn blinked, startled. Natalie’s eyebrows shot up in surprise.

If Leonard hadn’t ordered Nathan to come, then this was his own decision.

The realization sent an unwelcome flutter through Evelyn’s chest—just for a fleeting moment.

###Chapter 243
The fleeting emotion vanished as quickly as it had appeared.

Evelyn's face hardened like marble as she took a deliberate step backward. Her voice dripped with icy detachment.

"Then you have absolutely no business driving me to work." With that, she shouldered past Nathan, her heels clicking sharply against the pavement as she marched away.

Nathan's jaw clenched, his stormy gaze tracking her retreating figure. A muscle ticked in his temple as frustration surged through him. Before he could stop himself, he pivoted and closed the distance between them in long, purposeful strides.

In one fluid motion, he caught Evelyn's wrist, bent slightly at the knees, and hauled her over his shoulder like a sack of flour. The entire maneuver took less than three seconds.

Evelyn gasped, her world tilting upside down. "Nathan Black! Have you completely lost your senses?" She pounded her fists against his broad back, her legs kicking uselessly in the air. Behind them, Natalie's shocked gasp cut through the morning air.

"Oh my God..." Natalie whispered, her manicured fingers pressed to her parted lips.

Nathan remained silent, his grip unyielding as he carried his struggling cargo toward his sleek black Mercedes. When they reached the vehicle, he yanked open the passenger door and deposited Evelyn inside with surprising gentleness.

Even as she glared daggers at him, he leaned across her trembling form and snapped the seatbelt into place with practiced efficiency. His expression remained unreadable, though a vein pulsed visibly at his temple.

Without so much as glancing in Evelyn's direction, Nathan slid behind the wheel, fastened his own seatbelt, and started the engine with a low growl.

Evelyn's chest heaved with indignation. She opened her mouth—once, twice—but no words emerged. Finally, she turned her face toward the window, watching the raindrops race down the glass in silent fury.

The tension inside the car grew so thick it was almost suffocating. After what felt like an eternity, Nathan finally broke the silence.

His voice came out rough, almost hesitant. "I didn't realize... when you invited me to dinner before... it was because your grandmother had returned." His fingers tightened around the steering wheel. "Had I known, I would never have turned you down."

Evelyn's eyelashes fluttered briefly, but her expression remained carefully blank. His words might as well have been spoken to the wind for all the effect they had on her.

No explanation could erase the memory of him choosing to dine with Serena instead. That bitter truth remained unchanged, no matter what pretty words he offered now.

A humorless smile touched Evelyn's lips. "Ancient history," she said with deliberate lightness. "No point dredging it up now. Besides..." Her voice dropped to a whisper. "It won't happen again."

Nathan's knuckles turned white against the steering wheel. A storm brewed in his dark eyes—anger, frustration, something else too complex to name. His breathing grew noticeably heavier, but he said nothing.

The silence stretched between them, taut as a bowstring, until the only sound was the rhythmic swish of windshield wipers battling the relentless rain.

###Chapter 244
The torrential rain hammered against the windshield as Evelyn Hartley watched the traffic descend into utter chaos through the fogged-up windows. Nathan Black's fingers tightened around the steering wheel, his knuckles whitening as their luxury sedan remained motionless for what felt like an eternity. The air inside the car grew heavier with each passing minute, thick with unspoken tension.

Evelyn deliberately kept her face turned toward the passenger window, watching raindrops race down the glass like tiny silver bullets. The rhythmic patter of rain against metal filled the suffocating silence between them.

Just when the traffic showed signs of movement, another bottleneck formed barely two blocks ahead. The neon sign of Grandins General Hospital glowed faintly in the distance - a mere ten-minute walk through the storm.

Evelyn turned toward Nathan, about to demand he pull over, when panicked shouts sliced through the downpour.

"Clara! Clara, can you hear me?"
"Someone help! She just collapsed!"
"Call 911 immediately!"

The commotion drew a rapidly growing crowd toward a single spot on the sidewalk. Without hesitation, Evelyn snapped at Nathan, "Stop the car now!"

Nathan swerved to the curb with practiced precision. Before the car fully stopped, Evelyn was already throwing open her door and sprinting into the deluge, her designer heels splashing through ankle-deep puddles.

"Let me through! I'm a doctor!" Her commanding voice cut through the murmuring crowd as she elbowed her way forward.

At the center of the gathering, a middle-aged Latina woman lay motionless on the wet pavement, her floral blouse already soaked through. A distraught man hovered over her, his face twisted in panic.

Evelyn dropped to her knees without regard for her expensive slacks. "Ma'am? Clara?" She gently shook the woman's shoulder while simultaneously checking for responsiveness. Her medical training kicked in automatically as she turned to the frantic man. "Any known medical conditions?"

"She has arrhythmia!" he choked out, clutching at his chest. "Her medication is in her purse but-"

Evelyn didn't wait for him to finish. With swift movements, she loosened Clara's collar and pressed two fingers to her carotid artery. Her expression darkened when she detected no pulse. Leaning down, she listened for breath sounds before immediately beginning chest compressions.

"She's in cardiac arrest!" Evelyn announced, her voice steady despite the adrenaline coursing through her veins. "I need space to work! Someone call an ambulance and see if there's an AED nearby!"

Her hands found the correct position on Clara's sternum as she began the rhythmic compressions, counting under her breath. The man fumbled with his phone, his hands shaking violently as he dialed emergency services.

Around them, the crowd formed a protective circle against the relentless rain as Evelyn fought to bring Clara back from the brink. Water streamed down her face, mixing with sweat as she maintained perfect CPR form despite the adverse conditions.

Nathan appeared at her side suddenly, holding out a compact AED he'd retrieved from a nearby store. Without a word, he tore open Clara's blouse further to allow proper pad placement, his movements precise and efficient.

The wail of approaching sirens cut through the storm just as the AED analyzed Clara's rhythm. Evelyn's breath caught as the machine's mechanical voice announced: "Shock advised."

###Chapter 245

Nathan arrived moments later, his strides quick and purposeful, halting abruptly at the sight before him.

Evelyn knelt on the rain-slicked pavement, her face a mask of fierce concentration. Beads of sweat glistened on her forehead despite the cool drizzle, her hands moving with unyielding precision as she performed CPR. Every compression was deliberate, every breath she gave measured—her entire being focused on saving a life.

When the chest compressions alone didn’t yield results, Evelyn pinched Clara’s nose and leaned down, sealing her lips over the woman’s to deliver rescue breaths. She alternated between breaths and compressions, relentless, refusing to falter even as exhaustion threatened to creep in.

Watching her, Nathan felt something stir in his chest—admiration, yes, but something warmer, something deeper. The sheer determination in Evelyn’s every movement, the way she poured every ounce of herself into saving a stranger, left him breathless.

Nearby, the man who had called for help stood rigid, his expression taut with worry as he watched Evelyn’s tireless efforts. Recognition flickered in his eyes when he glanced at Nathan, his pupils contracting slightly.

Nathan Black.

And if Nathan was here, then the woman kneeling on the ground, refusing to give up—

His gaze snapped back to Evelyn, realization dawning.

Evelyn Hartley.

A tangled knot of emotions twisted inside him. Of all the ways to cross paths again, he hadn’t expected this.

Minutes stretched like hours, the tension thick in the air. Then—

Clara’s lips parted.

Evelyn froze for a heartbeat before pressing two fingers to Clara’s neck, checking for a pulse. A second later, her shoulders sagged in relief, and she exhaled shakily. "Her heartbeat’s back."

A murmur rippled through the gathered crowd, swelling into astonished whispers.

"That woman is incredible!" someone gasped, awe lacing their voice.

###Chapter 246

"You're incredible, Miss! You saved this woman's life!" a bystander exclaimed, admiration shining in their eyes.

"Absolutely! You're a real-life hero!" another added enthusiastically. "And so young and compassionate too! You should be proud!"

Evelyn Hartley offered a modest smile, her cheeks warming slightly under the praise.

"Thank you," the man who had been with Clara Fernandez said earnestly, his voice thick with gratitude as his gaze locked onto Evelyn's.

Evelyn pressed one hand against the damp pavement, bracing herself as she tried to rise.

Seeing her struggle, Nathan Black stepped forward without hesitation. His strong fingers wrapped around her forearm, steadying her with a firm but gentle grip.

With a smooth motion, he helped her to her feet.

But Evelyn had knelt for too long—her legs trembled beneath her, and she stumbled forward, crashing straight into Nathan's chest.

Nathan caught her effortlessly, his hands secure yet careful as he steadied her.

Evelyn looked up, her eyes briefly meeting his.

For a fleeting second, she remembered the way he had wiped the sweat from her brow earlier—an unexpected gesture of care that had caught her off guard.

Her breath hitched, but before she could speak, the wail of an approaching ambulance shattered the moment.

Medical personnel spilled out of the vehicle with practiced efficiency.

"Dr. Hartley," one of the doctors greeted her, recognition flashing in their eyes.

Since the incident had occurred near St. Grace General Hospital, the ambulance had been dispatched from there.

Evelyn gave a curt nod, slipping back into her professional demeanor. "The patient has a history of heart disease. She likely suffered cardiac arrest. I performed CPR, and her pulse has stabilized."

"Understood," the doctor replied briskly, immediately joining the team as they prepared to transport Clara.

Within moments, the ambulance sped away, its sirens cutting through the steady drizzle.

The crowd buzzed with excitement. "She's a doctor at St. Grace? That's amazing!"

"And so young! What a brilliant woman!"

Evelyn acknowledged them with a polite nod, her expression composed as she turned and walked back toward Nathan's car.

When she reached it, she didn’t get in.

Instead, she opened the passenger door, retrieved her bag, and turned to Nathan. "I'll walk to the hospital from here," she said calmly.

Nathan frowned, his voice low but firm. "It's still raining."

###Chapter 247

"It's not an issue for me," Evelyn responded without missing a beat.

With that, she spun on her heel and strode away, her steps quick and determined, leaving no room for hesitation.

Nathan lingered by the car, his brow furrowing as he watched her retreating figure. His sharp gaze darkened slightly, unreadable and intense. For a long moment, he stood there, lost in thought.

By the time Evelyn reached the hospital, she was soaked to the bone, the relentless rain having seeped through every layer of her clothing. Time was of the essence, so she swiftly towel-dried her hair, secured a wig in place, changed into fresh scrubs, and threw on her white coat before hurrying to her office to prepare for rounds.

Once her duties were completed, she finally allowed herself a brief respite, retreating to the break room for a much-needed hot shower.

As she stood blow-drying her damp hair, her phone buzzed on the counter. A slight crease formed between her brows when she recognized the caller ID.

With a quiet exhale, she answered. "Hello?"

"Are you free right now?" Alexander's familiar voice came through, casual but laced with curiosity.

"Not particularly busy. What is it?" Evelyn kept her tone even.

"I wanted to tell you about something that happened last night. It's important," Alexander said, his voice shifting to something more serious.

He recounted the events in vivid detail, describing Nathan's reactions—his clenched jaw, the way his gaze had darkened, the barely restrained tension in his posture.

When he finished, Alexander paused before adding, "Evelyn... I think Nathan cares about you. More than he lets on."

Evelyn stilled, her fingers tightening slightly around the phone. For a brief moment, surprise flickered in her eyes.

Then, just as quickly, she let out a soft, dismissive laugh. "Didn’t you hear him say it himself? He wasn’t angry because he cared about me. He was angry because he thought my actions would reflect poorly on the Black family’s reputation. That’s all there is to it."

Alexander sighed audibly, his tone tinged with resignation. "Nathan has always been like this—too stubborn to admit what he really feels. Do you honestly believe that’s the only reason?"

Evelyn’s voice remained steady, betraying nothing. "Yes. I’m certain he doesn’t care about me at all."

By refusing to read into it, she could maintain her composure, her heart fortified against foolish hope.

Alexander exhaled again, his voice quieter this time. "Alright. If that’s how you see it, I won’t push the matter further."

Evelyn drew in a slow breath, forcing a faint smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes. "Alexander... thank you for testing the waters for me."

###Chapter 248

But there was no point in holding on anymore.
It was all meaningless.

Their divorce was inevitable.

Even if Nathan Black cared for her—maybe even had feelings for her—what would it change? What difference would it make in the end?

Evelyn Hartley let out a quiet sigh, her fingers tightening around her phone.

So what if Nathan felt something for her? A flicker of affection? A fleeting moment of tenderness? It wasn’t enough. She was exhausted.

She refused to spend her life chasing after scraps of love from a man who could never fully commit to her.

It would only drain her, just as it already had.

Instead of clinging to false hope, she knew it was better to walk away.

After all, from the very beginning…

Both of them had wanted this divorce. Desperately. Without hesitation.

On the other end of the line, Alexander Prescott exhaled heavily, frustration creeping into his voice.

He could hear the finality in Evelyn’s tone. She had already given up on her marriage to Nathan, and for some reason, that realization left him with a pang of regret.

He had always believed they shouldn’t end things like this.

Before he could argue further, Evelyn spoke again, her voice firm. "I have work to finish, Alexander. I’m hanging up now."

"Fine," he relented, though his tone was heavy with reluctance.

The call ended, and Evelyn tucked her phone away, turning her attention back to her documents.

Her expression remained composed, untouched by the conversation—as if the weight of her crumbling marriage meant nothing to her.

Grand Oaks General Hospital, VIP Suite

"How is she, Doctor?" a deep voice asked.

"Thanks to the quick response of the attending physician, we managed to stabilize her," the doctor replied. "She’s out of immediate danger."

He paused, adjusting his glasses before continuing, "However, she must avoid any physical strain in the future. And she must carry her heart medication at all times."

"Understood," the man nodded. "Thank you."

The doctor left, and the man’s gaze lingered on the unconscious woman in the bed.

After a long moment, he turned and walked out, the door clicking shut behind him.

###Chapter 249

Standing outside the hospital room, Elliot Dawson pulled out his phone and dialed a familiar number.

"Today," he said the moment the call connected, his voice tight, "I ran into Evelyn Hartley..."

He recounted the morning's events in clipped tones. When he finished, the person on the other end chuckled darkly.

"Well, isn't that convenient? Now you don’t have to waste time coming up with excuses to get close to her."

Elliot’s grip on the phone tightened. A beat of silence passed before he spoke again, his voice rough with restrained emotion. "I don’t want to do it like this."

This time, the silence stretched longer.

Then, coldly: "Elliot, think about your mother."

The line went dead.

Elliot’s jaw clenched as he shoved his phone back into his pocket. A storm of anger flickered in his eyes, but he forced it down, exhaling sharply. After a few steadying breaths, he schooled his expression and returned to the hospital room.

Meanwhile, Evelyn finally had a moment to sit down after a hectic morning. She reached for her water bottle, taking a long sip before checking her phone.

It had been buzzing incessantly earlier, but she’d been too swamped with patients to respond. Now, she frowned at the flood of missed calls and unread messages.

Curious, she tapped Natalie Brooks’ name first.

"What’s going on?" Evelyn asked when the call connected. "Why the sudden barrage?"

"Evelyn!" Natalie’s excited voice crackled through the speaker. "You’re everywhere! News outlets, social media—everyone’s talking about how you saved that woman’s life today. You’re a hero!"

Evelyn blinked, caught off guard. "I was just doing my job."

"Maybe, but if it weren’t for you, she wouldn’t have made it. That’s not just a job—that’s a miracle!"

Evelyn laughed softly, shaking her head. They chatted a bit longer before she hung up and scrolled through her messages.

Every text was about the same thing.

Before she realized it, her thumb hovered over a news link. She tapped it.

The headline blared: "The Heroic Doctor Who Defied Death."

The article detailed the morning’s emergency, complete with a photo of Evelyn performing CPR on the woman, her expression fierce with determination.

###Chapter 250

The comments beneath the article overflowed with praise for Evelyn, calling her both stunning and compassionate. Some even compared her to a celestial being, devoted to mending broken bodies and saving lives.

Evelyn felt her cheeks warm as she skimmed through them.

Then, one comment caught her attention:

"I saw this drop-dead gorgeous man wiping sweat from the beautiful doctor’s forehead while she was performing CPR. Trust me, you’ve never seen a face like his—the kind that etches itself into your memory forever. The way he looked at her? Pure tenderness. There’s definitely something special between them."

Evelyn’s fingers stilled.

Nathan, gazing at her with tenderness? That had to be an exaggeration.

She scrolled past a few more comments before replying to other messages, brushing off the observation. But gossip spread faster than wildfire, and soon, whispers filled the hospital corridors.

Colleagues who’d read the article couldn’t stop buzzing about it.

When the news reached Lila, bitterness coiled in her chest like a venomous snake.

Ever since the competition, Evelyn’s reputation had skyrocketed. Now, with this incident? No one dared speak ill of her.

Lila’s nails dug into her palms.

So what if Evelyn saved a life? It could’ve been staged—some desperate actor paid to play the victim, all to make Evelyn look like a saint.

That evening, Evelyn left work on time, heading straight to Serena Cole’s villa for dinner with Eleanor and the others.

Unsurprisingly, Eleanor brought it up the moment she sat down. “Darling, I’m so proud of you!” she gushed, eyes sparkling.

Evelyn smiled, about to respond—

Then Isabelle cut in, voice laced with curiosity. “Evelyn, one of the comments mentioned a man beside you during the rescue. He wiped your sweat, supported you… Who was it?”

Evelyn’s smile faltered.

Eleanor’s gaze sharpened, waiting.

###Chapter 251

Evelyn let out a weary sigh before responding, "It was Nathan. He just gave me a ride to work this morning."

The silence that followed was thick with tension.

"Evelyn," Isabelle finally spoke, her voice hesitant, "I've always thought you and Mr. Black had such good chemistry. That time at the gala, why did you—"

"It's getting late," Eleanor interrupted sharply. "You should head home and rest, Evelyn."

Nodding, Evelyn rose from her seat. "You're right. I'll be going now."

"Be careful on your way back," Eleanor said, her tone softening.

"Will do! See you both soon," Evelyn replied with a tired smile.

As soon as the door closed behind Evelyn, Eleanor turned to Isabelle with a stern expression. "From now on, avoid mentioning Nathan when Evelyn's around."

Isabelle pressed her lips into a thin line and nodded silently, though an unreadable glimmer flashed in her eyes.

By the time Evelyn arrived at the Black family estate, Nathan was already there.

She didn't acknowledge his presence.

Moving through her evening routine mechanically, she took a long shower before settling on the plush sofa with a book in hand.

Her gaze never once strayed toward where Nathan sat.

Nathan, however, kept stealing glances at Evelyn throughout the evening.

When it became painfully obvious she was deliberately ignoring him, his brows furrowed in frustration.

Her cold indifference stirred an unfamiliar discomfort in his chest.

Exhausted from her sleepless night, Evelyn retired to bed earlier than usual.

The next morning, as Nathan prepared to leave their shared bedroom, he noticed Evelyn still hadn't stirred.

This was unusual.

Her alarm had sounded multiple times already.

Concerned, Nathan approached Evelyn's side of the bed and immediately noticed the unnatural flush on her cheeks.

Frowning, he reached out to press the back of his hand against her forehead.

She was burning up.

Evelyn was running a high fever.

Nathan's expression darkened with worry. "Evelyn," he called urgently, gently shaking her shoulder. "Evelyn? Wake up..."

After several attempts, Evelyn finally blinked her eyes open, her gaze unfocused and glassy.

"What...?" she murmured weakly, squinting at her surroundings in confusion.

"You have a fever," Nathan said, his voice uncharacteristically gentle.


###Chapter 252
A Sudden Fever

Evelyn blinked in surprise as realization washed over her.

No wonder I feel so awful.

Her throat burned like fire, her tongue sticking to the roof of her mouth like parched parchment. It had to be from yesterday’s downpour—she’d been drenched to the bone. And with back-to-back surgeries at the hospital, she’d barely had a moment to catch her breath, let alone change out of her damp scrubs.

She lifted a shaky hand to her forehead, pressing her fingers against her clammy skin.

"It’s nothing serious," she murmured, tucking her hand back under the covers. "Just a mild fever—around 101.5°F." She glanced at Nathan. "Could you grab the medicine from the drawer? Some pills should do the trick."

Nathan stared at her for a long moment, his brow furrowing.

Had she really just guessed her temperature without a thermometer?

Still, he moved to the nightstand, retrieving the first-aid kit. He pulled out a digital thermometer and pressed it to her temple. The screen flashed—101.5°F.

His lips parted slightly.

How had she known exactly?

"Just pills?" His voice was low, edged with concern. "No IV? No doctor?"

Evelyn shook her head weakly. "Not yet. Let’s try the meds first." She pushed herself up slightly, wincing at the effort. "If they don’t work, then we’ll consider stronger measures."

Nathan’s jaw tightened, but he didn’t argue. He rummaged through the kit, pulling out the medications she listed—antipyretics, anti-inflammatories, something for the sore throat. He lined them up neatly on the nightstand before standing.

"I’ll have breakfast brought up," he said, his tone leaving no room for protest. "Stay in bed."

Evelyn gave a small nod, her usual sharpness dulled by the fever. She looked softer like this—vulnerable, almost docile.

Nathan’s fingers twitched at his side, an inexplicable urge to brush a stray lock of hair from her face rising in his chest. He clenched his fist and turned away.

The moment the door clicked shut, Evelyn dragged herself out of bed, shuffling to the bathroom to splash cold water on her face. By the time she emerged, Nathan was already back, balancing a tray laden with steaming soup, toast, and a cup of herbal tea.

His eyes darkened when he saw her standing there.

"Back to bed. Now," he ordered, his voice brooking no argument.

Evelyn obeyed without protest, sliding under the covers as he set the tray over her lap. She picked up the spoon, her movements sluggish, and took a slow sip of the broth.

Nathan watched her for a moment before exhaling sharply.

This woman would be the death of him.

###Chapter 253

Evelyn noticed Nathan still hovering by her bedside. She met his gaze steadily. "You don't have to stay," she said, her voice softer than she intended. "Your work won't wait." But Nathan only studied her with those unreadable dark eyes.

A sigh escaped her lips. "Really, it's fine," Evelyn continued, adjusting the blanket over her lap. "If your father asks, I'll tell him I insisted you leave. He won't blame you."

Nathan's jaw tightened visibly at her words.

Wasn't this what he wanted? Then why did her dismissal sting so much?

After a tense silence, Nathan turned on his heel and left without another word.

Evelyn watched the door close behind him, her fingers tracing the edge of the soup bowl absently. The rich aroma of chicken broth filled the air, but it suddenly seemed unappetizing.

She forced herself to finish the meal anyway. Thirty minutes later, she swallowed her medication with practiced efficiency before calling the hospital administrator. "I won't be coming in today," she said, her voice carefully neutral.

Sleep claimed her almost immediately after her head hit the pillow.

Nathan found himself standing outside their townhouse at precisely 12:17 PM. He couldn't explain why he'd raced back during lunch hour, cutting two important meetings short.

What was he doing here?

"Mr. Black!" Winston exclaimed as Nathan entered the foyer. The older man's eyebrows shot up in surprise. "We weren't expecting you until evening." Then understanding dawned, and a knowing smile curved his lips. "Ah, checking on Mrs. Black? She's resting comfortably. Had lunch and took her medicine like clockwork."

Nathan's shoulders stiffened. "I came for some documents," he said brusquely, already taking the stairs two at a time before Winston could respond.

The butler chuckled quietly to himself. As if the CEO of Black Industries needed to retrieve his own files. The man was transparent as glass when it came to his wife.

Nathan's gaze swept the empty bedroom the moment he entered. The perfectly made bed looked untouched since morning. A frown creased his forehead as he turned toward the ensuite bathroom—

CRASH!

The sound of shattering glass sent his heart into overdrive.

Nathan was across the room in three strides, his pulse roaring in his ears. The noise had come from behind the bathroom door.

He wrenched it open with enough force to rattle the hinges—

###Chapter 254

"Nathan!" His voice echoed through the hallway as he rapped his knuckles against the bathroom door.

The silence from within sent a sharp pang of worry through his chest.

"Evelyn! Answer me!" His tone grew more urgent, laced with a rising panic that tightened his throat.

Finally, a faint, pained groan broke through the tense quiet. "Ugh…"

That was all it took.

Nathan twisted the doorknob, shoving the door open without hesitation.

The sight before him stole his breath.

His pupils contracted sharply, heat flooding his veins in an instant.

Evelyn lay sprawled across the cold tiles, her lithe figure completely exposed—every graceful curve, every inch of smooth skin laid bare under his stunned gaze.

Her long legs, the delicate swell of her chest, even—

His jaw clenched.

Evelyn’s eyes flew open, locking onto Nathan’s frozen form in the doorway.

A furious blush exploded across her cheeks as a sharp scream tore from her lips. "Nathan! You—close your eyes right now!"

Her voice trembled with mortification as she scrambled to cover herself, hands darting to shield her chest and thighs.

But her frantic movements only accentuated her natural allure, making her appear even more devastatingly beautiful in her flustered state.

Nathan’s gaze darkened, something unreadable flickering in his eyes as he took her in.

His Adam’s apple bobbed visibly before he moved.

Without a word, he snatched a nearby towel and tossed it over her.

Then he stepped closer.

Bending down, he scooped her into his arms effortlessly, her warm skin searing against his. A rush of desire flared within him, just for a heartbeat, before he forced it down.

Carrying her to the bed, he set her down gently.

Evelyn immediately yanked the blanket over herself, shielding her body from his lingering stare.

"Where are you hurt?" Nathan’s voice was low, rough with an unintentional huskiness that sent a shiver down her spine.

Evelyn’s cheeks burned hotter.

She bit her lip before muttering, "My… my hip."

An awkward tension flickered across Nathan’s face.

He turned his head slightly, clearing his throat as if to regain his composure.

Without another word, he strode back to the bathroom, retrieved her clothes, and placed them neatly beside her on the bed.

###Chapter 255

Nathan's voice was clipped as he turned away, his jaw tight. "I'll send someone to tend to your injuries."

Without another word, he strode out, the door clicking shut behind him with finality.

Outside, Nathan braced himself against the wall, his breathing ragged. A tempest of emotions raged inside him, leaving his usual composure in tatters. His fingers curled into fists as he glanced down, his expression darkening at the undeniable evidence of his body’s betrayal.

"Goddamn it," he muttered under his breath, frustration lacing the curse.

Forcing himself to regain control, he marched toward his study and dialed Winston Graves. His tone was sharp, leaving no room for discussion. "Send a maid to Evelyn’s room immediately. She needs ointment for a fall."

The moment the call ended, Nathan exhaled slowly, his chest rising and falling with the effort to steady himself. He needed to get a grip—now.

Inside the bedroom, Evelyn winced as she pushed herself upright, her movements slow and cautious. The clothes Nathan had left for her lay neatly on the bed, and she reached for them with trembling fingers.

Her pulse still raced, the memory of his touch burning against her skin like a brand. The way his hands had lingered—gentle yet possessive—sent an involuntary shiver down her spine.

She bit her lip, heat flooding her cheeks.

The fever had left her sticky with sweat, desperate for relief. But the moment she’d stepped into the shower, dizziness had overtaken her. A slip on the slick tiles, a sharp cry—and then Nathan had been there, his presence overwhelming.

Just as she finished dressing, a soft knock sounded at the door.

"Come in," she called, her voice still unsteady.

The door opened, revealing a maid carrying a small tray of medical supplies. "Mrs. Black, Mr. Black asked me to assist you with your injuries."

Evelyn managed a small, grateful smile. "Thank you. I appreciate it."

"Of course, ma’am." The maid worked efficiently, her touch light as she applied the ointment to the bruises blooming along Evelyn’s skin. Once finished, she gathered her supplies and slipped out as quietly as she’d come.

Alone again, Evelyn exhaled, pressing a hand to her still-fluttering heart.

What the hell had just happened?

###Chapter 256

About thirty minutes later, Nathan stepped back into the room, his expression carefully composed, though a flicker of concern lingered in his dark eyes.

By the time he returned, his face betrayed none of the earlier tension. He moved to the bedside, his fingers brushing lightly against Evelyn’s forehead, his touch deliberate and controlled.

Her fever had lessened, though it hadn’t completely faded.

A brief flash of relief crossed his features before his expression hardened once more.

"Did you not realize you were sick?" His voice was low, edged with disapproval. "What were you thinking, taking a bath in that state?"

Evelyn opened her mouth to respond, but Nathan cut her off, his tone growing sharper with each word.

"I happened to be back in time to hear the noise. What if I hadn’t been here? What if you’d hit your head and lost consciousness?"

The more he spoke, the darker his expression became.

Evelyn’s voice was barely a whisper. "I was drenched in sweat… I just wanted to freshen up."

Nathan didn’t relent. His gaze remained unyielding. "You could have asked for help. Was that so difficult?"

She fell silent, knowing he was right.

Nathan studied her for a long moment, something unreadable in his piercing stare. Then, with a quiet exhale, he said nothing more.

Evelyn, unwilling to argue further, sank back against the pillows and closed her eyes, retreating into her thoughts. Exhaustion soon pulled her under, and she drifted into a deep, dreamless sleep.

As she slept, her features softened, the tension easing from her face, leaving her looking almost fragile.

Nathan remained seated beside her, his stern demeanor gradually thawing. He didn’t even notice the warmth in his gaze or the faint curve of his lips as he watched her.

Once satisfied she was resting comfortably, he stood and left the room. He ate quickly before heading to the office, determined to catch up on work.

Evelyn slept through most of the day, undisturbed. By evening, her fever had broken completely, and she felt significantly better.

The next morning, she returned to work as usual.

That afternoon, Alexander unexpectedly invited Evelyn and Eleanor out for dinner. After a brief hesitation, Evelyn agreed.

###Chapter 257

The moment Evelyn stepped out of the office building, the evening breeze brushed against her skin, carrying the faint scent of blooming jasmine. She slid into her car and drove straight to Eleanor Sinclair’s residence to pick her up. Tonight, they were meeting Alexander Prescott for dinner—an invitation that had left Eleanor both curious and slightly hesitant.

As they cruised down the city streets, Eleanor turned to Evelyn with a thoughtful expression. “Darling, why did your friend suddenly invite me to dinner? I don’t even know him,” she mused, her fingers lightly tapping against the car window.

Evelyn’s lips curved into a soft smile. “Grandmother, Alexander is one of my dearest friends—just like Natalie. When I was in Chixdon, he was there for me through everything.”

Eleanor’s expression softened, her skepticism melting into warmth. “In that case, we should absolutely enjoy this meal and thank him properly for taking care of you,” she said, patting Evelyn’s hand affectionately.

By the time they arrived at the upscale restaurant, Eleanor’s initial reservations had faded. Alexander was already waiting for them, impeccably dressed, his charming smile lighting up as soon as he spotted them. His polite demeanor and genuine warmth only deepened Eleanor’s favorable impression.

“Alexander, thank you for looking after Evelyn during her time in Chixdon,” Eleanor said warmly, reaching out to squeeze his hand.

Alexander shook his head with a humble laugh. “No thanks needed, Mrs. Sinclair. Evelyn helped me just as much—if not more. That’s what friends do, isn’t it? We support each other.”

Eleanor’s smile widened. “Exactly right. You’re a good man, Alexander.”

Just as Alexander was about to respond, a smooth, familiar voice cut through the air.

“Well, isn’t this a pleasant surprise? Alexander, Mrs. Sinclair… and Evelyn.”

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her napkin at the sound of Serena Cole’s voice. A flicker of unease passed through her before she turned to see Serena approaching their table, her smile dazzling. Behind her trailed Dylan Reeves, Theodore Whitmore, and—

Nathan Black.

Evelyn’s breath hitched when her gaze collided with Nathan’s. His dark eyes were already fixed on her, an unreadable intensity simmering beneath the surface. For a heartbeat, the air between them crackled with something unspoken—something that made Evelyn quickly avert her eyes, as if burned.

Nathan’s attention shifted to the table, taking in Eleanor and Alexander seated beside Evelyn. His jaw tightened almost imperceptibly.

Evelyn was having dinner with her grandmother… and Alexander?

Without hesitation, Nathan strode forward, his steps measured. His gaze briefly flickered to Eleanor before he greeted her in a voice laced with quiet respect.

###Chapter 258
Eleanor's demeanor shifted instantly.

The moment her gaze landed on Serena, her face darkened considerably. When she noticed Nathan accompanying Serena, her expression turned stormy.

"Mr. Black," she said icily, her tone dripping with dismissal, "you and your companions should proceed with your dinner. We wouldn't want to interrupt your evening."

Nathan hesitated, the sharpness of Eleanor's words hitting harder than expected. A flicker of resignation crossed his features before he schooled them back to neutrality. He knew Eleanor still harbored resentment from their last encounter.

After the incident, Nathan had suggested to Evelyn that they invite Eleanor to dinner as a peace offering, but Evelyn had refused without hesitation. When Nathan personally called Eleanor to extend the invitation, she'd rejected him just as swiftly.

Now, seeing him dining with Serena—even if they weren't alone—would only fuel Eleanor's displeasure. Nathan exhaled quietly before responding, "Then we won't disturb you further." Without waiting for a reply, he turned on his heel.

Serena followed without hesitation.

Alexander had chosen "The Sky Lounge," an upscale restaurant owned by Theodore. Perched on the 66th floor, it offered a stunning 360-degree view of downtown Owathe. The modern open-concept design featured no private rooms, with all tables arranged along the floor-to-ceiling windows in the main dining area.

This meant Nathan's group ended up seated uncomfortably close to Evelyn and her companions.

As they settled in, Dylan leaned toward Nathan, unable to contain his curiosity. "What's happening here? Why is Alexander dining with Evelyn and her grandmother?"

Nathan remained silent, his gaze distant, while Serena opened her mouth as if to speak before thinking better of it.

"It's just dinner," Theodore interjected smoothly, clearly attempting to change the subject.

Dylan wasn't convinced. "It's never just dinner," he countered, eyes narrowing. "Ever since that bar game, I've noticed Alexander seems to have developed feelings for..." He let the implication hang deliberately in the air.

The unspoken meaning was clear to everyone at the table.

Nathan said nothing, but his jaw clenched visibly, his expression darkening like gathering storm clouds.

###Chapter 259

A tempest brewed in his stormy gaze, though his lips remained sealed.

At that moment, Theodore fell into an uncharacteristic silence, his expression darkening as a sudden realization struck him.

He had arranged this dinner.

Earlier that morning, he had called Alexander, inviting him to dine at The Rooftop, but Alexander had declined, claiming prior engagements.

Yet here he was—seated at the very restaurant Theodore had chosen, sharing a meal with Evelyn and her grandmother, Eleanor.

Theodore couldn’t shake the suspicion creeping into his thoughts.

Had Alexander orchestrated this? Or had he deliberately chosen this venue after learning Nathan would be dining here as well?

Theodore couldn’t be certain, but the possibility gnawed at him like a persistent itch.

What Theodore didn’t know was that Alexander had planned this encounter.

After Theodore’s invitation, Alexander had swiftly arranged to bring Evelyn and Eleanor to the same restaurant, fully aware Nathan would witness their presence.

Of course, before finalizing the reservation, Alexander had discreetly confirmed with Eleanor that she wasn’t afraid of heights—only then had he settled on The Rooftop.

Every move Alexander made was calculated, a carefully laid trap meant to force Nathan and Evelyn to confront their unresolved feelings.

Just then, Serena shattered the silence, her voice dripping with exaggerated disbelief. "You all actually think there’s something between Alexander and Evelyn? That’s ridiculous." Her words were laced with feigned shock, as if the mere suggestion was absurd.

"Let’s just order," Theodore interjected, steering the conversation away.

Dylan and Serena exchanged knowing glances but chose not to press further.

Throughout the meal, however, subtle glances were cast toward Evelyn’s table.

The atmosphere at Evelyn’s table was warm and effortless.

Evelyn, Eleanor, and Alexander chatted animatedly, their laughter a soft melody in the air.

Even with Nathan’s group seated nearby, they remained entirely unbothered, their joy undisturbed.

It was clear Eleanor had taken an instant liking to Alexander.

His effortless charm and quick wit had her smiling nonstop, her mood visibly lighter.

As for Evelyn, she watched the two with faint exasperation, though the smile on her lips never faded, betraying her contentment.

After a while, Evelyn excused herself to visit the restroom.

As she stepped out and began making her way back, her steps slowed when she spotted Nathan standing not far ahead.

She froze, her breath hitching as their eyes locked.

Nathan turned his head just as Evelyn emerged, his piercing gaze capturing hers.

###Chapter 260

Nathan's gaze was stormy, his dark eyes swirling with unspoken turmoil.

In stark contrast, Evelyn stood composed, her face an unreadable mask of serenity. After a brief, charged moment, she averted her eyes and strode forward, her steps quick and purposeful.

Just as she was about to pass him, Nathan's hand shot out, his fingers wrapping around her wrist with undeniable force, stopping her in her tracks.

Evelyn turned her head, meeting his intense stare with unwavering calm. Her voice was soft but firm as she asked, "Do you need something?"

"Why did you bring Alexander to meet your grandmother? What was the point of that?" Nathan's voice was low, laced with unmistakable irritation.

Evelyn's brows knitted slightly as she lifted her chin, her expression unshaken.

Her lips parted, her reply crisp and unyielding. "What do you mean? My friend wanted to have dinner with my grandmother. Is that a crime? Or do I need your permission now, Mr. Black?"

Nathan's jaw clenched, his gaze turning glacial as he studied her. "So, Alexander gets to dine with your grandmother, but I don't?"

The question was sharp, slicing through the thick tension between them.

His displeasure was palpable.

Evelyn's lips curled into a faint, mocking smile as she let out a derisive laugh. "Mr. Black, you seem to have a selective memory. Who was it who declared he wouldn’t attend any more of my family gatherings? Since you made your stance crystal clear before, how could I possibly defy you?"

Nathan faltered, momentarily silenced by her words.

The quiet between them was heavy, though it lasted only seconds.

Nathan’s voice shifted into something commanding, his tone firm as he said, "Regardless, Alexander isn’t allowed to—"

Evelyn’s gaze darkened, something unreadable flickering in her eyes as she pulled her wrist free from his grip.

Her voice was cool, almost detached, as she replied, "We’re practically divorced already, Mr. Black. You really shouldn’t waste your time worrying about such trivial matters, should you?"

Nathan’s expression remained shadowed, but then, something shifted in his mind.

A knowing smirk tugged at the corners of his lips as he studied her. His voice dropped to a husky murmur. "Evelyn, you don’t actually want this divorce, do you?"

Evelyn stiffened, her composure cracking for just a heartbeat.

Her lashes fluttered, betraying the storm of emotions beneath her calm facade before she let out a sharp, icy laugh. "You’re delusional. I’m counting the days until our divorce is finalized. I can’t wait."

"Is that so?" Nathan arched a brow, his expression inscrutable as he stepped closer, closing the distance between them.

###Chapter 261

Evelyn Hartley instinctively stepped back, her movements swift and guarded.

She gnawed on her lower lip, nerves fluttering in her chest, but she squared her shoulders, forcing herself to meet his piercing gaze with defiance. "Of course!"

Nathan Black didn’t stop. He advanced with deliberate, unyielding steps, his presence overwhelming.

Evelyn retreated until her back hit the wall, the cool surface pressing into her.

She tensed, immediately lifting a hand to shove against his chest.

Her brows furrowed, lips pressed into a thin line as irritation laced her voice. "Nathan! What the hell do you think you're doing?"

Her tone was sharp, but Nathan’s dark eyes bore into hers, dissecting every flicker of emotion as if he could read her thoughts.

His fingers closed around her wrist, the warmth of his touch searing.

A slow, knowing smirk curved his lips as he repeated, his voice low and dangerously smooth, "Evelyn, are you really willing to divorce me?"

Her breath hitched, the weight of his question momentarily shaking her resolve.

She inhaled sharply, steeling herself. "Of course—"

But before she could finish, Nathan’s mouth crashed down on hers.

The kiss was relentless.

Evelyn’s eyes flew open in shock, her mind blanking for a heartbeat.

It wasn’t until his tongue slid past her lips, claiming her mouth with possessive heat, that reality snapped back into place.

A muffled protest escaped her as she shoved against his chest, trying to break free.

Nathan didn’t yield.

With effortless strength, he pinned her wrists above her head, his grip firm but careful. His other arm banded around her waist, hauling her flush against him, leaving no space between them.

His kiss was fierce, intoxicating—a storm of heat and demand that left Evelyn dizzy.

For a moment, she couldn’t think, couldn’t breathe.

Why is he doing this?

But then frustration surged.

Two seconds later, she bit down—hard—on his lower lip.

"Fuck—" Nathan hissed, jerking back.

Evelyn’s teeth had drawn blood, a crimson droplet welling on his lip.

Nathan swiped his thumb across the wound, his gaze dark and unreadable, a tempest of emotions swirling in his eyes.

He had meant the kiss as a test—to see if she truly meant her words.

Yet, he hadn’t expected to lose himself in it.

And that realization pissed him off.

###Chapter 262

A crimson streak now adorned Evelyn's lips, adding a feral, irresistible allure to her already mesmerizing beauty.

Evelyn drew in a sharp breath, her gaze icy and unwavering as she spoke with cutting precision. "Nathan! I am not some plaything you can summon at your whim!"

With that final declaration, she turned on her heel and strode away without so much as a backward glance.

Nathan watched her retreat, his expression darkening with a storm of conflicting emotions. He then turned and headed toward the restroom to tend to his wounded lip.

Unseen in the shadows, a figure stirred.

Serena had followed them discreetly after witnessing Evelyn and Nathan heading toward the restroom, an uneasy feeling gnawing at her.

She hadn’t expected to witness that.

Nathan had kissed Evelyn—first.

Why? How?

Consumed by jealousy, Serena’s fingers curled into tight fists as she watched the scene unfold. Her first impulse had been to storm in, to tear them apart—but she restrained herself, painfully aware she had no right to interfere.

All she could do was seethe in silence, her eyes glinting with envy, her breaths shallow and quick with barely contained fury.

After forcing herself to take a steadying breath, Serena turned and slipped back to their table.

Nathan returned moments later.

When Theodore and Dylan spotted the bite mark on Nathan’s lip, their eyes widened in shock.

That kind of mark…

It was unmistakably from a bite.

But who could have bitten Nathan?

Earlier, both Evelyn and Serena had excused themselves to the restroom, and both had returned visibly agitated.

Theodore and Dylan exchanged baffled glances, unable to deduce who might have left the mark. They held their tongues, however, knowing better than to pry.

Soon after Evelyn returned, she and her companions concluded their meal and prepared to leave the restaurant.

As they departed, Evelyn and Lila pointedly ignored Nathan. Only Alexander made the effort to offer a polite farewell before hurrying after them.

After dinner at The Rooftop, Alexander drove Lila and Evelyn back to Vera Vista.

Choosing not to return to the Black family estate that night, Evelyn decided to stay over at Vera Vista with Lila.

###Chapter 263

The soft glow of the bedside lamp cast a warm light over the room as Evelyn settled under the covers. Eleanor turned to her granddaughter, her sharp eyes filled with concern. "Darling, you've been unusually quiet since you came back from the restroom earlier. Did something happen?"

Evelyn's lips parted, but no sound escaped.

Eleanor's expression darkened slightly as she continued, "I noticed Nathan and Serena left the table shortly after you did. When they returned, Nathan had a cut on his lip." She hesitated, the unspoken question hanging heavily between them. "Did you... run into them?"

A sudden realization struck Evelyn—Serena had also gone to the restroom at the same time. She hadn’t seen her there, which made her wonder if Serena had been lurking nearby, listening in, or if she had slipped away somewhere else entirely. A flicker of suspicion crossed Evelyn’s eyes before she answered in a low, steady voice, "No."

She pressed her lips together briefly, then added with quiet conviction, "I was the one who bit Nathan’s lip."

Eleanor’s breath hitched. Her eyes widened in shock, a storm of surprise and confusion swirling within them. Yet beneath it all, a subtle wave of relief washed over her. At least it had nothing to do with Serena...

After a long pause, Eleanor spoke again, her voice gentle but firm. "Evelyn, when it comes to you and Nathan, I just want you to think carefully before making any decisions. I don’t want you to act impulsively and regret it later."

Her words carried the weight of years of wisdom and love. She had always sensed that Nathan wasn’t as indifferent to Evelyn as he pretended to be.

Evelyn didn’t respond immediately. Her fingers traced the delicate embroidery on the bedsheet absently, her thoughts tangled. Finally, she murmured, "You should rest now, Grandma."

"Alright," Eleanor conceded with a soft sigh. She didn’t push further, knowing Evelyn needed time to sort through her emotions.

With age came the habit of early sleep, and soon, Eleanor’s breathing evened out as she drifted into a peaceful slumber.

Evelyn, however, remained awake, staring at the ceiling, her mind racing with unanswered questions.

###Chapter 264

Evelyn lay beside her, gazing blankly at the ceiling.

Sleep refused to claim her as her thoughts twisted into knots, spiraling endlessly. She couldn’t even remember when exhaustion finally dragged her under, pulling her into a fitful, uneasy slumber.

Meanwhile, at the Black family estate...

The clock ticked closer to midnight, and still, Evelyn hadn’t returned.

Nathan sat in the dimly lit study, the silence pressing in around him. Her absence weighed on him like a physical thing, gnawing at the edges of his composure. He knew she had chosen not to come back tonight.

Yet, he didn’t call her.

Just as he was about to retire for the night, his phone shattered the quiet with its sharp ring. His fingers twitched slightly before he reached for it, his expression carefully blank.

But when he saw the caller ID, his brows drew together—just a fraction—and something flickered in his gaze. Disappointment? Irritation? He didn’t even register it himself.

He answered, voice cool and detached. "Yes?"

"Nathan, you need to get to Grandview General Hospital—now! Serena—she—" Dylan’s voice was frantic, tight with urgency. "She hit her head. There’s blood everywhere, and she’s unconscious!"

Nathan’s jaw tightened as he processed the words. A beat of silence stretched before he finally spoke, his tone low. "How did this happen?"

"I don’t know the details!" Dylan snapped, breathless. "Just get here!"

The line went dead before Nathan could respond.

Dylan had already hung up.

Nathan stared at the darkened screen for a long moment before slipping the phone into his pocket, his expression unreadable. He didn’t know what to make of the churning in his chest—irritation, restlessness, something else he couldn’t name.

His fingers curled into the edge of the sheets, hesitating.

Then, with a sharp exhale, he threw them aside, swung his legs over the edge of the bed, and strode to the wardrobe. Within minutes, he was dressed and out the door, heading straight for the hospital.

At Grandview General’s VIP ward...

Nathan arrived just in time to catch the tail end of the doctor’s update to Dylan.

"She needed stitches and has a mild concussion..."

###Chapter 265
"It's nothing serious."
"We'll keep her under observation tonight. If everything checks out, she can go home tomorrow."
"Just make sure she returns for her follow-up appointment."

"Understood. Thank you, doctor," Dylan said, his voice laced with quiet concern despite his composed demeanor.

The doctor gave a curt nod before striding out of the room, his white coat fluttering behind him.

The moment the door clicked shut, Nathan stepped inside. His presence was magnetic, instantly commanding the room’s attention.

"Nathan," Dylan exhaled, relief softening his tense shoulders.

At the sound of his voice, Serena stirred weakly, her lashes fluttering open.

"Nathan…" she whispered, her voice fragile, like a threadbare whisper.

The stark white bandage wrapped around her forehead contrasted sharply with her pale skin, making her appear even more delicate.

Nathan approached the bed, his expression unreadable as he studied her. His gaze was cool, detached—almost clinical.

"What happened?" His tone was direct, devoid of warmth.

Even now, faced with Serena’s obvious injury, he didn’t ask how she was.

Serena’s fingers twitched against the sheets. "I had a nightmare," she murmured. "I must have rolled off the bed and hit the nightstand."

Nathan’s jaw tightened imperceptibly, but his face remained impassive.

Dylan cleared his throat, sensing the tension thickening the air. "I’ll give you two some privacy," he said, already backing toward the door.

Without waiting for a response, he slipped out, leaving the door slightly ajar behind him.

Serena’s eyes never left Nathan’s face. A faint smile touched her lips. "Thank you for coming," she said softly. "Just seeing you here makes the pain bearable."

Nathan remained still, his voice low and measured. "You should rest."

She ignored him, patting the empty space beside her. "Nathan, please. Sit with me for a moment. There’s something I need to tell you."

A beat of silence passed before Nathan finally relented, perching stiffly on the edge of the mattress.

The second he did, Serena lunged forward—faster than expected—and threw her arms around him, burying her face against his chest.

Nathan froze. His entire body went rigid, his expression darkening like a storm rolling in.

###Chapter 266

Without hesitation, his hands shot to her shoulders, gripping them tightly as he pushed her away, putting cold distance between them.

He remained silent, the weight of his unspoken words pressing heavily between them.

Serena looked up at him, her eyes glistening with unshed tears, brimming with desperate longing.

Her voice quivered as she whispered, "Nathan, do you know what I dreamed? I dreamed that you didn’t love me anymore, that you were walking away from me."

She swallowed hard, her fingers twisting into the fabric of her nightgown. "No matter how much I ran after you or how desperately I begged, you never even glanced back."

A shaky breath escaped her lips. "I woke up in a panic, and in my fear, I fell right off the bed."

Her lower lip trembled as she searched his face, her eyes shimmering with fragile hope. "Nathan, tell me—it was just a nightmare, wasn’t it? You won’t leave me, will you?"

When Nathan heard Serena repeat the same question yet again, his jaw tightened imperceptibly.

A flicker of irritation crossed his features before he exhaled sharply through his nose.

His dark gaze locked onto hers, unwavering and firm, as he answered in a low, rough voice, "Serena, I’ve answered this question more times than I care to remember."

Serena bit down on her lip hard enough to leave marks, her fingers curling into fists at her sides. "I just…" Her voice cracked. "I can’t shake this fear. Nathan, you don’t understand—I feel like I’m drowning in uncertainty."

A tear slipped free, tracing a slow path down her cheek. "I’m terrified that one day, you’ll walk away and never look back."

Her breath hitched as she clutched at his sleeve, her eyes pleading. "Nathan, don’t you see? Without you, I—" She choked on the words. "I wouldn’t even know how to breathe anymore."

Nathan’s expression darkened further, the weight of her desperation pressing down on him like a suffocating blanket.

His tone turned icy, sharp enough to cut. "Everyone has their own path, Serena. You can’t tie your entire existence to another person. You need to find meaning in your own life."

Serena’s gaze dropped to the floor, her tears falling freely now, silent sobs wracking her slender frame.

She didn’t argue, didn’t speak—only the quiet sound of her crying filled the tense silence between them.

Nathan clenched his teeth, the echo of her words sitting like a lead weight in his chest. The pressure was unbearable, tightening around his ribs until it was hard to draw a full breath.

His patience was wearing dangerously thin, but he forced himself to remain composed.

With a clipped exhale, he finally said, "Get some rest." His voice left no room for negotiation.

Serena gave a small, jerky nod, wiping at her tears with the back of her hand. But just as Nathan turned to leave, she lunged forward suddenly, her lips aiming for his cheek.

Nathan’s eyes widened in shock, his body recoiling instinctively before her lips could make contact.

The near-kiss hung in the air between them, unfinished.

Serena froze, her expression shattering into raw hurt as she stared at him, her breath coming in shallow gasps.

The rejection stung worse than any slap.

###Chapter 267

Nathan's lips thinned into a tight line, his voice dropping to a dangerously low timbre. "Serena, I'm still a married man. You know this isn't appropriate."

Serena's cheeks burned crimson, humiliation and hurt flashing in her widened eyes. Her fingers twisted into the fabric of her dress as she stammered, "I—I didn't mean to overstep, Nathan. It was just... a moment of weakness."

Nathan's expression remained unreadable, his gaze icy and detached. Without softening, he clipped out, "Get some rest. I'm leaving."

His tone brooked no argument.

Then, he turned sharply and strode out, the door clicking shut behind him with finality.

Serena stared at the closed door, her chest tightening. She bit down hard on her lower lip, disappointment crashing over her in waves. She had hoped—foolishly—that Nathan might stay. That tonight would be different.

But no.

Ten minutes.

That was all the time he'd spared her before walking away.

Outside, Dylan Reeves—who had been lurking in the hallway, phone discreetly recording through the cracked door—jerked back the second Nathan stepped out. He shoved the device into his pocket and feigned innocence, putting distance between himself and the scene.

The moment Nathan crossed the threshold, his shoulders relaxed marginally. A quiet exhale escaped him.

"Nathan," Dylan called, stepping forward with a carefully constructed look of concern. He lowered his voice, injecting just the right amount of urgency. "Serena hasn't been herself lately. Her mental state is... fragile. If you could just spend a little more time with her—talk to her—it would mean everything."

Nathan turned, his expression unyielding. "What Serena needs," he said coolly, "isn't me. It's a professional. I'll have my assistant arrange for the best psychologist in the city."

Dylan stiffened, caught off guard. His brows knit together in confusion. Since when did Nathan suggest therapy? Since when did he not indulge Serena's whims?

"But Nathan, you've always—"

"I'm done here," Nathan cut in, his tone leaving no room for debate. "The psychologist will be arranged by tomorrow."

Without waiting for a response, he walked away, his footsteps echoing down the hall with unshakable finality.

###Chapter 268

Dylan stood frozen in place, his piercing gaze following Nathan's retreating figure down the sterile hospital corridor. His brows knitted together, a storm of confusion brewing in his sharp blue eyes.

What the hell just happened?

This tactic had always worked before. Nathan had never brushed him off so coldly—never dismissed him like some insignificant nuisance.

So why now?

A dark suspicion slithered into Dylan’s mind, twisting his handsome features into something far more sinister.

Could Evelyn be the reason?

The thought burned through him, igniting a flicker of frustration in his chest. But then—his lips curled into a slow, calculating smirk as he remembered the damning photos he had just captured.

Pulling his phone from his pocket, he scrolled through the incriminating images, satisfaction coiling in his gut.

Perfect.

Without hesitation, he sent them straight to Evelyn.

Dylan’s smirk deepened, his mind already conjuring up her reaction—whether it would be shock, anger, or something even more delicious.

Whatever it was, it would be…

Entertaining.

Sliding his phone back into his pocket, he turned on his heel and strode into the hospital room.

The moment he entered, Serena’s tear-filled eyes locked onto him, her usual composed facade shattered.

"Dylan," she whispered, her voice trembling. "What am I supposed to do now?"

The raw vulnerability in her tone caught him off guard. He had never seen Serena like this—so fragile, so broken.

"I can feel Nathan pulling away from me," she admitted, her fingers twisting anxiously in the sheets. "He’s different now… colder."

Dylan moved closer, resting a reassuring hand on her shoulder. "Don’t worry," he murmured, his voice smooth and controlled.

But he had noticed it too—Nathan’s growing detachment from Serena.

Biting her lip, Serena leaned in, her voice dropping to a desperate whisper. "You’ve seen it too, haven’t you? Nathan and Evelyn… they’re—"

Her breath hitched, her chest rising and falling rapidly as panic clawed at her. "What if he changes his mind about divorcing her? What do I do then?"

Dylan’s expression darkened, a shadow passing over his sharp features. "We need to destroy whatever’s between them," he said, his voice low and dangerous. "Before it’s too late."

Serena’s eyes searched his face, desperation etched into every line of her delicate features. "But how?"

Dylan’s lips curved into a chilling smile. "Don’t worry, Serena. I have a plan."

###Chapter 269

A wave of relief washed over Serena, and she offered a faint smile. "I'm so grateful you're here to help me, Dylan," she murmured sincerely.

Dylan returned her smile, his fingers gently tousling her hair. "You should rest now. You need it."

"Okay," Serena whispered, nodding as she settled back against the pillows. The dull throb in her temples made it difficult to focus, so she allowed herself to drift into much-needed sleep.

The Next Morning

The sharp trill of the alarm shattered the silence of the room.

Evelyn groaned softly before reaching out to silence it. She stretched languidly, then swung her legs over the edge of the bed, moving through her morning routine with practiced efficiency.

By the time she finished getting ready, the rich aroma of breakfast filled the air.

Eleanor had already prepared a warm meal for her.

"Thank you, Grandma," Evelyn said, her voice warm as she pulled Eleanor into a tight embrace.

"Enough of that," Eleanor chuckled, patting her back. "Hurry up and eat, or you'll be late for work."

"Okay," Evelyn agreed with a nod, sliding into her seat.

She began eating, her mood light and carefree—until she pulled her phone from her pocket.

Absently, she scrolled through her notifications, first checking WhatsApp before moving to her text messages.

Her brows knitted together as she spotted new messages from Dylan.

Curious, she tapped the screen to open them.

Her eyes flickered over the two photos—and in an instant, her expression darkened. Shock and disbelief twisted her features as her grip on the phone turned white-knuckled.

The images were taken in a hospital.

The first showed Nathan seated on a hospital bed, Serena leaning weakly against him, her posture fragile and dependent. Nathan's arms were raised, as if he were about to pull her into an embrace.

The second photo was worse.

Serena pressing a kiss to Nathan’s cheek, her expression soft, intimate.

Evelyn's beautiful face turned to ice, her jaw tightening as fury coiled in her chest.

"Evelyn? What's wrong?" Eleanor's voice cut through the tension. She had just stepped out of the kitchen and immediately noticed the storm brewing in her granddaughter's eyes.

###Chapter 270

Eleanor Sinclair's concern was palpable as she studied her granddaughter's face.

When Eleanor posed the question, Evelyn Hartley quickly blinked, forcing her emotions back under control. Drawing a steadying breath, she tucked her phone away and met her grandmother's gaze, her voice deliberately even. "It's nothing, Grandma. Just a difficult case—a patient with a poor prognosis. It's weighing on me."

Eleanor's sharp eyes lingered on Evelyn, her intuition telling her there was more to the story. But she respected her granddaughter's privacy and didn't press further.

"Alright," she murmured, though her expression remained troubled.

Evelyn shifted the conversation to lighter topics, laughing and chatting, but the strain in her smile didn’t escape Eleanor’s notice. No one knew Evelyn better than her grandmother, and Eleanor could see right through the facade.

After breakfast, Evelyn left the Sinclair estate. The moment the elevator doors closed behind her, the carefully constructed mask shattered. Her expression darkened, the weight of the photos burning in her mind. A bitter, humorless laugh escaped her lips.

Just hours ago, Nathan Black had kissed her with such intensity that it left her shaken—only for her to receive photos of him wrapped around another woman, kissing her with the same effortless passion.

Nathan truly was a master at juggling women, wasn’t he?

Evelyn’s lips curled into a sardonic smile as she replayed the events in her head. The memory of how flustered she’d been by his kiss last night now made her feel ridiculous.

Why had Dylan sent her those photos?

What was he trying to prove?

Did he want her to know Nathan had always loved Serena Cole, that she should just step aside and file for divorce? Or was this just another twisted game to provoke her?

A cold glint flickered in Evelyn’s eyes.

Some people really had no shame.

They dismissed her warnings, assuming she was too soft to act. They thought she would endure their games in silence, that she was an easy target.

Well.

They were about to learn how wrong they were.

Stepping out of the elevator, Evelyn pulled out her phone and dialed a number.

###Chapter 271

Two hours later, the internet exploded with a scandalous revelation.

"Exclusive! The secret wife of Blackstone Group's CEO, Nathan Black, finally exposed! She's none other than Serena Cole, the renowned violinist from the Sonata Philharmonic!"

The post went viral across all social media platforms, amassing millions of views and comments within minutes.

"I always knew Mr. Black married young, but I never imagined his wife would be Serena Cole! She's phenomenal—I've attended her concerts before. Her violin skills are mesmerizing!"

"Ugh, so jealous! Being married to the CEO of Blackstone Group is every woman's dream!"

"They look absolutely perfect together!"

"Honestly? I don’t think Serena is even in Nathan’s league. She’s talented, sure, but looks-wise? Not even close."

The gossip spread like wildfire, igniting endless debates.

Even the doctors at Grand Oak General Hospital’s Cardiac Surgery Department couldn’t resist discussing it during their break.

"Did you see the trending news? Nathan Black’s wife is actually Serena Cole!" one doctor exclaimed, eyes gleaming with intrigue.

Another leaned in, lowering their voice. "I heard from the ER nurses that Mr. Black has been seen visiting Serena’s hospital room multiple times. People suspected they were dating, but married? That’s a bombshell!"

Evelyn Hartley stood nearby, her expression icy and composed as she listened to their conversation.

Her sharp eyes narrowed slightly, a dangerous glint flashing in their depths.

Within seconds, her lips curled into a mocking smirk, her gaze dripping with sarcasm.

Lila Sinclair, who had been eavesdropping, glanced at Evelyn with barely concealed amusement.

She wondered how Evelyn would react if she saw the photos and comments online, all praising Nathan and Serena as the perfect couple.

The thought filled Lila with vicious satisfaction.

So what if Evelyn was Nathan’s real wife? Hardly anyone knew.

Who even recognized Evelyn as Mrs. Black?

Now, the world was buzzing about Serena being Nathan’s beloved wife.

No one had a clue that Evelyn was the one truly married to him.

The sheer irony of it made Lila want to laugh.

Just as Evelyn stepped out of the office, her phone rang.

She pulled it out, frowning slightly at the caller ID before answering.

"Grandma."

###Chapter 272

"Evelyn, what's this nonsense I'm seeing all over social media?" Eleanor's voice was sharp with disapproval through the phone.

Evelyn froze. "Grandmother, how did you—"

"Isabelle showed me," Eleanor cut in. There was a brief pause before she continued, her tone accusatory. "You were acting strange at breakfast. Had you already seen those posts?"

Evelyn exhaled slowly, gripping her phone tighter. "Grandmother, please, not now. I'll explain everything later."

On the other end, Eleanor's frustration was palpable. "No, Evelyn. I'm done being kept in the dark! But mark my words—I stand by you filing for divorce. Do it immediately and put an end to this circus!"

Before Evelyn could respond, the line went dead.

She pressed her lips together, emotions churning inside her. After a moment, she shoved her phone into her pocket and kept walking, her steps quickening as if she could outpace the storm brewing around her.

Meanwhile, Dylan's phone buzzed—his father's name flashing on the screen.

He answered warily. "Father, I—"

"Dylan!" Gregory Thornton's voice was a whip crack of fury. "What in God's name is going on between you and Serena? Did I not make myself clear? Keep her away from Nathan! And now this? Have you lost your mind?"

Dylan stiffened, thrown by the outburst. "Father, what are you talking about?"

"Don't play dumb!" Gregory snapped. "Check social media. It's a disgrace!" The call ended abruptly.

Frowning, Dylan pulled up the trending feed—and his blood ran cold.

There, at the top, were two damning photos.

His jaw clenched.

How?

He had only sent these to Evelyn.

Had she leaked them herself? The thought sent a dark ripple of suspicion through him.

Scrolling down, he skimmed the comments—most praising Serena's beauty, until one stood out, gaining traction fast:

"I work at Blackstone Holdings. Let me clarify—Serena is NOT the CEO's wife. His actual wife is someone else entirely. From what I know, Serena used to be Mr. Black's ex, but they split years ago."

###Chapter 273

The post ignited a firestorm across social media, sending shockwaves through every comment section. Within minutes, the internet was ablaze with speculation and outrage.

"Hold on—Serena isn't actually Nathan Black’s wife? Then why are there photos of them looking so intimate? If she’s not married to him, why was she kissing him like that?"

"This reeks of scandal! How reckless can Serena be? She knows full well Nathan is married, yet she’s still throwing herself at him. Disgusting! What kind of woman does something like this? She’s nothing but a homewrecker!"

"And let’s not pretend Nathan is innocent here! He’s a married man—how is it acceptable for him to be tangled up with an ex like this? Imagine how his wife must feel!"

"I always had my doubts. Rumor has it Nathan’s real wife is reclusive and has a distinctive birthmark on her face. Serena clearly doesn’t match that description!"

"Exactly! I’ve heard those rumors too!"

"Let’s boycott this shameless woman! Cancel Serena! She needs to answer for her actions—why is she cozying up to a married man? Has she no self-respect?"

"She’s vile!"

Serena’s public image crumbled in an instant, her reputation shifting from admired to reviled. Hate flooded her social media accounts, each comment more venomous than the last. The backlash was relentless.

Dylan Reeves clenched his phone, his face darkening as he scrolled through the chaos. If Nathan ever traced this post back to him, the consequences would be catastrophic.

A cold sweat broke across his skin. He had been the one to leak those photos.

Panic set in. He immediately began dialing every media contact he had, desperate to have the post taken down. But one call after another yielded the same answer—it was too late. The story had gone viral.

"Damn it!" Dylan slammed his fist against the steering wheel. "How did this spiral out of control so fast?"

Just as he was about to call Evelyn Hartley, his phone buzzed—Serena was calling. He answered instantly.

"Dylan… what the hell is happening online? Where did those photos even come from?" Serena’s voice trembled with panic.

"Serena, just stay calm. I’m almost at the hospital. We’ll figure this out when I get there." He ended the call before she could protest.

Five minutes later, Dylan strode into Serena’s hospital room. The moment he entered, she turned to him, her eyes wide with fear.

"Dylan…" Her voice cracked. "What are we going to do?"

###Chapter 274

Dylan approached Serena with a grim expression, his jaw clenched tight.

"I owe you an apology, Serena. This mess is my fault," Dylan admitted, his voice heavy with regret.

"What?" Serena blinked in confusion, her fingers tightening around the edge of her coat.

Dylan exhaled sharply. "I was the one who took those photos. I sent them to Evelyn. I thought they would prove to her that Nathan only had eyes for you—that he loved you more than anyone else. I never imagined they'd end up online."

The backlash had been far worse than he'd anticipated, spiraling out of control before he could react.

Serena's breath hitched, her face paling.

So Dylan had been the one behind the photos?

After a moment of stunned silence, she swallowed hard. "Dylan... do you think Evelyn leaked them?"

"Who else would?" he snapped, his eyes darkening with anger.

"But what do we do now?" Serena's voice trembled, her nails digging into her palms. "The entire internet is calling me a homewrecker! My social media is flooded with hate. If I don’t fix this, my career is over." Tears welled in her eyes, threatening to spill.

Dylan placed a steadying hand on her shoulder. "Just breathe, Serena." He hesitated, then squared his shoulders. "I started this. I'll end it."

A flicker of hope lit up her face. "How?"

"First, I need to figure out what really happened." With that, Dylan turned on his heel and strode out of the hospital room.

He marched straight to the Cardiac Surgery Department. When he arrived, he spotted Evelyn inside a patient’s room, speaking softly to a young boy.

Dylan paused in the doorway, struck by the tenderness in her expression. The boy—clearly nervous about his upcoming surgery—clung to Evelyn’s every word as she reassured him. It was a side of her Dylan had never seen before. Her voice was soothing, her touch gentle, radiating warmth that could melt even the iciest of hearts.

For a moment, he was mesmerized.

Then the boy pointed at him, and Evelyn’s head snapped up.

Her expression instantly hardened, her lips pressing into a thin line. After a beat, she turned back to the boy. "Be good for your mom, okay? I’ll see you before your surgery tomorrow."

The boy nodded eagerly. "Promise?"

"Promise." She ruffled his hair before standing, her smile vanishing the second she faced Dylan.

Without a word, she brushed past him. "Follow me," she ordered coldly.

Dylan gritted his teeth, snapping out of his daze. How had he let himself be distracted by her? Scowling, he quickened his pace to catch up.

They reached the rooftop garden before Evelyn finally stopped. She whirled around, her eyes sharp as ice. "What do you want?"

Dylan met her glare head-on. "Evelyn. Did you leak those photos?"

###Chapter 275

"Yes," Evelyn Hartley admitted without hesitation.

Nathan Black's piercing gaze narrowed as he demanded, "Why? What's your game here? Why would you post those photos?"

Evelyn's laugh was sharp, laced with mockery. "Oh, Mr. Reeves, how amusing. You sent them to me. What I do with them is my choice. I assumed you wanted the world to see your cousin’s little indiscretions. I was simply helping your cause."

Her voice dripped with sarcasm, each word deliberate.

Nathan’s expression twisted in fury, his jaw tightening. But Evelyn remained unshaken, stepping forward with icy composure.

Caught off guard, Nathan instinctively took half a step back.

Evelyn tilted her chin up, meeting his glare with a frosty stare of her own. "I warned Serena Cole to stay away from my husband. She chose to ignore me. So tell me—why should I show her mercy? If she’s so desperate to be the other woman, then let the world see exactly what she is."

Nathan’s face darkened as her words sank in. He had sent those photos to drive a wedge between Evelyn and Nathan, never imagining she’d weaponize them so publicly. The fallout would be disastrous—for Serena, for Nathan’s reputation, for everything.

A muscle twitched in his jaw. "You’re playing with fire."

Evelyn’s lips curled into a cold smile. "And you’ve underestimated me for the last time, Dylan. Push me again, and I won’t hold back."

She turned to leave, but Nathan grabbed her arm. "Wait!" His voice was rough with urgency. "Take those photos down. Now."

Evelyn arched a brow, unfazed. "Why would I? The world deserves to see them."

His grip tightened. "Think about Nathan! Do you really want to humiliate him like this?"

Her laugh was bitter. "Why should I care about his reputation?" Had Nathan ever considered her feelings when he was sneaking around with Serena?

Nathan faltered, stunned by her callousness.

Before he could respond, Evelyn wrenched free and strode away. He watched her go, his expression darkening into something dangerous.

At Black Enterprises, a knock sounded on the CEO’s office door.

"Come in," Nathan called.

Walter Kingsley, his assistant, entered with a grim expression. He placed a tablet on the desk.

"Sir, you need to see this."

###Chapter 276

Nathan Black picked up the tablet, his fingers gliding across the screen with practiced ease. But the moment his eyes landed on the two incriminating photos, his entire body tensed. His first thought was razor-sharp—Had Evelyn seen these?

Damn it.

His jaw clenched as he stared at the images, his mind racing. Where the hell had these come from? Who had dared to leak them?

With a sharp exhale, he slammed the tablet onto his desk, the sound echoing through the office. His voice was ice. "Get these taken down. Now. And find out who posted them."

Walter Kingsley hesitated, his expression flickering with unease. Nathan caught it immediately. His gaze darkened. "Speak."

Walter swallowed. "We've already traced the source, sir. The photos… were posted by people hired by your wife."

Nathan froze.

Evelyn?

His fingers curled into a fist. "Say that again."

Walter met his gaze, steady despite the tension. "Your wife arranged for them to be uploaded."

A cold, dangerous stillness settled over Nathan. His mind spun. Why?

And then it hit him—Dylan.

That day at the hospital, the door had been slightly ajar when he left Serena’s room. Dylan must have been lurking outside, waiting for the perfect shot.

Nathan’s expression darkened further, his voice barely above a whisper. "Take down the trending post immediately."

Walter nodded sharply and left.

Nathan grabbed his phone, dialing Dylan’s number without hesitation. The call connected after two rings.

"Nathan—"

"My office. Now."

He hung up before Dylan could respond.

Dylan Reeves arrived at Blackstone Enterprises within twenty minutes, his pulse unsteady. Nathan’s tone had been deceptively calm, but that only made it worse.

Stepping into the office, he found Nathan standing by the floor-to-ceiling windows, his back turned. The air was thick with tension.

"You wanted to see me?" Dylan ventured cautiously.

Nathan turned slowly, his gaze piercing. "Do you know why you're here?"

Dylan exhaled, his fingers tightening at his sides. There was no point lying. "Yes. The photos. I sent them to Evelyn."

Nathan’s eyes narrowed.

Dylan continued, voice low. "I wanted to drive a wedge between you two. After Serena came back from The Rooftop, she was hysterical—convinced you had feelings for Evelyn. She was terrified you’d abandon her. I couldn’t stand seeing her like that. So when I saw you with her at the hospital, I took the photos. I sent them to Evelyn, hoping she’d walk away."

Silence.

Then—

Nathan’s fist crashed onto the desk with a force that made Dylan flinch.

###Chapter 277

The simple gesture cut Dylan off mid-sentence, his words dying in his throat. He flinched, his eyes flickering under Nathan’s unrelenting stare.

Nathan didn’t look away, his gaze sharp as a blade, radiating an icy dominance that made the air thick with tension. His voice was low, dangerous. "Whatever happens between Evelyn and me is our business. Since when did it concern you?"

The coldness in his tone sent a visible shudder down Dylan’s spine.

"I—I was just trying to help Serena," Dylan stammered, scrambling for an excuse.

Nathan leaned back in his chair, silent for a beat, his expression unreadable. Then, with chilling calmness, he delivered the blow. "You’re removed from the East District project. Effective immediately."

Dylan’s face drained of color. His lips parted, but no sound came out.

"Nathan—" His voice cracked, betraying his panic.

Deep down, he knew. Nathan had discovered he was the one who sent those photos to Evelyn. He had expected anger—but not this. Not the complete annihilation of his involvement in the most crucial project the Reeves family had ever secured.

The East District deal was supposed to elevate their status in Owathe. The entire family had staked their future on it. And now, with a single sentence, Nathan had ripped it all away.

The realization hit him like a freight train. This wasn’t just about the project. It was about Evelyn.

Two photos. That was all it took for Nathan to react this violently.

She mattered to him. More than Dylan had ever realized.

"Nathan, please!" Desperation clawed at his throat. "I swear, I won’t ever interfere again! Just give me one more chance!"

Serena’s problems were the last thing on his mind now. If his father found out he’d lost the project because of this—

He didn’t even want to imagine the fallout.

Nathan’s expression didn’t waver. His voice was steel. "When have I ever reversed a decision? This is final."

Dylan’s hands clenched into fists, his knuckles white.

Nathan stood abruptly, his presence towering, his gaze glacial. "Consider this your last warning. If you cross this line again, don’t expect our friendship to save you."

Dylan swallowed hard, his mind racing. After a tense silence, he finally dared to voice the question burning in his chest.

"Nathan… you’ve fallen for Evelyn, haven’t you? You don’t want to divorce her anymore."

Nathan’s face remained impassive. He met Dylan’s gaze head-on, his reply cutting and final.

"That’s none of your concern." A dismissive tilt of his chin. "Get out."

Jaw clenched, Dylan turned on his heel and stormed out.

The moment he stepped out of Black Enterprises, the weight of his mistake crashed down on him.

Two photos. That was all it took to ruin everything.

His future. His family’s ambitions. All gone.

His steps were heavy as he walked away, his mind reeling.

How had things spiraled so far out of control?

###Chapter 278

Back in his office, Nathan Black's expression remained stormy and unreadable. Dylan Reeves' words echoed in his mind... Had he truly fallen for Evelyn Hartley? The idea of divorcing her now was unthinkable? Preposterous! It wasn't about her—it was about principle. He couldn't tolerate deception, no matter who was involved.

Yet, he couldn't shake the question... Why had Evelyn posted those photos? What was she trying to accomplish?

That evening, at the sprawling Black family estate. Both having worked late, Evelyn and Nathan arrived home almost simultaneously, their cars pulling into the garage one after the other.

Evelyn spotted Nathan's car but deliberately ignored it. She stepped out, slamming her door with deliberate force, and strode toward the house without a backward glance.

Nathan's brow furrowed slightly, but he said nothing as he exited his own car and followed her inside.

Winston Graves, the family butler, raised an eyebrow at their synchronized arrival. "Mr. and Mrs. Black, you're home," he greeted, then hesitated before adding, "Mr. Black, your father is waiting for you both in the living room."

"Understood," Nathan replied curtly, and the two proceeded down the hall.

Leonard Grant and Margaret Hayes sat stiffly on the living room sofa. The room was eerily silent, the television off. Leonard's expression was stern, disapproval etched into every line of his face.

"Father," Nathan said, breaking the tense quiet.

Leonard's voice was sharp. "Do you have any idea what you've done? You've gone too far this time!"

Nathan took a seat, his face impassive.

"Explain to me what happened between you and Serena Cole," Leonard demanded, his tone clipped.

Nathan remained composed as he recounted the events. "Dylan called to inform me Serena had been hospitalized after a head injury. I went to check on her—nothing more."

Leonard's jaw tightened. "And yet, you ended up embracing her? Kissing her?"

Nathan exhaled. "It wasn't like that. When she hugged me, I pulled away immediately. The photo is misleading—it wasn't a kiss."

Evelyn remained silent, her expression unreadable.

Leonard's glare softened slightly, but his voice remained firm. "Nathan, you are married. You must consider Evelyn's feelings in everything you do."

Nathan lowered his gaze, pausing before responding in a quiet, measured tone. "I realize my mistake. It won't happen again."

His last words were directed at Evelyn, but she refused to meet his eyes, her posture rigid with indifference.

Breaking the silence, Margaret suddenly spoke. "Nathan, have you discovered who leaked those photos?"

Evelyn's lips parted slightly, as if she were about to speak. "The photos were—"

...

###Chapter 279

Before Evelyn could finish her sentence, Nathan swiftly cut in, "Dylan was behind the photos..."

"I've traced the uploader. They were just looking to create chaos."

Evelyn froze, her wide eyes locking onto Nathan’s. For a moment, she couldn’t find her voice. Why was he shielding her? He had to know she was the one who orchestrated the leak.

She had braced herself for this—ready to confess if Leonard or Margaret confronted her, prepared to bear the backlash. Her actions had been fueled by vengeance against Serena, but they’d also painted Nathan as the villain in the public eye. At the time, emotions had clouded her judgment, pushing her to act recklessly. Yet, she never expected Nathan to step in and cover for her.

Leonard slammed his fist on the table, his anger palpable. "Dylan’s behavior is unacceptable! I’m calling Gregory right now—does his family think they can meddle in our lives without consequences?"

Nathan stayed silent. Leonard’s expression softened slightly as he turned to Evelyn. "I’ll handle this. Don’t worry."

"Thank you," Evelyn murmured, nodding gratefully.

"It’s been a long day. Both of you should get some rest," Leonard said, gesturing toward the stairs.

Evelyn stood. "You should rest too."

Leonard gave a tired smile. "I will."

They ascended the stairs in silence, the weight of the evening pressing between them. Once inside their bedroom, Evelyn turned to Nathan the moment the door clicked shut.

"Nathan," she began, her voice steady, "you know I arranged for those photos to be leaked, don’t you?"

She searched his face, waiting for confirmation.

"Yes," he answered simply, his tone unreadable.

Evelyn held his gaze. "Aren’t you going to ask why I did it?"

A faint smirk tugged at his lips. "I assumed it was your way of retaliating against Serena—and maybe me, too."

She blinked slowly, surprised by his insight. "Then why did you cover for me in front of your parents?"

Nathan studied her for a long moment before responding in a low, measured tone, "Because complicating things further benefits no one." With that, he turned and walked into the bathroom, leaving Evelyn standing there, her thoughts swirling.

After a beat, she exhaled sharply and left the room, heading straight for Leonard’s study.

When she arrived, Leonard and Margaret had just settled in. Leonard looked up, brows furrowed. "Evelyn? Is something wrong?"

Evelyn straightened her shoulders. "There’s something I need to tell you both. I can’t keep it from you any longer."

Before they could react, she continued, her voice firm. "I was the one who leaked those photos."

She refused to hide the truth any longer—especially not from Leonard.

###Chapter 280

"What? You orchestrated this?" Margaret gasped before Leonard could speak.

After a weighted pause, she demanded, "But why?"

Evelyn answered coolly, "Dylan sent me those photos. He kept gloating about how Nathan doted on Serena, how inseparable they were. I ignored it at first, but his taunts made it seem like my silence was weakness. I warned Serena repeatedly to stay away from my husband. She ignored me—once, twice, until her audacity became unbearable. So I decided the world should see her for what she truly is."

Margaret’s disapproval sharpened. "You humiliated Serena, but Nathan got dragged into the scandal too."

Evelyn’s lips thinned briefly.

Before she could retort, Leonard cut in, voice like steel. "And why shouldn’t he be?"

He fixed Margaret with a piercing stare. "Tell me, is Nathan blameless? Wasn’t it him sneaking out at midnight to meet another woman? Wasn’t it him letting Serena cling to him? If he’d hesitated a second longer, wouldn’t her lips have been on his? How can you defend him?"

Margaret floundered, caught off guard. Leonard’s tone brooked no argument. "Evelyn did nothing wrong. The public outrage is justified. A married man has no business being that close to an ex."

Turning to Evelyn, his expression softened. "You have my full support in this."

Gratitude warmed Evelyn’s eyes. "Thank you, Leonard." She rose gracefully. "I’ll let you rest now."

"Get some sleep yourself," he urged.

"I will." With a nod, she left.

The door clicked shut. Margaret rounded on Leonard. "How could you side against our son? She’s practically a stranger!"

Leonard remained unshaken. "Evelyn is family. And tell me—did Nathan behave like a devoted husband?"

Margaret hesitated, then muttered, "Fine, he wasn’t perfect. But Evelyn should’ve considered his reputation!"

A dry laugh escaped Leonard. "Did Nathan consider hers when he crept out to meet Serena?" He patted her hand, gentler now. "Try seeing this through her eyes."

Margaret fell silent, chewing her lip.

Then Leonard added, eyes glinting, "What fascinates me is Nathan covering for Evelyn. Now that’s telling, don’t you think?"

Margaret blinked. "Maybe he doesn’t know she’s behind it?"

Leonard arched a brow. "You really underestimate our son."

Margaret had no answer to that.

###Chapter 281

Leonard's expression darkened as a sudden realization struck him. "I need to call Gregory right away."

He snatched his phone from his pocket, scrolling through his contacts until he found Gregory Thornton's number. The call connected almost instantly.

"Leonard," Gregory's voice came through the line, laced with unmistakable tension.

"Gregory," Leonard cut in sharply, his tone icy. "If you can't control your children, I'll be more than happy to step in. Does your family have no sense of decency? Should I hire someone to teach you all what shame means?"

Gregory stiffened at the verbal lashing. Never in his years as head of the Thornton family had he been spoken to with such brutal directness—and worse, he knew he had no defense.

His face burned with humiliation as he swallowed his pride. "You're right, Leonard. This is entirely Dylan and Serena's fault. I'll handle it personally. I assure you, it won't happen again."

Leonard's voice remained cold, measured. "Gregory, don't let your business pursuits blind you to your responsibilities as a father. Meddling in another man's marriage is disgraceful. I won't repeat myself. From this moment on, all business dealings between our families are terminated. Keep your son and niece away from Nathan and Evelyn—permanently."

Gregory's face drained of color, panic flashing in his eyes. "Leonard, wait—"

But Leonard cut him off with finality. "If this happens again, don't expect mercy."

The line went dead.

"Leonard—?" Gregory stared at his phone, disbelief warring with fury. His hands trembled slightly as he took a deep, steadying breath.

"What's wrong?" Cassandra asked, her brow furrowed in concern.

Gregory shoved her hand away, his glare locking onto Dylan. "On your knees. Now."

Dylan dropped to the floor with a heavy thud.

"Happy now?" Gregory's voice rose, veins pulsing at his temples. "Not only have we lost the East District project, but Leonard has severed all ties with us!"

Dylan and Serena, standing nearby, paled. The consequences had spiraled far beyond what they'd anticipated.

A beat of silence passed before Serena abruptly knelt beside Dylan.

"Get up!" Gregory snapped.

Serena kept her head bowed. "This is my fault, Uncle Gregory. I take full responsibility."

###Chapter 282

"Get up!" Gregory Thornton's voice was like ice, cutting through the tense air.

"Serena, just stand," Cassandra Whitmore urged gently, her eyes filled with concern.

Serena Cole hesitated, then slowly rose to her feet, her hands trembling slightly.

"You are not a Thornton by blood, which means I have no right to discipline you," Gregory stated coldly.

Serena's breath hitched, shock flashing across her face. He had always treated her like his own daughter—until now. This betrayal had severed whatever familial bond remained between them.

Dylan Reeves, desperation lacing his voice, cried out, "Father!"

"Quiet!" Gregory snapped.

After a weighted pause, he continued, his tone sharp as a blade. "Did I not make it clear that Serena was to stay away from Nathan until his divorce was finalized? What was your promise to me? You agreed without hesitation, only to scheme behind my back."

"Do you take me for a fool?"

Dylan lowered his head, silent.

Gregory let out a humorless laugh. "Your silence won't save you. Today, you will learn the consequences of disobedience. Maxwell, fetch my whip."

The room tensed at his command, the air thickening with dread.

"Gregory, please!" Cassandra rushed forward, clutching his arm. "Dylan knows he was wrong. Spare him this once!"

Tears streamed down Serena's face as she dropped to her knees. "Uncle Gregory, punish me instead! This was all my fault—Dylan only wanted to help me!"

Gregory remained unmoved, his gaze hardening as he turned to the butler. "Maxwell, did I stutter? Bring me the whip."

With visible reluctance, Maxwell Fletcher bowed and left, his footsteps heavy with unease.

Dylan stayed kneeling, his back straight, his jaw clenched. He knew better than to beg. His father's rage needed an outlet, and words would only fan the flames.

Moments later, Maxwell returned, holding a thick, coiled horsewhip.

Gregory took it without hesitation, his grip tightening as he positioned himself behind Dylan. Without warning, he raised the whip and brought it down with a sharp crack.

The lash split the air like thunder, striking Dylan's back with brutal force. A choked gasp escaped him, his body jerking forward from the impact.

Gregory didn't stop.

Again.

Again.

By the fifth strike, Dylan's strength gave out, and he collapsed onto the floor, his breathing ragged.

Cassandra lunged forward, gripping Gregory's arm with all her strength. "Enough! He can't take any more!"

###Chapter 283

"Release me!" Gregory Thornton roared, his voice laced with unbridled rage.

"I won't!" Cassandra Whitmore shot back, her fingers tightening around his arm in defiance.

"Maxwell!" Gregory barked, his tone sharp with command.

Maxwell Fletcher hurried forward, gently but firmly pulling Cassandra away from Gregory.

The moment Cassandra was moved aside, Gregory raised the whip again, ready to bring it down on Dylan Reeves once more.

But before the strike could land, Serena Cole suddenly dropped to her knees, her voice trembling with desperation. "Uncle Gregory, please stop! Don't hurt Dylan anymore. This is all my fault—punish me instead!"

Gregory's icy gaze flickered toward her, his voice cutting through the tension like a blade. "Serena, step back. I am disciplining my son, and you have no right to interfere."

Tears welled in Serena's reddened eyes, but she refused to move, her knees rooted to the floor in silent defiance.

Gregory's expression darkened, but he said nothing more to her. Instead, he lifted the whip again and brought it down with a searing crack across Dylan's back.

"Dylan!" Serena's scream tore through the room, raw with anguish.

A pained groan escaped Dylan's lips as his body jerked violently from the force of the blow.

Strike after merciless strike followed, Gregory showing no mercy as he delivered twenty lashes in total. Only then did he finally lower the whip, his chest heaving with exertion.

Looming over Dylan's battered form, Gregory cast a cold glance at Serena, still kneeling beside him. Then, in a voice like frost, he said, "This is your final warning. If something like this happens again, a whipping will be the least of your concerns."

With that, Gregory let out a derisive scoff, tossed the whip aside carelessly, and strode out of the room without a backward glance.

"Dylan… Are you okay?" Serena whispered, her voice shaking as she reached for him, her heart breaking at the sight of his pain.

"Don't—don't touch me!" Dylan hissed through gritted teeth, his body trembling violently.

His face was deathly pale, slick with sweat, and every slight movement sent fresh waves of agony through him.

Just then, Cassandra rushed to his side, followed closely by several servants, their faces etched with worry.

"Quick, take him upstairs! Call the family doctor immediately!" she ordered, tears streaming down her cheeks.

"Aunt Cassandra," Serena murmured softly, stepping forward to help.

But the moment her fingers brushed Cassandra's, Cassandra recoiled, her expression hardening.

Without a word, Cassandra turned away and ascended the stairs, leaving Serena standing there, her heart sinking.

Serena's throat tightened as she watched her aunt disappear. She knew Cassandra blamed her for this—after all, it was her actions that had led to Dylan's punishment.

Swallowing back her tears, Serena wiped her face and quietly followed after them, her chest heavy with guilt.

###Chapter 284

At the sprawling Black family estate, the evening unfolded in stark contrast to the usual quiet.

Evelyn had just stepped out of the shower, her skin dewy and flushed from the steam. A few damp tendrils of hair clung to her temples as she padded across the plush carpet toward her vanity.

As she smoothed her favorite serum over her cheeks, her gaze drifted toward Nathan, who was hunched over his desk, his fingers flying across the keyboard with practiced efficiency. A wry smile curled her lips.

Breaking the silence, she remarked, "Leonard’s birthday is coming up soon. Mr. Black, surely you can afford to be a little more patient, can’t you? Before you know it, Serena will be yours, and the two of you can finally be together—officially."

Nathan’s fingers stilled. His eyes flicked up, dark and unreadable, before narrowing slightly at her words. A slow, knowing smirk tugged at his lips as he countered, "Then shouldn’t you be keeping your distance from Alexander as well?"

Evelyn let out a soft, dismissive laugh. "Alexander and I are just friends. There’s nothing between us. Why would I need to keep my distance? We’re not exes, and we’re certainly not that close."

Nathan’s jaw tightened imperceptibly. A shadow passed over his expression before he exhaled sharply, his voice dropping to a rough murmur. "Evelyn, can’t you see that—"

The words "Alexander is in love with you" lodged in his throat.

"See what?" Evelyn turned fully toward him, curiosity glinting in her eyes.

"Nothing." He clenched his teeth briefly before adding in a tone that brooked no argument, "Just stay away from other men from now on."

Evelyn merely rolled her eyes and didn’t bother responding. Finishing her skincare routine, she slipped beneath the covers without another word.

The next morning, the moment Nathan stepped into his office, his secretary buzzed in to inform him that Serena was waiting downstairs.

After a brief pause, he instructed, "Send her up."

Five minutes later, a soft knock sounded at his door. "Come in," Nathan called, his voice cool and composed.

The door opened, and Serena stepped inside, her usually poised demeanor frayed at the edges. "Nathan," she said softly, her voice trembling slightly.

Nathan barely spared her a glance, but his frown deepened when he noticed her red-rimmed, swollen eyes.

She bit her lip, her fingers twisting nervously in front of her. "I… I just want to clear my name. To prove I’m not the other woman in this situation."

Nathan let out a humorless chuckle, his expression turning glacial. "Clear your name?" His voice was dangerously quiet. "Are you implying that my wife is the one who’s intruding?"

Serena’s eyes widened in panic. "No! That’s not what I meant at all! I—I just…" She floundered, her words dissolving into incoherent stammering.

Nathan said nothing, merely watching her with piercing scrutiny. A flicker of disdain crossed his features before vanishing just as quickly.

He had noticed the change in Serena’s character three years ago. But now? She had sunk even lower in his estimation.

###Chapter 285

Nathan saw through her scheme immediately. She wanted him to declare to the world that they were truly in love, didn’t she? But if he did that, what would become of Evelyn? How would the public perceive her then?

As Nathan’s expression darkened, Serena’s heart sank. She rushed to explain, her voice trembling, “I’m sorry, Nathan. I—I panicked. My social media is flooded with hateful comments. It’s humiliating. I didn’t know what else to do, so I thought—”

Before she could finish, Nathan cut her off sharply. “Enough, Serena. I’m busy. You should go.”

His tone was final, leaving no room for argument.

Serena bit her lip, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears as she stared at him. But Nathan had already turned his attention back to his documents, effectively dismissing her.

Swallowing her pride, she whispered, “Alright, Nathan. I’ll leave you to your work.”

The moment she turned away, hot tears spilled down her cheeks. She wasn’t blind—she had noticed Nathan’s growing impatience with her. Even now, as the world dragged her name through the mud, he refused to lift a finger.

She knew why. Clearing her name would only make Evelyn the villain in the public’s eyes. Nathan would never allow that. He wouldn’t tarnish Evelyn’s reputation, even if it meant leaving Serena to suffer.

The realization twisted like a knife in her chest.

Serena wasn’t sure she could wait any longer for Nathan and Evelyn’s inevitable divorce. She couldn’t afford to sit back and hope. These small schemes were useless—they would never drive them apart.

She needed something decisive. Something that would end their marriage for good.

Wiping away her tears, Serena’s expression hardened. A glint of cold determination flickered in her eyes.

Meanwhile, at Vera Vis, Evelyn visited her grandmother during her lunch break.

After their meal, Evelyn pulled Eleanor aside and explained the social media controversy in detail.

Eleanor’s face darkened as she listened. “That Serena has no shame!” she spat. Then, after a pause, she added, “And that scoundrel Nathan is just as bad!”

Evelyn chuckled softly but didn’t argue. Eleanor’s blunt words mirrored her own thoughts.

Eleanor reached out and took Evelyn’s hand, giving it a gentle squeeze. With a heavy sigh, she said, “My dear, it breaks my heart to see you like this. Why… why did you ever fall for that man?”

Evelyn exhaled slowly. “Feelings aren’t always easy to explain.”

“True,” Eleanor conceded. “But it’s good you’ve decided to divorce him. The sooner, the better. Dragging this out won’t do either of you any favors.”

Evelyn bit her lip at the mention of the impending divorce. “Grandma… do you really want us to separate that badly?”

Eleanor’s gaze was firm. “Absolutely. I didn’t raise you all these years just to watch you waste your life in a loveless marriage with a man who doesn’t appreciate you. I never approved of this union from the start. You two were never meant to be.”

###Chapter 286

A heavy silence lingered before Eleanor Sinclair spoke again, her voice softer now. "But you were so certain, Evelyn. You swore you loved him, that marrying him was your choice. Back then, you truly believed you could melt his heart with sheer determination." She sighed, shaking her head. "Yet here we are. Some men are like stone—unyielding, no matter how much warmth you pour into them. Why should I stand by and watch you waste your brightest years on someone who refuses to change? You deserve more than that."

Evelyn Hartley lowered her lashes, her fingers tightening around the edge of her sleeve. The words stung, but she couldn’t deny their truth.

Noticing her granddaughter’s silence, Eleanor softened her tone. "This is only my opinion, darling. The choice is yours and Nathan’s alone. But I don’t want you to look back one day and regret staying in a marriage that brings you nothing but heartache."

Evelyn lifted her gaze, meeting Eleanor’s concerned eyes. "I understand," she murmured. "I’ll think about it carefully."

Eleanor smiled, relief flickering across her features. "Good."

Just as Evelyn opened her mouth to speak again, a faint shuffle sounded outside the door. Her spine straightened, and she pressed a finger to her lips, signaling for Eleanor to stay quiet.

Confused but obedient, Eleanor nodded.

Evelyn moved swiftly, her steps silent as she crossed the room. In one fluid motion, she yanked the door open—

"Ah!" Isabelle Laurent stumbled forward, barely catching herself before she hit the floor.

"Isabelle?" Eleanor gasped, startled.

Evelyn crouched down, offering a hand to help Isabelle up, though her expression was anything but kind. "Isabelle," she said coolly, "care to explain why you were eavesdropping on a private conversation?"

Isabelle’s face burned crimson. There was no point in lying—she’d been caught. "I—I was just worried," she stammered. "I thought you two might be arguing, and I wanted to make sure everything was okay. That’s all."

Evelyn’s gaze didn’t waver. "I appreciate your concern," she said, her voice deceptively calm, "but when I ask for privacy, I expect it to be respected. Eavesdropping is not only inappropriate—it’s disrespectful. Don’t let it happen again."

"I—I’m sorry, Evelyn." Isabelle couldn’t meet her eyes. Humiliation burned through her as she scrambled to her feet and fled down the hallway.

The door clicked shut behind her.

"Evelyn," Eleanor chided gently, "she meant no harm. She was just looking out for us."

Evelyn said nothing, but a sharp unease settled in her chest. She’d noticed Isabelle’s growing interest in her marriage—always lingering a little too close whenever Nathan’s name came up.

Her expression remained neutral, but her thoughts churned. After exchanging a few more pleasantries with Eleanor, she left Vera Vis.

On her way back to the hospital, her phone buzzed. Natalie Brooks’ name flashed across the screen.

Evelyn answered. "What is it, Natalie?"

###Chapter 287

"Evelyn! Have you seen the latest headlines?" Natalie's voice crackled with excitement through the phone. "There's been another twist in the Nathan and Serena saga."

A flicker of confusion crossed Evelyn's face as she tightened her grip on the steering wheel. "What now? I'm driving—haven't checked my phone yet."

"Right, focus on the road. Check it once you park. I won't keep you. Drive safe," Natalie said briskly before hanging up.

Evelyn exhaled, her curiosity piqued. Only when she pulled into the parking lot of Grand Oak General did she finally grab her phone. The moment she unlocked it, a trending post from Serena Cole glared back at her.

"Nathan Black, CEO of Blackstone Holdings, and I shared a relationship years ago. But now? We're simply friends—nothing more. These photos are old, taken long before his marriage. I don't know who leaked them, but this malicious act harms Nathan's marriage and our friendship. It's unethical. Stop spreading lies."

Evelyn's lips curled into a wry smirk. Clever move, Serena. The photos lacked timestamps, making it easy to dismiss them as relics of the past—if the public bought it.

Scrolling through the comments, the reactions were split.

"I knew Serena wouldn’t be a homewrecker! This is just drama."

"Old photos? Prove it. Words are cheap."

"Why hasn’t Nathan spoken up? Guilty much?"

"She’s totally lying. Mistress vibes."

"I believe her. Serena’s classy—she wouldn’t stoop so low."

The backlash had softened, with some even romanticizing Serena’s past with Nathan.

Evelyn scoffed, tucking her phone away. She had no intention of diving into this mess. Leonard had promised answers, and she’d wait. No need to stir the pot herself.

Stepping out of her car, she strode toward the elevator, shifting her focus to the day ahead.

After a chaotic afternoon, Evelyn finally sank into her office chair, sipping water.

Then Lila appeared in the doorway, urgency sharp in her tone. "Evelyn. We need to talk. Now."

Evelyn arched a brow but stood. "Lead the way."

Lila whisked her to a secluded corner, tension thick in the air.

###Chapter 288

Once certain they were alone, Evelyn asked, "Alright, what's this?"

Lila produced a small USB drive and extended it toward Evelyn. "Here, take this."

Evelyn hesitated for a moment, eyeing the drive, not taking it. "What is it?" she asked.

Lila explained, "It’s the surveillance footage from the VIP Emergency Department at our hospital. I had to pull a lot of strings to get it."

"This will prove that the photos circulating online were taken recently, not years ago as Serena has been claiming."

Evelyn furrowed her brows as she absorbed the information.

She was taken aback, not having expected Lila to offer her such a thing.

Lila, seeing no response from Evelyn, sighed deeply, a look of resignation on her face as she continued, "Evelyn, I don’t understand why you’ve grown so distant from me. Even if you don’t see me as your sister anymore, you’ll always be my little sister in my eyes. When I saw those photos online, I was furious—they were so unfair to you. I’ve warned you before about Serena—she’s far more cunning than she appears."

She paused, frustration evident as she bit her lip, her voice sharp with anger. "Watching her dismiss them as old photos made my blood boil. As your sister, I had to defend you! Recognizing the hospital in the background, I called in every favor I had to get this footage. This should help you expose Serena’s lies."

With that, Lila pressed the USB drive firmly into Evelyn’s hand.

Evelyn’s sharp almond-shaped eyes narrowed as she studied the drive. She didn’t trust Lila’s motives. Testing her would be easy enough.

Suddenly, Evelyn looked up, her expression softening as if moved. "Thank you, Lila. I never thought you’d go this far for me. I... I don’t know how to repay you."

Lila’s face brightened with a warm smile. "We’re sisters. Isn’t it natural for me to help you?"

Evelyn’s smile widened. "Exactly."

"If sisters help each other, then you’ve put it perfectly. And since you’re so eager to help me, dear sister, I have a favor to ask."

"Go ahead," Lila replied.

"Since you got the footage, could you upload it online for me?" Evelyn asked.

At that, Lila stiffened visibly.

Evelyn’s smile turned sly. "Let me explain why I want you to do it. If I post it and Nathan finds out, he might resent me—or worse, get angry. That would only hurt our marriage, don’t you think? You wouldn’t want that, would you?"

Internally, Lila seethed. I’d love nothing more than to see your marriage fall apart. A divorce would be even better!

After a tense pause, Lila answered reluctantly, "But... What if Mr. Black finds out I posted it? He’d blame me."

Evelyn waved a dismissive hand. "He won’t. Deep down, he’ll understand you did it for me. As my sister, it’s only natural you’d want justice for me. What reason would he have to blame you? And if he does, I’ll make sure Leonard sets him straight."

###Chapter 289

Lila Sinclair's expression tightened further. "But... But..."

Noticing her hesitation, Evelyn Hartley tilted her head. "What's wrong? Don't you want to help me?"

"No, of course I do! It's just—" Lila stumbled over her words, her mind racing for an excuse.

Evelyn blinked up at her with wide, guileless eyes. "Didn't you say sisters should always support each other? This is the only way to expose Serena without ruining my relationship with Nathan. Lila, can't you do this for me?"

Lila clenched her fists, frustration bubbling beneath her skin. She had never intended to actually help Evelyn. If she released the surveillance footage, Evelyn would reap all the benefits while she would be left dealing with Nathan's wrath. What did she gain from that?

Damn it. Manipulating Evelyn was becoming harder than she'd anticipated.

After a tense pause, Lila offered an alternative. "Evelyn, why don't you post it instead? If Nathan blames you, I'll step in and defend you."

Evelyn scoffed, her sweet facade cracking. "Cut the act, Lila. Do you think I'm stupid? Stop pretending to care—it's pathetic."

She was done playing along. Lila's plan was obvious: let Evelyn take the fall, drive a wedge between her and Nathan, and tarnish Serena's reputation—all while keeping her own hands clean.

A flawless scheme. Too flawless.

Lila's smile froze, her eyes turning icy. "Evelyn, you—"

Evelyn shoved the USB back into Lila's palm, her voice flat. "Take it. Stay out of my business from now on."

"Do whatever you want with it. Just leave me out of it."

She turned to leave, but Lila called after her, desperation creeping into her tone. "Evelyn! Are you really going to let Serena get away with this?"

Evelyn paused but didn’t look back. "That’s my problem, not yours."

And with that, she walked away, leaving Lila seething.

Lila hadn’t expected Evelyn to reject her so bluntly. Without Evelyn’s involvement, the footage was useless. It had to come from Evelyn—otherwise, the backlash would land solely on her.

She wasn’t about to let that happen.

Gritting her teeth, Lila shoved the USB into her pocket and stormed off.

Meanwhile, at the Thornton estate, Serena Cole exhaled in relief as the online backlash against her began to fade.

Then her phone rang.

The caller ID made her pulse spike.

Taking a steadying breath, she answered. "Hello, Manager Fernandez."

The voice on the other end belonged to her orchestra manager.

###Chapter 290

"Serena, I just saw your post. Why didn't you tell me about this earlier?" Clara Fernandez asked, her tone warm but laced with concern.

Serena Cole’s voice carried a quiet resignation as she replied, "When you called before, the first thing you told me was that I was barred from the Owathe concert."

"I didn’t even get the chance to explain everything to you."

Because of those two photos, the orchestra had removed her from the performance, citing negative publicity, and replaced her with her understudy.

When Serena first received the news, she had been in a state of utter panic.

The person who had been scheming against her had been eyeing her position for months, pulling strings behind the scenes. Serena had always managed to thwart her rival’s attempts—until now. If her opponent succeeded this time, it would undoubtedly jeopardize Serena’s future in the orchestra.

Despite her desperate efforts to change the orchestra’s decision, Serena had hit a wall. It was then that she realized she needed to tackle the root of the problem. Fortunately, she had resolved it—for now.

After hearing Serena’s explanation, Clara’s response was noticeably uneasy. "Uh… Well, I’m glad we’ve cleared up this misunderstanding! I never believed you’d do something like that, Serena. Knowing you, it just didn’t add up. It’s a relief to know it was all a mistake. I have a few things to handle here, so I’ll have to go now."

"Alright, Clara. See you at the orchestra." With that, Serena ended the call.

Dylan Reeves turned to her. "Did you sort things out with the orchestra?"

"Yes." Serena nodded, gratitude softening her expression. "Dylan, it was your quick thinking that made this possible. Without you, I wouldn’t have known what to do."

Dylan shook his head, his expression tinged with guilt. "Honestly, part of this is my fault. If I hadn’t taken those photos and sent them to Evelyn, none of this would’ve happened."

Serena quickly reassured him. "Don’t think like that. You had good intentions."

"And because of me, you got dragged into this mess with your father—even lost a project. If anyone should apologize, it’s me."

Dylan fell silent. The sting of losing the East District deal still weighed heavily on him.

After a moment, he spoke carefully. "Serena, for now, you should stay away from Nathan."

Serena’s expression shifted slightly as she understood his concern—that provoking Nathan and Gregory Thornton further would only make things worse. Avoiding conflict was the wisest move.

"Okay, I understand," she agreed quietly.

Dylan offered a small smile. "Evelyn and Nathan are getting divorced soon. Once he’s single, no one can criticize you for being near him."

Serena forced a smile, though it lacked warmth. A question nagged at her—would Nathan and Evelyn actually go through with the divorce this time? The answer remained uncertain.

To everyone else, the matter seemed settled. But then, the unexpected announcement from Triumph Consortium sent shockwaves through them all.

###Chapter 291

The afternoon sunlight streamed through the hospital window, casting a warm glow over the room where Dylan Reeves lay recovering. Serena Cole sat beside him, her fingers gently tracing patterns on the back of his hand. The quiet moment was abruptly shattered when Dylan’s phone rang.

Serena glanced at the screen—Cassandra Whitmore flashed across the display. Without hesitation, she answered and held the phone to Dylan’s ear.

"Mom?" Dylan’s voice was rough from disuse.

"Everything’s falling apart again!" Cassandra’s sharp tone crackled through the speaker, thick with urgency.

Dylan’s expression darkened instantly. "What happened?"

"Just look at the news," she snapped before hanging up.

A knot of dread twisted in Serena’s stomach as Dylan turned to her, his jaw tight. "Serena, check the headlines. Now."

Her fingers trembled as she unlocked her phone and opened her social media. The moment the page loaded, her breath hitched.

Hundreds—no, thousands—of notifications flooded her screen.

"Pathetic liar! Gold-digging homewrecker!"
"You disgust me. Get out of the Blackwood Symphony!"
"How dare you play the victim? Unfollowed and blocked!"

Each comment was a fresh stab to her chest. Swallowing hard, she refreshed her feed—and froze.

A post from Leonard Grant dominated the top of the page.

Her vision blurred as she read the words, the room tilting around her.

No. No, no, no—

Dylan noticed the blood draining from her face. "Serena, what is it?"

Hands shaking, she passed him the phone. His eyes scanned the screen, his expression turning stormy.

The post read:

"As Chairman of Grant Industries and father to Nathan Black, I must address Ms. Cole’s recent behavior. Should you find yourself in distress, I suggest contacting your own family rather than a married man in the dead of night. Have you no sense of propriety? While my son is not without fault, I have reminded him of his marital obligations and advised him to distance himself from certain individuals. His marriage is strong. Any attempts to undermine it will be met with consequences."

The statement was a death sentence—painting Serena as the villain, the scheming seductress who had overstepped.

Dylan’s grip on the phone tightened. He scrolled through the comments, each one more vicious than the last.

"Wow. Leonard Grant never makes public statements. Serena must have really crossed a line!"
"She’s officially branded as the other woman. No coming back from this."
"Did she really think she could fool everyone with those ‘old photos’? Karma’s a bitch!"

Serena’s hands curled into fists, her nails biting into her palms.

This wasn’t just a scandal.

This was war.

###Chapter 292

The crisp glow of the phone screen illuminated Dylan Reeves' face as he scrolled through the scathing comments.

"Messaging a married man at midnight? That's crossing the line. But throwing yourself at him, kissing him? Disgusting. If I were Nathan's wife, I'd slap Serena Cole so hard she'd forget her own name."

With a sharp exhale, Dylan tossed the phone onto the couch. The penthouse suite, usually filled with the hum of city life outside, was now suffocatingly silent—a heavy, unyielding quiet that pressed down on them both.

Then, the stillness shattered.

A choked sob escaped Serena, curled into herself on the marble floor. Her shoulders trembled as the tears came—first in quiet hiccups, then in heaving, unrestrained cries that echoed through the room.

Dylan's chest tightened. He wanted to go to her, to pull her into his arms and shield her from the storm, but the searing pain down his spine rooted him in place. Gritting his teeth, he could only watch helplessly as she unraveled.

Minutes stretched like hours before her sobs softened into ragged breaths.

"Dylan," she whispered, voice raw. "It's over. Everyone thinks I'm some homewrecker now. How do I even show my face again?"

His jaw clenched. There was nothing he could say. Leonard Grant had played his hand perfectly—cornering Serena with no escape. And who would dare challenge him? The damage was done.

But Dylan knew who was truly to blame.

Evelyn Hartley.

This was her doing. She had orchestrated this humiliation, and she would pay for it. A cold, calculating glint flickered in his eyes.

Evelyn first heard the whispers in the hospital break room.

"Leonard Grant actually called Serena out publicly? That's brutal. Her reputation is in shreds."

"Right? I never thought he'd get involved. But he didn't just go after her—he even dragged Nathan into it. No mercy."

Evelyn's fingers stilled around her coffee cup.

"What are you talking about?" she asked, feigning casual interest.

One of the nurses turned, eyes bright with gossip. "You haven't seen? Leonard Grant just dropped a bomb online. Serena's little redemption act? Crushed. He made sure everyone knows exactly what she is."

Evelyn pulled out her phone, scanning the trending post. A slow, satisfied smile curved her lips.

So this was Leonard's idea of closure.

No courtroom, no evidence—just one decisive strike. And nothing could have been more effective.

###Chapter 293

The fallout was immediate.

Serena's name trended for all the wrong reasons. News outlets dissected Leonard's post, dissecting every word like vultures picking at a carcass.

But Evelyn wasn't celebrating—not yet.

Because while Serena had been dealt a blow, Dylan Reeves was still standing. And men like him didn't surrender quietly.

Her phone buzzed. An unknown number.

"You think you've won?"

Evelyn's pulse spiked. She knew that venomous tone anywhere.

Dylan wasn't done.

And neither was she.

Evelyn quietly savored the moment, thinking how utterly satisfying this was. Nathan truly knew how to handle things perfectly.

With no pressing work obligations that evening, Evelyn went straight home after leaving the office. When she arrived, she found Leonard in the living room, absorbed in a documentary playing on the television.

"Nathan!" Evelyn greeted him with a warm smile, moving behind him to knead his shoulders gently.

Her voice softened with sincerity as she spoke. "I saw your post. Thank you."

Leonard exhaled slowly, his expression thoughtful. "Evelyn, I know this situation hasn’t been easy for you."

Evelyn lowered her gaze, her silence speaking volumes.

A moment later, Leonard seemed to recall something and said, "About Nathan’s behavior… There’s no defending his actions, and I won’t make excuses for him. But… I have to admit that his obsession with Serena might be partly my fault."

At this, Evelyn’s lashes fluttered, her fingers pausing briefly before resuming their motion. "Is this about you keeping Serena locked away for three years?"

Leonard turned slightly to face her, surprise flickering in his eyes. "You know about that?"

"I’ve heard," Evelyn confirmed.

Leonard let out a quiet chuckle, nodding. "Yes." He hesitated, his gaze sharpening before he continued in a measured tone, "I’m not entirely sure Nathan understands whether his feelings for Serena are driven by love… or guilt."

Evelyn’s breath hitched as she absorbed his words.

Guilt? Was that possible?

Seizing the opportunity, Evelyn pressed further. "What’s the real reason you oppose Nathan and Serena’s relationship?"

At the mention of Serena’s name, Leonard’s expression darkened with disdain. "That woman is trouble." His voice turned icy. "Her delusions of joining the Black family are laughable."

In that instant, Leonard remembered the bet he had made with Nathan. He had already decided—even if Evelyn and Nathan separated after his birthday, Serena would never become part of the Black family. He had only agreed to the wager to placate Nathan.

And if Nathan still insisted on marrying Serena? Well… Leonard was prepared to take extreme measures.

A steely glint flashed in his eyes at the thought.

Evelyn studied Leonard’s reaction, silently speculating what Serena could have possibly done to earn such deep-seated hatred from him.

Noticing her curious expression, Leonard pressed his lips together briefly before saying, "Evelyn, you should know—you’re the daughter-in-law I want."

Evelyn’s face brightened with a grateful smile. "Thank you for saying that."

With that, the subject was dropped.

After finishing the massage and exchanging a few more words with Leonard, Evelyn retreated upstairs to her room.

Fresh from her shower, she stepped out of the bathroom—only to find Nathan standing in the doorway, his presence unexpected.

###Chapter 294

The moment Evelyn spotted him, her steps faltered. Theodore's words from earlier reverberated in her mind, refusing to fade.

Evelyn was lost in thought.

Was it guilt that drove Nathan's feelings for Serena? Or did he truly care for her?

The questions swirled relentlessly in Evelyn's mind as she studied Nathan's face.

Nathan, too, was watching her. His sharp gaze caught the flicker of uncertainty in her eyes, and his brows drew together slightly. Just as he opened his mouth to speak, his phone buzzed insistently in his pocket.

He pulled it out, glanced at the screen, and stepped onto the balcony, sliding the glass door shut behind him before answering.

"The situation with Dylan and Serena has reached me," Theodore's voice came through, smooth but edged with something unreadable.

Nathan said nothing, waiting.

After a beat, Theodore continued, "Nathan, is removing Dylan from the East District project truly necessary? Isn’t that excessive?"

Nathan’s expression remained cold. "Would anything less make him think twice?" His voice was low, almost mocking. "He needs to learn. Consequences are the only language he understands."

Theodore exhaled sharply. Before he could argue further, Nathan cut in, "If this call is to plead his case, save your breath."

"I’m not," Theodore countered swiftly. "But I am curious about something else."

Silence stretched between them.

Then, with deliberate slowness, Theodore asked, "Tell me, Nathan—are you punishing Dylan for going behind your back, or because he sent those photos to Evelyn?"

Nathan stiffened. His grip on the phone tightened imperceptibly. "It’s because Dylan—"

Theodore didn’t let him finish.

"No need to explain to me. Ask yourself that question instead." His tone carried a knowing weight. After a pause, he added, "Dylan crossed a line this time. He deserves what’s coming. That’s all I wanted to say."

The call ended abruptly, leaving Nathan standing there, the silence pressing in around him.

When he finally stepped back inside, Evelyn was seated at her vanity, applying a light serum to her skin.

Nathan crossed the room in three strides. Without warning, he cupped her chin, tilting her face up to meet his gaze.

Evelyn blinked, startled. Her long lashes fluttered as she frowned up at him. "What are you doing?"

Nathan didn’t answer. His eyes burned with something fierce, unspoken words swirling in their depths.

###Chapter 295

Evelyn's skin glowed with a soft, rosy hue after her bath, flawless and smooth like polished marble. Up close, Nathan couldn't detect a single blemish on her face. Her features were exquisitely delicate, as if meticulously sculpted by an artist’s hand.

As Nathan studied Evelyn, a flicker of doubt crossed his mind—was there more to his actions toward Dylan than he cared to admit?

Evelyn broke his reverie with a sharp, incredulous tone. "Nathan! What are you staring at? Never seen a beautiful woman before?"

Nathan was momentarily speechless. Releasing her chin, he regarded her with a cool, dismissive glance. His voice was laced with disdain as he remarked, "You’re rather ordinary, actually."

With that, he turned on his heel and strode away.

Evelyn stood frozen, her lips parting in shock. Indignation flared in her eyes as she watched his retreating figure. "Ordinary? Are you blind or just delusional?"

Nathan caught her furious retort, and though his back was turned, a faint smirk tugged at his lips, amusement glinting in his gaze.

Still fuming, Evelyn resumed her skincare routine with aggressive precision, though her mind was far from settled.

Then, as if struck by a sudden impulse, Nathan reappeared in the doorway. "Would you like to accompany me to the Sterling family’s banquet tomorrow evening?"

Evelyn’s hand stilled mid-air, the jar of face cream hovering inches from her skin.

This was unprecedented—Nathan had never invited her to a social event before.

Her pulse quickened. Was he finally acknowledging her as his wife in public? The thought sent an unexpected thrill through her.

Yet, after a brief hesitation, she replied, "No, I’ll be going with Ethan instead."

Nathan’s expression darkened instantly. Rejection—sharp and unexpected—cut through him, leaving behind a bitter mix of anger and something dangerously close to disappointment. His voice turned icy. "Fine. It was my father’s request anyway."

With that, he disappeared into the bathroom, leaving Evelyn to her thoughts.

Her grip tightened around the jar. So, Leonard had pressured him. Of course. Nathan would never extend such an invitation of his own volition.

It was clear—Leonard intended to use the banquet to formally introduce her as Nathan’s wife.

But if divorce was inevitable, why tie herself further to the Black family’s legacy? Better to remain unseen, unclaimed.

Evelyn resumed her skincare, though her movements were mechanical, her mind elsewhere. She applied the same serum twice without realizing it before finally abandoning the routine altogether.

Sinking onto the bed, she exhaled sharply, her thoughts a tangled mess.

The following evening…

The Sterling estate glittered under the evening sky, hosting a lavish welcome-back party for their eldest daughter, Giselle, who had just returned from abroad. Edmund Sterling, the family patriarch, had spared no expense for the occasion.

Evelyn arrived on Ethan’s arm, and the moment they stepped into the grand hall, all eyes turned toward them. Ethan, dressed in a sleek black tuxedo, exuded effortless charm and sophistication. Beside him, Evelyn was a vision in a deep sapphire gown that draped elegantly off her shoulders, accentuating her graceful collarbones and slender frame. Her makeup was understated yet radiant, her every movement captivating.

Whispers followed them as they moved through the crowd, but Evelyn barely noticed. Her gaze swept the room—until it landed on Nathan.

He stood across the hall, his piercing eyes locked onto her, an unreadable expression on his face.

The air between them crackled with tension.

And then—

Giselle Sterling stepped forward, her smile sharp as a blade.

"Ah, Evelyn Hartley," she purred. "How interesting to see you here."

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her clutch.

This night was far from over.

###Chapter 296

Even among those who knew Evelyn Hartley well, her arrival never failed to take their breath away. Her beauty was so radiant, so utterly mesmerizing, that it commanded attention wherever she went.

"I've always thought Nathan and Evelyn would make the perfect couple!"

"Absolutely! They complement each other so well."

"Honestly, at this point, they might as well just announce their engagement!"

Nathan Black, overhearing the whispers, stiffened. A dark, icy aura radiated from him, chilling the air around him. He had deliberately chosen a deep blue suit for the evening—one that matched Evelyn’s gown—accentuating his sculpted frame. His sharp, aristocratic features only heightened his striking presence.

Standing beside him, Theodore Whitmore noticed his friend’s stormy expression and nearly rolled his eyes. Before he could comment, however, the murmurs in the room swelled again—this time, laced with disdain.

"Can you believe she actually showed up?"

"Talk about shameless."

"If I were her, I’d never show my face in public again!"

Nathan and Theodore both turned toward the entrance, where Serena Cole and Dylan Reeves had just stepped into the grand hall.

Serena walked in with her head held high, though the weight of the room’s judgment pressed down on her. Dylan shot her a concerned glance, his jaw tight. He had tried to dissuade her from coming, knowing full well the venom she would face. But Serena had refused to hide. She couldn’t spend the rest of her life cowering—she had to face the world eventually.

Spotting a quiet corner, Dylan guided her toward it, deliberately steering clear of Nathan. The last thing they needed was another confrontation.

Meanwhile, Natalie Brooks leaned in toward Evelyn, her voice dripping with mockery. "I can’t believe she actually dared to show up. She really has no shame, does she?"

Evelyn was slightly taken aback by Serena’s presence as well. She had to admit—the woman had nerve.

"But Leonard Grant is truly impressive," Natalie continued, admiration coloring her tone. "Stepping in to clean up his son’s mess with the mistress? That takes guts."

After a pause, she added, "You’re so lucky to have a father-in-law like him."

Evelyn smiled faintly. "Yes, I’ve always considered myself fortunate in that regard."

But inwardly, her heart ached. Soon, she wouldn’t be Leonard’s daughter-in-law anymore. The thought made her lower her gaze, her fingers tightening around her glass.

As the banquet officially began, the host of the evening, Edmund Sterling, took the stage to deliver his opening speech. Afterward, his daughter, Giselle Sterling, stepped forward to address the guests.

While Giselle spoke, Natalie leaned in again, her voice hushed with gossip. "Did you know Giselle went abroad because she was chasing after some guy she was obsessed with?"

Evelyn blinked in surprise. "She went that far for love?"

###Chapter 297

Natalie Brooks leaned in with a conspiratorial whisper. "Oh, absolutely. Rumor has it the poor man was so smitten—or terrified—that he fled overseas just to escape her. And what did she do? Chased him halfway across the globe!" She arched a brow, lowering her voice further. "Only returned now because he did."

Evelyn Hartley pressed her lips together, choosing silence. Gossip was a fickle beast, and she’d learned long ago that truth often got lost in the whispers. Until she had the full story, she’d reserve judgment.

Natalie opened her mouth to continue, but a rich, velvety voice cut through the chatter behind them.

"Dr. Hartley?"

Evelyn turned, startled.

Her breath hitched.

Him.

The man standing there was unmistakable—broad-shouldered, with a jawline sharp enough to cut glass and eyes like molten amber. His presence was magnetic, effortless. The kind of man who commanded attention without trying.

A slow, surprised smile curved his lips as he closed the distance between them. "It is you."

Evelyn returned the smile, though her pulse betrayed her calm exterior. "How is your aunt doing?"

Recognition flickered in his gaze. She’d saved the woman months ago during a medical emergency on the street.

"Much better, thanks to you." His voice softened with gratitude. "She’s stable now—just needs regular monitoring for her heart condition."

"That’s a relief." Evelyn nodded, then added firmly, "Make sure she never leaves home without her medication. For patients like her, even one missed dose can be life-threatening."

A shadow of guilt crossed his face. "She was in a hurry that day. It won’t happen again."

Then, as if catching himself, he chuckled and extended a hand. "I’ve been rambling without introducing myself. Julian Hawthorne. It’s a pleasure to finally meet you properly."

"Evelyn." She clasped his hand, warmth spreading at the contact.

Julian’s gaze lingered on hers, something unreadable flickering in his expression.

Across the room, Giselle Sterling froze mid-step, her champagne flute nearly slipping from her fingers.

Her friend Daphne Whitmore beamed, oblivious. "Giselle! You were stunning on stage earlier—everyone couldn’t stop talking about you!"

Giselle didn’t respond. Her eyes were locked on Julian and the woman beside him.

"Who," she hissed, "is that?"

Daphne followed her gaze. "Oh! That’s Evelyn Hartley. She’s close with Marcus Donovan."

They watched, stunned, as Julian handed Evelyn a fresh drink, then—unthinkably—plucked a slice of decadent chocolate cake from a passing tray and offered it to her with a smile.

Daphne’s jaw dropped.

Julian Hawthorne—the man who barely spared anyone a second glance, who exuded an air of untouchable elegance—was serving someone?

Giselle’s manicured nails dug into her palm.

This wasn’t just unexpected.

It was unacceptable.

###Chapter 298

Yet at this moment... Evelyn could scarcely believe her eyes—was that truly Julian standing there?

She turned to glance at Giselle, whose face had darkened with barely contained fury. A sinking feeling settled in Evelyn's stomach—she knew trouble was brewing.

Giselle had a notorious reputation for ruthlessly eliminating any woman who dared to get too close to Julian.

Evelyn hesitated, then cautiously remarked, "Evelyn is practically family to Marcus and Olivia. They adore her like their own daughter."

Giselle scoffed, her voice dripping with disdain. "She's nothing more than a charity case they took pity on. Do you really think they'd risk their standing for her?"

Evelyn fell silent. It was clear that despite Evelyn's connection to the Donovans, Giselle wouldn't be deterred. Evelyn was on her own.

Nathan, too, watched the interaction between Evelyn and Julian with a stormy expression.

Theodore, intrigued, leaned closer. "How does Evelyn know the CEO of BergWind Group?"

Nathan's jaw tightened. "The CEO?"

"Yes," Theodore confirmed. "That's Julian Hawthorne. His company has been collaborating with my family's business recently."

BergWind Group was a powerhouse. Emerging from Chixdon, it had conquered the Owathe market in just five years, cementing its dominance.

"Evelyn and Julian seem... familiar," Theodore observed.

Nathan's voice was icy. "They're not. She once helped his aunt during a medical emergency. That's all."

Theodore's eyes lit up with recognition. "Ah, so she's the one from that viral news story? The heroic doctor?"

"Exactly," Nathan clipped.

Theodore chuckled. "Evelyn has transformed completely. Not just her looks—her entire aura is different. She used to orbit around you, desperate for your attention, doing anything to win you over. But now? She's practically radiant. That act of bravery made her a public darling. People can't stop talking about her."

He paused, then added with a smirk, "Rumor has it, once your divorce is finalized, half the city's elite will be lining up to court her."

Nathan's grip on his glass tightened, his knuckles whitening. A surge of possessive fury burned through him.

How dare they? She was still his wife.

Noticing Nathan's darkening expression, Theodore quickly changed the subject. "Anyway, Leonard's birthday is in a week. Is it true you're finalizing the divorce right after?"

Nathan exhaled sharply. After a beat, he answered with cold certainty, "Yes."

###Chapter 299

The crystal chandelier cast a golden glow over the lavish banquet hall as Theodore Whitmore leaned closer to Nathan Black, his brow arched in skepticism. "Are you absolutely certain about this decision? No second thoughts?"

Nathan's lips curled into a cold smirk. "Who do you think will be the one regretting this after I divorce Evelyn?" His voice was smooth, almost indifferent, as if discussing the weather rather than the end of his marriage.

Theodore chuckled, lifting his champagne flute in a casual toast. "Well then, here's to your impending freedom, my friend."

Nathan clinked his glass against Theodore's before taking a slow sip, his piercing gaze scanning the room.

Meanwhile, across the hall, Evelyn Hartley and Natalie Brooks stood near a marble pillar, engaged in quiet conversation. A woman in a sunflower-yellow evening gown approached them with a practiced smile.

"Ms. Hartley, Ms. Brooks," she greeted warmly. "Giselle and the others are gathered by the lounge. Why don’t you join them? It’s much livelier over there."

Evelyn and Natalie exchanged a brief glance before nodding politely. After all, Giselle Sterling was tonight’s honored guest—it would be rude to decline.

As they settled onto the plush velvet sofas, the conversation revolved around Giselle’s latest acquisition—a rare, diamond-encrusted necklace that cost more than most people’s annual salaries. The piece was passed around for admiration, and when it reached Evelyn, she barely glanced at it before handing it off to Natalie.

The chatter was predictable—designer labels, exclusive resorts, and who was rumored to be dating whom. Evelyn stifled a sigh, her fingers tapping lightly against her clutch. Natalie caught her eye, her lips quirking in silent amusement.

Just a little longer, Evelyn told herself.

Finally, Giselle was whisked away by the host, and the group dispersed. Evelyn and Natalie wasted no time making their escape.

But just as Evelyn took a step forward, a sudden force collided with her from behind. She stumbled, her balance faltering—until Natalie’s quick reflexes caught her arm, steadying her. Her handbag, however, wasn’t as fortunate, hitting the marble floor with a sharp thud.

"Oh my goodness, I’m so sorry!"

Evelyn turned to see Daphne Whitmore—the same woman who had invited them earlier—clutching her own clutch in dismay.

"I wasn’t watching where I was going," Daphne fretted, her cheeks flushed.

Evelyn waved it off with a polite smile. "It’s fine." She bent to retrieve her bag, but Daphne was already one step ahead, scooping it up with surprising eagerness.

Instead of handing it back immediately, Daphne hesitated, her fingers brushing over the leather as if inspecting it. Then, with a bright smile, she finally returned it. "I checked for any damage—it’s perfectly fine!"

Evelyn’s gaze sharpened, lingering on Daphne for a beat too long before accepting the bag with a nod. "Thank you."

As they walked away, Natalie muttered under her breath, "That was… odd. She practically studied your bag."

Evelyn’s lips curved slightly, but she said nothing.

Some games were best played in silence.

###Chapter 300

They relocated to another table. Evelyn fetched two glasses of sparkling fruit punch before excusing herself to the ladies' room.

Upon her return, she resumed her lively conversation with Natalie. Ethan soon joined them, adding his own witty remarks to the discussion.

Their pleasant exchange was abruptly interrupted by a piercing shriek that cut through the hum of the party. "Oh my God! My necklace is gone!"

All eyes snapped toward the commotion. Giselle, the evening's radiant hostess, was frantically rummaging through her clutch, her flawless features twisted in distress. "This can't be happening! It was right here before I left!"

Daphne, standing beside her, mirrored her panic. "Are you sure you didn't misplace it?"

Giselle shook her head violently, her voice trembling. "No! I specifically remember putting it in my bag before I went to freshen up. It's vanished!"

A sudden realization dawned on Daphne. "Wait—you left your bag unattended on the counter when you washed your hands. Do you think… someone could have…?"

Her words trailed off, but the unspoken accusation lingered in the air like a dark cloud.

A young socialite nearby piped up, "If I recall correctly, after you and Ms. Chamberlain used the restroom, no one else went in."

Giselle and Daphne exchanged uneasy glances, their expressions a mix of suspicion and disbelief.

Then another voice chimed in, hesitant but pointed. "But… wasn’t Evelyn the first one to go in?"

The moment the words were spoken, dozens of gazes swiveled toward Evelyn. Murmurs erupted like wildfire.

"What’s going on? Do they think Evelyn took it?"

"That’s ridiculous! She could buy a dozen necklaces if she wanted. Why would she—?"

Evelyn remained unruffled, her posture regal, her expression unreadable. She sipped her drink calmly, as if the accusations were nothing more than background noise.

Giselle, however, wasted no time. She marched up to Evelyn, her voice laced with desperation.

"Ms. Hartley, I hate to ask this, but that necklace is irreplaceable. Have you seen it anywhere?"

Evelyn arched a brow, her tone cool. "Are you implying I took it, Ms. Sterling?"

Daphne quickly interjected, "No one’s accusing you, Ms. Hartley. It’s just that you were the only other person in the restroom around the same time."

Natalie scoffed. "So now everyone who used the bathroom is a suspect?"

Daphne backtracked. "Not at all. We’re just trying to piece together what happened."

Evelyn set her glass down with deliberate calm. "I didn’t see anything."

Giselle bit her lip, her fingers twisting nervously. Then, hesitantly, she asked, "Ms. Hartley… would you mind if we checked your handbag?"
###Chapter 301

Evelyn's expression turned icy in a heartbeat. "What exactly are you implying? You want to search me? On what grounds?"

Ethan stepped forward sharply, his voice cutting through the tension. "This is absurd. Are you suggesting Evelyn would need to steal something as trivial as a necklace? She could buy a dozen without blinking."

Daphne quickly intervened, her tone conciliatory. "Mr. Caldwell, you're misunderstanding Giselle. She wasn't accusing Ms. Hartley; she merely wanted to clear any doubts and prove Ms. Hartley's innocence."

Natalie exploded in outrage. "This is ridiculous! Evelyn doesn't need anyone to prove her innocence. Who does this woman think she is?"

Watching Ethan and Natalie defend her so fiercely, Evelyn felt a surge of warmth. Perhaps she wouldn't need to fight this battle alone.

Just as Evelyn opened her mouth to speak, a calm voice interrupted. "Evelyn, wouldn't it be simpler to just let them check your purse? That would settle this matter quickly."

Evelyn's face darkened instantly at the familiar voice. Lila.

Seeing Lila involve herself, Natalie's expression soured. "Stay out of this. It's none of your concern!"

"As Evelyn's older sister, it's my duty to guide her," Lila responded firmly, meeting Natalie's glare. "Moreover, the Sterling family's reputation is at stake if Evelyn doesn't clear these baseless accusations."

Lila's words sent shockwaves through the crowd, freezing everyone in place.

Murmurs erupted immediately. "Wait, what? Evelyn is Lila's sister? Since when did the Sterlings have another daughter?"

"Of course! How could I forget about the Sterling family's... less legitimate branch?"

"Ah yes, the open secret everyone pretends not to know."

"So Nathan Black's close friend is actually the Sterling family's illegitimate child?"

The atmosphere shifted palpably. While illegitimate children weren't uncommon in high society, they were often treated as dirty secrets - tolerated but never truly accepted.

Ethan's commanding voice cut through the whispers. "What does her birth status matter? She's the Caldwell family's treasured guest!"

His declaration carried undeniable authority, silencing the murmurs instantly. The guests who'd been ready to judge suddenly found their tongues tied.

Lila's mask slipped for just a moment, revealing a flash of frustration before she schooled her features. Turning to Evelyn, she adopted a concerned tone. "Evelyn, when you took my necklace last time, I let it go because we're family. What's mine is yours. But this is different! If you've really taken Miss Sterling's necklace, you must return it immediately."

The moment Lila finished speaking, Evelyn's head snapped up. Her gaze turned razor-sharp, as if she could slice Lila apart with just her eyes. Under that intense stare, Lila unconsciously swallowed, a flicker of unease crossing her face.

###Chapter 302

Lila's accusation sent shockwaves through the gathered crowd.

"Did Evelyn actually steal from Lila before? This explains everything!"

"Of course she would! Being the illegitimate daughter, she's probably desperate enough to steal again."

"I wasn't sure about the previous theft, but now I'm convinced Evelyn did it."

Lila had successfully thrown Evelyn into the center of a scandal.

"Lila! What nonsense are you spouting? When has Evelyn ever stolen from you?" Natalie shouted furiously, making Lila flinch.

Lila glanced at Evelyn with feigned remorse. "I'm sorry, Evelyn. I didn't mean to bring this up publicly."

Evelyn responded with an icy laugh, seeing right through Lila's act. This was the perfect opportunity for Lila to strike, and she wouldn't miss it.

"Miss Sinclair," came a deep, commanding voice cutting through the murmurs. "You've accused Ms. Hartley of theft. Do you have any evidence?"

All eyes turned as Nathan Black emerged from the crowd. His tall frame moved with effortless grace, one hand casually in his pocket.

Stopping before Lila, he looked down with piercing intensity.

A dangerous smile played on his lips. "Shall we call your father and see what the Sinclair family head thinks of these accusations?"

Lila's face went pale.

She hadn't anticipated Nathan's intervention, least of all his threat to involve her father. That call would only bring her humiliation - her father would never publicly support such baseless claims that would disgrace their family name.

Knowing she'd face severe consequences at home, Lila bit her lip. "That won't be necessary. I... I spoke without thinking earlier. It wasn't true."

Nathan's derisive snort echoed through the silent room. The guests exchanged disdainful looks.

"Fabricating such serious accusations - how shameful!"

"And at a time like this too. Clearly trying to frame Evelyn."

"Pretending to support her sister while stabbing her in the back. The hypocrisy is astounding."

Lila's cheeks burned crimson under the weight of their judgment.

Nathan then turned his hawk-like gaze on Giselle, his voice dropping to a dangerous timbre.

"Ms. Sterling, is it customary for the Williamson family to demand guests submit to bag searches?"

Caught off guard, Giselle hesitated before countering, "Mr. Black, what exactly is your relationship with Ms. Hartley? Why are you defending her so vehemently?"

###Chapter 303

Nathan responded instantly, his voice firm. "She's with me!"

Giselle quickly cut in.

Nathan's piercing gaze narrowed slightly as he turned toward Giselle, his eyes flashing with barely contained irritation.

Evelyn was taken aback by Nathan's unexpected defense. A warm surge of gratitude washed over her, but she knew she couldn't rely on him to handle this. If she didn't stand her ground now, these people would keep walking all over her.

Drawing herself up, Evelyn took a steadying breath before addressing Giselle with cool precision. "Ms. Sterling, are you suggesting I'm not free to leave unless I submit to having my belongings searched?"

Giselle met her gaze evenly. "Ms. Hartley, that's not what I meant at all. Our family would never resort to such tactics. However..."

She let the word hang in the air before continuing with a knowing smile. "If you refuse the search, perhaps involving the authorities would be more appropriate."

The mention of police sent murmurs rippling through the gathered guests.

Giselle pressed on. "I've made it clear how valuable that necklace is to me. This matter can't simply be dropped. If you cooperate now and the necklace is found, I'll show leniency. But if the police discover it on you..." She tilted her head. "You understand the consequences, don't you?"

With feigned concern, she added, "Think carefully about your next move, Ms. Hartley."

Evelyn's responding smile was ice-cold. "How considerate of you, Ms. Sterling."

Then, with deliberate calm, she turned to Natalie. "Call the police. Now."

Gasps filled the room. No one had expected Evelyn to escalate the situation by summoning law enforcement herself.

This bold move made several guests reconsider - surely someone guilty wouldn't invite police scrutiny? Yet Giselle hid a triumphant smile. This was exactly the outcome she'd hoped for.

Natalie shot Evelyn a worried look as realization dawned. Earlier, Daphne had "accidentally" bumped into Evelyn, causing her to drop her purse. It had been Daphne who retrieved it. Given Giselle and Daphne's confident expressions now, the necklace had likely been planted then. Calling the police would only trap Evelyn further!

But Evelyn appeared unshaken. She met Natalie's anxious eyes and murmured, "Trust me."

After a brief hesitation, Natalie nodded and pulled out her phone to make the call.

The police arrived swiftly - a male and female officer dispatched to the Sterling estate.

"Who placed the call?" the male officer inquired.

"I did, Officer." Natalie stepped forward. "Here's what happened..." She quickly summarized the situation for both officers.

When she finished, the male officer turned to Evelyn. "As you're the primary suspect, we'll need to search your belongings and conduct a pat-down."

###Chapter 304

"Of course," Evelyn Hartley said smoothly, handing her clutch to the female officer.

The officer unzipped the small designer bag with no compartments, its contents now exposed to everyone's view.

Gasps rippled through the crowd. The necklace was nowhere to be seen. Giselle Sterling's triumphant smile froze, then shattered.

Daphne Whitmore's jaw dropped. This couldn't be happening. She'd personally slipped the diamond pendant into Evelyn's bag mere minutes ago.

"Officer," Evelyn's voice cut through the murmurs, "would you mind accompanying me to the ladies' room for a more thorough search?"

The female officer nodded. "Standard procedure."

They disappeared into the restroom.

Five tense minutes later, they returned.

"Ms. Hartley is clean," the officer announced to her partner.

Giselle and Daphne exchanged horrified glances. The necklace had vanished like smoke.

The male officer turned to Giselle. "We've conducted a complete search of Ms. Hartley and her belongings. Perhaps you misplaced the necklace before visiting the restroom?"

"Impossible!" Giselle's voice rose shrilly. "I specifically put it in my bag before leaving!"

The officer's gaze traveled upward to the security cameras dotting the ceiling. "We could review the surveillance footage."

Giselle's manicured fingers twitched. "Those... those cameras were turned off tonight. Privacy concerns for our distinguished guests."

His frown deepened.

Evelyn's lips curved. "Officer, I just remembered something important."

All eyes turned to her.

"Ms. Sterling wasn't alone in the restroom, was she?" Evelyn's voice carried clearly.

The crowd erupted in whispers.

"Daphne went with her!"
"If Evelyn's a suspect, then Daphne should be too!"

Giselle's face darkened. "Preposterous! Daphne was with me the entire time!"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "The entire time? Even in the stall?"

Giselle's mouth opened, then snapped shut.

Daphne stepped forward, chin raised. "I have nothing to hide. I'll submit to a search as well."

###Chapter 305

Evelyn took the lead, striding purposefully toward the restroom with the female officer trailing behind her.

Two minutes later, the officer emerged holding up a delicate necklace. "Is this what you were searching for, Ms. Sterling?"

Giselle's breath caught. It was indeed the missing heirloom.

Her hands trembled as she reached for it. "But... how?"

"Daphne must have stolen it," someone in the crowd murmured. "Did you see how she defended Evelyn earlier? What a hypocrite!"

"To betray your best friend like this... absolutely despicable."

Daphne stumbled out of the restroom moments later, her face ashen. Confusion clouded her features as she looked around wildly. "This isn't possible... I didn't..."

"Ms. Whitmore," the male officer said firmly, "you'll need to come with us."

"No!" Daphne's voice cracked with desperation. She turned pleading eyes toward Giselle. "You know I would never do this! Please, you have to believe me!"

Giselle's mind raced. Despite her shock, she couldn't let them arrest Daphne. A police record would ruin her friend forever. "Officers, there must be some mistake here—"

Evelyn's mocking laughter cut through the tension. "How amusing, Ms. Sterling. When you accused me, you were so certain. Almost as if you'd planted it yourself. Weren't you just saying how invaluable this necklace was? How you'd make the thief pay? But now that it's your dear friend..." She arched a perfect eyebrow. "Suddenly it's all a misunderstanding? Are you wasting police time?"

Giselle's mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water.

The officer cleared his throat. "Regardless, we must proceed with our investigation. The suspect needs to come to the station."

As they turned to leave, Evelyn's voice rang out sharply. "Wait!"

She approached the officers with confident strides. "Before you go, there's something you should know about this necklace." She extended her hand. "May I?"

After a brief hesitation, the officer handed it over.

All eyes followed as Evelyn sauntered toward Giselle. A knowing smirk played on her lips as she dangled the jewelry just out of reach. "For something so precious, Ms. Sterling... it's curious you didn't notice this is a counterfeit."

The crowd erupted in gasps.

###Chapter 306

A counterfeit? That couldn't be possible! With the Sterling family's immense wealth, why would they own a fake necklace?

When Giselle heard Evelyn's accusation, her temper flared. She forced a cold smile, masking her irritation. "Ms. Hartley, I understand you're upset about the theft allegations. But you can't just claim my necklace is fake because you're angry."

Evelyn held up the necklace, pointing to a specific detail. "This limited edition piece from rema has a unique locking mechanism. It's supposed to open with a special key pendant, transforming its appearance. But yours won't budge. Clearly, this is a well-made replica."

The guests exchanged confused glances, unsure who to believe.

Giselle stood her ground. "Ms. Hartley, these baseless accusations are beneath you! rema never advertised any such feature when they launched this collection."

Evelyn's voice remained calm. "The special feature was only disclosed to actual buyers."

"Stop making up stories!" Giselle scoffed. "You're embarrassing yourself."

Murmurs spread through the crowd. "I've never heard of that feature."
"Neither have I. Evelyn must be lying."

Ignoring the whispers, Evelyn pulled out her phone and made a video call.

Seconds later, the call connected.

The screen showed a distinguished middle-aged man with a warm smile. "Hello, darling!" he greeted Evelyn affectionately.

Nathan's expression darkened at the man's familiar tone.

"Adrian," Evelyn responded before turning her phone toward Giselle and the crowd.

Adrian Hawthorne blinked in surprise. "Evelyn, what's going on there?"

Giselle froze when she saw the man on screen, her face draining of color.

"Could you examine this necklace for me?" Evelyn requested.

Nathan watched Evelyn intently, his face unreadable.

Evelyn held the necklace up to her camera.

Adrian only needed one glance. "That's a fake. The lock won't open, will it?"

"Exactly," Evelyn confirmed.

"Definitely counterfeit. Evelyn, where did you get this? What happened to the real one I gave you? Why aren't you wearing it?" Adrian asked.

Evelyn smiled. "It's safe at home. I'll explain later. I need to handle this situation first."

"Wait, Evelyn! Don't hang up yet! You never call me anymore," Adrian protested.

###Chapter 307
"I'm afraid I must leave now!" Evelyn ended the call abruptly, setting her phone down with deliberate calm.

Turning to Giselle with an icy composure, Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Ms. Sterling, you recognized the voice on that call, didn't you?"

Giselle's face flushed crimson, her lips parting soundlessly.

Daphne, standing nearby, looked equally stunned.

"Who was that?" a guest whispered. "That voice—it sounded so familiar!"

"That was Adrian Hawthorne, rema's world-renowned art director! Who knew Evelyn had such close ties to him? Their conversation clearly indicates they're more than just acquaintances!"

"Then... does this mean Giselle's necklace is a fake?"

"Is there any doubt? Adrian, an expert from rema, identified it as counterfeit instantly. Would someone of his stature lie about such a thing?"

"He mentioned gifting the genuine piece to Evelyn, which means she possesses the real one! Why would she bother stealing Giselle's imitation? Looking back, it's almost laughable how confidently Giselle accused her!"

"Exactly! Flaunting a fake like that... How mortifying!"

The murmurs of the crowd made Giselle wish the ground would swallow her whole.

She never anticipated Evelyn being so closely connected to Adrian Hawthorne, rema's global art director.

Instead of tarnishing Evelyn's reputation, Giselle had only succeeded in humiliating herself, while Evelyn emerged more admired than ever.

Gritting her teeth in frustration, Giselle clenched her fists.

Evelyn, meanwhile, allowed a knowing smirk to play on her lips before shifting her attention elsewhere. Her gaze landed on Nathan.

Their eyes locked.

For a fleeting moment, an unspoken tension crackled between them.

Nathan hadn't expected Evelyn to share such an intimate rapport with Adrian...

What other secrets was she keeping from him?

After five charged seconds, Evelyn broke the stare. She approached the male officer, returning the necklace with a polite nod. The officer accepted it and departed with his colleague, escorting Daphne away.

Giselle, pale-faced, turned to leave.

"Stop." Nathan's commanding voice cut through the room like a blade. The sheer authority in his tone froze Giselle mid-step.

"Miss Sterling," he said coolly, "do you truly believe you can simply walk away after slandering someone like that?"

His piercing gaze then shifted to a middle-aged man in the crowd, a frosty smile curling his lips. "Mr. Sterling, your daughter appears to lack basic manners."

Edmund Sterling had no choice but to step forward, forcing an uneasy smile. "This is all a misunderstanding, Mr. Black." He turned to Giselle, his voice firm. "Apologize to Ms. Hartley at once."

###Chapter 308
"Father!" Giselle's voice dripped with defiance.

Edmund's expression turned glacial. "Apologize to her immediately!"

Trapped, Giselle bit her lower lip and muttered toward Evelyn, "My apologies."

Nathan's stern gaze made it clear he found her apology lacking.

"Properly!" Edmund commanded. "Give Ms. Hartley a sincere apology, Giselle!"

Giselle shot her father a look of betrayal and fury.

Edmund met her gaze unflinchingly. Though he often indulged her, Giselle knew he wouldn't hesitate to discipline her if she threatened the family's interests.

Swallowing her pride, Giselle stepped forward and forced out the words, "I apologize, Ms. Hartley. It was wrong of me to accuse you without evidence. Please forgive me."

Evelyn didn't even glance at Giselle. She simply turned to Nathan and said, "Thank you."

Then, addressing Natalie and Ethan, she added, "Let's go."

"Of course," they agreed.

Without another word, the trio exited the banquet early.

Once inside Ethan's car outside the Sterling residence, Natalie couldn't contain her curiosity. "Evelyn, how did you pull that off?" Her eyes sparkled with admiration.

Ethan watched Evelyn expectantly, waiting for an explanation.

Evelyn pressed her lips together briefly before answering. "After Daphne handled my purse, I noticed the clasp wasn't aligned properly. That's when I suspected tampering. When no one was watching, I checked and found the necklace. Realizing she meant to frame me, I decided to turn the tables."

Natalie frowned. "But how did it end up in Daphne's pocket?"

A faint smile touched Evelyn's lips. "Remember when I went to get us drinks? Daphne was there too. I slipped it into her dress pocket discreetly."

"Incredible," Natalie breathed, impressed.

Evelyn's expression darkened. "I initially thought Daphne was behind it. Only when Giselle intervened did I realize she was the mastermind."

She paused, then added, "We've never even spoken. Why would she target me?" The mystery gnawed at her.

Ethan and Natalie exchanged puzzled glances. After a moment, Ethan asked, "Weren't you worried about security cameras catching you?"

Evelyn smiled confidently. "No need to worry, Ethan."

She'd been careful to stay out of their sight.

###Chapter 309

Moreover, since Daphne managed to plant the necklace in my purse, it meant she'd already tampered with the security recordings beforehand.

If anyone reviewed the footage, her guilt would be immediately apparent.

Nathan gave a slow nod of agreement.

"Watching Giselle and Daphne face the music for their schemes is deeply satisfying," Natalie remarked with a satisfied smile.

Evelyn and Ethan exchanged knowing smiles.

Returning home, Evelyn slipped out of her evening gown, removed her makeup, and stepped into a steaming shower.

Emerging from the bathroom, she settled at her vanity for her nightly skincare ritual when the bedroom door creaked open.

Through the mirror's reflection, Evelyn saw Nathan entering.

His gaze swept the room until it locked with hers in the glass.

A heavy silence stretched between them.

After several heartbeats, Nathan closed the distance between them.

His voice was icy when he finally spoke. "Why did you introduce us as mere acquaintances at the gala, Evelyn?"

Evelyn's brow furrowed in genuine confusion. "What should I have said? That I'm your wife?" she countered.

A humorless chuckle escaped Nathan's lips. "Does the idea of being my wife embarrass you?"

Rising to face him directly, Evelyn crossed her arms. "I don't follow your logic, Mr. Black. You made it abundantly clear I should keep my distance and never reveal our marriage. I simply obeyed your instructions. Why does this suddenly bother you?"

Nathan's jaw tightened, momentarily speechless.

Evelyn tilted her head, a knowing smile playing on her lips. "Having regrets, Mr. Black? Ready to make our relationship public after all?"

His expression darkened instantly. "Don't be absurd. That would be disastrous."

Without another word, he turned on his heel and disappeared into the walk-in closet, effectively ending the conversation.

Evelyn watched his retreating form, her amused smile lingering as she returned to her skincare routine with deliberate calm.

Her mind wandered to tonight's unexpected development - Nathan had actually defended her. This was unprecedented.

Three years ago, no matter what scandals she faced or which socialite she argued with at events, Nathan would never have intervened. At parties, whenever she found herself in trouble, he'd remain aloof, not even granting her a passing glance as if she were invisible.

But now... Nathan's behavior toward her had undeniably shifted. She'd noticed the gradual changes, but...

###Chapter 310
Evelyn's hands froze mid-air as she caught her own reflection in the vanity mirror. She exhaled sharply, forcing the unwelcome thoughts away. Enough.

With the divorce proceedings looming over her, obsessing over Nathan's behavior was a waste of energy.

Finishing her nighttime routine with brisk efficiency, she slid beneath the silk sheets, shutting her eyes against the whirlwind of emotions.

The following afternoon, Evelyn's phone buzzed during her lunch break. Julian Hawthorne's name flashed across the screen. Her pulse hitched as she accepted the call.

"Mr. Hawthorne."

"Dr. Hartley," Julian's smooth baritone resonated through the receiver, "Clara and I would be honored if you'd join us for dinner tonight. We'd like to properly thank you."

Evelyn's response was immediate. "That's unnecessary. Saving your aunt was simply part of my job."

Julian's voice warmed but remained insistent. "To us, it was everything. Please don't decline."

She hesitated. "I appreciate the gesture, but I already have plans tonight."

It wasn't a lie—Leonard had invited her grandmother to the Black family estate for dinner.

"Tomorrow evening, then?" Julian pressed.

"That works," Evelyn conceded.

"Perfect. I'll make reservations and send you the details."

After ending the call, Julian twirled his phone between his fingers, a smirk playing on his lips. Last night's events had intrigued him. He'd witnessed every detail—from Daphne deliberately bumping into Evelyn and slipping a necklace into her purse, to Evelyn covertly returning it to Daphne's clutch.

He'd been ready to intervene when the "stolen" necklace was discovered, but Evelyn had outmaneuvered Daphne effortlessly. Not just clever—ruthlessly strategic.

Julian's smirk deepened. Dr. Hartley was far more fascinating than he'd anticipated.

Meanwhile, Evelyn dialed Eleanor's number. When her grandmother answered, Evelyn kept her tone measured. "Grandmother, Leonard has invited you to dinner tonight at the Black residence. He's been quite persistent. Will you go?"

A weighted pause. Then Eleanor sighed. "I've refused twice already. Very well—tell him I'll attend."

Her prior refusals hadn't been out of pride. With Evelyn's divorce from Nathan underway, maintaining ties to the Black family seemed pointless. But Leonard's unwavering invitations had worn down her resolve.

"I'll inform him," Evelyn replied.

###Chapter 311

The evening sun cast golden hues through the grand windows of the Grant estate as Evelyn arrived with Eleanor Sinclair, Grace Monroe, and Isabelle Laurent in tow.

"Leonard, these are just small tokens of appreciation," Eleanor said gracefully, indicating the elegantly wrapped gifts on the marble coffee table.

Leonard's warm smile crinkled the corners of his eyes. "Eleanor, you shouldn't have gone to such trouble. We're family here." He gestured toward the plush sofas. "Please, make yourselves comfortable."

Eleanor settled onto the cream-colored sofa with practiced ease while Grace and Isabelle perched more cautiously on the adjacent loveseat. Isabelle's gaze wandered across the opulent decor, her fingers twitching slightly before she clasped them tightly in her lap.

Nathan stepped forward suddenly, his deep voice breaking the comfortable silence. "Mrs. Sinclair, I owe you an apology for my previous behavior. It was completely unacceptable."

Eleanor studied Nathan's contrite expression for a long moment before responding in an even tone, "Mr. Black, there's no need for formal apologies between family." The deliberate use of his surname didn't escape Leonard's notice.

Leonard smoothly redirected the conversation to lighter topics until Winston Graves announced dinner was served. The group moved to the dining room where crystal chandeliers cast soft light over the elaborate place settings.

Throughout the meal, Nathan surprised everyone by discreetly sliding Evelyn's favorite dishes toward her. Evelyn shot him a questioning glance but remained silent, assuming Leonard must have instructed this courtesy.

Eleanor, however, noticed the precision with which Nathan selected each dish - the roasted duck with cherry glaze Evelyn loved, the truffle mashed potatoes she always requested. Coincidence? Eleanor filed the observation away for later consideration.

After dessert, Leonard touched Eleanor's elbow lightly. "Would you join me in the study? There's a matter I'd like to discuss privately."

The study's rich wood paneling and leather-bound books created an atmosphere of quiet authority. Leonard offered Eleanor a drink, which she declined with a polite wave. "That seven-course dinner was more than enough," she said with a small smile.

Leonard settled into his wingback chair, choosing his words carefully. "I understand if you're still upset with Nathan. His behavior was inexcusable."

To his surprise, Eleanor shook her head. "Leonard, you're worrying unnecessarily. That matter is already in the past."

Leonard studied her composed expression before venturing, "How much do you know about Nathan and Evelyn's... arrangement?"

Eleanor met his gaze steadily. "You mean their agreement to divorce after your birthday celebration? Yes, Evelyn told me everything."

###Chapter 312

Nathan froze momentarily, taken aback by her bluntness. "And what do you think about that?"

Eleanor's response came swift and unshaken. "I believe it's the right decision. The divorce would benefit both Nathan and Evelyn."

Her words left Leonard speechless. He hadn't anticipated Eleanor would endorse the idea so wholeheartedly.

"Eleanor, you..." Leonard exhaled heavily, resignation weighing his voice down. "Surely you see how deeply Evelyn cares for Nathan? Why would you want them to separate? Being with the man she loves should bring her genuine happiness!"

"Happiness? Joy?" Eleanor let out a mirthless laugh. "Forgive me, Leonard, but I don't witness any of that."

She paused briefly, her gaze steady. "Answer me truthfully—do you honestly believe Evelyn has known a single day of happiness since marrying your son?"

Leonard's face stiffened. He wanted to argue, but the words died in his throat.

Eleanor's lips curved into a knowing smile. "This marriage has always been one-sided, Leonard. Your son never wanted to wed Evelyn from the beginning."

"But feelings can develop over time!" Leonard protested, his voice rising suddenly.

Eleanor's tone turned razor-sharp. "Years, Leonard. They've been married for years. If affection was going to blossom, wouldn't it have happened by now?"

Leonard stood frozen, unable to counter.

After a tense silence, he murmured, "Perhaps they just need more time. I still believe—"

"There's no need," Eleanor cut in firmly. "Leonard, I love Evelyn more than you can fathom. I refuse to watch her waste her love on someone who doesn't return it. I don't care about wealth or status—I only want her to find someone who truly values her. Surely you understand that?"

Leonard's shoulders slumped under the weight of her words.

He couldn't deny the painful truth in her statement. He knew his son had given Evelyn nothing but uncertainty—a hollow marriage devoid of the love she deserved. Eleanor's stance wasn't selfish; it came from pure grandmotherly love.

Before Leonard could respond, Eleanor rose abruptly, her expression grave.

"Leonard," she began, voice trembling with emotion, "I ask only one thing. If after your birthday they still choose divorce, don't stand in their way."

Then, to Leonard's shock, Eleanor started to bow before him.

"Eleanor, please don't—" Leonard stammered, springing up to stop her.

His hand rested gently on her shoulder as he sighed in defeat. "Very well," he conceded quietly. "If that's their final decision, I won't interfere."

Eleanor exhaled deeply, relief washing over her features. "Thank you, Leonard," she whispered.

Downstairs, Nathan emerged from the restroom, adjusting his shirt cuffs, when he noticed Isabelle lingering nearby.

Spotting Nathan, Isabelle straightened and called out, "Mr. Black, might I have a word?"
###Chapter 313

Nathan paused, his dark eyes flickering with hesitation. Though Isabelle wasn't blood-related to Evelyn, she'd always been like a sister to her. Whatever she wanted to discuss, it undoubtedly concerned Evelyn.

Without a word, Nathan turned on his heel and strode toward a secluded corner of the mansion.

Isabelle blinked in surprise but hurried after him.

He stopped at a moonlit balcony, the cool night breeze tousling his raven-black hair as he faced her. "What is it?" His voice was low, edged with impatience.

"Mr. Black," Isabelle began, twisting her fingers nervously, "is it true that you and Evelyn are finalizing the divorce soon?"

Nathan's brows knitted together, his expression unreadable. Instead of answering, he countered, "Did you chase me down just to ask that?"

Isabelle stiffened, then shook her head vigorously. "No! I... I wanted you to know that Evelyn truly cares for you. The only reason she's considering divorce is because she wants your attention. That's all."

A sardonic smile played on Nathan's lips. "Is that so?"

"Yes!" Isabelle nodded eagerly, her eyes wide with sincerity. "We grew up together—I know her better than anyone. If you showed her even a fraction of kindness, she'd never go through with it."

Nathan's smirk deepened, enigmatic. "Does Evelyn know you're telling me this?" he asked abruptly.

Isabelle's cheeks flushed. "Of course not! She'd never admit her feelings. That's why I approached you privately. Please, don't tell her about this."

Nathan studied her in silence, his piercing gaze making her squirm.

Desperate, Isabelle continued, "Mr. Black, you must believe me! This is only the second time I've seen Evelyn so invested in a man—"

Nathan's eyes sharpened. "Second time?" His voice turned icy.

Isabelle paled. Her gaze darted away as she stammered, "N-no! I misspoke! You're the first man she's ever loved!"

Her panicked reaction betrayed her. She clearly wanted him to believe her slip was meaningless.

Nathan let out a cold chuckle. "Interesting," he remarked, his tone devoid of warmth.

Frantic, Isabelle stepped closer. "Wait, Mr. Black, I didn't mean—"

Her foot caught on the uneven tiles. She lurched forward—straight toward Nathan.

But with feline grace, Nathan sidestepped, leaving her to crash into the balcony railing. "Ah!" she cried, clutching her ribs in pain.

Nathan observed her dispassionately. "Miss Laurent," he drawled, amusement lacing his voice, "you should watch your step."

###Chapter 314

The biting sarcasm in his voice sent a shiver down her spine.

Isabelle's cheeks burned crimson, humiliation crashing over her like a tidal wave.

"I...I apologize, Mr. Black," she stuttered, fingers twisting the fabric of her dress. "It wasn't my intention. I merely wished to clarify about Evelyn. She's never shown interest in anyone else."

Her voice dropped to a whisper. "Only you."

Nathan let out a dark, humorless laugh, his icy gaze piercing through her.

"Frankly, I couldn't care less," he said, each word dripping with disdain. "But your desperate explanations...they make me question everything."

His eyes raked over her trembling form with deliberate cruelty.

"Tell me, Miss Laurent—should I believe your pathetic excuses or not?"

Isabelle's breath hitched, her face frozen in a mask of terror. The silence stretched unbearably before she finally choked out, "I'm speaking the truth."

"Pathetic." Nathan's voice was devoid of emotion.

Without another word, he turned on his heel and strode away, leaving Isabelle rooted to the spot. His cutting words hung in the air like poisoned daggers, their meaning as elusive as they were cruel.

A storm of emotions flickered across her face—fear, anger, shame. In the end, she merely bit her lip until it bled and fled the scene without another word.

Eleanor and her entourage didn't linger at the Grant estate. After exchanging pleasantries in the grand foyer, Nathan and Evelyn saw them off.

Once the guests departed, Leonard summoned Nathan to his study.

The older man's voice was steady when he spoke. "I've discussed your situation with Evelyn's grandmother."

Nathan remained silent, his expression unreadable.

"Eleanor supports the divorce," Leonard continued. "She's asked me not to interfere if you and Evelyn still wish to proceed after my birthday celebrations."

At this, Nathan's pupils contracted almost imperceptibly. He'd anticipated this outcome.

"She refuses to let Evelyn waste her life on a man who doesn't love her," Leonard added. "And I can't fault her for that. She's protecting her granddaughter. So if you still want the divorce after my birthday, I won't stand in your way."

The silence that followed was deafening. Nathan wasn't disagreeing—he simply had nothing to say.

Leonard leaned forward, his gaze intense. "Nathan, have you truly considered this? Is divorce really what you want?"

After an eternity, Nathan finally spoke, his voice hollow. "Yes."

The single word fell like a guillotine's blade. Yet as it left his lips, an unfamiliar tightness gripped his chest. He quickly dismissed it—this was what he'd wanted all along, wasn't it? He should be relieved. Happy even.

Leonard studied his son's impassive face, emotions warring behind his own eyes. Finally, he straightened in his chair. "Very well. If that's your decision, I'll say no more. You may go."

###Chapter 315
Nathan stood abruptly and exited without another word.

Leonard watched his son's retreating figure, a seed of concern planting itself in his mind. He could only hope Nathan wouldn't come to regret this choice later.

When Nathan returned to the master suite with Evelyn, his gaze instinctively swept the room. It was empty except for the pale moonlight filtering through the balcony doors. He crossed the space, drawn to the open balcony.

Outside, the night breeze carried the faint scent of jasmine. Evelyn sat curled on the swing chair, her silhouette outlined against the city lights as she stared into the distance.

Nathan stepped onto the balcony, his voice cutting through the quiet. "How close are you with Isabelle?"

Evelyn turned, her brow furrowing at the unexpected question. "Why do you ask?"

Nathan ignored her. "Are you two friends?"

"Of course," Evelyn said after a beat. "We've always been close."

"Be careful around her." His tone carried an edge that made Evelyn stiffen.

Her frown deepened. "What's that supposed to mean? Did something happen?"

Nathan leaned against the railing. "Isabelle came to see me earlier. Said you're madly in love with me and this divorce is just some elaborate scheme to get my attention."

A dry chuckle escaped him.

Evelyn's face darkened instantly. Isabelle had gone behind her back? And said what—that she was playing hard to get?

Before she could respond, Nathan added, "Oh, and she mentioned I'm only the second man you've ever liked."

Evelyn's breath caught. Her nails dug into her palms. What game was Isabelle playing?

Nathan continued, his voice laced with sarcasm. "Then she conveniently 'twisted her ankle' and tried to fall into my arms. Tell me, Evelyn—do you think the tiles in this house are defective, or was it just bad acting?"

Evelyn stared at him, momentarily speechless. Then realization crashed over her like ice water.

Isabelle had been trying to seduce Nathan.

Suddenly, everything made sense—the odd questions, the sudden interest in her marriage, Isabelle eavesdropping on her conversation with Eleanor. She'd been gathering intel.

A sharp pang of betrayal lanced through Evelyn's chest. She'd treated Isabelle like family. Like a sister.

She trusted Nathan wouldn't lie about this. He had no reason to.

Taking a steadying breath, Evelyn bit her lip. "I see."

Nathan said nothing more. He turned and walked back inside, leaving Evelyn alone with the wreckage of her trust.

###Chapter 316

The phone in Evelyn's pocket vibrated insistently. She pulled it out, her breath catching when she saw the caller ID: Victor Sterling.

Her fingers hovered over the screen for a heartbeat before answering.

"Evelyn!" Victor's voice roared through the speaker, sharp enough to make her flinch. "Must you constantly drag our family name through the mud?"

Evelyn's grip tightened around her phone. "What exactly have I done now?" she demanded, her voice like shards of ice.

"Do you have any idea who Giselle Sterling is?" Victor spat. "Do you comprehend the power the Sterling family holds in Owathe?"

"They rank eighth among the elite families," Evelyn replied evenly, though her pulse quickened.

Victor's fury escalated. "Then why in God's name would you humiliate Miss Sterling? Do you honestly believe the Hartley family can withstand the Sterlings' wrath?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Tell me, Father—was it I who provoked her? Or was it Giselle and Daphne who publicly accused me of theft? Should I have remained silent while they slandered me?"

"You have a history, Evelyn!" Victor shot back cruelly. "Can you blame people for assuming the worst?"

The words struck like a physical blow. Evelyn's vision blurred momentarily.

Before she could retort, Victor continued viciously, "Fine. Clear your name if you must. But did you need to expose Miss Sterling's necklace as counterfeit? Was flaunting your connection to Steven Rayne truly necessary? You made a Sterling look like a fool in front of high society!"

A bitter laugh escaped Evelyn's lips. "Let me understand—when falsely accused, I should simply accept the insult? Is that what you're saying?"

"Fight back?" Victor's voice dripped with contempt. "Against a Sterling? Know your place, girl! You've angered the Sterlings and walked away unscathed, but have you considered the consequences for our family? When they direct their fury at us, what then? Are we equipped to survive their retaliation?"

Each word was a hammer strike.

Evelyn remained eerily calm. "What would you have me do?"

"Go to Sterling Manor immediately," Victor commanded. "Beg Miss Sterling's forgiveness on your knees."

Ice flooded Evelyn's veins.

Her own father. Her own flesh and blood. Demanding she apologize to the very person who'd wronged her.

Her voice dropped to a deadly whisper. "You want me to apologize to that viper? You're delusional."

Victor exploded. "Evelyn Hartley! You will obey me this time! If you refuse, you'll face consequences beyond your imagining!"

"Then let them come," Evelyn said with glacial finality before ending the call.

Without hesitation, she blocked Victor's number—a mistake to ever unblock it.

Setting the phone aside, she closed her eyes and drew several steadying breaths. The familiar ache in her chest pulsed with each heartbeat.

###Chapter 317

Evelyn had once clung to the faint hope that even if Victor didn't love her as his daughter, he might at least possess some basic decency. But this? This betrayal cut deeper than she'd ever imagined.

Sometimes she questioned what Diana had ever seen in Victor. Diana was elegant, visionary—a woman of substance and grace. By all accounts, someone of her caliber should never have married a man like Victor: selfish, deceitful, and utterly lacking in loyalty.

Evelyn remained on the balcony longer than intended, letting the crisp night air numb her turbulent emotions before finally retreating inside. The scalding shower did nothing to wash away her bitterness. She lay awake until dawn's first light, grateful at least for her day off—she desperately needed the rest.

Meanwhile, at the Sterling estate, Daphne burst into Giselle's chambers, her face ashen with panic.

"Giselle! We're ruined!" she gasped, voice trembling.

Giselle glanced up from her vanity, unimpressed by the theatrics. "Compose yourself. Breathe, then speak clearly."

But Daphne couldn't slow her racing thoughts. "There's no time! This morning, our longest-standing business partner severed ties with my family. Father just learned they've aligned with the Caldwells instead!"

She clutched the bedpost for support before adding in a whisper, "This has to be retaliation for what happened to Evelyn. Giselle, what do we do now?"

A shadow crossed Giselle's features. "You're certain of this?"

"Absolutely!" Daphne paced like a caged animal before suddenly whirling around. "What if I beg Evelyn for forgiveness? If I apologize, maybe the Caldwells will stop—"

Giselle's palm slammed against the tea table with such force the porcelain rattled. Her glacial stare pinned Daphne in place. "Have you lost all reason? Do you truly believe that snake would show mercy? And how exactly would you explain yourself? By throwing me under the carriage?" Her voice dripped with venom.

Daphne recoiled. "No! I'd never—I just—" She swallowed hard. "I spoke without thinking. I won't approach her."

Giselle's posture relaxed marginally. She exhaled through pursed lips before adopting a calmer tone. "This likely has nothing to do with the Caldwells. Don't borrow trouble."

But Daphne shook her head violently, complexion ghostly. "It's them! The timing proves it! I'd heard rumors about Evelyn—dismissed them as exaggerations. Now I fear they might be true!"

"What rumors?" Giselle's brow furrowed.

###Chapter 318

Daphne proceeded to reveal everything she had uncovered about what transpired with Dylan, Lila, and their associates.

After absorbing the information, Giselle's expression darkened considerably. She fixed Daphne with a piercing stare, demanding sharply, "Why didn't you inform me of this sooner?"

Daphne blinked innocently. "I..."

"I didn't truly believe any of it initially, so why would I mention it? Besides, I did warn you that Marcus values Evelyn, but you dismissed my concerns."

"You!" Giselle's voice trembled with a mixture of fury and panic.

The Caldwell family had already begun their assault on the Whitmore family. Were the Sterlings next? Yet upon reflection, Giselle dismissed the thought. The Whitmores were easy prey for the Caldwells, but the Sterlings ranked among the elite eight families. They wouldn't be such simple targets.

Would the Caldwells truly risk war with the Sterlings over a mere friend?

This reasoning steadied Giselle's nerves. Turning to Daphne, she said, "Listen, dwelling on this serves no purpose now. Considering the Caldwells have already struck your family once, they're unlikely to target you again. So stop worrying."

Daphne, however, found Giselle's reassurances hollow. It was easy for Giselle to speak so casually—she hadn't endured the Caldwells' wrath firsthand. She remained blissfully unaware of the true consequences since she wasn't the one suffering.

Giselle didn't even consider that she'd offended Evelyn and the Caldwells on Daphne's behalf. Now that Daphne's family faced retaliation, there wasn't even any compensation.

Though these thoughts simmered beneath the surface, Daphne masked her resentment. After all, her family still relied on the Sterlings.

Giselle offered some half-hearted comfort before dismissing Daphne.

The situation's development had caught Giselle off guard. She'd never imagined the necklace from her ardent admirer would be counterfeit.

Though she'd lost this first skirmish with Evelyn, surrender wasn't in her nature. Their feud was now set in stone.

"Let's see who laughs last," she muttered darkly.

At noon, Edmund returned home.

"Father, you're back!" Giselle greeted cheerfully.

"Do you realize the trouble you've caused?" Edmund snapped.

Giselle blinked with feigned innocence. "What have I done?"

"Our company's project was stolen by the Caldwells!" Edmund's face darkened with rage. "This partner was a small firm, but their project showed immense promise. After extensive negotiations, we were ready to sign—only for them to sign with the Caldwells today! All my efforts wasted, and the Caldwells reap the benefits!"

As he spoke, Edmund's anger intensified, veins throbbing at his temples.

"What? What did you say?" Giselle's expression shifted instantly. She hadn't expected the Caldwells would antagonize the Sterlings over someone unrelated by blood.

###Chapter 319

Had Marcus and his wife completely lost their senses? Was destroying two prominent families really worth it for a mere acquaintance?

What Edmund said next twisted the knife deeper into Giselle's heart.

His expression darkened as he spoke through gritted teeth. "How many times must I tell you to control that temper of yours? Normally I wouldn't care if you targeted nobodies. But Evelyn? The woman who's practically family to the Caldwells? You've never even exchanged words with her! What possible justification could you have?"

Giselle bit her lower lip until it turned white. "She was getting too close to Julian. He bought her desserts, they laughed together... That level of familiarity is unacceptable!"

Edmund's face flushed crimson with barely contained rage. "Julian? You've been throwing yourself at that man for years and he still treats you like wallpaper. You're a Sterling heiress - have some dignity!"

"I don't care!" Giselle shrieked, her voice cracking. "I love him! Any woman who dares come between us is my enemy!"

Her obsession had clearly crossed into dangerous territory.

"And what solution do you propose for this mess?" Edmund demanded.

"That's your problem to solve!" Giselle spat before storming toward the grand staircase.

"Giselle! Stop this instant!" Edmund bellowed, but his daughter didn't even glance back.

The news of the Caldwell family's retaliation against the Sterlings and Chamberlains spread through elite circles like wildfire. Society now understood that while Evelyn might be Victor Sterling's illegitimate daughter, she was utterly untouchable with the Caldwells' protection.

Moreover, everyone recognized Giselle and Daphne as the clear aggressors in this situation. The loss of lucrative partnerships was entirely their own doing.

Meanwhile, Lila Sinclair sat fuming in her penthouse, having taken an unplanned day off. The morning's revelations had shattered her good mood.

"That little bitch!" She hurled a crystal paperweight across the room. "Why does Olivia Caldwell dote on her so much? What makes Evelyn so damn special?"

Lila had orchestrated that banquet humiliation perfectly - exposing Evelyn's bastard status while framing her as a thief. Yet somehow, Evelyn emerged unscathed while Lila suffered the consequences.

"And now she's practically royalty while I'm the laughingstock."

The memory of Evelyn commanding the room, casually name-dropping the global art director of rema, made Lila's blood boil with envy. Why couldn't she have been the one to capture the Caldwells' attention first? She was every bit as talented - no, more talented - than that Hartley girl.

A dangerous idea began taking shape in Lila's mind. Her lips curled into a predatory smile as her eyes gleamed with malicious intent.

The following morning found Evelyn at the Caldwell estate. By afternoon, she sat in the sun-dappled garden, sharing tea and laughter with Olivia Sinclair.

###Chapter 320

The peaceful atmosphere shattered when Evelyn's phone buzzed with an unknown caller ID.

Evelyn swiped to answer, her voice carefully neutral. "Who is this?"

"It's your father, Evelyn," Victor's voice crackled through the line.

Evelyn's face darkened immediately. Her thumb hovered over the end call button, but something made her hesitate.

She stood abruptly, turning to Olivia. "Excuse me, I need to take this."

Olivia gave a knowing nod. "Of course."

Evelyn moved several paces away, her back rigid.

"What do you want now, Mr. Sterling?" Her voice could have frozen hell over.

Victor's tone took on an uncharacteristic softness. "Evelyn, I've been thinking... about how wrong I was yesterday."

"I shouldn't have spoken to you that way. I owe you an apology."

A bitter laugh escaped Evelyn's lips. "The great Victor Sterling admitting fault? Now that's something I never thought I'd hear."

Her smile never reached her eyes. Every cruel word from their last conversation played in her mind like a broken record.

"Evelyn, I truly regret my actions," Victor continued, sounding almost... humble. But the act only made her stomach churn.

She knew better. She knew exactly why he was calling now.

The Caldwell family's brutal retaliation against the Sterling and Whitmore families had changed everything. Suddenly, the Sterlings were untouchable, and Victor wanted back in her good graces. But Evelyn saw right through him.

Her instincts were correct.

When news first broke, Victor had been stunned. The Caldwells going to war for someone outside their bloodline? Unheard of. The Whitmores were one thing, but the Sterlings - ranked eighth among elite families - that was another matter entirely.

Was Evelyn really worth burning bridges with the Sterlings?

At first, Victor thought the Caldwells had lost their minds. Then it hit him - his daughter held more sway with them than he'd ever imagined.

Evelyn's laugh was ice cold. "Don't flatter yourself. You're not worth my anger."

On the other end, Victor's face twisted in rage. He bit back his temper, forcing calm into his voice.

"Evelyn," he said with forced warmth, "why don't you come home for dinner? We should talk—"

Evelyn cut him off. "The only thing that would accomplish is ruining my appetite."

She ended the call without waiting for a response.

###Chapter 321

Evelyn slipped her phone into her pocket, taking a deep breath to compose herself before returning to the garden where Olivia sat waiting.

Olivia's sharp eyes immediately caught her troubled expression. "Evelyn, darling, what's wrong? You look like you've seen a ghost."

With a faint shake of her head, Evelyn forced a small smile. "It's nothing," she murmured softly.

Leaning against Olivia's shoulder, Evelyn nuzzled closer with uncharacteristic vulnerability. "Thank you," she whispered, "for having my back. You and your friends... it means more than you know."

Olivia stroked Evelyn's hair affectionately. "That's what family does, sweetheart. No one gets to hurt you while we're around."

Evelyn remained silent, her thoughts drifting to those who should have protected her but didn't. The memory of her father's betrayal still stung...

"By the way," Olivia broke the silence, "Marcus called while you were away. The Sterlings and Whitmores want to come apologize in person. What should I tell him?"

Straightening up, Evelyn's expression turned icy. "Don't bother. Their apologies would be as fake as their smiles. I won't waste my time on their theatrics."

After a thoughtful pause, Olivia nodded. "You're absolutely right. I'll have Marcus send them packing."

That evening, Evelyn had planned to dine with Julian, but he'd canceled due to urgent business. Instead, she found herself enjoying a surprisingly pleasant dinner with the Caldwell family.

Later, Cassandra and Julian Montgomery practically dragged Evelyn to the Velvet Lounge. She'd hesitated at first, but Olivia had encouraged her. "Go have some fun, darling. You deserve it."

At the club, Cassandra raised her cocktail with a mischievous grin. "Come on, Evelyn! Bottoms up!"

Evelyn clinked glasses lightly before taking a cautious sip, immediately regretting it as the strong liquor burned her throat.

Cassandra leaned in conspiratorially. "So... do you know why Giselle's been targeting you?"

Evelyn shook her head, genuinely puzzled.

"It's Julian," Cassandra explained. "She's obsessed with him. At the gala, when he spent time talking with you? That was enough to make you her mortal enemy."

Evelyn's eyes widened in disbelief. She'd only met Julian twice - they were barely acquaintances. That someone would go to such lengths over such a trivial interaction was absurd.

"Wait," Evelyn breathed, "all this... because I had a conversation with Julian?"

Cassandra nodded grimly. "Giselle's ruthless. Any woman who even looks at Julian becomes her target. Last year? She bankrupted some poor girl's family business. That's why most women avoid Julian now."

The revelation hit Evelyn like a punch to the gut. Wasn't this exactly how she'd behaved under Lila's influence? The realization made her cringe - she'd been just as insufferable.

"That's Giselle for you," Cassandra shrugged. "Vicious and vindictive. But don't worry - with Aunt Olivia and Uncle Marcus backing you, no one would dare touch you."

###Chapter 322

Evelyn forced a weak smile, giving a slight nod of agreement.

Cassandra raised her glass again, her enthusiasm contagious. "Let's go wild tonight! We're not stopping until we drop!"

Evelyn chuckled softly and took another sip.

Cassandra kept finding excuses to refill Evelyn's glass.

Something felt off tonight - Evelyn's alcohol tolerance seemed nonexistent. After just a few drinks, the room started spinning.

A faint alarm bell rang in her mind, but before she could react, her body betrayed her.

She collapsed onto the couch, unconscious...

Seeing this, Cassandra set down her wine glass and called out, "Evelyn? Hey, are you okay? Did you pass out? Come on, wake up! The party's just starting!" She leaned over and shook Evelyn several times.

No response.

Cassandra glanced up at Julian, their eyes meeting. A triumphant smirk flashed between them.

"Now's our chance," Cassandra said, her previously cheerful demeanor replaced by cold calculation.

Julian nodded. "Let's move."

He stepped forward, bending to scoop Evelyn into his arms.

Just as his fingers brushed her wrist...

"Back off!" Evelyn suddenly sprang up from the couch, her bloodshot eyes blazing with fury.

Julian froze momentarily before forcing a charming smile. "Ms. Hartley, you're clearly intoxicated. Allow me to escort you home." He reached for her again.

With a sharp crack, Evelyn slapped his hand away and staggered to her feet. "Who...who says I'm drunk? I'm stone cold sober! Now watch this!" She suddenly broke into song, "We will, we will rock you..."

Julian stood dumbstruck.

Cassandra gaped at Evelyn in confusion.

"What the hell?" Julian muttered under his breath.

"No idea!" Cassandra shook her head. After a pause, she hissed, "We can't waste time. Stick to the plan!"

Julian sighed and tried again. "Ms. Hartley, you need to go home now," he said firmly.

Before he could react, Evelyn grabbed his arm and flipped him over her shoulder with surprising strength, slamming him onto the floor with a painful thud.

Julian groaned, writhing in pain. "Jesus Christ..."

Cassandra's jaw dropped. "What just happened?" she gasped.

"I can't do this. She's like a damn ninja when she's drunk. You try..." Julian clutched his back as he struggled to stand.

###Chapter 323

Cassandra hesitated, her fingers trembling slightly. This version of Evelyn was terrifying. With Julian unable to approach Evelyn, the weight of their plan rested entirely on her shoulders.

Taking a deep breath, Cassandra stepped forward. Evelyn was still swaying wildly, completely off-beat to the music blaring through the speakers. "Evelyn, it's me, Cassandra! You're drunk. Let me take you home, okay?"

The moment Cassandra's fingers brushed Evelyn's arm, she found herself flying through the air. Evelyn flipped her effortlessly, sending her crashing onto the hard floor.

"Ahhh!" Cassandra screamed, clutching her side in pain.

"Cassandra!" Julian limped over, his face twisted in concern as he helped her up.

Meanwhile, Evelyn clapped her hands with childish delight. "That was fun! Let's do it again!" With a loud whoop, she launched into a spinning kick before landing in a perfect martial arts stance.

Cassandra and Julian exchanged stunned glances. There was no doubt now—Evelyn truly knew how to fight.

Julian whispered urgently, "What now? We can't even get near her."

Cassandra's face was tight with frustration. She hadn't anticipated things spiraling out of control like this. Who knew Evelyn would turn into a drunken martial artist? Her reflexes were lightning-fast, making it impossible for either of them to get close.

Calling for help wasn't an option. If Evelyn remembered everything tomorrow, their entire scheme would collapse. But this opportunity was too perfect to waste. If they let it slip away, would they ever get another chance?

Yet what could they do? Evelyn was unpredictable in her drunken state, lashing out at anyone who approached.

"Maybe we should abandon this attempt," Julian muttered under his breath.

Cassandra bit her lip hard as she watched Evelyn switch songs, now attempting to rap along badly.

She hadn't thought much of Evelyn initially. But over time, she'd come to understand Evelyn's significant influence within the Donovan family.

After discussing it with her mother, they'd decided to use Evelyn to secure their position within the family. If Evelyn married Julian, Cassandra was certain it would bring their small family closer to Olivia and Marcus.

Originally, Cassandra had planned to take it slow. She'd arranged for Julian and Evelyn to spend time together naturally, hoping feelings might develop. That would have been the safest, most lasting approach.

But Evelyn proved nearly impossible to get close to.

Every invitation was either refused outright or accepted only if Ethan came along. And with Ethan present, neither she nor Julian dared make a move. Ethan would have seen through their intentions immediately.

That's why Cassandra had resorted to drastic measures. Get Evelyn drunk, let something happen between her and Julian...

Tonight was supposed to be perfect. But drunk Evelyn was uncontrollable, turning everything into chaos. Neither Cassandra nor Julian could even touch her.

###Chapter 324

Even after everything, surrendering now left a sour taste in Cassandra’s mouth. She inhaled deeply, straightened her posture, and steeled herself for one final attempt to approach Evelyn.

“I’ll try one more time,” she muttered.

But Evelyn wasn’t having any of it.

“Evelyn, please! Just listen to me—”

Evelyn shoved Cassandra to the ground again.

“Evelyn! It’s me, Cassandra! You’re way too drunk right now. Let me—”

Another failure.

After two disastrous attempts, Cassandra finally admitted defeat. With trembling fingers, she fished out her phone and dialed Ethan.

Cassandra was barely holding it together. Every inch of her body ached, and she didn’t dare get near Evelyn again.

Evelyn, meanwhile, seemed to have endless energy, belting out karaoke at the top of her lungs and occasionally breaking into wild dance moves.

The moment Ethan stepped into the room, Cassandra rushed to him, her face a mix of exhaustion and relief.

“Ethan! Thank heavens you’re here!” she gasped.

Ethan’s gaze landed on Evelyn, who was now standing barefoot on the sofa, singing like she was headlining a concert. His expression shifted, lips twitching as he suppressed a sigh.

“What happened?” he asked, voice low.

Cassandra launched into an explanation, gesturing wildly. “Evelyn got completely wasted. Julian and I tried to take her home, but she was out of control! Every time we got close, she flipped us over like we were nothing! We had no choice but to call you.”

Ethan arched a brow and waved them off. “I’ll handle it. You two can go.”

Cassandra and Julian didn’t need to be told twice. They bolted from the room, leaving Ethan alone with the chaos.

Ethan approached Evelyn cautiously. “Evelyn, it’s me. I’m taking you home.”

Evelyn spun around, narrowing her eyes. “Who the hell do you think you are? Trying to impersonate Ethan? Take this!”

Before Ethan could react, Evelyn launched into a flying kick. Instinctively, he raised his arm to block the blow.

Evelyn’s foot slammed into his forearm with shocking force, sending him stumbling back several steps.

Ethan stared at her, stunned.

In all the years he’d known Evelyn, he’d seen her drunk before. She’d been loud, reckless, even obnoxious—but never violent.

Yet now…

That kick had been no joke. His arm still throbbed from the impact.

###Chapter 325

"Evelyn, look at me," Ethan said firmly, his piercing gaze locking onto hers. His voice carried an urgency that cut through her drunken haze. "It's Ethan. You know me."

Evelyn blinked slowly, her defiant expression melting into confusion. She rubbed her temples as if trying to clear fog from her mind. The alcohol made everything swim before her eyes.

After what felt like an eternity, she suddenly wailed, "I don't want you! Where's my husband? I need Nathan!"

She began stumbling around the lavish hotel suite, knocking over a vase in her frantic search. Her movements were erratic as she checked behind curtains and under tables, calling Nathan's name like a mantra.

The alcohol had clearly taken full control now.

When her desperate search proved fruitless, Evelyn collapsed onto the plush carpet with a dramatic sob. Tears streamed down her flushed cheeks as she cried, "Why did he leave me? Doesn't he love me anymore?"

Ethan froze, taken aback by her raw emotion. He knelt beside her, careful not to touch. "Evelyn, listen to me," he said gently. "Nathan didn't leave you. He's just tied up with work."

"I don't care about work!" Evelyn shrieked, pounding her fists against the floor like a petulant child. "I want my husband here right now!"

Ethan ran his fingers through his dark hair, exhaling sharply. "Alright, alright," he conceded after a moment's thought. "I'll call Nathan for you, okay?"

Like magic, Evelyn's tears stopped. She looked up at him with wide, hopeful eyes, her tear-streaked face suddenly bright. "Promise?" she hiccuped.

"Yes," Ethan assured her, keeping his distance. "Just stay put. I'll call him to come get you."

"Really?" Evelyn clapped her hands together, her mood swinging to giddy excitement in an instant.

Ethan blinked, momentarily speechless at her rapid emotional shifts. The usually composed Evelyn was behaving like an entirely different person.

Standing, he pulled out his phone and dialed Nathan's number. After several rings, a deep voice answered amidst background noise.

"Ethan?" Nathan's voice came through, slightly distorted.

"Nathan," Ethan said evenly. "Evelyn's had too much to drink. She's in suite 3603 at the Grand Marquis. You should come get her."

He deliberately omitted Evelyn's emotional breakdown and constant pleas for her husband.

There was a brief silence before Nathan replied, "On my way." The line went dead.

Ethan pocketed his phone and turned back to Evelyn. "He's coming."

Evelyn's entire face lit up like the sunrise.

"Get off the floor," Ethan said, extending a hand. "You'll catch cold."

To his shock, Evelyn slapped his hand away with surprising force. "Don't touch me!" she snapped, her eyes blazing. "Nathan would be furious if you touched me!"

Ethan recoiled, momentarily stunned by her vehemence. He sighed deeply. "Fine. But can you at least get up?"

###Chapter 326
Evelyn narrowed her eyes at him with suspicion but eventually staggered to her feet. She shuffled toward the leather couch and climbed onto its backrest, perching there with perfect posture as if attending a high-society tea party.

Her uncharacteristically prim demeanor was oddly endearing. Nathan couldn't suppress a chuckle at the sight.

Twenty minutes later, the door swung open, and Ethan strode in.

The moment Ethan appeared, Evelyn brightened, standing on the couch with a radiant smile. But she didn't leap down. Instead, she waited expectantly, her gaze locked onto him like a sunflower tracking the sun.

As Ethan approached, Nathan caught the sharp tang of whiskey clinging to his clothes. Clearly, he'd just come from a business negotiation.

When Ethan reached the couch, Evelyn's face lit up like fireworks. "Darling! You're here!" she exclaimed, her voice dripping with delight.

"Get down," Ethan ordered, his tone firm but quiet.

Evelyn shook her head stubbornly. "No! Carry me!" She stretched her arms toward him, fingers wiggling in a clear demand.

Ethan froze momentarily, visibly startled by her boldness.

"She's... not herself tonight," Nathan remarked dryly. After a beat, he added, "Normally when she's drunk, she just sings off-key and tries to arm-wrest strangers. But tonight..." He trailed off with a shrug. "She won't let anyone near her. Only you."

Ethan's expression flickered briefly before settling into its usual unreadable mask. Without another word, he stepped forward and scooped Evelyn into his arms.

She immediately melted against him, winding her arms around his neck and nuzzling into his shoulder with a contented sigh.

Nathan grabbed her discarded heels and gestured toward the exit. "Let's go. I'll walk you out."

The trio made their way to the parking lot where Walter, Ethan's driver, stood waiting by the sleek black car.

Ethan opened the rear door, attempting to deposit Evelyn inside, but she clung to him like ivy on a trellis. "No! No car!" she protested, tightening her grip.

Ethan exhaled sharply through his nose, the picture of exasperated resignation. After a brief internal debate, he slid into the seat himself, keeping Evelyn cradled in his lap.

Nathan's eyebrows shot up at the unexpected display of tolerance. He'd never seen Ethan indulge anyone's whims like this.

As the car pulled away, Nathan found himself reevaluating everything. Olivia had always insisted Ethan was indifferent to Evelyn, that divorce was her best option. But tonight's events painted a different picture.

Frowning thoughtfully, Nathan turned on his heel and headed back into the club.

Inside the moving vehicle, Evelyn remained curled comfortably in Ethan's lap, her arms looped around his neck. Her head rested lightly against his shoulder, eyes closed in peaceful contentment.

Ethan studied her face, his dark eyes swirling with unreadable emotions.

###Chapter 327

Nathan had always found Evelyn's presence irritating before. He'd treated her as if she were invisible, even after her return from studying abroad. Their relationship remained strained, filled with unspoken tension.

Yet now, as she leaned against him with such innocent trust, an unfamiliar warmth bloomed in his chest—something he couldn't quite define.

Exhausted from her earlier excitement, Evelyn soon fell into a deep slumber. Her breathing steadied, her grip around Nathan's neck loosening slightly.

When they reached home, Nathan carried Evelyn upstairs to her bedroom. He laid her down carefully, turning to leave when her hand suddenly shot out, grabbing his collar.

Her grip was unexpectedly strong. Before he could react, she pulled him down toward her.

Nathan stumbled, bracing himself against the mattress to avoid crushing her. The movement brought their faces dangerously close—so close that his lips brushed against hers.

The moment their lips met, Nathan's pupils dilated sharply. His breath hitched as Evelyn's drowsy eyes fluttered open, her long lashes grazing his cheek like butterfly wings.

That fleeting contact sent electric currents through Nathan's body, awakening something primal and unknown within him.

Several charged seconds passed before Nathan pushed himself up slightly. His voice emerged rough and uneven. "What are you doing, Evelyn?"

Evelyn met his gaze with startling intensity, her cheeks flushed a delicate rose that enhanced her ethereal beauty.

With quiet determination, she answered, "Kissing you." Those simple yet bold words struck Nathan harder than any physical blow.

His dark eyes smoldered as his Adam's apple bobbed. "And what else do you want to do besides kiss me?" he murmured, his voice dripping with dangerous charm.

Instead of answering, Evelyn acted. She wrapped her arms around his neck, pulling him down again as she pressed her lips to his with purposeful tenderness.

The kiss deepened naturally, their movements growing more urgent as if drawn together by some irresistible force. Evelyn parted her lips slightly, allowing Nathan to explore further as their tongues danced in intoxicating rhythm.

Her heart pounded wildly, each beat echoing through her entire being as she surrendered to the overwhelming sensations.

As passion flared, Evelyn's fingers fumbled with the buttons of Nathan's shirt. One popped open, then another...

When she struggled with the third button, Nathan's hand shot out to stop her.

He propped himself up, his heated gaze roaming over her face. Evelyn's lips were slightly swollen and glistening from their passionate exchange, making her utterly irresistible.

Nathan's gravelly voice broke the charged silence. "Evelyn, do you realize what you're doing right now?"

Their eyes locked, the air between them thick with unspoken desire.

###Chapter 328

"I know," Evelyn whispered, her voice barely above a breath.

A dangerous glint flashed in Nathan's eyes, primal and untamed. "No going back now," he growled.

Before she could respond, he claimed her lips again in a searing kiss that stole her breath.

His hands moved with practiced ease, slipping beneath the delicate fabric of her dress.

Evelyn's trembling fingers struggled with Nathan's shirt buttons. Impatient, she tore the fabric apart.

Pearl buttons scattered across the hardwood floor like fallen stars.

Within moments, all barriers between them disappeared, leaving only heated skin and the thunderous beating of their hearts.

This wasn't Nathan's first time seeing Evelyn unclothed. Yet tonight felt entirely different.

Compared to that stolen glance in the bathroom weeks ago, now he could drink in every inch of her.

Moonlight cascaded over her curves, highlighting every exquisite dip and swell.

Nathan's breath caught as his gaze traveled downward. Heat flooded his veins, his mouth suddenly dry.

Resistance was impossible now.

His fingertips brushed her collarbone, marveling at the satin texture of her skin.

Evelyn's cheeks burned crimson.

She turned her face away, suddenly shy.

"Look at me," Nathan commanded, voice rough with desire.

Slowly, Evelyn obeyed, meeting his smoldering gaze through her lashes.

Nathan trailed kisses down her throat, each touch igniting fire across her skin until he reached the peak of her breast.

A soft whimper escaped Evelyn's lips.

She bit down on her lower lip, shocked at the sound she'd made.

Her fingers tangled in Nathan's hair, pulling him closer as her eyes fluttered shut. Everything was perfect until...

"Ah! Nathan, wait—"

Evelyn gasped sharply as pain shot through her.

Her nails scored down his back, leaving angry red marks.

Nathan stilled immediately, concern darkening his features when he saw her pale face. "I'll go slower," he murmured.

He adjusted his movements, but the discomfort lingered.

Gradually, the pain melted into something else entirely—something that made Evelyn arch against him.

Their first union ended too soon, but Nathan recovered quickly.

This time, he moved with newfound confidence.

###Chapter 329

The air grew thick with passion, charged with an undeniable electricity.

Soft whimpers and breathless gasps filled the luxurious suite.

Evelyn finally succumbed to exhaustion, her body going limp against the silk sheets.

Nathan carefully gathered her in his arms, carrying her to the marble ensuite bathroom. The warm water cascaded over her delicate frame as he tenderly washed away the evidence of their passion.

As he gazed at Evelyn's flawless form, something unfamiliar flickered in Nathan's usually cold eyes. The sight of her vulnerable beauty stirred something primal within him.

His fingers trembled slightly as they traced the curve of her shoulder. The desire to take her again burned through his veins, but with tremendous effort, he restrained himself.

After drying her gently with a plush towel, Nathan carried Evelyn back to bed. Finding her own sheets in disarray, he brought her to his king-sized bed instead.

The alcohol haze had completely lifted now. Every moment of their passionate encounter played vividly in his mind.

Nathan was stunned by his own loss of control. Never in his disciplined life had he surrendered to desire so completely.

But the combination of whiskey and physical exertion weighed heavily on him. With Evelyn curled against his chest, he fell into a deep sleep.

The first light of dawn filtered through the curtains when Evelyn stirred awake.

Pain was her first conscious sensation. Every muscle protested as if she'd run a marathon in stilettos.

Her eyes fluttered open to find Nathan's chiseled profile inches from her face. The realization hit her like a freight train.

She was in Nathan Black's bed. And he was shirtless.

A terrifying thought struck her. With trembling hands, Evelyn lifted the duvet - and nearly choked on her own breath.

Not a stitch of clothing covered her body. Worse still, angry red marks decorated her pale skin where his mouth had been.

The memories came flooding back in vivid detail.

Last night...

She'd slept with Nathan Black.

And heaven help her, she'd been the one to initiate it.

The recollection of her drunken boldness made her want to crawl into a hole and die. Had she really pinned him against the wall? Had she actually torn at his shirt buttons with her teeth?

Evelyn bit down hard on her lower lip as she studied Nathan's peaceful expression. Moving with the caution of a thief, she began extracting herself from the tangle of limbs and sheets.

###Chapter 330

Evelyn wanted to slip away to the bathroom without disturbing Nathan's sleep.

Her bare feet had barely touched the plush carpet when—"Going somewhere?" A sleep-roughened baritone vibrated through the dim bedroom.

Her entire body went rigid.

Fingers clutching the silk sheets like a lifeline, she pulled them higher around her bare shoulders without turning around.

"Let me guess," Nathan's voice dripped with lazy amusement, the kind that made heat pool low in Evelyn's belly. "Planning to sneak out after what happened last night?"

Her lips parted in silent outrage.

She was the one who should be making accusations here! How dare he twist things like that?

But the words died in her throat when she finally dared to glance over her shoulder.

Nathan had propped himself up against the headboard, the morning light painting golden streaks across his sculpted torso. The sheet barely covered his hips, revealing the faint red scratches she'd left on his skin.

Her face burned.

Oh God.

Had she really been that...enthusiastic?

"Cat got your tongue?" Nathan's smirk deepened as he leaned closer. "Or should I say, the alcohol? Convenient excuse, isn't it?"

Evelyn's mouth went dry.

###Chapter 331

This was beyond ridiculous.

Why was he making it sound like she was some scheming seductress who'd used him and was now fleeing the scene?

Evelyn's temper flared dangerously.

Whirling to face Nathan, she snapped, "Nathan Black, stop playing the wounded saint! Don't pretend you weren't enjoying every second last night. Who was the one who couldn't get enough? Who kept begging for—"

Nathan's smug expression faltered as her words hung between them.

An uncomfortable silence descended.

Evelyn's boldness evaporated instantly, and she squeezed her eyes shut in mortification.

Holy hell, what had she just said?

Clearing her throat awkwardly, Evelyn muttered, "Just... turn around. I'm getting up."

Nathan arched an eyebrow, amusement dancing in his dark eyes. "Really, darling? After everything we've done, you're suddenly shy?" he drawled.

Evelyn shot him a glare that could melt steel.

"Turn. Around. Now," she ground out.

With an exaggerated sigh, Nathan complied, rolling onto his side.

Evelyn didn't waste a second. She flung the covers aside.

The moment her feet hit the floor, her legs nearly gave out.

She swayed dangerously, catching herself on the nightstand.

Every muscle protested, and certain parts of her body ached in ways that made her cheeks burn.

Biting back a whimper, she hobbled toward the bathroom like a newborn fawn.

Only when the lock clicked did Nathan open his eyes.

Propping himself against the headboard, he couldn't suppress the smirk as memories from last night flooded back.

His gaze drifted to the tangled sheets, lingering on the faint rust-colored stains.

The smirk deepened into something warmer, more possessive.

Evelyn gasped when she saw her reflection.

The marks weren't just on her chest—they trailed up her neck in blatant declaration.

Her anger reignited.

That absolute bastard, Nathan!

How dare he act like she'd taken advantage of him?

The man had no shame.

###Chapter 332

The warm water cascaded down Evelyn's body as she stepped out of the shower, wrapping herself in a plush towel.

A new dilemma presented itself as she reached for her clothes.

Summer's heat made turtlenecks impossible, and scarves were out of the question.

With limited options, Evelyn carefully applied concealer to the faint marks along her neckline.

The coverage wasn't perfect, but it would suffice unless someone examined her too closely.

Descending the staircase, Evelyn froze when Leonard's voice carried through the foyer.

"You and Evelyn certainly made the most of last night, didn't you?" Leonard chuckled knowingly.

Evelyn's cheeks burned with embarrassment.

She considered retreating when Winston's sharp eyes caught her movement.

"Good morning, Miss Hartley," he announced, drawing everyone's attention.

Nathan and Leonard both turned toward her with knowing smiles.

Evelyn couldn't meet their gazes.

"I'm running late for my shift," she blurted out.

Without waiting for a response, she practically fled through the front door.

Her personal vehicle remained at the Sterling estate, forcing her to accept the Grant family chauffeur's services.

As the car moved through the city streets, Evelyn's racing pulse gradually steadied.

Fragmented memories from the previous evening began surfacing.

While she'd consumed several cocktails at the Velvet Lounge, her alcohol tolerance was substantial.

The level of intoxication she'd experienced didn't add up.

A chilling realization dawned - someone must have tampered with her drink.

Cassandra and Julian Blake immediately came to mind as likely suspects.

But what could they possibly gain from such an act?

Determined to uncover the truth, Evelyn placed a call to her most trusted ally.

Gabriella Vega arrived at the hospital shortly after Evelyn, drawing blood with practiced efficiency.

"Any other unusual symptoms you've noticed?" Gabriella inquired while labeling the vials.

Evelyn shook her head, her mind already racing through possible scenarios.

###Chapter 333

The room fell silent for a moment before Gabriella spoke. "I'll notify you immediately once the test results come in." She carefully stored the blood sample away.

Then, as if struck by sudden recollection, she added, "I've examined everything you brought me previously. There were no irregularities in any of them."

Evelyn's brows knitted together. "Nothing at all?"

"Completely clean."

"Perhaps you should reconsider. Could there be anything you might have missed?" Gabriella suggested.

"That was everything I could possibly find. The calcium supplements I regularly take have already been tested by you - all ingredients are safe, no hormones or unusual substances. The occasional medications show nothing abnormal either. If those are clear too, I truly can't imagine what else could be the cause," Evelyn replied, frustration creeping into her voice.

Her mind raced through past medications. Could something have been secretly laced with hormones?

Gabriella looked equally perplexed by Evelyn's words.

"Maybe it's best not to dwell on it since you can't recall clearly. It happened years ago - any traces would have naturally dissipated by now, making investigation nearly impossible," Gabriella advised gently.

Evelyn gave a slow nod. After a thoughtful pause, she said, "I'll try to remember more details."

"Alright, I should head back now. I'll call as soon as your blood test results are ready," Gabriella said, rising from her seat.

Evelyn stood too, returning to her department.

Slipping into her white coat, she consciously pushed aside all distractions, forcing her focus onto her work.

Meanwhile, in the CEO office of Triumph Consortium, Nathan found his concentration repeatedly shattered by vivid memories of the previous night.

He set down the documents he'd been reviewing and leaned back, closing his eyes.

His fingers massaged his temples in slow circles as he willed his mind to clear.

"Get a grip," he muttered to himself. "You're not some hormone-driven teenager."

Last night had indeed been his first experience.

But really - he'd simply slept with his wife. What was the big deal?

They were married, after all. Such intimacy was perfectly normal between spouses.

Clutching this rationalization firmly, Nathan straightened in his chair and attempted to refocus on his paperwork.

Just then, a knock interrupted his thoughts.

"Come in," he called.

The door swung open to reveal Dylan.

Nathan's expression darkened at the sight of his uninvited guest.

Today, Dylan had come alone.

###Chapter 334

Nathan believed it was wiser for Serena to keep her distance from him to prevent any unnecessary gossip, particularly since his divorce from Evelyn hadn't been finalized yet.

Fortunately, the legal proceedings were nearly over.

Dylan approached the mahogany desk, his expression contrite. "I owe you an apology for what happened last time, Nathan. I'm truly sorry."

A beat of silence passed before he continued, "After reflecting on it, I realize I was out of line. Your decision to discipline me was justified. I swear nothing like that will happen again. Please, let's move past this."

Nathan wasn't someone Dylan could afford to cross.

With the punishment already dealt, Dylan knew the best course was to seek reconciliation.

Nathan's face remained impassive as he replied, "Like I said before—don't let it happen again."

"Of course," Dylan said, shoulders visibly relaxing.

Nathan's response signaled the matter was closed.

Then Dylan's gaze snagged on Nathan's neck.

A faint, reddish mark stood out against his skin, sparking Dylan's curiosity.

Was that… a love bite?

Before he could stop himself, the question tumbled out. "Did Evelyn leave that mark? Have you two…?"

The words came out sharper than intended.

Nathan's expression darkened instantly. "Do my personal affairs concern you?"

Dylan realized his blunder too late.

"I—I just thought Serena might be upset if she saw it," he stammered.

"Evelyn is still my wife. Whatever happens between us is no one's business but ours," Nathan stated coolly.

A pause. Then, with deliberate emphasis, he added, "I don't owe explanations to anyone. Understood?"

The words struck Dylan like a physical blow. His gaze dropped, conflicting emotions flashing in his eyes. Jaw tightening, he gave a stiff nod. "Understood."

Nathan turned away dismissively. "I have work to attend to."

Dylan took the hint immediately. "Right. I'll leave you to it."

Without another word, he strode out of the office.

Nathan watched him go, eyes narrowing thoughtfully. Was Dylan's reaction about Serena… or something else entirely?

The moment the door closed behind him, Dylan's face twisted with barely suppressed fury. The image of that mark on Nathan's neck burned in his mind.

Nathan and Evelyn had been intimate.

The realization sent a surge of jealousy roaring through him, hot and uncontrollable.

What the hell was wrong with him?

At the Sterling family banquet, he'd watched Evelyn dismantle false accusations with razor-sharp precision and retaliate against Giselle with devastating wit. In that moment, she'd been utterly mesmerizing.

And yet, this relentless pull he felt toward her only fueled his frustration.

This internal war, this storm of emotions—it terrified him.

###Chapter 335

Dylan Reeves took a deep breath to steady himself before walking away. He needed to inform Serena Cole about what had just happened. It was becoming painfully obvious that Evelyn Hartley and Nathan Black were growing closer—a situation that couldn't be allowed to continue. He and Serena had to come up with a plan to sabotage Nathan's relationship with Evelyn before it was too late.

Nathan's marriage to Evelyn needed to end. Soon.

Later that afternoon, Evelyn's phone buzzed with an incoming call from Cassandra Blake.

"Evelyn, how are you feeling? Did you recover from last night?" Cassandra's voice dripped with false concern.

"I'm fine now," Evelyn replied coolly, her fingers tightening around her phone.

"Oh, thank goodness," Cassandra sighed dramatically. "I feel terrible about last night. That wine is usually my favorite, but it's stronger than most people realize. I completely forgot to warn you, and you ended up... well, you know."

Evelyn's eyes narrowed as a flicker of suspicion crossed her face. Something about this didn't add up.

After a brief pause, she said, "That's strange. I've always had a high alcohol tolerance, but last night... I got drunk unusually fast. Cassandra, any idea why that might be?"

On the other end of the line, Cassandra's expression faltered for just a second before she quickly recovered. "Really? But last night it seemed like you couldn't handle your liquor at all!" She paused, then added hastily, "Oh! I know what it was! You must have been emotionally vulnerable—that always makes alcohol hit harder! After my last breakup, I got wasted on just two glasses!"

Her voice remained smooth, betraying no hint of deception.

Evelyn's gaze turned calculating. Whether Cassandra was telling the truth or just an excellent liar was impossible to determine over the phone. Without being able to see her face, Evelyn couldn't detect any tells.

Waiting for the lab results was her only real option right now.

"Maybe you're right," Evelyn conceded, her tone carefully neutral.

Cassandra continued her charade of concern for several more minutes before finally ending the call. When work finished, Evelyn headed straight to Eleanor Sinclair's residence. Eleanor had called earlier inviting her to dinner—the perfect opportunity to question Isabelle Laurent about certain matters.

Only Eleanor and Isabelle were home when Evelyn arrived; Grace Monroe had stepped out on an errand. The moment Isabelle saw Evelyn, she beamed. "You're here! We're in for a treat tonight—Eleanor's cooking for us!"

Evelyn gave a slight nod but remained silent. Her intense gaze lingered on Isabelle, studying her closely. Just then, Eleanor emerged from the kitchen carrying a steaming dish. "Wash up, dinner's ready," she said with a warm smile.

After washing her hands, Evelyn took her seat at the dining table. As Isabelle opened her mouth to speak, her eyes suddenly caught on the unmistakable marks visible above Evelyn's collar. Her eyes widened. "Evelyn, are those... hickeys on your neck?"

Eleanor turned to look, her expression shifting to one of quiet understanding. The older woman recognized the marks immediately and knew exactly how they must have gotten there.

Before Evelyn could respond, Isabelle pressed on, "Did Mr. Black give you those? You and Mr. Black... Did you two...?" She couldn't bring herself to finish the sentence, as if refusing to acknowledge the possibility.

Evelyn let out a soft laugh, her eyes glinting with amusement. "You seem unusually interested in my relationship with Nathan, Isabelle."

###Chapter 336

Isabelle was momentarily stunned but quickly recovered. "Naturally! You're my sister—your concerns are mine. Knowing your feelings for Mr. Black, of course I care about your relationship with him."

"Is that so?" Evelyn arched an eyebrow, her smile laced with quiet irony.

"What's wrong?" Isabelle blinked, feigning innocence.

Evelyn lazily lifted her gaze, locking eyes with Isabelle before asking with a sardonic twist of her lips, "So every word you said to Nathan was out of sisterly concern?"

Isabelle stiffened, a shadow of discomfort flickering across her face.

"What exactly did Isabelle say to Nathan?" Eleanor interjected sharply.

With deliberate calm, Evelyn recounted Nathan's version of events.

A suffocating silence descended upon the room.

Eleanor's expression darkened as the implications sank in.

Isabelle sprang to her feet, hands fluttering in distress. "Evelyn, please understand—it was an honest mistake! I acted without thinking."

She rapped her knuckles against her temple in exaggerated frustration.

"I only wanted to clarify the misunderstanding for you, but I moved too quickly, lost my balance, and nearly collided with Mr. Black. But I swear I never touched him—not even his sleeve!"

Her voice trembled with manufactured sincerity. "You must believe me. I'd never intentionally hurt you. This family has shown me nothing but kindness—how could I betray that? Please..."

Evelyn remained impassive, her silence more damning than any accusation.

Eleanor too said nothing, her lips pressed into a thin line.

Overcome by her own performance, Isabelle suddenly slapped her own cheek. "This is all my fault! My careless words ruined everything!" She repeated the gesture, eyes glistening with crocodile tears.

Both women recoiled at the theatrics—an unsettling echo of Grace Monroe's manipulative playbook.

"Enough!" Eleanor snapped.

Isabelle froze mid-sob, biting her lip as she turned pleading eyes toward the older woman. "Eleanor... surely you don't doubt me?"

The matriarch exhaled slowly before addressing Evelyn. "I don't believe Isabelle meant any harm." Having raised the girl herself, Eleanor refused to entertain the possibility of such calculated betrayal.

It wasn't so much faith in Isabelle as confidence in her own judgment—she couldn't have nurtured deceit in her own household.

Evelyn acquiesced to her grandmother's wisdom, though suspicion coiled like a serpent in her chest.

"Let's eat," she finally said, breaking the tense silence.

###Chapter 337

The lingering tension from the earlier confrontation had stolen both Evelyn and Isabelle's appetites.

Across the table, Eleanor ate with relish, savoring every bite of Evelyn's cooking—a rare treat she always cherished. Once the meal concluded, Eleanor gestured for Evelyn to join her in the private sanctuary of her bedroom.

"Evelyn, I need to ask you something important," Eleanor began, her tone uncharacteristically grave. "Did you truly sleep with Nathan?"

Evelyn met her grandmother's gaze without flinching. There was no point in lies. "Yes."

Eleanor's face darkened. Her fingers trembled as she pointed at Evelyn, disbelief sharpening her voice. "You—how could you—?"

The more Eleanor dwelled on it, the hotter her anger burned. Frustration won out—she reached forward and flicked Evelyn's forehead. "Foolish child!"

Evelyn rubbed the spot, lips pursed in a pout. "Tell me everything," Eleanor demanded. "What exactly happened?"

"Last night, we..." Evelyn didn't hold back. She recounted the events in detail—the drinks, the haze of intoxication, the blur of passion that followed.

"So, you were both drunk," Eleanor murmured, absorbing the confession. Slowly, she fell silent, grappling with the weight of it. Words failed her.

Evelyn took Eleanor's hand, her voice soft but unwavering. "Grandmother, I don’t regret it."

Eleanor studied her granddaughter’s face, emotions warring in her eyes. After a long pause, she exhaled. "If you don’t regret it, then neither will I."

Evelyn smiled faintly. "Good. You don’t need to worry about me."

A beat of silence passed before Eleanor ventured another question. "What about Isabelle? How do you feel about what she did?"

Evelyn’s expression shuttered.

Eleanor pressed gently, "I’m certain she didn’t mean any harm. You’ve known her since you were girls."

Evelyn’s lips pressed into a thin line. After a moment, she conceded, "Fine. I understand."

Perhaps Isabelle hadn’t acted with malice this time—but for Evelyn, the fracture in their trust was irreparable. Still, she wouldn’t burden Eleanor with that truth.

Meanwhile, in the living room, Isabelle sat rigid, her fingers twisting in her lap. The situation had spiraled beyond her control, and the unease gnawing at her grew sharper by the second. She knew—after this, Evelyn’s wariness toward her would only deepen. And there was nothing she could do.

She understood her place all too well. In this household, she couldn’t afford to misstep.

Regret coiled in her chest. She never should have approached Nathan. Never should have spoken those reckless words.

But after stepping into the opulence of the Black family estate, after tasting the life she’d only dreamed of—something inside her had ignited. A hunger. A determination.

One day, she vowed silently, she would claim that world as her own. The promise burned in her mind, relentless as a flame.

###Chapter 338

After leaving Eleanor's room, Evelyn retreated to her own private quarters. Isabelle wasted no time in seeking out the elderly matriarch.

"Eleanor, I swear on my life—it was never my intention to cause harm."

Eleanor's expression remained unreadable, her voice calm yet distant. "Very well. Just ensure you maintain appropriate boundaries with Nathan from now on."

Isabelle's lips pressed into a thin line as she nodded vigorously. "Of course! I'll keep my distance, I promise."

Eleanor offered no further response.

At an upscale gentleman's club, Dylan lounged across a velvet chaise, surrounded by a dozen carefully selected hostesses. The club manager hovered nearby with obsequious enthusiasm. "Mr. Reeves, these are our most exquisite companions. Please indicate if any catch your attention."

To Dylan, these women were utterly forgettable. None could compare to the woman who still haunted his thoughts.

Noticing Dylan's disinterest, the manager quickly dismissed the first group and presented another. "Perhaps this selection will be more to your taste, Mr. Reeves?"

Dylan's gaze swept lazily across the new arrivals until his eyes landed on a woman at the far end. His pupils contracted slightly. She wasn't conventionally stunning, but her vulpine eyes and delicate features bore an uncanny resemblance to that woman.

Dylan pointed decisively. "Her. Name?"

The manager hesitated momentarily before signaling. "Adrienne, step forward."

Dylan's expression flickered at the name.

The woman approached with a slight bow. "Mr. Reeves," she murmured, her voice carrying a melodic quality.

"Look at me," Dylan commanded.

Adrienne lifted her gaze without hesitation. The resemblance was even more striking up close.

"Spell your name," Dylan demanded sharply.

"A-D-R-I-E-N-N-E," she replied softly.

"You're mine tonight," Dylan declared.

"Of course! Enjoy your evening, Mr. Reeves." The manager turned to Adrienne. "See to Mr. Reeves' every need." With a bow, he ushered the other women out.

"Mr. Reeves..." Adrienne began tentatively.

"Call me Dylan," he interrupted.

Adrienne's eyes widened slightly. "I... Yes. Dylan."

Dylan studied her intently before abruptly asking, "Are you untouched?"

A delicate blush colored Adrienne's cheeks as she nodded almost imperceptibly. "Yes." Dylan's lips curved into a satisfied smile at her response.

###Chapter 339

The night air was crisp as Dylan exited the club with Adrienne clinging to his arm.

Back at the Black family estate, Evelyn's breath caught when she saw Nathan. Memories of their passionate night together flooded her mind, making it impossible to meet his piercing gaze.

Nathan broke the tense silence first. "Evelyn," his deep voice rumbled, "about last night—"

"We were both drunk," Evelyn interrupted, her fingers tightening around her clutch. Her voice remained steady despite the tremor in her hands. "It was mutual consent. Surely it meant nothing to you, Mr. Black?"

Nathan's expression darkened instantly, his jaw clenching. His stormy eyes searched her face as if trying to decipher a hidden code.

After a charged pause, he gave a cold, humorless laugh. "Exactly what I was going to say. Glad we're on the same page. I was concerned you might try to use this to trap me."

Evelyn's shoulders relaxed slightly. Thank God she hadn't been foolish enough to read too much into their night together.

Yet... an unexpected pang of disappointment twisted in her chest.

Drawing a steadying breath, she lifted her chin. "Don't worry. I won't."

Nathan's hands curled into fists at his sides before he turned abruptly and left the room.

That night, Nathan avoided their shared bedroom entirely, burying himself in paperwork until dawn. Evelyn tossed and turned all night, arriving at work the next morning with dark circles shadowing her eyes.

At noon, Olivia found herself walking alone through a deserted alley when a masked man suddenly blocked her path, a knife glinting in his hand.

"Stop right there!" he growled. "Hand over your purse and jewelry!"

Olivia stumbled backward, her heart pounding. "Please—take whatever you want!" Her trembling hands fumbled with her bag's clasp.

"What the hell do you think you're doing?" A sharp female voice cut through the alley like a whip.

In a flash, a figure darted between Olivia and her attacker. The woman stood protectively in front of Olivia, her stance unyielding.

"Lila?" Olivia gasped, recognizing the woman shielding her.

"Mrs. Caldwell, are you alright?" Lila asked over her shoulder, her eyes never leaving the thief.

"I—I'm fine," Olivia stammered, clutching her chest.

The thief laughed mockingly. "Two for the price of one! Empty your pockets, ladies!"

Lila spread her arms wider, a human shield radiating defiance. Her fierce glare pinned the man in place.

###Chapter 340
"I've already alerted the authorities! They'll be here any minute!" Olivia Sinclair declared, her voice steel-edged. "If you value your freedom, you'd better vanish before they catch you in the act!"

The thug's face twisted into a vicious scowl. "You dare threaten me? Forget the money—I'm taking you both now! Let's see if those cops arrive fast enough to save you!"

With a predatory grin, he advanced, the blade in his hand catching the flickering alley light as he closed in on the two women.

Lila Sinclair and Olivia recoiled, their movements stiff with terror.

"Stay behind me, Mrs. Sinclair. I won't let him touch you," Lila commanded, her voice steady despite the adrenaline coursing through her. She stepped forward, shielding Olivia with her body.

The thug hesitated, momentarily stunned by her defiance, before raising his knife with a snarl.

Acting fast, Lila lunged, seizing his wrist. "Run, Mrs. Sinclair! Now!" she shouted, her muscles straining against his strength.

Olivia stood frozen, her voice trembling. "I can't leave you here, Lila!"

"Go!" Lila's plea was sharp with desperation.

The thug's free hand lashed out, striking Lila across the face with a brutal slap.

The sound echoed through the alley. Lila staggered, her vision blurring as she fought to stay upright.

"Lila!" Olivia cried, her voice cracking with panic.

Gritting her teeth, Lila shook off the dizziness. A trickle of blood seeped from her split lip, but she forced a weak smile. "I'm fine."

Her words were a lie. Her cheek throbbed, already swelling, but she refused to show weakness.

Seeing her vulnerability, the thug turned his attention to Olivia, his steps deliberate and menacing.

Ignoring the pain, Lila darted between them again. "You're not getting near her!" she spat, her voice shaking but resolute.

"Move, bitch!" the thug roared, lunging to shove her aside.

But Lila dug in her heels and shoved back with unexpected force, sending him stumbling.

The thug regained his balance, his face contorted with rage. With a furious cry, he raised the knife and charged, the blade arcing toward her.

Instinctively, Lila raised her arm, bracing for the impact—

###Chapter 341

A blood-curdling scream tore through the tense air. Crimson bloomed across Lila Sinclair's forearm where the blade had sliced deep, leaving a gruesome trail in its wake. The wound pulsed with each heartbeat, staining her sleeve a dark red.

The sight was horrifying enough to make anyone's stomach lurch. Lila's face turned ashen as the pain registered. She clamped her hand over the injury, but scarlet droplets continued to escape between her trembling fingers.

"Lila!" Olivia Sinclair rushed forward, her voice laced with alarm.

The attacker froze, shock registering on his face as he realized what he'd done. His grip on the knife slackened for a crucial second before he turned to flee.

Just as he pivoted, a dark figure materialized from the shadows and delivered a crushing kick to his ribs. The impact sent him sprawling onto the pavement, gasping for breath.

A sharply dressed man in black approached Olivia, bowing slightly. "Mrs. Caldwell, my deepest apologies for the delay." One of Olivia's personal security detail.

"Better late than never," Olivia snapped. "Have this scum arrested immediately!"

"At once, ma'am," the bodyguard acknowledged.

Another security officer appeared, efficiently subduing the would-be assailant with professional ease before dragging him away.

Lila observed the scene with widening eyes. A flicker of panic crossed her features before she schooled her expression.

"Let me get you to the hospital," Olivia insisted, pulling Lila from her thoughts.

Lila shook her head weakly, her complexion ghostly pale. "It's... not serious..."

"Nonsense." Olivia supported Lila's uninjured side as they headed toward a waiting car, the bodyguard following closely.

The gash required fourteen stitches. When Olivia saw the bandages wrapping Lila's forearm, an unexpected wave of gratitude washed over her.

Olivia's voice softened as she regarded Lila with new appreciation. "I don't know what would have happened if you hadn't intervened. Thank you." The warmth in her tone was unmistakable.

A thought occurred to Olivia. "What brought you to that part of town today?"

Lila hesitated briefly before answering. "Visiting a friend who works nearby. When I saw you heading down that alley, I thought I'd say hello - you've been so kind to my sister. I never imagined..."

Olivia nodded in understanding. "Of course."

At that moment-

"Olivia!" Evelyn Hartley burst into the room, breathless from running.

Her chest heaved as she reached Olivia's side. "Are you hurt? What happened?" Her eyes darted between the two women anxiously.

"Everything's fine, darling," Olivia assured her quickly. "Thanks to Lila here."

###Chapter 342

After a brief silence, she continued, "It's Lila who got injured. If she hadn't intervened today, I can't imagine what might have happened!"

Evelyn let out a relieved sigh, her eyes shifting toward Lila.

When she noticed Lila's swollen cheek and bandaged arm, she hesitated, her expression turning skeptical.

Shocked, she turned back to Olivia and asked, "Lila was the one who protected you?"

"Absolutely! Earlier, when I..." Olivia quickly recounted the incident.

Evelyn's brows furrowed as she fell into deep thought.

Since when had Lila become so courageous and selfless? She recalled a time when they were shopping together and witnessed a thief snatching a woman's purse.

She had wanted to step in, but Lila had held her back, insisting it wasn't worth the risk—especially with the thief brandishing a knife.

What if he turned on them? Lila had even tried to drag her away from the scene, refusing to identify the thief or assist the victim.

When Evelyn had eventually gone to help, Lila had distanced herself, pretending not to know her, terrified of being involved.

But this time...

Lila had acted so bravely to save Olivia?

This was... unusual.

Evelyn kept these thoughts to herself.

Instead, she said, "I suppose we owe Lila a proper thank-you."

"Definitely! We should express our gratitude properly." Olivia nodded in agreement.

Lila gently waved her hand and said, "Mrs. Sinclair, Evelyn, there's no need for thanks. It was nothing."

After leaving the hospital, Olivia had her bodyguard escort Lila home.

Then, she headed back with Evelyn by her side.

During the car ride, Evelyn asked, "Olivia, where were your bodyguards at the time? Why didn't they intervene when that man threatened you?"

Marcus had always ensured Olivia had bodyguards for protection. It didn't make sense that they'd only arrived as the attacker was fleeing.

Olivia blinked in surprise before answering, "They weren't with me when it happened."

Evelyn's frown deepened slightly, her face betraying a hint of suspicion.

As she drove Olivia home, Evelyn pressed for more details about the incident. The more she learned, the more troubled she became.

After dropping Olivia off, Evelyn went straight back to the hospital to resume her work.

Later that evening, Lila received a call from Olivia.

"A banquet in my honor?" Lila repeated, stunned by Olivia's words. Disbelieving, she covered her mouth, letting the news sink in. After a pause, she replied, "Oh, Mrs. Sinclair, please don't go to such trouble. You're practically family to Evelyn, and I'm her sister—we're all close. In a situation like that, seeing you in danger, I couldn't just stand by. But really, it's nothing worth celebrating. You don't need to hold a banquet for me over this."

###Chapter 343

Her pulse raced wildly despite her attempts to appear composed. The sheer joy bubbling inside her was nearly impossible to suppress.

"You're my hero, Lila. Words can't express my gratitude. This decision is final—don't even think about refusing!" Olivia's voice held finality before the line went dead.

The moment the call ended, Lila let out an unrestrained squeal of delight. A gala—an entire gala dedicated to celebrating her!

This surpassed even her wildest fantasies.

When Olivia's security team had whisked the assailant away, Lila had been terrified they might uncover the truth. The constant anxiety had gnawed at her for days. Never in her wildest dreams had she anticipated this phone call.

The Caldwells suspected nothing. Instead, they were honoring her as their savior! The thrill of it made her lightheaded.

This gamble had paid off spectacularly. Now she had her golden ticket into the Caldwell inner circle. With Marcus and Olivia childless, their affection for Evelyn ran deep—and soon, she'd make sure they felt the same about her.

If she played this right, Evelyn's privileged position could soon be hers. The mere thought sent delicious shivers down her spine.

Victor reacted with equal enthusiasm when she shared the news. "Magnificent! You brilliant girl!" He clasped her shoulders, beaming with paternal pride. "I always knew you'd make us proud!"

Diana, however, frowned skeptically. "An entire gala? Isn't that rather... excessive? And so sudden?"

"Nonsense!" Victor waved away her concerns. "Our Lila took a knife for Olivia Sinclair! Who knows what might've happened otherwise? In Olivia's eyes, she's nothing short of a miracle! This extravagant gesture proves how deeply grateful they are." He rubbed his hands together gleefully. "Mark my words—this is just the beginning. With Lila as our connection, the Sterlings' standing will reach unprecedented heights!"

By morning, news of the gala had electrified Owathe's elite circles.

Lila's phone began buzzing at dawn with calls from envious acquaintances. Their thinly veiled jealousy was almost palpable through the receiver.

"Lila darling, you've outdone yourself! The Caldwells hosting a gala in your honor? This isn't just appreciation—it's adoption by another name! Your social stock just skyrocketed overnight. I'm positively green!"

Lila's lips curved into a satisfied smile. "Oh please, I never expected anything like this. The Caldwells simply value gratitude above all else."

Her friend's voice turned conspiratorial. "With their backing, you'll be untouchable! Even that precious sister of yours will have to watch her step now. After all..." A meaningful pause. "She didn't save Olivia's life, did she?"

The barb struck its mark perfectly. Lila's chest swelled with vindictive pleasure.

"Promise you won't forget us little people when you're dining with Owathe's royalty?" her friend teased.

"Darling," Lila laughed airily, "you'll always have a seat at my table."

###Chapter 344

The private dining room of Le Jardin was bathed in soft golden light as Evelyn Hartley arrived for her scheduled lunch with Grace Monroe. During her brief respite from work, Evelyn had driven across town to meet her mother, only to find Victor Sterling already seated at the table when she entered.

Evelyn's delicate brows knitted together instantly at the sight.

Victor didn't waste a second before launching into his characteristic tirade. "Too important for your own father now, are we? Blocking my number? Ignoring my calls? Do those Caldwell connections make you think you can treat me this way?"

A cold, mirthless laugh escaped Evelyn's lips.

She remembered Victor's first call - all honeyed words and false humility. Now his true colors showed. This sudden shift didn't surprise her. Not when all of high society buzzed about how Lila Sinclair had become the Caldwell family's new darling after saving Olivia Sinclair. Naturally, Victor no longer saw any value in pretending to care for Evelyn.

"Get to the point," Evelyn said coolly, taking her seat and picking up her fork.

Victor leaned forward, his demand immediate. "Your sister saved Mrs. Caldwell. They're throwing her a gala. If Ethan and Olivia offer to support Lila publicly, you will not interfere. Understood?"

Evelyn's dark eyes flashed with derision as she studied him. Was he truly this delusional? Did he honestly believe one good deed could buy Lila the Caldwells' favor? That their world operated on such simplistic transactions?

Before she could respond, Victor pressed further. "And if Ethan doesn't bring it up, you will. You'll suggest they support Lila publicly. Do I make myself clear?"

For a moment, Evelyn could only stare, certain she'd misheard. The sheer audacity left her momentarily speechless.

Victor's frown deepened at her silence. "Did you hear me?"

Another sharp laugh. "Mr. Sterling, you're fantasizing. The Caldwells would never back Lila."

Victor's face flushed crimson. "Why not? They took you in readily enough! And Lila saved Olivia's life!"

Suddenly, a smug expression crossed his features. "I see what this is. You're jealous. Worried your sister might steal your precious Caldwell connections. But Evelyn, you should be happy - two daughters in their good graces! People would kill for that!"

Evelyn continued eating, utterly unfazed by his shameless words.

Victor exchanged a loaded glance with Grace, who hesitated before speaking. "Darling, perhaps your father has a—"

"Mother," Evelyn cut in sharply, setting down her fork with deliberate precision. "Don't."

Rising gracefully, Evelyn looked down at Victor with icy disdain. "I will never agree to this. Don't ask again."

###Chapter 345

"As for your wishes, I can only say good luck with that."

Without giving him a chance to respond, Evelyn turned on her heel and strode away.

"Evelyn! Evelyn Hartley, stop right there!" Victor bellowed, his face flushing with anger as he watched her retreating figure.

Not even glancing back, Evelyn marched straight out of the room without hesitation.

Victor's words echoed in her mind, making her scoff at his absurdity. If he was so confident the Caldwell family would support Lila at the banquet, she'd gladly wait and see how that played out.

That afternoon, in an exclusive café lounge...

"Ms. Sterling, I must admit I'm curious about why you wanted to meet with me?" Lila inquired, her sharp eyes studying Giselle across the table.

Giselle smiled mysteriously, reaching into her designer handbag to slide an exquisite velvet jewelry box toward Lila.

Lila's perfectly shaped eyebrows arched slightly at the unexpected gift. "What's this about, Ms. Sterling?"

"A token of friendship, Ms. Sinclair," Giselle purred, pausing dramatically before adding, "I believe we could become... valuable allies."

Lila feigned surprise. "Is this because of the Caldwell family?"

She wasn't naive. Giselle's sudden generosity clearly came with expectations.

Giselle didn't bother denying it. "That's part of it," she admitted, leaning forward conspiratorially. "The other reason? We share a common enemy. Doesn't that make us natural allies?"

Lila frowned delicately, tilting her head in feigned confusion. "I'm afraid I don't follow, Ms. Sterling."

Giselle's smile turned razor-sharp. "Oh come now, we both know I'm talking about Evelyn Hartley."

Lila let out a soft, practiced sigh. "Ms. Sterling, you're mistaken. Evelyn is my sister. I could never wish her harm."

"Sister?" Giselle's laugh was like shattering crystal. "A bastard child born from an affair? You expect me to believe you consider that trash family?"

Lila's gaze flickered momentarily before she composed herself. "Evelyn isn't responsible for the circumstances of her birth. She shouldn't be judged for that."

Internally scoffing at Lila's hypocrisy, Giselle smirked. "Really? Then why did you publicly announce at my gala that Evelyn was your family's dirty little secret? Why mention she supposedly stole from you? Ms. Sinclair, your actions hardly scream 'loving sister.'"

A barely perceptible twitch crossed Lila's features before she bit her lip in a show of remorse. "I only spoke up because I heard rumors about Evelyn stealing. I wanted to guide her away from temptation. The money incident was just a misunderstanding - I apologized and she forgave me."

Giselle didn't buy a word of it. "Save the act, darling," she drawled, swirling her champagne. "Don't worry - your secrets are safe with me."

###Chapter 346

"I just want to be your ally. Together, we could be unstoppable, don't you think?"

Lila Sinclair maintained her flawless smile, though her fingers tightened around her champagne flute. "Ms. Sterling, you're mistaken. Evelyn and I share an unbreakable bond. Betrayal isn't in my nature."

Giselle's lips twisted in displeasure. She'd never paid much attention to Lila before, but now this insignificant woman had somehow caught the Caldwell family's attention?

Straightening her designer gown, Giselle pushed the velvet jewelry box closer. "Since you insist on playing innocent, I won't press further. But do accept this small token. Perhaps you might mention me favorably to Mr. and Mrs. Caldwell?"

Lila's gaze lingered on the Cartier box. Aligning with Giselle couldn't hurt. They did share a common enemy, after all. And the diamond bracelet inside was simply... irresistible.

"Consider it done," Lila said, snapping the box shut with a decisive click. "I'll ensure the Caldwells hear glowing reviews about you."

Giselle's smile turned predatory. With Lila accepting the bribe, the foundation was laid. Their scheme against Evelyn could wait until their alliance solidified.

The conversation shifted to safer topics—the upcoming charity gala, the latest fashion trends—carefully avoiding any mention of a certain raven-haired surgeon.

That evening at The Grand Celeste Hotel...

The Caldwell-owned venue glittered with crystal chandeliers as elite guests mingled, champagne flutes in hand. The whispers started the moment Lila made her entrance.

"Can you believe the Sinclair sisters' luck? First Evelyn saves Mrs. Caldwell, now Lila's practically family!"

"Do you think Marcus will publicly endorse her tonight?"

"With this lavish party? Absolutely! The Caldwells never do things by halves."

"Two golden geese in one family—how fortunate!"

Evelyn Hartley stood near the dessert table, calmly savoring a chocolate truffle as the gossip swirled around her.

"Aren't you worried?" Natalie Brooks appeared at her side, fidgeting with her clutch.

"About what?" Evelyn took another bite, the rich ganache melting on her tongue.

Natalie lowered her voice. "About Marcus taking Lila under his wing?"

Evelyn's laugh was soft but certain. "The Caldwells don't make impulsive decisions."

"I know, but..." Natalie's brow furrowed. "This whole spectacle feels off. Why would they throw such an extravagant event for Lila?"

The question hung between them, unanswered.

###Chapter 347

The grand ballroom doors swung open with dramatic timing. All heads turned as Olivia Caldwell made her entrance, her arm linked through Marcus Donovan's. But it was the figure trailing behind them that made Evelyn's fork freeze mid-air.

Lila stood bathed in spotlight, wearing a gown that cost more than most people's annual salary. The diamond bracelet from Giselle sparkled at her wrist.

Olivia raised her champagne flute. "To new beginnings and cherished connections!"

The crowd erupted in polite applause. Evelyn's eyes narrowed as Marcus stepped forward to make his toast—but not toward Lila as everyone expected. Instead, he walked purposefully through the crowd... directly toward her.

"Dr. Hartley," Marcus said, his voice carrying across the suddenly silent room. "There's someone who's been desperate to meet you."

Behind him, a familiar broad-shouldered figure emerged from the shadows. Nathan Black's piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn as murmurs rippled through the guests.

Evelyn's pulse stuttered. This wasn't just a party—it was an ambush.

And from the triumphant smirk on Lila's face, she'd known about it all along.

Evelyn responded calmly, "Olivia must have her own considerations for doing this."

Natalie pressed her lips together and remained silent.

Across the room, Victor Sterling - Lila's father - was working the crowd with practiced ease.

"Mr. Sterling, you've raised exceptional daughters!"

"Indeed! Both your girls are now physicians at Grand Ins General. Remarkable achievements!"

"Mr. Sterling, here's my card. We should keep our families connected."

"Mr. Sterling, my business card as well. Do consider me for future collaborations."

Victor's pockets bulged with business cards by evening's end. His smile never faltered as he moved through the crowd with triumphant strides. Lila had truly become his golden ticket!

Meanwhile, Theodore Whitmore observed Victor with undisguised disdain. Turning to Nathan, he murmured, "Nathan, what's your read on the Caldwells? Their behavior seems... unusually hasty, wouldn't you say?"

Nathan had been watching Evelyn sample the dessert table. At Theodore's words, his gaze shifted and he replied evenly, "If there's deception at play, the truth will surface soon enough." The situation felt more layered than it appeared.

Just then, Evelyn excused herself to the ladies' room. As she entered a stall, two voices carried clearly through the partition.

"Lila hit the jackpot this time! Rescuing Mrs. Caldwell? Why don't I get opportunities like that?"

"Maybe you should start stalking the Caldwell estate. Follow Mrs. Caldwell everywhere until your chance comes!"

"Don't be ridiculous! I have some dignity!"

"Rumor has it Lila might become the Caldwells' new favorite. Wouldn't that be something?"

"If that happens, Evelyn better watch her back!"

"Serves her right! Let's see if Evelyn can keep acting so high and mighty then!"

"The banquet's starting soon. We shouldn't miss it."

"Right. Let's go."

Silence reclaimed the restroom.

Evelyn emerged unfazed, as if the venomous words had never reached her ears. She returned just as the evening's formal program commenced.

With only Olivia present - neither Marcus nor Ethan having attended - Olivia took the stage alone. Smiling warmly at the assembled guests, she spoke into the microphone: "Tonight's gathering celebrates my profound gratitude to Lila for her heroic actions." Her gaze found Lila in the audience. "Lila, please join me."

Lila pressed her lips momentarily, then gracefully lifted her gown's hem and ascended the stage. Her ensemble tonight was breathtaking - the bold crimson of her dress and dramatic makeup commanding every eye. As she reached Olivia's side, the older woman continued her praise.

With practiced humility, Lila responded, "Mrs. Caldwell, you're too generous. Anyone would have done the same in that situation."

###Chapter 348

Olivia arched one delicate eyebrow, her lips curling into a knowing smile. "Is that so? Well, Lila dear, there's something I'd like to ask you. And I want everyone present to hear the answer."

Lila's pulse quickened at Olivia's words. A thrill of anticipation shot through her veins. She was certain Olivia was about to publicly declare her support. Why else would the Thomas matriarch make such a statement before all these important guests? Her heart hammered against her ribs as she leaned forward eagerly.

The gathered guests seemed to share Lila's assumption. Every eye in the room fixed on Olivia as she spoke with deliberate clarity. "Lila, you deliberately engineered our meeting. You even paid someone to stage that robbery. Tell me, what exactly were you hoping to achieve?"

A stunned silence descended upon the room, so complete one could hear a pin drop.

Lila's face drained of color, her eyes widening in shock. Panic flickered across her features before she schooled them into careful neutrality. She told herself Olivia couldn't possibly have proof. This was just a bluff, a tactic to make her slip up. She couldn't afford to crumble now.

Summoning all her acting skills, Lila forced her voice to tremble with apparent hurt. "Mrs. Caldwell, how could you say such things? I would never—" she began, then turned to the crowd with wounded eyes. "Can you believe these accusations?"

Murmurs broke out among the guests. "So that heroic rescue was all staged?"
"She's got some nerve, that one."

Olivia's smirk deepened. She gave a subtle nod toward the sound system. Moments later, crisp audio filled the room.

First came a gruff male voice: "What exactly do you need me to investigate?"

Then Lila's unmistakable tones: "Simple. Follow the woman in these photos for two days. Document her routine, especially any patterns. And check if she travels with security."

Every head swiveled toward Lila as her recorded voice continued.

"Perfect. Wait for my report," the man responded.

Ten seconds later, his voice returned: "I've tracked her for two days. Every morning at eleven, she visits a pottery studio on Aelbank Road. It's isolated—cars can't approach. She walks through a narrow alley alone."

"No bodyguards," he added.

"Good," Lila's voice purred in the recording. "Now I need you to arrange a fake robbery."

After a pause, her voice turned calculating: "I'll intervene as the hero. Tell your man he can rough me up slightly—but not too much. It needs to look convincing."

"What about the target? Should we hurt her?" the man asked.

Lila's reply was chillingly calm: "Just scare her. No actual injuries. Her husband is dangerously protective. If she's harmed, he'll investigate, and we can't risk that."

"Understood. Consider it done," the man concluded.

The recording ended, leaving the room in stunned silence.
###Chapter 349

The screen went black as the recording concluded.

Suddenly, the massive display on stage flickered back to life, revealing a series of damning bank statements under Lila Sinclair's name. One after another, financial records appeared, clearly showing transfers from Lila's account to a private investigator. The evidence was irrefutable, leaving no possibility for denial.

Lila's face drained of all color. This wasn't how tonight was supposed to go. Hadn't she been promised recognition as the Sinclair family's closest ally? How had everything unraveled so completely?

Her carefully constructed composure shattered like glass.

"Lila has gone too far! Such underhanded tactics are unforgivable."

"Gambling everything for status and wealth - she thought her scheme was foolproof."

"The sheer audacity!"

"Did Olivia Sinclair organize this entire gala just to publicly destroy Lila? That's brutal."

"Lila's reputation is in ruins."

"Worse than that - I doubt she'll ever show her face in society again."

"Olivia's strategy was masterful! First making Lila believe she'd gained the Sinclairs' favor, then crushing her at the height of her triumph."

The murmurs in the crowd grew louder.

"Honestly, Lila brought this upon herself. No one forced her to play these dirty games."

"Now I understand why Marcus and Ethan were absent earlier. This explains everything."

Natalie stood frozen, her mouth slightly agape. She nudged Evelyn sharply. "Did you know about this?"

Evelyn gave a subtle shrug. "After the incident, something felt off. I asked Olivia to investigate. When I heard about this gala for Lila, I knew it wasn't what it seemed."

Natalie scoffed. "Lila actually thought she could fake a robbery and play the hero? The delusion!"

"She saw how close you've become with the Sinclairs and got greedy."

Evelyn's response was a cold, humorless laugh.

On stage, Olivia spoke again, her voice cutting through the murmurs. "The Sinclair family recognizes only one person - Evelyn Hartley. No schemes, no manipulations will ever change that. To anyone considering similar tactics - think carefully. Are you prepared to face the full wrath of the Sinclair family?"

Her icy glare swept across the room, the unspoken threat hanging heavy in the air. Several guests who'd been entertaining their own schemes suddenly found them far less appealing.

Theodore whistled low. "Olivia Sinclair certainly knows how to make an impression! I've never seen someone destroyed so thoroughly. She gave Lila hope just to rip it away. That's psychological warfare at its finest. Look at Lila and her parents now - they're utterly humiliated."

###Chapter 350

Nathan's lips curled into a knowing smirk as he spoke in that deep, gravelly tone that always sent shivers down spines. "Olivia Sinclair didn't just settle the score tonight - she sent a clear message to everyone watching."

Theodore Whitmore chuckled, nodding appreciatively. "Absolutely. Seeing the Sinclair family stand so fiercely for Evelyn Hartley, even taking on the Sterlings and Chamberlains... it's making waves. People are realizing what true protection looks like." He leaned in closer. "And since Marcus and Olivia Sinclair keep such a tight inner circle, you can bet half the elite are scrambling to get into their good graces. Especially after what happened with Lila..." His voice dropped. "But after tonight's display? Nobody would dare cross that line unless they've got a death wish. Olivia's strategy of making an example was brilliant."

Nathan remained silent, his sharp eyes missing nothing. He sensed Olivia's actions toward Lila carried deeper implications...

Just then, Olivia's voice cut through the murmuring crowd, her words aimed directly at Victor and Diana Sterling. "Mr. and Mrs. Sterling, while building your empire is commendable, perhaps you should invest equal effort in raising your daughter properly."

Her next words landed like a slap. "If you won't teach her manners, the world will teach her consequences."

The implication of their parental failure hung thick in the air. Victor Sterling visibly flinched, his earlier confidence crumbling into humiliation. Diana's cheeks burned scarlet as she clutched her purse like a lifeline.

"Y-yes, of course," Victor stammered, his voice barely above a whisper. He whirled toward the stage where Lila stood frozen. "Get down here now!" he barked.

Lila jumped at her father's command, her trembling hands gathering her skirt as she moved to descend.

"Wait." Olivia's voice, though quiet, stopped Lila mid-step like an invisible barrier. The single word carried enough ice to frost the entire ballroom.

Lila turned slowly, her voice quivering. "Mrs. Sinclair... is there something else?"

Olivia's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Do you recall accusing Evelyn of stealing your necklace at the Sterling gala?"

The color drained from Lila's face. Victor jumped in immediately. "That was clearly a misunder—"

"Let her answer," Olivia cut him off sharply, leaving Victor gaping like a fish.

Lila's nails dug into her palms. What could she possibly say now?

After an agonizing silence, she whispered, "I... I was wrong. Evelyn never took anything from me."

Olivia's gaze remained steady. "Then don't you think an apology is in order, Miss Sterling?"

Lila's knees nearly buckled.

As if on cue, the crowd parted, creating a path for Evelyn to step forward. Evelyn blinked in surprise but quickly composed herself, meeting Lila's gaze with quiet dignity. For a heartbeat, resentment flashed in Lila's eyes before she looked away.

Victor attempted damage control. "Mrs. Sinclair, it was just a slip of the tongue between sisters. Surely no formal apology is needed between family?"

Olivia arched one perfectly shaped brow. "I was prepared to be lenient if your daughter apologized. But since you insist there's no need..." Her smile turned razor-sharp. "Then I see no reason to hold back."

...

The tension in the grand ballroom became palpable, every guest holding their breath as the confrontation unfolded. Evelyn stood perfectly still, the candlelight catching the subtle tremble of the emerald pendant at her throat - the same necklace Lila had falsely accused her of stealing months ago.

Nathan watched from the shadows, his protective instincts flaring as he observed Evelyn's quiet strength. She hadn't asked for this public reckoning, yet she bore it with grace that made his chest tighten.

Theodore nudged him with an elbow. "This is better than any theater production," he murmured. "Look at Edmund Sterling's face - he's realizing too late that his daughter picked the wrong target."

Indeed, the patriarch of the Sterling family looked as if he'd swallowed something foul, his earlier bravado replaced by dawning comprehension of how thoroughly his family had underestimated the Sinclairs' loyalty to Evelyn.

On stage, Lila's breathing grew erratic, her carefully applied makeup doing little to conceal her pallor. The glittering chandeliers overhead now felt like interrogation lights rather than decorative lighting.

Olivia took a deliberate step forward, her designer heels clicking against the marble. "Well, Miss Sterling? We're all waiting."

The unspoken challenge hung in the air: apologize now, or face consequences far worse than public humiliation. The entire elite society watched, their expressions ranging from schadenfreude to genuine shock at seeing the mighty Sterlings brought so low.

Evelyn's gaze flickered to Nathan briefly, finding silent strength in his steady presence before returning her attention to the unfolding drama. She hadn't sought this reckoning, but she wouldn't shy away from it either - not after everything Lila had put her through.

Victor Sterling opened his mouth again, perhaps to protest, but a single quelling look from Olivia silenced him. The message was clear: this was between Lila and Evelyn now, and no parental interference would be tolerated.

Lila's hands clenched into fists at her sides, her manicured nails leaving crescent marks in her palms. The moment stretched, the tension thickening until it felt nearly suffocating.

Then, with a shuddering breath that seemed to cost her dearly, Lila Sinclair took the first step toward her long-overdue reckoning...
###Chapter 351

The moment Olivia finished speaking, Lila's and Victor's faces drained of color. Guests exchanged uneasy glances. It was obvious to everyone that Olivia was standing up for Evelyn.

Natalie leaned in close, whispering to Evelyn, "Mrs. Sinclair truly has your back!"

Evelyn smiled softly, touched by the gesture.

"I'll apologize to her!" Lila blurted out. She hastily descended from the stage and trudged toward Evelyn, each step heavy with reluctance.

Standing before Evelyn, Lila took a sharp breath, clenched her teeth, and forced out, "Evelyn, I'm sorry. I spoke carelessly and wronged you that day. I sincerely apologize and hope you can forgive my mistake."

Though Lila's words sounded contrite, the fire in her eyes betrayed her true feelings. She was seething.

Evelyn nearly laughed at the absurdity, a mocking smile playing on her lips.

She gave a slight nod. "Since you're apologizing so sincerely, how could I refuse? But do be more careful with your words in the future, Lila. I'm sure you understand how dangerous loose tongues can be."

Evelyn's smile never wavered as she spoke.

Meanwhile, Lila's face cycled through shades of pale and flushed, emotions warring visibly. Finally, she stumbled out of the venue in a daze, barely aware of how she'd even left.

This gala had been nothing short of a revolution for all present. Olivia's maneuver had been masterful—killing three birds with one stone! Those who'd been waiting for Evelyn's downfall or currying favor with Lila were left thoroughly humiliated. Who could have predicted such a dramatic turn?

After the event, Olivia pulled Evelyn aside and invited her to stay at the Sinclair residence for the night. Back at the Sinclair mansion, the group gathered in the living room.

Olivia finally explained, "Truthfully, my security team noticed the private investigator following me from day one. I wanted to uncover who was behind it and their motives, so I let it play out." Olivia's laugh was icy. "When Lila appeared, I knew she was the puppet master. Her motives were transparent."

It turned out Olivia's reactions during the confrontation had all been an act.

Hearing this, Evelyn exclaimed, "So that's why your bodyguard didn't intervene! You'd planned everything from the start!"

Olivia nodded with a satisfied smile. "Precisely. Even this gala was a 'gift' I prepared for Lila—one she'll never forget."

"Yes, it's certainly unforgettable for her," Evelyn said, unable to suppress her smile.

Not just Lila, Evelyn thought—Victor would remember this night vividly too.

In stark contrast to the warm atmosphere at the Sinclair residence, tension hung thick in the Prescott household that night.

The moment the Prescott family returned home, Diana snapped at Lila, "On your knees. Now!"

Lila bit her lip so hard it turned white. Her eyes reddened as she lowered her gaze, slowly sinking to her knees.

###Chapter 352

Diana's chest rose and fell rapidly, her face flushed crimson with rage. "Hiring criminals to fake a robbery and playing the hero? Lila, you've truly gone too far! Is this the kind of behavior I raised you to exhibit? Did I teach you to sink to such despicable levels just to get your way?"

Lila remained silent, trembling too violently to form words.

"Answer me!" Diana slammed her palm against the marble tabletop, the sharp sound echoing through the tense silence.

Lila's entire body shook as she stammered, "I-I'm sorry, Mother. It was a mistake! I know I shouldn't have done it. I just... I wasn't thinking clearly and made a terrible choice."

After a shaky breath, she continued, "Seeing how the Caldwell family dotes on Evelyn made me so jealous that I—"

A cold laugh escaped Diana's lips. "Jealous? That's your excuse? You were so consumed by envy that at the Sterling family gala, in front of high society, you publicly accused Evelyn of stealing your necklace?"

Lila lifted tear-filled eyes, shaking her head desperately. "It... it just slipped out! I didn't mean—"

"Stop lying," Diana cut in sharply. "I know exactly what you intended."

Her voice turned icy. "I carried you for nine months. Do you think your own mother can't see through your schemes? Your jealousy of Evelyn has festered into pure malice. You sought to ruin her reputation out of petty spite."

"Did you even consider the consequences of dredging up Evelyn's past in that setting? Or have you forgotten she's your sister?"

Lila's jaw clenched. Sister? Evelyn was nothing but a bastard child born from that mistress Grace Monroe! Sometimes Lila wondered if her mother had lost her mind—not only tolerating her father's mistress but welcoming the illegitimate daughter into their home without protest.

Did Diana even love Victor at all? What kind of wife would behave this way?

"Enough, Diana. Lila understands her mistake. Let her stand now," Victor interjected.

"You've spoiled her rotten! And now see what she's become—resorting to such shameful tactics!" Diana's temples pulsed visibly with anger.

After composing herself, she pronounced judgment: "Lila, you'll kneel here all night. No one is permitted to help you up without my express permission. And for the next week, you're confined to your room to reflect on your disgraceful behavior."

Lila's head snapped up in shock, her eyes wide with disbelief. Even Victor's expression darkened.

"Diana, making her kneel until morning is too severe. She has hospital duties tomorrow."

"If the punishment isn't harsh, how will she learn?" Diana remained unmoved. "Take leave from the hospital tomorrow, Lila. If they won't grant it, then resign!"

"Mother!" Lila gasped.

"My decision is final." With that, Diana rose and ascended the grand staircase without another glance.

###Chapter 353

Lila Sinclair stood frozen in place, her limbs locked in paralyzing shock.

"Lila..." Victor Sterling began, but she cut him off with a sharp gesture.

"Father, please leave me. I need to be alone," Lila said, her voice eerily composed despite the storm raging inside her.

Victor hesitated, then exhaled heavily before retreating upstairs.

Alone in the grand foyer, Lila sank to her knees, her spine rigid as steel. Waves of humiliation and fury crashed through her veins. She couldn't comprehend how her meticulously orchestrated plan had unraveled so spectacularly. By dawn, her disgrace would be the talk of every elite gathering in the city. The entire social circle now knew she'd staged that robbery to manipulate the Caldwells.

How could she ever show her face again? What whispers would follow her through gala entrances and charity balls? Her reputation lay in tatters.

The injustice of it all made her vision swim with crimson rage. Olivia Sinclair would pay for this humiliation. Lila swore to herself - this debt would be repaid tenfold.

Meanwhile, Victor entered his study and immediately dialed a familiar number.

"Victor? How did it go? Did Marcus recognize Lila as a family friend?" Grace Monroe's anxious voice crackled through the receiver.

Victor drew a long breath before recounting the evening's disastrous events in brutal detail.

Grace fell into stunned silence, struggling to process the revelations.

"I can't believe..."

"Olivia went through all this trouble just to humiliate Lila and elevate Evelyn! She's made her intentions painfully clear - she wants to destroy our daughter completely." Victor's words dripped with venom, each syllable sharp enough to draw blood.

"How is Lila taking this?" Grace asked hesitantly.

"Devastated doesn't begin to cover it," Victor replied grimly. "Diana's making her kneel in the foyer until she gives permission to rise."

Grace gasped. "What? How could Diana do that to her? Is she expecting our girl to stay there all night? I don't care what Diana thinks - I won't stand for this treatment of Lila!" Her voice trembled with maternal fury.

"Grace!" Victor's voice held a warning edge.

There was a pause before Grace hastily added, "I can't help it - I've always treated Lila as my own."

A dangerous glint flashed in Victor's eyes.

After a weighted silence, he spoke with deliberate emphasis. "You should be proud, Grace. The daughter you raised is truly... exceptional."

Grace's breath caught in her throat.

She had no response to Victor's scathing remark.

###Chapter 354

"That's enough for now," Victor Sterling snapped before abruptly ending the call.

As the line went dead, Grace Monroe's eyes narrowed, her expression flickering with something unreadable. Her fingers, resting on the coffee table, curled into a tight fist before slowly relaxing again, her features smoothing back into practiced composure.

The next morning.

Leonard Grant had called Evelyn Hartley late last night, informing her they'd be spending the day at their countryside villa. Before dawn had properly broken, Evelyn had already packed her bags and was waiting for Leonard and the others to pick her up.

Just as Evelyn was about to leave her room, her phone buzzed unexpectedly. Seeing Gabriella Vega's name flash across the screen, a brief shadow crossed her face before she answered.

"Do you have the results?" Evelyn asked immediately, her voice tight.

"Yes," Gabriella replied. After a slight hesitation, she added, "There's no trace of any substances in your system."

Evelyn's brows drew together in surprise. "Nothing at all?"

Gabriella's voice was firm. "I ran multiple tests. Your bloodwork came back completely clean. Either whatever was in your system metabolized unusually fast, or..." She trailed off meaningfully.

Evelyn pressed her lips together, uncertainty flashing in her stormy gray eyes. Had she imagined the whole thing? Was it possible she'd simply had too much to drink that night?

"Evelyn," Gabriella said gently, "think carefully. Did you notice anything else unusual that night besides feeling drunk?"

Evelyn considered for a long moment before shaking her head. "No. Nothing specific."

"Then maybe..." Gabriella hesitated. "Maybe there wasn't anything in your drink after all? You'd been under a lot of stress lately. Maybe your tolerance was just lower than usual."

"Maybe," Evelyn murmured, though the word tasted bitter in her mouth. Despite the test results, something still felt off about that night. But with no evidence, she had no choice but to let it go—for now. Ending the call, she headed downstairs.

A sleek black limousine bearing the Grant family crest idled at the curb. As Evelyn slid inside, the powerful engine purred to life, carrying them toward the countryside estate. During the drive, Leonard turned to Evelyn with concern in his eyes. "How is Olivia doing?"

Evelyn knew he was asking whether Olivia Sinclair had been harmed during the staged robbery. She shook her head. "She's fine. The thief never even touched her."

"Thank God," Leonard exhaled, his shoulders relaxing slightly. "Lila has gone too far this time. To stoop to such measures!" His mouth twisted in disgust. "She's shamed the Prescott name." Leonard had never trusted Lila Sinclair. There had always been something calculating about her, and recent events had proven him right.

"The Caldwells have been so kind to you," Margaret Hayes remarked from the opposite seat.

Evelyn nodded, a genuine smile touching her lips. "I'm very fortunate to have them in my life."

Nathan Black remained silent throughout the exchange, though his piercing blue eyes kept drifting to Evelyn as if drawn by some invisible force. Leonard noticed the younger man's attention and hid a knowing smile, his mood lifting considerably.

Upon arriving at the villa, the group settled in briefly before Evelyn headed to the kitchen to prepare lunch. Leonard had mentioned during the drive how much he missed her cooking, and she'd promised to make them a proper meal. Keeping it simple, she focused on a few comforting family recipes.

###Chapter 355

The dining table was set beautifully as the four of them took their seats. Leonard raised his glass with a warm smile. "To family," he declared.

Glasses clinked together in harmony. Leonard's gaze lingered on Nathan and Evelyn as he added, "I hope we can share meals like this every day from now on." His words carried an unspoken weight.

Evelyn and Nathan exchanged quick glances, their expressions unreadable.

Their eyes locked for a brief moment, an electric current passing between them. Yet neither dared to voice what they were feeling.

The meal passed pleasantly, with Nathan eating more than usual. After lunch, they all retreated to their rooms for afternoon rest.

Evelyn's room contained only one bed, which she now had to share with Nathan. Without hesitation, she flopped onto the soft mattress. To her surprise, Nathan lay down beside her.

She turned to him with raised eyebrows. "You—"

Nathan met her gaze steadily. "It's not our first time sharing a bed," he reminded her.

Evelyn's cheeks flushed. This infuriating man! She glared at him wordlessly before turning away, determined to get some sleep.

Nathan's rhythmic breathing soon filled the room. Strangely comforted by the sound, Evelyn found herself drifting off.

Nathan watched as Evelyn's breathing evened out in sleep. He couldn't believe she was lying right beside him. Her presence soothed something restless in his heart. Lately, she'd occupied his thoughts more than he cared to admit. Not wanting to examine these feelings too closely, he closed his eyes and surrendered to sleep.

Later that afternoon, Leonard suggested Nathan teach Evelyn how to swim.

"Absolutely not necessary. I have no interest in learning," Evelyn protested immediately.

The truth was, water terrified her.

But Leonard wouldn't hear it.

"Knowledge is power, Evelyn. Swimming is an essential life skill that could save you one day. You must learn," he insisted firmly.

Turning to Nathan, he added, "I'm counting on you to teach her properly."

"Really, Leonard, this isn't—" Evelyn tried again.

Nathan caught the flicker of fear in Evelyn's eyes and felt a mischievous urge. Without hesitation, he agreed, "Consider it done."

Evelyn gaped at him.

She stared at Nathan, torn between shock and disbelief. What game was he playing? Since when did he have time to give swimming lessons?

"Perfect!" Leonard beamed. "You should start right away."

Ever thoughtful, Leonard had already arranged for swimwear to be prepared, which only confirmed Evelyn's suspicion that this was all part of his master plan.

###Chapter 356

Clutching the towel around her body, Evelyn stepped hesitantly toward the pool area. The afternoon sun reflected off the crystal-clear water, creating dazzling patterns on the surrounding tiles. Nathan was already swimming with powerful strokes, his muscular form cutting through the water effortlessly.

As he surfaced, water cascaded down his bronzed shoulders and sculpted chest. Sunlight caught the droplets clinging to his skin, making him look like some Greek god emerging from the sea. Evelyn's breath hitched as she unconsciously tightened her grip on the towel.

Nathan spotted her frozen form and smirked. "Planning to stand there all day?" His deep voice carried across the water, sending shivers down her spine.

Evelyn didn't move, her feet seemingly rooted to the spot. Nathan arched an eyebrow, his expression turning predatory. "Should I come get you?"

"No!" she blurted out, panic flashing in her eyes. "I'm coming."

Taking a deep breath, Evelyn let the towel drop. The moment the fabric slipped from her shoulders, she felt Nathan's gaze like a physical touch. The emerald green bikini hugged her curves perfectly, accentuating her slender waist and long legs.

Nathan's eyes darkened as they traveled over her body. Evelyn suddenly regretted accepting the swimsuit the maid had provided - it revealed far more than she'd anticipated.

Clearing her throat, she inched toward the pool's edge. The cool water lapped at her toes as she descended the steps. Nathan swam closer, extending his hand. After a moment's hesitation, she placed her palm in his.

The instant their skin touched, electricity shot up Evelyn's arm. Nathan pulled her deeper into the water, but as the bottom dropped away beneath her feet, terror gripped her.

"Nathan, wait!" she gasped, her voice rising in pitch.

Turning to face her, Nathan's expression was unreadable. "First rule of swimming, Evelyn..." Before she could react, he released her hand.

Evelyn's scream was cut off as water closed over her head. She flailed wildly, her movements uncoordinated and panicked. Water burned her nose and throat as she desperately tried to surface.

Strong arms suddenly wrapped around her waist, hauling her upward. Evelyn clung to Nathan like a lifeline, coughing and gasping for air. Their bodies pressed together intimately as he supported her weight.

"You... you..." she sputtered between coughs, her face flushed with anger and exertion. With all her strength, she smacked his shoulder. "You absolute jerk!"

Nathan's lips curved into a wicked grin. "That's lesson one, sweetheart. Everyone swallows water when they're learning." His arms tightened around her as she continued to tremble against him. "Ready for round two?"

###Chapter 357
Evelyn glared at him, her words trapped in her throat. Fury ignited within her at his infuriating smirk. "You absolute bastard! Is this your twisted idea of teaching someone to swim? I'm leaving—and Leonard will hear about this!" she spat through clenched teeth.

"Cool it!" Nathan snapped.

Evelyn swung again, aiming for Nathan's shoulder. "Who the hell do you think you are? Let me go, you arrogant prick!"

Nathan's expression darkened, his gaze turning dangerous. "Keep pushing me, Evelyn, and I might just drop you. Feel like testing that theory?"

Her eyes widened, defiance flashing. "You wouldn't dare."

"Try me." His voice dropped, low and rough, as he feigned loosening his grip.

Panic seized her. Without thinking, she hooked her legs around his waist, yanking them flush together. The sudden contact sent a jolt through them both.

Nathan stiffened, caught off guard. His voice turned strained. "Evelyn. Let go."

"No," she shot back, clinging tighter, challenging him.

"Let. Go." His tone was sharp but husky.

When she only tightened her hold, his jaw tensed. He tried to pry her legs free, but she locked them like a vise.

"Not happening," she hissed.

Then—her breath hitched. Something firm pressed against her thigh.

"Nathan…" Her voice wavered. "Something's—"

Realization struck. Her face burned. That was—

Her wide eyes snapped to his face, now a mix of tension and exasperation. The air between them thickened.

Nathan cleared his throat, rough. "Get. Down."

He looked away, jaw clenched.

Evelyn hastily unwound herself—but the second she did, she sank. Panic flared, but Nathan's arm banded around her waist, hauling her back against him.

Water rippled around them as their bodies collided again. Her hands braced on his shoulders, their gazes locking.

Silence. Charged. Unspoken.

Nathan's eyes darkened, stormy with restraint. He couldn't tear his gaze from her flushed lips.

His throat worked. Resolve crumbling, he leaned in—

Evelyn's breath caught. His warmth brushed her skin as he closed the distance. Heart racing, she surrendered, eyelids fluttering shut.

###Chapter 358

Nathan's lips hovered mere inches from Evelyn's when a piercing ringtone shattered the intimate moment. The sudden interruption made them both freeze. Evelyn's eyes flew open, her cheeks flushing crimson as she quickly turned her face away. Nathan let out a heavy exhale, clearing his throat as he too averted his gaze.

Without a word, he guided Evelyn toward the pool's edge. With effortless strength, he lifted her onto the deck before climbing out himself. Evelyn sat awkwardly, avoiding Nathan's eyes as he grabbed his towel. His brow furrowed slightly when he glanced at the caller ID.

After a beat, he answered with a clipped tone. "Yes?"

The voice on the other end was frantic. "Nathan! Serena's been taken!"

Shock flashed across Nathan's face. "What did you say?"

"Some men in black grabbed her from the mall parking lot!" Dylan's voice was tight with urgency.

"I'm coming." Nathan didn't waste another second. He ended the call without further questions.

Turning to Evelyn, his voice was brisk. "Serena's been kidnapped. I have to go."

He grabbed his towel and headed for the exit without waiting for her response.

"Wait!" Evelyn's hand shot out, gripping his wrist. Her expression was calm but firm. "If Serena's been kidnapped, you should call the police first—not rush in alone!"

Nathan paused, his gaze unreadable. "I still have to go."

Evelyn's grip tightened, her eyes clouding with hurt. "So nothing will stop you?" she asked softly.

Nathan's eyes darkened. "No."

Gently pulling his wrist free, he walked away without another word. His sense of responsibility toward Serena had always been unwavering. Ignoring this wasn't an option.

Evelyn stood frozen, her heart sinking as she watched him leave. The weight of disappointment pressed heavily on her chest, making it hard to breathe. A bitter laugh escaped her lips. She should have known. When it came to Serena, Nathan always dropped everything.

What chance did she have against the lingering power of first love?

Her laugh turned self-mocking as she slowly rose from the pool's edge. Chaotic thoughts swirled in her mind, drowning her in insecurity and frustration. Distracted and not watching her step on the wet surface, she suddenly slipped.

With a gasp, she lost her balance and plunged back into the water. The loud splash shattered the pool's stillness as she disappeared beneath the surface. Panic seized her immediately.

"Help! Someone help!" Evelyn flailed wildly, struggling to keep her head above water. The pool swallowed her cries as water rushed into her mouth and nose. The suffocating pressure squeezed her chest, her lungs burning for air.

Her arms thrashed desperately, but the water seemed determined to drag her down. Each second made her feel heavier, colder. As despair crept in—her mind screaming that this might be the end—a voice cut through the chaos.

"Mrs. Black!" A maid's alarmed cry echoed across the pool area. "Help! Mrs. Black is drowning!" The servant shouted before diving into the water.

###Chapter 359

The maid rushed toward Evelyn, wrapping strong arms around her waist and hauling her upward with desperate strength. Evelyn choked as her face broke the water's surface, her fingers digging into the servant's shoulders like claws.

"Hold tight, Mrs. Black!" the maid gasped, kicking fiercely toward the pool's edge.

After an eternity of struggling, they finally reached safety. The servant heaved Evelyn onto the deck before pulling herself out. Evelyn collapsed onto the tiles, coughing violently as water streamed from her hair.

The maid snatched a towel and draped it over Evelyn's shaking form.

"Evelyn!" Leonard's voice cut through the chaos, laced with panic. He arrived with Margaret and a cluster of staff, their faces pale with concern.

Evelyn shook her head weakly at Leonard. Between ragged coughs, she managed, "Leonard... I'm... okay..." But her trembling body betrayed the truth.

"Okay? You call this okay?" Leonard's face darkened with worry. Suddenly, realization flashed across his features. "How did this happen? And where's Nathan? Where did that irresponsible boy disappear to?"

Evelyn drew a shuddering breath. "He... received an urgent call... had to leave." She met Leonard's gaze steadily despite her coughing. "I slipped and fell in."

Leonard's jaw tightened. "An urgent call? What could possibly be more important than your safety?"

"Dylan contacted Nathan..." Evelyn coughed. "Serena's been kidnapped."

She saw no reason to shield Nathan from the truth with lies.

Leonard's expression turned stormy, and even Margaret gripping his arm looked grave.

"That fool!" Leonard's fists clenched, his voice shaking with fury. "Margaret, call Nathan immediately. Tell him to return at once!"

Before Margaret could move, Evelyn spoke firmly, "No, Leonard." Her tone carried quiet authority. "Don't summon him back."

Leonard bristled. "Why ever not? He—"

"Please," Evelyn interrupted, her eyes pleading yet resolute. "Just this once, trust my judgment. Don't call him."

Leonard opened his mouth to argue but hesitated, something in Evelyn's gaze softening his anger. With a heavy sigh, he relented. "Very well. I'll respect your wishes." Evelyn offered a weak smile in response.

"Send for the doctor," Leonard ordered.

Evelyn shook her head. "Unnecessary. Truly, I'm fine."

"Are you certain?" Leonard frowned. "A medical examination wouldn't hurt."

"I know my limits," Evelyn said gently but firmly. "Just need rest. I'll retire upstairs."

Seeing her determination, Leonard could only nod. "Very well. Go rest."

###Chapter 360

The maid rushed forward immediately, helping Evelyn Hartley rise from the floor. Evelyn's grateful eyes met the servant's, her expression softening with relief. "I owe you my life today. Without your help, I might not have made it."

Her words struck Leonard Grant and Margaret Hayes like physical blows. The maid simply shook her head. "No thanks necessary, Miss Hartley. Let me escort you to your room." Evelyn gave a silent nod of agreement.

Once inside her bedroom, Evelyn collapsed onto the plush mattress. The day's traumatic events had sapped every ounce of her strength, leaving her too exhausted to even consider showering. As her body relaxed against the sheets, overwhelming fatigue consumed her. Within minutes, she was deep in dreamless sleep.

Across town at Black Enterprises, Nathan Black stood rigid behind his mahogany desk, his piercing gaze scanning the intelligence reports spread before him. He'd already mobilized his elite security team to investigate Serena Cole's abduction.

Dylan Reeves sat nearby, his face pale with worry. Opposite him, Serena's distraught friend wept uncontrollably.

"This is all my fault! If only I hadn't insisted on that shopping trip! She...she fought them off so I could run...I should have stayed with her—"

"Silence!" Nathan's sharp command cut through the hysterics like a blade. His glacial stare froze the woman mid-sob. "Your tears solve nothing. Sit down and compose yourself."

The woman's mouth snapped shut, her breath hitching in stunned silence. After what felt like an eternity, Walter Kingsley entered the room with urgent strides.

"Mr. Black, we've confirmed Bradly Stanley orchestrated Miss Cole's kidnapping," Walter reported, his professional tone unable to mask the gravity of the situation.

Nathan's expression darkened at the name. Bradly Stanley—the man who'd dared challenge his authority years ago, only to be left drowning in financial ruin. Had Walter not mentioned him, Nathan might have forgotten the man entirely.

"Bradly? Former CEO of Stanley Industries?" Dylan interjected.

Walter nodded grimly. "The very same."

Dylan fell silent, his own history with Bradly clearly surfacing in his mind.

"But why?" he finally asked, confusion knitting his brow. "What could he possibly gain from taking Serena?"

Walter shook his head. "That remains unclear. We'll need to apprehend Bradly for answers."

"Any leads on Serena's location?" Dylan pressed.

"Not yet," Walter admitted.

Nathan's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Expand the search. And bring me Bradly."

"Yes, sir." Walter exited swiftly to execute the orders.

Time crawled by with agonizing slowness until the breakthrough finally came—Nathan's team had located Serena.

Without hesitation, Nathan, Dylan, and the now-silent woman raced to the location with an armed security detail. Their destination: an abandoned construction site on the city's outskirts.

Inside the skeletal building, Serena lay bound spread-eagle on the concrete floor, her restraints pulled taut in a cruel star pattern.

"Please! Let me go!" Her desperate pleas echoed through the hollow structure, her voice raw with terror.

###Chapter 361

One of the masked men stepped closer, his lips curling into a sadistic smirk. "How adorable. We'll enjoy ourselves thoroughly before even thinking about releasing you."

Serena's breath hitched as terror gripped her. "What are you talking about? Don't you dare touch me!"

The ringleader let out a chilling laugh. "It's been ages since we've had such exquisite entertainment. Cooperate, and the pain might be bearable."

"No! I'm begging you!" Serena's voice cracked as tears streaked her cheeks. "Name your price - any amount! Just don't hurt me!"

"Money can't buy what we want tonight, princess," the leader sneered, running a finger along her jawline. "We only want you."

The other men erupted in crude laughter, their hungry eyes raking over her trembling form. "Quit stalling, boss! Let's get started!"

"Yeah, we're tired of waiting!" another thug shouted, licking his lips.

The leader raised his hand for silence. "Alright boys, strip her."

With animalistic cheers, they descended upon Serena, shredding her clothes until she stood completely exposed.

"Get away! Someone help me!" Her desperate screams only fueled their arousal.

"Damn, look at that body!" one leered.

"I call first turn!" another growled, unbuckling his belt.

The leader began lowering his pants with a predatory grin...

"HELP! PLEASE!" Serena's raw screams echoed through the abandoned warehouse, her throat burning from exertion.

"Save your breath," the leader taunted. "We're miles from civilization. No one's coming to rescue you."

He stepped forward in just his boxers, his erection visible through the thin fabric.

"Please... I'll do anything," Serena whimpered, shrinking against the cold concrete.

Suddenly, pounding footsteps interrupted the scene.

"Boss! Trouble!" a lookout shouted, panic in his voice.

"Handle them!" the leader barked.

When Nathan burst into the room, his gaze immediately locked onto Serena's broken form curled naked on the floor. His jaw muscles twitched as he sharply turned away. "Cover her," he ordered sharply.

Grace rushed forward without hesitation, wrapping Serena in a thick blanket while shielding her from prying eyes.

###Chapter 362

The moment Nathan draped his jacket over Serena's trembling shoulders, she finally allowed herself to exhale.

Serena's tear-filled eyes locked onto Nathan's face, and a broken sob tore from her throat. "Nathan... You came for me!" Her voice cracked as she reached out desperately.

Nathan caught her wrist before she could collapse against him. "You're safe now," he said evenly, though his jaw remained tight.

Grace stepped forward urgently. "We need to move. Serena, can you stand?"

"I... I'll try," Serena whispered, gripping Grace's arm like a lifeline.

Her knees buckled instantly. "Serena!" Grace gasped, barely catching her. "Where does it hurt?"

Serena shook her head violently, fresh tears spilling down her cheeks.

"Can you carry her?" Grace turned to Dylan with pleading eyes.

Dylan moved to help, but Serena recoiled so violently she nearly fell again. "No! Please... don't touch me." Her breathing turned ragged. "I can't... not after..."

The unspoken horror hung heavy in the air.

Nathan exhaled sharply before striding forward. Without ceremony, he scooped Serena into his arms.

To everyone's surprise, Serena immediately buried her face against Nathan's neck, her fingers twisting into his shirt.

The ride to Silvercrest Medical Center passed in suffocating silence.

At the hospital, Dr. Graves emerged from the examination room. "Physically, she's stable," he told Dylan. "Minor abrasions and ligature marks on her wrists and ankles."

His expression darkened. "The psychological trauma is more concerning. She's exhibiting acute aversion to male contact and shows signs of severe distress. She'll need constant support from trusted individuals to prevent further deterioration."

Dylan's knuckles whitened around his phone. "Understood. Thank you, Doctor."

As the medical team departed, the group stood frozen in the sterile hallway, the weight of unspoken questions pressing down on them.

###Chapter 363

Dylan stood motionless, his piercing gaze locked onto Nathan.

His lips parted slightly as if words were trapped in his throat, unable to escape.

Nathan didn't linger.

Without sparing a backward glance, he pushed through the hospital room door.

Dylan and the woman remained frozen in the corridor, shadows stretching long behind them.

Both understood with painful clarity—Serena needed Nathan more than anyone in this moment.

His presence alone could anchor her shattered soul.

Inside the sterile room, Serena lay like a porcelain doll against the stark white sheets.

Her hollow eyes stared blankly at the ceiling's fluorescent lights.

The rhythmic click of dress shoes made her head turn mechanically.

A spark ignited in her dulled irises at the sight of Nathan.

"Nathan," she whispered, the name cracking like thin ice.

Her fingers twitched toward him instinctively before recoiling as if burned.

She clutched the hospital blanket like armor, knuckles bleaching white.

Trembling lips parted. "Nathan... I'm... contaminated." A tear carved a path down her cheek. "Those men saw everything. How can you even look at me now?"

Nathan's expression remained an unreadable mask.

His voice came steady as bedrock. "They never touched you. Only removed your clothes. Don't give them power they didn't take."

Serena shook violently, fingernails digging into her palms. "You don't understand! Their eyes—like cockroaches crawling over my skin!" She began scrubbing her arms raw. "I can still feel them—"

"Enough." Nathan captured her wrists mid-motion.

Her breath hitched as their skin connected, searching his face like a drowning woman spotting land.

"The question remains," she pleaded, voice fracturing. "Am I still... worthy to you?"

The silence between them grew teeth.

Nathan's gaze dropped to their joined hands before gently tucking them beneath the blanket. "You need rest," he murmured, smoothing the sheets.

The light in Serena's eyes guttered out.

She collapsed into the pillows, turning her face toward the wall. Fresh tears darkened the fabric. "Just go," came the broken whisper. "I'll manage alone."

Nathan hesitated at the threshold. "They'll pay," he vowed, the words heavy as a tombstone sealing shut.

###Chapter 364

Without another word, Nathan turned on his heel and walked out of the room.

Serena's head whipped toward the door where he'd disappeared, her face a mask of stunned disbelief.

Those words had been spoken in a moment of wounded pride, a desperate attempt to make him stay.

Never in her wildest dreams had she imagined he would actually leave.

A tidal wave of fury and anguish crashed over her.

All she'd wanted was for Nathan to pull her into his arms, to whisper that he still desired her—not some sterile vow of retribution.

Back at Black Enterprises, Nathan marched into his office, his expression carefully blank.

Moments later, Walter entered, his features drawn tight.

"Mr. Black, Bradley has confessed," Walter announced. "He claims to have harbored resentment toward you for years."

A pause.

"Since... certain past incidents."

"He was biding his time for the perfect moment to strike."

"When those compromising photos of you and Miss Cole surfaced online, he assumed she held special significance to you."

Nathan's eyes narrowed to dangerous slits, his gaze sharp enough to flay skin. "And what exactly was his original plan?"

Walter hesitated, discomfort radiating from him. "He... intended to have Miss Cole assaulted."

"He planned to record the entire ordeal and send you the footage."

The temperature in the room seemed to drop twenty degrees.

Nathan's expression darkened like a gathering storm. "They've got remarkable audacity, don't they?"

"Fortunately, our team intervened in time. Otherwise—" Walter left the grim alternative hanging in the air.

Nathan's jaw tightened, irritation flashing across his features.

Once again, Serena had become collateral damage in his personal wars.

Another debt he owed her.

When would this cycle ever end?

The thought twisted like a knife in his gut.

After a weighted silence, his gaze turned razor-sharp. "Dig up everything on Bradley," he commanded.

Walter immediately understood the subtext. "You suspect someone might be pulling Bradley's strings?"

Nathan's voice was ice. "It's a distinct possibility. I'd rather be thorough than regretful later."

###Chapter 365

"Understood. I'll issue the orders right away," Walter responded.

He paused briefly before adding, "What about those kidnappers? How should we handle them?"

Nathan contemplated for a moment before replying, "Let Serena decide. Leave it to her."

"Yes, Mr. Black." With that, Walter turned and exited the office.

Nathan let out a heavy sigh, massaging his temples before rising from his chair.

He had planned to return to the countryside estate, seeking some peace and quiet.

But just as he reached the office door, his phone rang.

He answered immediately.

Dylan's frantic voice came through the line. "Nathan, you need to get to the hospital now! Serena... Something's wrong. She's locked herself in the bathroom with the shower running. She won't come out, and no matter how much I beg, she just keeps saying she's fine. But I'm terrified she might do something stupid."

Nathan's brows furrowed deeply.

Irritation flared within him, but he pushed it down. This couldn't be ignored.

"I'm on my way," he said curtly before ending the call.

Abandoning his original plans, Nathan drove straight to Grand Oaks General Hospital.

When he arrived at the hospital room, he found Dylan standing outside the bathroom door, pleading softly. "Serena, please open the door. You've been in there too long. I'm scared."

From inside, Serena's weak voice responded, "I told you, I'm fine. Stop worrying about me."

Dylan knocked again, desperation coloring his tone. "If you're really fine, then prove it. Open the door."

Nathan strode forward, his voice commanding. "Serena, open this door now."

The bathroom fell silent for a beat before Serena's faint reply came. "Nathan..."

"You have three minutes," Nathan stated coldly. "If you're not out by then, I'm leaving."

"No! I'm coming out!" Serena's response was immediate, laced with panic.

Nathan turned away, seating himself on the nearby sofa without another word.

Two minutes later, the bathroom door creaked open.

Serena emerged, her wet hair plastered to her flushed face, an unnatural red hue staining her cheeks.

"Serena!" Dylan rushed to her side, his face etched with concern. "Are you okay?"

Serena offered him a weak smile. "I told you, I'm fine. Stop fussing."

But as Serena moved toward Nathan, Dylan suddenly grabbed her wrist and pushed up the sleeve of her hospital gown.

A vivid red mark stood out starkly against her pale skin.

###Chapter 366

The angry red marks on Serena's skin looked like they'd been scrubbed raw.

Her entire arm was inflamed, the capillaries bursting beneath the surface from excessive friction.

"Dylan! Stop staring at me!" Serena's voice cracked as she tried to pull away from his grasp.

Nathan observed silently from the doorway, his dark eyes tracking every flinch of Serena's body.

"Serena, you're hurting yourself," Dylan said, his grip tightening around her wrist. "What happened in there? Your face is flushed too."

"Let me go!" She twisted violently, her sleeve catching on Dylan's watch.

When he finally released her, Serena immediately began rubbing the spot he'd touched with frantic, jerky motions.

Nathan stepped forward, his presence commanding immediate attention. "Enough."

Serena froze mid-motion, her breathing ragged.

Dylan ran a hand through his hair. "This is worse than we thought. She's developed a full aversion to physical contact."

The sound of running water drew their attention. Serena had retreated to the bathroom again.

Nathan found her at the sink, scouring her forearm under scalding water. Her skin was turning an alarming shade of crimson.

"Serena." Nathan's voice cut through the steam-filled room.

She didn't look up. "It won't come off. I can still feel their hands—"

Nathan turned off the faucet with deliberate slowness. "You're clean."

Tears welled in Serena's bloodshot eyes as she stared at her reflection. The haunted look in them spoke volumes.

"Bed. Now." Nathan's command brooked no argument.

Serena nodded jerkily and shuffled toward the bedroom, her shoulders hunched defensively.

Dylan maintained a careful three-foot distance, his usual confident demeanor replaced with wary concern.

The psychological scars ran deeper than any of them had anticipated.

###Chapter 367

Back in the hospital bed, Serena turned to Dylan and Nathan with weary eyes. "Dylan, Nathan, you should both go now. I'll be alright."

Dylan's brow furrowed. "Leave? So you can start that obsessive scrubbing the moment we're gone?"

Serena hesitated, her fingers twisting the bedsheet.

"I'm staying," Dylan declared firmly. "Just try to rest."

Serena's gaze flickered to Nathan, a silent plea in her eyes.

"Sleep," Nathan commanded in that deep, unreadable voice of his.

Biting her lip, Serena finally closed her eyes without another word.

Midnight came and went.

When Nathan rose from the sofa, Dylan looked up in surprise. "I'm heading out," Nathan announced.

Dylan opened his mouth to protest when—

"NO! Don't touch me—" Serena's terrified scream sliced through the quiet room.

Both men rushed to her bedside.

Serena thrashed violently, sweat glistening on her pale face. Her hands clawed at invisible attackers as she whimpered, "Nathan...Nathan, help me!"

"Serena! Wake up!" Dylan shook her shoulders gently.

With a gasp, Serena jolted upright, her chest heaving. Her wide, haunted eyes darted around the room.

"It was just a nightmare," Dylan soothed. "You're safe here. Nothing will hurt you."

But Serena's shattered gaze found Nathan instead. "Nathan..." Her voice cracked like broken glass.

"It's over," Nathan said coolly, making no move to comfort her.

Serena wrapped her arms around herself, curling into a trembling ball as silent tears fell.

Nathan felt the sharp sting of guilt. This broken woman before him was collateral damage in his war.

###Chapter 368

That fleeting emotion was all he allowed himself to show—nothing beyond that.

A deep sense of resignation settled over Nathan as his gaze remained fixed on Serena.

The realization hit him hard—he wouldn't be leaving this place tonight.

His expression turned contemplative as he wondered about Evelyn—was she asleep now? Or still angry with him?

Meanwhile, in the countryside mansion, chaos reigned. Leonard, worried sick about Evelyn, had instructed the maids to check on her hourly. Their horrified gasps echoed when they discovered Evelyn burning up with fever in the dead of night.

The family physician arrived in haste, his frown deepening when the thermometer read 39.2°C.

"Leonard, it's just a chill from the cold water. I know my body. I'll recover soon. Please don't fret," Evelyn rasped, her cheeks flushed crimson despite her weak protest.

"Do you call this trivial?" Leonard snapped, his fingers tightening around the bedpost. "When will you stop being so stubborn about your health?" He turned sharply to Margaret. "Call Nathan immediately. Tell him to get his ass home now!"

Before Margaret could dial, Evelyn's hoarse voice cut through the tension. "Don't!"

She swallowed painfully before continuing, "Please... don't disturb him. It's just a fever. I'd rather... he not come."

Biting her cracked lip, Evelyn met Leonard's gaze with startling intensity. "I don't want to see him... not now."

Leonard felt helplessness crash over him like a wave. But faced with Evelyn's iron resolve, he could only clench his fists in frustration. This was all his son's fault.

Evelyn spoke again, weaker this time. "Leonard... promise me you won't call Nathan."

With a heavy sigh, Leonard relented. "Fine. Rest now. That's an order."

"Thank you," Evelyn whispered before closing her eyes. "You should rest too. The medicine... will work soon."

After repeated reassurances, Leonard and Margaret finally left the room. Alone at last, Evelyn sank into the pillows, her body wracked with chills, until exhaustion claimed her.

By eight the next morning, her fever finally broke. The news made Leonard sag with relief against the hallway wall.

"Thank God," he murmured, rubbing his tired eyes.

Just then, the front door slammed open. Nathan strode in, his clothes wrinkled from a sleepless night.

Leonard's face darkened instantly. Snatching a porcelain cup from the side table, he hurled it at Nathan's feet where it shattered violently.

Nathan froze. Leonard's veins bulged as he roared, "Get over here now!"

Nathan, sporting dark circles and bloodshot eyes, wasn't surprised by the outburst. Steeling himself, he approached his father and stepmother.

Leonard's laugh was bitter. "Oh, so you remember where home is? Since you're so devoted to Serena, why bother coming back at all? Maybe you should just move in with her permanently!"

###Chapter 369

Nathan's voice was strained as he explained, "Serena was taken hostage yesterday by an old business enemy of mine. I had to act immediately."

Despite his explanation, Leonard's expression remained icy. He glared at Nathan with piercing eyes. "So you abandoned Evelyn by the poolside? Were you aware she can't swim? Because of your negligence, she fell in and nearly drowned!"

Leonard's tone grew increasingly cutting with each word.

"What?" Nathan's face paled instantly.

Leonard let out a bitter laugh. "You dare ask? If not for a maid hearing Evelyn's desperate screams and rescuing her, you'd be identifying her body right now!"

The memory still shook Leonard. Yesterday's incident had been terrifyingly close to tragedy. Most staff had been in the main house, too far to hear the splashing. That single maid's timely intervention had prevented disaster.

Nathan's hands trembled visibly.

The word "body" struck him like a physical blow. The thought of losing Evelyn made his chest constrict painfully.

Leonard continued sharply, "And where were you when Evelyn burned with fever all night? Still absent!"

Dark shadows crossed Nathan's face. His eyes burned with anguish as he demanded, "Why didn't anyone call me?"

Margaret watched the exchange silently from the doorway.

Leonard scoffed derisively. "Why bother? You were clearly preoccupied with Serena's drama. Perhaps you should focus solely on her from now on!"

Nathan turned abruptly and stormed upstairs without another word.

Margaret approached Leonard cautiously. "I believe Nathan still cares deeply for Evelyn."

"Do you think Evelyn would value such conditional concern?" Leonard replied evenly.

Margaret pressed her lips together, choosing silence. The truth was evident - yesterday's events had shattered Evelyn's trust completely.

Entering the bedroom, Nathan found Evelyn still asleep. He moved soundlessly to the bedside.

Her cheeks glowed unnaturally pink, damp tendrils of hair clinging to her sweat-beaded forehead. The sight of her fragility twisted his gut with guilt.

Gently, he blotted her forehead with a tissue before settling into the bedside chair, keeping vigil.

Two hours later, Evelyn's eyelids fluttered open.

Her gaze landed immediately on Nathan's seated figure.

Her expression remained utterly blank, dark eyes devoid of recognition, as if staring at a stranger.

"You're awake," Nathan murmured.

Evelyn offered no reply. She pushed herself upright with visible effort.

###Chapter 370

Nathan rose swiftly to help her, but Evelyn brushed his hand aside without hesitation. She propped herself up against the headboard, deliberately avoiding his gaze the entire time.

His hand hovered awkwardly in the air before dropping to his side.

Evelyn reached for the glass of water on the nightstand, drinking thirstily until it was empty.

Nathan studied her carefully, his lips parting as he began, "About yesterday—I—"

She cut him off sharply. "Mr. Black, don't bother apologizing. You did nothing wrong from your perspective."

Her voice was disturbingly calm, as if discussing someone else's affairs. The detachment made Nathan's stomach twist uncomfortably.

After speaking, Evelyn lay back down and turned away from him, her tone turning icy. "I'm going back to sleep. You can leave now, Mr. Black."

Nathan stared at her rigid back, the weight of her dismissal pressing down on him. His jaw tightened as shadows crossed his face. That invisible wall between them had never felt taller.

After a long pause, he turned and left. Only when the door clicked shut did Evelyn reopen her eyes. Tears welled up, her nose burning with suppressed emotion. She didn't understand why this hurt so much. Not when she'd nearly drowned yesterday, nor during the feverish night wracked with pain—yet seeing Nathan sitting vigil by her bed had unleashed this unbearable ache. She'd wanted to sob openly then, but refused to give him that satisfaction.

Her tears weren't for someone who cared so little. So she'd swallowed them down, perfected her mask of indifference. Now they fell silently, soaking into the pillow. She told herself this was just residual shock from yesterday's trauma. It had nothing to do with Nathan. Nothing at all.

The door creaked open unexpectedly. Evelyn hastily wiped her face and steadied her breathing just as Nathan's rough whisper reached her: "Eat something first. Then take your medicine. You can sleep after."

She stiffened, not expecting his return. After a beat, she sat up obediently.

Her stomach growled as she accepted the tray, eating mechanically under his watchful gaze. Nathan continued speaking, undeterred by her silence. "Yesterday, Serena was kidnapped by a business rival targeting me. They intended to assault her. My team intervened just in time. While physically unharmed, the psychological damage..." His voice thickened. "She was targeted because of me. I couldn't abandon her in that state."

Evelyn's expression remained neutral, but turmoil churned beneath. So Serena's ordeal traced back to Nathan. The revelation only tangled their complicated dynamic further. A bitter laugh bubbled inside her—how tragically ironic.

Meeting his eyes, she gave a curt nod. "Thank you for explaining, Mr. Black. Since I'm eating now, you may go."

Her detached tone made Nathan frown. He mistook her calm for lingering anger, but the truth was far worse—Evelyn wasn't angry. She was profoundly disappointed. In him. In herself. In whatever fragile connection they'd almost built.

###Chapter 371

Nathan exhaled quietly through his nose. "Remember to take your medication," he instructed before pivoting on his heel and striding out without another glance.

Evelyn didn't watch him leave. She mechanically finished her meal, though the supposedly comforting flavors registered as nothing more than ash on her tongue.

After swallowing the last bite, she took her pills with practiced efficiency. The clammy discomfort clinging to her skin demanded attention. A shower became imperative. Though her limbs trembled with residual weakness, she forced herself through the motions.

Emerging from the steam-filled bathroom, she moved with deliberate caution, gripping the doorframe for balance. At the vanity, she lifted the hair dryer only to abandon it immediately - even that lightweight object felt like an impossible burden now.

Just as she resigned herself to air-drying, the door swung open.

Nathan's stormy expression darkened further at the sight of her dripping hair. "Are you trying to relapse?" he snapped, voice sharp as shattered glass. "Or have you forgotten last week's fever?"

Evelyn met his gaze in the mirror, her eyes calm but distant. Without waiting for response, Nathan snatched up the dryer. "I'll do it," he declared in a tone that brooked no argument.

She flinched instinctively when he approached, but his hand anchored firmly on her shoulder. "Stay still." Though her lashes flickered, she offered no resistance. Exhaustion had sanded down all her sharp edges.

Nathan worked with unexpected gentleness despite his thunderous expression. His inexperience showed - several times the brush caught painfully in her tangles. Evelyn remained statue-still, as if the discomfort couldn't penetrate her numbness.

Watching her reflection, Nathan's chest constricted. He'd prefer her fury, her tears - anything but this glacial detachment. She'd retreated behind walls he couldn't breach.

When the last strand dried, he set the dryer down with unnecessary force and exited without ceremony. Evelyn sat motionless for three full minutes before returning to bed, where sleep continued to elude her.

That afternoon, Leonard's arrival broke the suffocating silence. "Evelyn, you're still pale," he fretted, brow creased with concern.

A ghost of a smile touched her lips. "I'm recovering, Leonard. Really."

"Good, good." He patted her hand absently, the conversation lapsing into quiet.

After dinner, Evelyn caught his sleeve. "Walk with me in the garden?"

Recognizing her unspoken request for privacy, Leonard nodded. He exchanged a glance with Margaret, who discreetly remained behind.

Their footsteps crunched along the gravel path in companionable silence until Leonard finally prompted, "What troubles you?"

Evelyn took a steadying breath. "Tomorrow's your birthday gala. I'll attend as a family friend of the Grants."

Leonard stiffened as if struck. "Absolutely not!" he spluttered. "You're Nathan's wife - my daughter-in-law! This is precisely the occasion to make that clear to everyone!"

His plans to formally present her as part of their family crumbled beneath her quiet declaration. The mere suggestion of her attending as anything less than family was untenable.

###Chapter 372

"Leonard, please listen to me," Evelyn pleaded softly.

A faint smile played at the corners of her lips before she continued, "After your birthday, Nathan and I are planning to divorce. So, there's no need to announce at your banquet that I'm your daughter-in-law. Revealing it one day and filing for divorce the next would only bring humiliation. It's better to stay silent. Let Nathan's wife remain a mystery—perhaps that's for the best."

Evelyn kept her expression composed, but inside, her emotions churned violently. Every word she spoke felt like a blade twisting in her chest.

Leonard's face darkened as he listened. He realized she was right. He had promised—if Evelyn and Nathan still wanted a divorce after his birthday, he wouldn’t interfere. Her words now made it clear she had made up her mind.

Had recent events pushed her to this decision?

Leonard clenched his jaw, his voice low. "Evelyn, I know Nathan went too far yesterday. No matter his reasons, abandoning you like that was inexcusable. But… I can’t help feeling it would be a mistake if you two actually divorced."

He met her gaze earnestly. "After all this time, you must have noticed the changes in him. He’s slowly opening up to you. If you give up now, won’t you regret it later?"

Evelyn stayed silent for a beat before letting out a bitter laugh. "Opening up to me? Does that even matter? The second Serena calls, he leaves without hesitation. When it comes to her, his choice is always clear."

Her words left Leonard speechless. For a moment, he struggled to respond. Then, as if struck by sudden realization, he turned to her.

"Evelyn, there's something I haven’t told you. I made a bet with Nathan. The agreement was that if, after this month and my birthday, you both still chose to divorce, I wouldn’t stop you. And… I’d never interfere in his marriage again. But there was one condition—during this time, he had to follow my directions."

Evelyn froze, stunned. Suddenly, so many of her past confusions made sense. No wonder Nathan had never resisted Leonard’s requests—whether it was dinners with her, picking her up, or accompanying her to visit the Sterlings. He had complied without protest.

It was all because of that damn bet.

The realization sent another wave of crushing disappointment through her. She had foolishly hoped, even for a second, that Nathan did these things because he cared—even just a little.

Since Leonard had forced Nathan and Serena apart, Nathan had been rebellious, often defying his father. So when Nathan said things like, "My father asked me to," Evelyn had wondered if he was just using Leonard as an excuse. She believed if Nathan truly didn’t want to comply, Leonard couldn’t force him.

But she never imagined… it was all because of the bet.

How naive she had been.

Just then, Leonard spoke again. "I’m terrible at matchmaking. Aside from forcing you two together, I honestly didn’t know what else to do. I thought my plan was working, but then the mouse incident happened—you had nightmares all night because of it—and I regretted everything." His voice was heavy with resignation.

After that, he had decided to let things unfold naturally. He had started to sense that Nathan’s feelings for Evelyn weren’t entirely indifferent. But that wasn’t his main point.

"Evelyn," he urged, "please think carefully. If you do divorce, according to our agreement, I won’t interfere in Nathan’s marriage anymore. Even if—"

###Chapter 373

Leonard halted mid-step, his piercing gaze locking onto Evelyn. His voice deepened with conviction. "Even if Nathan chooses to wed Serena... I won't interfere. Do you grasp what that means?"

In truth, this was Leonard's calculated move - a psychological ploy designed to shake Evelyn's resolve.

He hoped the stark possibility would make her reconsider the divorce and fight for her marriage to Nathan.

Evelyn's face paled at his words. She'd been prepared to declare, "Yes, I'm certain." But suddenly, her throat constricted, the words dying before they could form. Observing her hesitation, Leonard knew his gambit had struck true. Pressing his lips together briefly, he continued, "About attending my birthday tomorrow as a Caldwell family friend - I consent. Since you wish to keep your identity concealed for now, I'll honor that secrecy."

Evelyn exhaled shakily, shoulders relaxing slightly. She offered Leonard a grateful nod. "Thank you, Leonard."

Leonard sighed heavily. "Let's just walk together for now."

"Alright," Evelyn murmured.

Meanwhile, in the VIP suite of Grand Ins Medical Center, Serena clutched her phone while Dylan stood sentry at the door.

"Finally answering?" she snapped as the call connected, her voice trembling with barely contained rage. "What incompetent fools did you hire? You guaranteed my safety! Then explain why those animals stripped me naked!"

The memory made her skin crawl. She'd forced herself to endure their revolting touches, playing the terrified victim perfectly. Every lingering trace of their filthy hands still haunted her.

A soft chuckle came through the receiver. "Isn't the effect precisely what you wanted? Now Nathan will drown in guilt. You can play the traumatized woman who only trusts him. Two birds with one stone, no?"

Serena's retort died in her throat. The bastard was right - the plan was working exactly as intended. But...

"But having those pigs violate me? How will Nathan see me now that others have... seen everything?" Her voice cracked with barely suppressed hysteria.

The voice turned dismissive. "He won't care. He'll only hate himself more for putting you through this. A man who loves you suffers when you suffer. A man who doesn't... well, nothing you endure would move him anyway."

Serena bit her lip until she tasted blood. The logic was infuriatingly sound. After a tense pause, she whispered, "And Dominic? There's no trail leading back to him?"

"None," came the immediate assurance. "Just remember - in this kidnapping drama, he's the mastermind."

###Chapter 374

"Fine." Serena exhaled sharply as the weight of anxiety lifted from her shoulders. The voice on the other end had that effect - equal parts terrifying and reassuring.

"Ten tonight. Our usual place," the caller commanded abruptly.

Serena's grip tightened around her phone. Her lips pressed into a thin line. "After everything I've suffered, you still—"

"Enough!" The sharp interruption made her flinch. "Drop the act, Serena. Cooperate or face the consequences. You know my temper. Don't be late." The line went dead with a final click.

Her teeth sank into her lower lip hard enough to draw blood. The metallic taste grounded her. A knock at the door startled her - she'd forgotten Dylan was still waiting outside.

"Come in," she called, hastily composing herself.

Dylan entered, closing the hospital door softly behind him. His observant gaze immediately caught her pallor. "Serena? What's wrong?" Concern laced his voice as he stepped closer.

"Nothing," she lied smoothly. "Just... worried Nathan might hate me after this."

Dylan chuckled, shaking his head. "Impossible. Nathan doesn't abandon people he cares about." He leaned against the windowsill. "Why would he start with you?"

Serena looked down, fingers twisting the hospital blanket. "His reaction today... it didn't feel like concern." The words tasted bitter.

Dylan hesitated. Privately, he shared her doubts, but his role demanded reassurance. "You're overthinking. This opportunity won't come again - we must seize it." He changed tactics smoothly. "Tomorrow's banquet preparations?"

"Ready." Serena's eyes flashed with determination. "Everything's arranged. The show will go perfectly."

"Excellent." Dylan's smile didn't reach his eyes.

The clock ticked past ten. Nathan still hadn't returned.

Evelyn tossed restlessly in the oversized bed, the silence pressing down like a physical weight. Each passing minute stretched longer than the last.

Finally, she grabbed her phone. Olivia answered on the second ring.

"Evelyn? It's nearly midnight." Olivia's voice held equal parts sleep and concern.

"I can't sleep." Evelyn's admission came out smaller than intended.

A knowing pause. "Thinking about tomorrow? About... Nathan?"

Evelyn sighed heavily. Tomorrow was Leonard's birthday celebration. And afterward, as planned, she and Nathan would finalize their divorce.

The thought lodged in her throat like a stone.

###Chapter 375

"Yes," Evelyn replied, her fingers tightening around the phone. "Olivia, I just discovered something shocking today—a wager between Leonard and Nathan."

Her voice quivered as she revealed the unsettling details, each word tasting bitter on her tongue.

Olivia grasped the core of Evelyn's distress immediately. "You're afraid that once the divorce is finalized, Nathan will marry Serena without hesitation, aren't you?" she probed gently.

Evelyn's lashes fluttered downward, her teeth sinking into her lower lip.

After a weighted pause, she confessed in a hushed tone, "I know he'll be with Serena after we're divorced, but... The idea of them exchanging vows right after our papers are signed... It makes my stomach twist."

Olivia's response was tender yet firm. "Evelyn darling, you're missing the crucial point here. This isn't about Nathan and Serena's future plans."

The real question is whether you truly want this divorce at all.

If you proceed, Nathan's life becomes none of your concern."

She continued after a deliberate beat, "Let me ask you this: when you're with Nathan, does he bring you more happiness or more heartache? Answer that, and you'll know what to do."

Evelyn's breath caught—the simplicity of the question striking like lightning.

Suddenly, the fog in her mind began to clear.

Silence stretched between them.

Then, a slow exhale. "I think... I understand now. Thank you," she murmured.

Olivia's voice softened like velvet. "Don't let others dictate your path. Listen to your heart."

"I will," Evelyn affirmed, resolve crystallizing in her chest. "It's late, Olivia. I should let you rest. Goodnight."

"Sweet dreams," Olivia replied.

As the call ended, Evelyn placed her phone aside and sank into the pillows.

For the first time in months, the weight on her shoulders lightened.

The tangled threads of her thoughts unraveled, revealing a clear path forward.

Even the air in the room felt easier to breathe.

Nathan never came to bed that night, choosing instead to brood in his study.

With Leonard's birthday gala looming tomorrow, he had his own demons to wrestle.

Morning found Evelyn calling in sick, her body still recovering from yesterday's emotional storm.

She spent the golden hours at the Grant estate with Leonard and Margaret, finding solace in their quiet company.

By afternoon, Ethan arrived to escort her home.

As dusk fell, the Grant mansion transformed into a glittering spectacle, drawing the city's elite like moths to flame.

Leonard's rare public appearance—a coveted invitation indeed, given his reclusive nature in recent years.

###Chapter 376

The grand ballroom glittered with chandeliers as the elite of high society gathered for Leonard Grant's birthday celebration. Every invited guest arrived punctually, many accompanied by their families in elegant ensembles.

Whispers floated through the air like delicate champagne bubbles as clusters of guests exchanged hushed conversations.

"Isn't tonight when we finally meet Nathan Black's mysterious wife?" a socialite murmured behind her fan.

"Undoubtedly! At an event this important, Mr. Black's wife simply must appear!"

"How peculiar," another guest remarked. "Mr. Black has been married for months, yet his wife remains an enigma."

"I heard she's not only plain-looking but quite...substantial in figure!"

"That can't be true! Why would someone like Nathan Black marry beneath him? What possible advantage could there be?"

Evelyn Hartley caught snippets of these conversations as she glided through the crowd, her lips curving into a knowing smile.

They were eager to see Nathan's wife? How amusingly predictable.

"Natalie Brooks approached with raised eyebrows. "Evelyn, you're attending with Ethan Caldwell?"

Evelyn shrugged one bare shoulder, the movement causing the sapphire silk of her gown to shimmer. "Is that so surprising?"

Natalie hesitated, glancing around before lowering her voice. "It's just...given the circumstances..."

Evelyn's laugh tinkled like crystal. "Darling, I always choose my companions carefully."

And indeed, Evelyn was a vision in her sapphire blue off-the-shoulder gown that hugged her curves perfectly. Her makeup was flawless - smoky eyes that smoldered, lips painted the exact shade of ripe cherries.

"You look..." Natalie began.

"Radiant? Breathtaking? I know," Evelyn finished with a playful wink.

Natalie rolled her eyes but couldn't suppress a smile. Leaning closer, she whispered, "Serena Cole and Lila Sinclair actually showed up. The audacity!"

Evelyn's long lashes fluttered. "It's Leonard's birthday. They wouldn't dare miss such an important event."

As Evelyn scanned the room, her gaze unexpectedly locked with Nathan's across the crowded ballroom. The air between them crackled with unspoken tension.

She was the first to look away.

Theodore Whitmore, observing the exchange, murmured to Nathan, "Evelyn attending with Ethan at an event like this? What message is she sending? This is your father's birthday - a family occasion. By not appearing as your wife, is she publicly rejecting her position?"

Nathan's jaw tightened, his darkening expression the only response.

###Chapter 377

After a brief silence, Theodore leaned in closer, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "Do you think she's planning to leave you after Leonard's birthday celebration? That would explain why she's still keeping your marriage a secret."

Nathan's entire body tensed, his knuckles turning white around his champagne flute.

Theodore's words cut deeper than he cared to admit.

Yet the painful truth remained - his theory made perfect sense.

Drawing a steadying breath, Nathan forced his features into practiced indifference. "Isn't that ideal? It's exactly what I've wanted all along."

Theodore arched an eyebrow, studying Nathan's carefully constructed mask. "Are you certain that's truly what you want?"

A muscle twitched in Nathan's jaw before he ground out, "Absolutely."

Theodore's lips curled into a knowing smirk. "Nathan, if you can't bear to let her go, stop this ridiculous charade. Show Evelyn some vulnerability for once. I guarantee it would make her reconsider this divorce nonsense."

His gaze drifted across the ballroom where Evelyn stood conversing with Ethan.

Ethan said something that made Evelyn laugh, then reached out to affectionately tweak her nose.

Though the intimate gesture would have infuriated Nathan under normal circumstances, Evelyn merely rolled her eyes in mock exasperation, making no move to pull away.

Theodore nudged Nathan's shoulder. "You realize if you let her slip away now, you'll regret it forever. The entire social circuit is buzzing about Evelyn and Ethan. Rumor has it he treats her like a queen. And since neither of them are attached..." He let the implication hang in the air. "You might want to reconsider your stance."

Nathan watched as Ethan whispered something in Evelyn's ear that made her throw her head back in genuine laughter.

Ice flooded his veins, followed by a surge of possessive fury.

He forced a derisive scoff. "Why would I care who she chooses? It's no concern of mine."

Nathan tried to convince himself this was true.

The anger coiling in his gut was merely residual guilt - guilt over nearly letting her drown that day at the pool.

Her eagerness to dissolve their marriage should be cause for celebration. So why did the thought make his chest constrict painfully?

Theodore studied Nathan's stormy expression as he glared at Evelyn, recognizing the lie for what it was.

Shaking his head, Theodore decided to drop the subject.

Nathan was being stubbornly blind. He'd realize his mistake when it was too late.

###Chapter 378

Nathan had to resolve this matter alone—no one else could shoulder this burden for him.

With a knowing smile, Theodore gave Nathan's shoulder another reassuring pat. "I'm glad you're seeing things clearly now! Congratulations on reclaiming your freedom! After the divorce papers are signed, you owe us all a celebratory dinner. We'll make it a night to remember."

Each word Theodore spoke made Nathan's fist tighten in his pocket.

Every syllable grated on his nerves like sandpaper.

He grabbed his wine glass and drained it in one swift motion.

As the gala officially began, the grand hall fell into hushed anticipation, all eyes turning toward Leonard and Margaret as they took the stage.

After delivering brief welcoming remarks, they gracefully descended.

Immediately, a swarm of well-wishers surrounded them, voices buzzing with flattery and thinly veiled agendas.

Meanwhile, among the more gossip-inclined guests, whispers began to circulate like wildfire.

"Have you noticed? Nathan hasn't been accompanied by a woman all evening. Where's his wife?"

"Could it be that even for such an important family event, Leonard's daughter-in-law still refuses to show her face?"

"It's utterly baffling! Nathan's wife remains a complete enigma."

"At this point, it's beyond mysterious—it's as if she doesn't exist at all."

"Precisely! Her absence speaks volumes about how little regard the Grant family must have for her."

"Or perhaps they're ashamed to present her in polite society!"

The murmurs weren't confined to curious onlookers—the elite socialites eagerly joined the speculation.

Particularly Beatrice, who never missed an opportunity to one-up Olivia.

"Tell me, Mrs. Sinclair, why is your precious Evelyn attending as merely your and Marcus's acquaintance?"

Beatrice's pointed barb instantly drew the attention of nearby socialites.

Their eyes darted between each other, expressions alight with scandalized curiosity.

"Yes, why would Evelyn Hartley attend as just another guest at Leonard's birthday gala?" another voice chimed in, fanning the flames.

Olivia remained composed, her voice cool. "Evelyn has her reasons."

Beatrice arched a perfectly sculpted eyebrow, her tone dripping with faux concern. "Oh? So you're claiming it was entirely Evelyn's decision to attend as someone other than Nathan's wife? The Sinclair family had no hand in this arrangement?"

Meeting Beatrice's gaze steadily, Olivia replied, "That's exactly what I'm saying. Is there a problem with that?"

Beatrice gave an exaggerated shrug. "If you insist that's the truth, then so be it. I merely asked a question."

She paused dramatically before adding, "By the way, Mrs. Sinclair, have you heard the latest about Nathan and his ex? As an outsider, even I find his behavior shocking! A married man sneaking around with his former lover? Midnight rendezvous are bad enough, but public displays of affection? Absolutely scandalous!"

Olivia's expression darkened, her eyes sharpening like daggers as they locked onto Beatrice.

###Chapter 379

The elite crowd around them held their collective breath.

Evelyn's sharp words had clearly struck a nerve with Olivia Sinclair.

A smirk played on Evelyn's lips as she took in Olivia's thunderous expression.

Seeing the usually composed socialite rattled gave her immense satisfaction.

After all, what did it matter if Olivia was close friends with Mr. Black's wife? A wife who received neither respect nor affection might as well be invisible.

Just as Evelyn prepared to deliver another verbal blow, Olivia finally spoke. "Before concerning yourself with others' affairs, perhaps you should tend to your own household. Rumor has it your son was recently caught in a rather... compromising position with two escorts. How much did that scandal cost you to bury?"

Evelyn's triumphant expression shattered like glass.

Before she could formulate a response, Olivia continued, her voice dripping with honeyed venom. "And isn't your daughter-in-law nearing her due date? How utterly shameful that your son chooses this moment to disgrace your family name. Were I her mother, I'd have that worthless boy of yours beaten within an inch of his life."

Evelyn's face flushed crimson with rage and humiliation.

Her lips trembled, but no words emerged.

Olivia's arrows had found their mark, and everyone present knew the truth behind her accusations.

The incident she referenced had already become society's worst-kept secret.

The assembled guests exchanged nervous glances, their throats tight with tension.

Compared to Evelyn's petty remarks, Olivia's counterattack had been nothing short of devastating.

Without awaiting a reply, Olivia turned on her heel and strode away, her posture radiating icy dignity.

Evelyn stood frozen, her jaw clenched so tightly her teeth threatened to crack.

Meanwhile, across the glittering ballroom, Alexander Prescott approached Nathan Black.

With Theodore momentarily absent, the two men stood alone.

"Nathan," Alexander began, his voice low but carrying an edge. "Have you given any thought to your situation with Evelyn?"

Nathan's brow furrowed instantly.

He turned sharply toward Alexander, his voice barely above a whisper. "What exactly are you implying?"

Alexander's lips curved into a knowing smile. "If you're still determined to divorce Evelyn, I might consider expressing my own feelings toward her. So I'm asking... what are your thoughts on that?"

Nathan inhaled sharply. "Why not ask Evelyn directly?"

Alexander remained unflappable. "I'm asking you first. Is there a problem, Nathan? Having second thoughts about letting her go? Could it be you've developed feelings for your own wife?"

At this, Nathan stiffened visibly. "I feel nothing for her! The divorce will proceed as planned!" he declared, his voice ringing with finality.

###Chapter 380

Nathan stood frozen, his jaw clenched as shadows danced across his stormy expression.

Alexander's words still echoed in the silent garden. "I'm going to confess to Evelyn tonight. I can't wait any longer."

The declaration had been delivered with such conviction that it left no room for doubt. Nathan's fingers twitched at his sides, his usually composed demeanor cracking under the weight of unfamiliar emotions.

Why did this feel like a betrayal?

Evelyn's laughter floated through the night air, mingling with Alexander's deeper tones. Nathan watched from the shadows as they disappeared down the rose-lined path, their silhouettes merging in the moonlight.

His pulse roared in his ears.

Every instinct screamed at him to follow, to interrupt whatever moment was unfolding between them. But before he could move—

"Nathan!" Leonard's voice cut through the night. "The investors are asking for you."

Nathan turned sharply, his gaze flickering between his father and the direction Evelyn had gone. "Not now."

Leonard's grip tightened on his arm. "This is important. The Tokyo deal—"

"Handle it yourself." Nathan shook off the restraining hand, already moving toward the garden.

But when he finally broke free and reached the secluded grove, the scene before him stopped him dead.

Alexander stood close—too close—his hands resting on Evelyn's shoulders. The moonlight caught the uncertainty in Evelyn's eyes as she bit her lip.

"Just give me an answer," Alexander pressed, his voice carrying clearly in the quiet night. "Yes or no?"

Nathan's vision tunneled. The champagne flute in his hand shattered, drawing their attention.

Three pairs of eyes locked in the moonlit garden.

The air crackled with unspoken tension.

###Chapter 381

A chilling, dangerous energy radiated from him now.

Nathan froze in shock.

Had Alexander really confessed his feelings to Evelyn so soon?

And Evelyn...

She hadn't rejected him outright.

Instead, she'd asked for time to consider? Unbelievable!

What was there to consider?

Did Evelyn actually want to be with Alexander?

At that moment, Nathan clearly heard Evelyn's sweet, musical voice say, "Alright, alright! I accept. Happy now?"

Nathan was speechless.

The words struck him like a thunderbolt, leaving him stunned and breathless.

He stared at Evelyn in shock, dark flames of anger flickering in his obsidian eyes.

His hands clenched into fists at his sides, veins pulsing at his temples.

Evelyn had actually agreed to be with Alexander?

How could she?

Did she truly have feelings for Alexander now?

"You've promised! No take-backs!" Alexander's voice, thick with excitement, reached Nathan's ears.

Nathan's gaze remained locked on Evelyn.

He watched as she sighed and curved her lips into a resigned smile. "Don't worry! I always keep my word!"

Alexander's face immediately broke into a radiant grin, clearly overjoyed.

"Come on, let's go inside."

Evelyn playfully pushed his hand away and turned toward the mansion.

"Wait for me," Alexander called, rushing to catch up with her.

Only when their figures disappeared through the doors did Nathan step from the shadows.

His face was contorted with barely contained fury.

Words failed him, unable to express the storm raging inside.

He stared blankly at the spot where Evelyn and Alexander had stood, a flash of pain and panic crossing his dark eyes—emotions he didn't even recognize in himself.

Only one thought screamed through his mind—Evelyn had agreed to be with Alexander!

It had really happened right before his eyes.

The realization ignited a wildfire of rage in Nathan's chest.

Fine! Have it your way!

###Chapter 382

After all, he and Evelyn were going to divorce soon. Whom Evelyn chose to be with was entirely her decision! It had nothing to do with him!

Nathan convinced himself that his anger was merely because Evelyn was still technically his wife at this moment.

That was all.

There couldn't possibly be any other reason!

After leaving the garden terrace, Evelyn seized the opportunity to slip unnoticed into the elevator, heading straight to the second floor.

The earrings she wore today were irritating her skin, so she needed to change them in her room.

As she stepped out, her gaze lifted and she saw Serena standing just a few feet away from her door.

Her brows furrowed slightly as she asked coldly, "What are you doing here?"

From Serena's posture, it was obvious she had been waiting for Evelyn.

Serena replied without hesitation, "Evelyn, we need to talk."

Evelyn crossed her arms. "Say what you want to say."

Serena straightened, her expression turning serious. "As agreed, once Leonard's birthday celebration is over, you and Nathan should proceed with the divorce immediately. I expect you to keep your word and not come up with any excuses to delay it," she said pointedly.

Hearing this, Evelyn let out a soft, mocking laugh. "That's none of your concern, Miss Cole."

Seeing Evelyn dismiss her so casually, Serena felt anger bubbling up inside her.

"Evelyn!" Her voice rose sharply, laced with frustration. "Do you honestly believe Nathan hasn't divorced you yet because he still has feelings for you? You're delusional! It's only because of his bet with Leonard! Nathan only agreed to this marriage arrangement to ensure there would be no obstacles when he marries me!"

Then, Serena gave a cold, mocking laugh. "So don't get any foolish ideas!"

In truth, Serena had only learned this by accident.

During a dinner with Dylan and Theodore, Vincent had gotten drunk and let it slip.

That was how Serena discovered the truth.

Evelyn's expression darkened instantly.

So Serena knew about it too!

It seemed she had been the only one kept completely in the dark.

All this time, she had thought Nathan's cooperation meant he cared about her, even just a little.

How ridiculous she had been!

Noticing the change in Evelyn's expression, Serena allowed herself a small, satisfied smile.

"Did you know Nathan stayed by my side all night at the hospital?" she said casually, her tone deliberately light. "You've heard about my kidnapping, haven't you? I almost died..."

###Chapter 383

Evelyn took a sharp inhale, steadying herself before continuing. "Even after seeing my scars, Nathan never flinched. He comforted me instead, telling me to focus on our future together. We're getting married soon. So Evelyn, honor your word. Sign the divorce papers tomorrow. Stop clinging to a man who doesn't want you."

Natalie's expression turned glacial, her lips curling into a mocking smile. "What happens between Nathan and me is none of your business, Miss Cole. His promises to you mean nothing to me. The divorce is my decision alone, and I owe you no explanations."

With a cold chuckle, she added, "For now, he remains my husband. So I suggest you stay away. My temper is notorious, and if I decide to teach you a lesson, don't say I didn't warn you."

Without waiting for a reply, Natalie strode past Serena, her heels clicking sharply against the marble floor.

Fury clouding her judgment, Natalie bypassed the elevators and headed straight for the emergency stairwell.

Just as she reached the landing, Serena came rushing up behind her, fingers digging into her forearm.

They stood dangerously close to the edge now.

Serena's face flushed with rage. "Natalie!" she spat. "Have you no shame? You've stolen my fiancé for years! I'm the one who should be Mrs. Black! He despises you—can't even stand to look at you. How long will you keep humiliating yourself?"

"Your fiancé?" Natalie repeated with an icy laugh.

Her gaze turned arctic. "When Nathan married me, your relationship had already ended. Are you suggesting men should marry every woman they've dated? How pathetic!"

She glanced pointedly at Serena's grip on her arm. "Release me," she commanded.

"Not until you promise to divorce him today!" Serena shrieked, tightening her hold.

Exhausted by the confrontation, Natalie wrenched her arm free and turned to leave.

But before she could take a single step—

Serena suddenly threw herself backward with dramatic flair.

Time seemed to freeze as Serena tumbled down the staircase, her shrill scream reverberating through the concrete shaft.

Natalie lunged forward instinctively, but her fingers only grazed empty air.

The sickening thuds of Serena's body hitting each step echoed upwards before culminating in a final, ominous crash.

The commotion immediately drew the attention of the gala attendees below.

A crowd began surging toward the stairwell in alarm.

"Oh god!"

"Did someone just fall from the second floor?"

"Serena!" Dylan's voice rang out as he pushed through the gathering crowd.

###Chapter 384

Nathan's hand hovered in the air, his movement abruptly stopping as if an invisible barrier had appeared between them.

A shadow of doubt flickered across his features before he withdrew completely, his fingers curling into a tight fist at his side.

Then Alexander Prescott arrived.

He moved with swift purpose, kneeling beside Evelyn Hartley with urgent concern.

Evelyn's porcelain skin glistened with perspiration, a crimson trail winding down her temple from the gash above her eyebrow.

The sight was nothing short of horrifying.

Her limbs bore the evidence of violent impact - angry purple bruises blooming across her delicate skin.

Dylan Reeves turned ashen, his breath coming in shallow gasps.

"Evelyn! What the hell happened?" His voice cracked with barely contained panic.

Nathan's jaw tightened visibly.

"It hurts... I can't..." Evelyn's words dissolved into broken sobs, tears carving paths through the blood on her cheeks.

With visible effort, she lifted her gaze toward Serena Cole descending the staircase.

Between shuddering breaths, Evelyn whispered, "Ms. Hartley... why would you push me?"

The accusation landed like a detonation.

An electric silence gripped the room, every occupant frozen in shock.

All eyes swiveled toward Serena, expressions cycling through disbelief to dawning horror.

"Serena would never do something like that! Those stairs could have killed someone!"

"Look at Evelyn's injuries - this was no accident!"

"What possible reason could Serena have to be so cruel?"

Nathan's head snapped up, his stormy eyes locking onto Serena.

For a fleeting moment, her delicate features triggered a memory - Serena and Alexander standing close in the garden that afternoon.

His expression darkened, something dangerous flashing in his gaze.

"That's a lie!" Serena's voice cut through the murmurs, steady and clear.

She enunciated each word with precision. "She fell on her own."

The moment Evelyn had tumbled down those steps, Serena had recognized the setup.

She knew with absolute certainty her touch hadn't been forceful enough to cause that fall.

This had been carefully orchestrated.

Those provoking words earlier - all calculated to make her react.

Evelyn's eyes widened dramatically, her trembling lips parting in feigned shock.

"How... how could you say that, Ms. Hartley?"

"I saw everything!" A timid voice piped up from the crowd.

###Chapter 385


All eyes snapped toward the trembling maid hovering near the second-floor staircase. "I-I witnessed Miss Hartley shove Miss Cole!" she stammered, wringing her hands.

"Preposterous!" Evelyn's voice cut through the murmurs like a whip.

The maid flinched, her complexion turning ashen. "I swear it's true! I saw everything!"

Evelyn didn't bother arguing further.

Her attention locked onto Nathan.

She needed to see his reaction, to gauge his belief.

But when their eyes met, her stomach twisted.

The icy fury in his gaze...

Did he actually believe Serena's accusation?

"Absolute nonsense!" A commanding voice sliced through the tension.

The crowd separated as Olivia and Ethan stepped forward, their presence radiating authority.

"Evelyn would never harm anyone," Olivia declared, her piercing stare pinning the maid. "Who put you up to this slander?"

The maid shook her head violently. "I'm telling the truth! Why would I lie?"

Without speaking, Nathan scooped Serena into his arms and turned to leave.

"Nathan!" Evelyn's voice cracked with desperation.

He paused mid-step.

"Please... you have to believe me. I didn't push her!" Her plea hung heavy in the air.

Nathan glanced back, his expression inscrutable.

The silence stretched unbearably.

Then he turned away, carrying Serena toward the exit without another word.

Evelyn's knees nearly buckled.

That cold dismissal spoke volumes - he'd chosen to believe Serena. Again.

A bitter laugh escaped her lips.

The taste of betrayal coated her tongue.

"Nathan!" Leonard's stern voice echoed through the hall.

But Nathan's footsteps never faltered.

Within moments, Nathan, Serena, and Dylan disappeared through the grand doors.

"Did she really push her?"

"Obviously! The maid saw it happen!"

###Chapter 386

"I'm just wondering—why would Evelyn push Serena? It doesn't add up!"

"Exactly. And why did Evelyn specifically call out to Nathan and try to explain things to him? What's really going on here?"

Leonard's expression darkened as he watched Nathan walk away.

His displeasure was evident.

He glanced at the pale Evelyn, took a deep breath, and approached her.

Standing before her, he gently placed a hand on her shoulder and murmured, "I believe in you, my dear."

Leonard's words sent shockwaves through the grand ballroom.

"Did you hear that? What did Leonard just call Evelyn in front of everyone? 'My dear'?"

"Oh my God! Could it be... Is Evelyn actually the mysterious wife of Mr. Black?"

Ignoring the murmurs, Evelyn gave Leonard a small nod. "Thank you, Leonard," she said softly.

At that moment, Leonard turned to address the crowd directly. "Allow me to introduce my daughter-in-law, Nathan's wife, Evelyn Hartley."

After a brief pause, he continued, "The reason Evelyn didn't attend tonight's gala as Nathan's wife is simple—she values her privacy and wished to keep her identity discreet. As her elder, I respected her decision."

This explanation clarified Evelyn's mysterious behavior.

It wasn't that the Black family was hiding her—Evelyn herself had chosen to remain under the radar.

Leonard scanned the room with a stern gaze. "Do you truly believe my daughter-in-law would push someone down the stairs? Is that the kind of woman she is?"

His words prompted immediate reactions.

"Of course not! The wife of Mr. Black would never do such a thing!"

"This must be a misunderstanding! Serena must have fabricated the whole story."

The room erupted in chatter as guests openly criticized Serena.

While many voiced support for Evelyn publicly, doubts still lingered privately.

Some couldn't shake the suspicion that Evelyn had indeed pushed Serena.

After all, Evelyn might harbor deep resentment toward Serena.

The earlier scene had made it painfully clear that Nathan still held feelings for his ex-girlfriend, Serena.

Yet no one dared voice such observations in Leonard's presence.

Later, Leonard proudly introduced Evelyn to his closest friends, beaming as he presented his accomplished daughter-in-law.

When they learned that Evelyn had already become an attending physician in Cardiac Surgery at Grand Oaks General Hospital at such a young age, Leonard's friends were astonished.

They unanimously agreed that the brilliant Evelyn was indeed the perfect match for Nathan.

###Chapter 387

The ballroom buzzed with hushed conversations as clusters of guests exchanged knowing glances. Crystal glasses clinked softly against each other while speculative whispers cut through the air like knives.

"Mr. Grant looks absolutely delighted with his daughter-in-law! Could Evelyn truly be the one hiding her identity all this time?"

"How peculiar! Weren't there rumors that Mr. Grant's wife was plain and overweight? Evelyn Hartley certainly doesn't fit that description."

"My wife Diana knows the Sterlings intimately. She told me she met Victor's illegitimate daughter years ago - back when Evelyn had a fuller figure and that distinctive birthmark on her left cheek."

"The rumors about Mr. Grant's wife were accurate, but that was three years ago. Perhaps Evelyn underwent cosmetic procedures? She's practically unrecognizable now."

"So the Sterling family's illegitimate daughter - the Thomas family's close friend - turns out to be Mr. Grant's mysterious wife!"

"Who would've imagined? And notice how Mr. Grant shows no particular favor to the Sterlings. The Thorntons, backed by the Caldwells, have benefited far more."

"It appears Mr. Grant still favors his former lover!"

"Shh! Not so loud."

Across the room, Olivia Sinclair found herself surrounded by society women hanging onto her every word.

"Olivia was right all along - Evelyn chose to conceal her identity herself. The Grants clearly adore her; just look at Leonard's pride when introducing her!"

"Absolutely! I've always said Evelyn is cherished by the Grant family."

Beatrice Waltham's expression darkened as she overheard the conversation. A bitter taste rose in her throat before she suddenly chuckled.

"Leonard might dote on Evelyn, but what does that matter? Nathan clearly can't stand her! Did you see how he carried Serena out of here earlier? That must have been humiliating for Evelyn."

An uncomfortable silence fell over the group. All eyes turned to Beatrice with disapproval. Even the most gossip-hungry socialites recognized the cruelty in her words.

Olivia's frown deepened. Nathan's public rejection of Evelyn - choosing to escort Serena instead - showed blatant disregard for his wife. And Leonard's timing couldn't be worse. Why reveal Evelyn's identity now, when divorce papers were practically signed? What would become of Evelyn's reputation after the separation?

These troubling thoughts only intensified Olivia's growing frustration.

At Grandins General Hospital's VIP ward...

Serena Cole lay motionless on the sterile white sheets, her injuries painting a grim picture. Four stitches closed the gash on her forehead. Her left forearm rested in a cast, while angry red abrasions covered her limbs. The worst was the persistent throbbing in her twisted spine that made even breathing painful.

After the medical team finished their work, Serena remained still - the picture of fragile vulnerability.

###Chapter 388

"Evelyn is utterly vicious! How could she shove Serena down those stairs? Doesn't she realize she might have killed her?" Dylan exploded, his voice trembling with barely contained rage.

Nathan stood motionless nearby, his face an unreadable mask. But his white-knuckled fists betrayed the tempest raging inside him. He'd witnessed everything—the horrifying moment Serena lost her footing, Evelyn's outstretched hand frozen in midair. The evidence was irrefutable: Evelyn had pushed her.

What made it worse was remembering Evelyn rejecting Alexander's confession of love earlier that evening. The memory only fueled Nathan's growing fury.

"Serena, how are you feeling?" Dylan's concerned voice snapped Nathan back to the present.

Serena stirred weakly, her eyelids fluttering open. A pained grimace twisted her delicate features. "It hurts... so much," she whimpered, tears glistening in her doe-like eyes.

Dylan softened his tone immediately. "The doctors have treated your injuries. Just rest now."

Nathan moved closer to the hospital bed, his shadow falling over Serena.

Leaning down, his voice came out rough and low. "Serena, what were you doing upstairs?" It was common knowledge—guests weren't permitted in the private quarters without invitation.

Serena bit her plump lower lip, guilt flashing across her face. "I saw Evelyn going up. There was something important I needed to tell her, so I followed quietly."

After a weighted pause, she added hastily, "I'm sorry, Nathan. I know I shouldn't have gone up there uninvited. That was wrong of me."

"What exactly did you discuss?" Nathan pressed, his tone turning arctic.

Serena hesitated before whispering, "I just reminded Evelyn about her promise to divorce you. That's all." Fresh tears welled up. "I never imagined she'd react like this... if I'd known, I would never have approached her." Her voice cracked with genuine remorse.

Dylan cut in angrily, "This isn't your fault! You were simply holding Evelyn accountable for her own words! Leonard himself said the divorce would proceed after his birthday celebration. Knowing Evelyn, she'd find another excuse to delay. You were being reasonable!"

He shook his head in frustration. "Serena, your kindness will be your downfall," he muttered.

Nathan's expression remained stony, his dark eyes giving nothing away. When he finally spoke, each word landed like a hammer blow.

"Serena, I've warned you before—stay out of my marriage."

The words struck Serena like a physical blow.

All color drained from her face as she stared at Nathan in stunned disbelief.

Her lips parted slightly as if to respond, but no sound emerged.

"Get some rest," Nathan said curtly, turning on his heel before she could react.

As Nathan strode toward the door, Dylan called after him, "Nathan—" But the door clicked shut with finality, cutting off any further protest.

###Chapter 389

Concern flashed across Dylan's and Serena's faces as they exchanged worried glances. Dylan hesitated for a brief moment before stepping out to check the hospital corridor. It was empty. Nathan had truly left just like that.

Returning to Serena's side, he murmured, "Nathan's gone." Serena bit her lower lip, her brow furrowed with anxiety. "Dylan, do you think... Does Nathan believe me, or is he siding with Evelyn?"

"Of course he believes you," Dylan reassured her softly. "Otherwise, he wouldn't have left the gala with you and rushed you to the hospital."

"You might be right," Serena conceded with a slight nod, her expression softening slightly. She recalled how Nathan had swept her into his arms in front of all their friends, and a flicker of joy lit up her face. She was certain of her place in Nathan's heart—she was his priority.

"But..." Dylan's voice trailed off as a thought struck him. He leaned closer to Serena, lowering his voice. "This time, you might have gone too far. How could you let yourself get hurt this badly?"

Serena's gaze hardened with determination. "Without serious injuries, how could I make Nathan feel this guilty and furious?"

"But now you're left with stitches that will scar," Dylan said resignedly.

A faint smile curled Serena's lips. "If it means Nathan divorces Evelyn and chooses me, then the scar doesn't matter. I don’t care about it at all!"

Dylan fell silent. For now, things seemed to be going their way.

???? ??d???? ?? g????????.????

At the Grant family mansion, the gala had already ended. Seated on the sofa were Leonard, Margaret, and Evelyn, with the maid who had been involved earlier standing nervously before them.

"Tell us exactly what you saw!" Leonard demanded sharply.

Too frightened to hold back, the maid spoke truthfully. "I had just finished tending to the flowers on the second-floor balcony and was about to go downstairs. But as I stepped out, I overheard Evelyn and Miss Cole arguing. I didn’t want to eavesdrop, so I went back to the balcony. When the noise stopped, I thought they’d left, so I stepped out again. And then... I saw Miss Cole falling down the stairs, and..." She hesitated, her eyes darting nervously toward Evelyn before gulping. "Evelyn’s hand was still outstretched."

Leonard’s expression darkened instantly. "Then why did you accuse Evelyn of pushing Serena? Did you actually see her do it?"

"I..." The maid faltered under the intense questioning.

"Who gave you the right to publicly accuse Evelyn when you didn’t see everything?" Leonard snapped, his face twisted in anger.

Panicked, the maid stammered, "I’m sorry! I was terrified in the moment. Seeing Evelyn’s hand extended, I... I just assumed..."

"I swear I won’t speak out of turn again!"

Leonard let out a cold laugh. "You think you’ll get another chance? Someone, settle her wages and have her removed immediately. This household doesn’t employ people like her!"

The maid’s face paled. She bowed frantically, begging for mercy. "I’m so sorry! I promise I won’t repeat this mistake. Please, give me another chance!"

She turned to Evelyn, bowing even lower. "I deeply regret my careless words about you pushing Miss Cole without knowing the full truth. It was entirely my fault! I’ll correct my mistake with every guest. Please, let me stay!"

###Chapter 390

Neither Leonard's nor Margaret's expressions flickered.

Grace stepped forward, her voice smooth as silk. "Leonard, firing her now might raise suspicions about our involvement. It could further tarnish Evelyn's reputation. Perhaps docking six months' salary would serve as sufficient warning - both to her and the other staff."

Leonard's sharp gaze met Grace's, instantly deciphering the unspoken message in her eyes. His jaw tightened momentarily before he addressed the trembling maid with icy precision. "You'll forfeit six months' wages. Consider this your final warning. Another misstep and you'll be out on the street without references."

"Understood! This will never happen again! Thank you for your mercy, Mr. and Mrs. Grant. Thank you, Miss Hartley," the maid stammered, relief washing over her features.

For someone employed at the prestigious Grant estate, losing half a year's income was devastating. Yet it was a price worth paying to keep her coveted position.

"Leave us," Leonard commanded with an impatient wave.

The maid scurried away like a frightened mouse.

As Leonard turned toward Evelyn, she rose gracefully. "Leonard, Margaret, I'm exhausted. I'll retire for the evening."

Leonard searched her face, words hovering on his lips. Finally, he simply nodded. "Of course. Rest well."

A ghost of a smile touched Evelyn's lips. "Happy birthday, Leonard."

"Thank you," he replied automatically, though the celebration had long since lost its joy. The evening's events had cast an unmistakable shadow over what should have been a joyous occasion.

Evelyn ascended the grand staircase without looking back.

The moment she disappeared, Leonard's expression darkened. He fixed Margaret with a penetrating stare. "That maid - you suspect something?"

Margaret gave a barely perceptible nod. "She's too convenient. We should monitor her discreetly."

Leonard's silence spoke volumes.

Meanwhile, in her chambers, Evelyn changed from her elegant gown into a silk robe. Settling onto the chaise lounge, she wondered if Nathan would return tonight. The click of the door opening answered her unspoken question.

Nathan stood framed in the doorway.

Their eyes locked in a charged silence, a thousand unspoken words passing between them.

Crossing the threshold, Nathan closed the door with deliberate care. His measured footsteps echoed as he approached, stopping just beyond arm's reach. His first words cut through the tension like a knife. "Why did you push Serena?"

A bitter laugh escaped Evelyn's lips, laced with self-mockery. She met his gaze head-on, countering with her own question. "So you've already convicted me based on Serena's account?"

"I saw your hand move," Nathan stated calmly, his deep voice resonating with quiet intensity.

Evelyn's voice sharpened. "And that's proof enough for you? A single gesture makes me guilty?"

###Chapter 391

Nathan remained silent.

Evelyn drew a deep breath to steady her racing heart. Her fingers trembled slightly as she spoke. "Let me make this clear—Serena threw herself down those stairs to frame me. I only reached out to catch her. Nathan, do you trust me?" Her piercing gaze searched his face for any flicker of emotion.

The air between them grew heavier with each passing second of his silence. His unreadable expression told Evelyn everything—he didn't believe her. The realization struck her like a physical blow, leaving her breathless.

Before Nathan could respond, Evelyn let out a bitter laugh. "If you've already decided I'm guilty, I won't waste my breath defending myself. What's your plan for revenge? Going to push me down the stairs too?" Her voice remained steady despite the storm inside her.

She held his gaze, unflinching, waiting for his response.

For a fleeting moment, Nathan thought he detected hurt in her words. An unfamiliar ache spread through his chest. But the memory of Evelyn smiling at Alexander's confession in the garden hardened his heart again.

Nathan found himself at a loss for words.

Even if he'd seen Evelyn push Serena, he felt no urge to demand an apology. Yet the image of her with Alexander ignited something dark within him.

Seeing his prolonged silence, Evelyn wasn't sure whether to feel relieved or devastated. A faint, sorrowful smile touched her lips before she straightened her posture. "Tomorrow at 10 AM. The courthouse. Let's finalize our divorce."

"What did you say?" Nathan's face darkened instantly. His hands clenched into fists as he stared at her, his breathing ragged. In one swift motion, he pulled Evelyn up from the sofa. "Say that again," he growled through gritted teeth.

His voice was icy enough to freeze the room.

Evelyn met his furious gaze calmly. "Remember our agreement? After Leonard's birthday, we'd end this marriage."

Nathan studied her face, trying to discern whether anger or genuine resolve drove her words.

Her steady gaze gave him the answer.

As the reality of her decision sank in, Nathan's grip on her shoulders tightened. His expression turned stormy. "Evelyn," he said slowly, "think carefully. Once we divorce, we become strangers forever."

"I've thought about nothing else. I've waited for this day too long," Evelyn replied without hesitation.

In that moment, she felt an odd sense of peace. The illusions she'd clung to finally shattered. She should have let go of Nathan—and their doomed marriage—long ago.

Veins stood out on Nathan's forehead as he struggled to control his emotions. Releasing her shoulders, a mocking smile twisted his lips. "Fine. The day has finally come. I'll be free to marry Serena soon."

The words seemed ripped from somewhere deep and painful within him.

###Chapter 392

Evelyn's breath hitched when Nathan's words struck her like a physical blow. Though she knew they were true, the pain still sliced through her chest with brutal precision. She forced a tight-lipped smile, her voice steady despite the storm inside. "Congratulations, Mr. Black."

Pride flickered through her. To say those words without breaking—that took strength.

Nathan's jaw clenched. Seeing her composure only fueled his anger. He reminded himself this was what he wanted. Freedom. A clean break.

Without another word, he stormed out, the door slamming behind him.

Evelyn exhaled, her shoulders dropping as the tension drained away. For the first time in years, she felt light. Unshackled.

She stepped into the shower, letting the water wash away the last remnants of their marriage. Afterward, she grabbed her phone and typed a message to her closest friends—Alexander and Natalie.

"Final step tomorrow. Court at 9 AM. Freedom tastes sweeter than I imagined."

Alexander replied instantly. "You're serious?"

Natalie's response followed. "Already? Tomorrow morning?"

Her phone rang seconds later. Alexander's voice was sharp with concern. "Eve, are you sure about this?"

"Completely." Her fingers tightened around the phone. "It's time."

A beat of silence. Then, resigned: "Then we’ll be there. Natalie and I."

"Thank you." She ended the call and slid under the covers, bracing for a sleepless night. Instead, she drifted off instantly, waking only to her alarm.

Dressed in a sleek black suit, she skipped breakfast and drove straight to the courthouse.

Nathan hadn’t slept.

He’d spent the night pacing his study, whiskey untouched on the desk. At dawn, Walter called.

"Sir, Mrs. Black left ten minutes ago. Her route suggests she’s heading to the courthouse."

Nathan’s grip on the phone turned lethal. "Perfect." His laugh was bitter. "Let her have her freedom."

He’d expected regret. Hesitation. But Evelyn had marched toward divorce without looking back.

Fine.

When she came crawling back—and she would—he’d be long gone.

He strode out, slamming the door behind him.

###Chapter 393

The courthouse clock struck 10:10 when Nathan Black arrived. Evelyn Hartley was already waiting in the marble lobby, her flawless complexion glowing under the fluorescent lights. The sight of her rested appearance sent a fresh wave of irritation through Nathan. Had she actually slept peacefully last night? While he'd spent the hours staring at his ceiling?

Evelyn stood immediately when he entered, her heels clicking decisively against the floor as she approached. Her expression was schooled into perfect neutrality, as if this were just another mundane errand rather than the dissolution of their marriage.

Nathan studied her carefully, the way her fingers didn't tremble on the paperwork, how her signature flowed effortlessly across the documents. Each precise movement felt like another twist of the knife in his chest. He found himself waiting - hoping - for any sign of hesitation.

Maybe she'd drop the pen. Perhaps her phone would ring with some emergency. Anything to delay this finality.

But Evelyn signed each page with steady hands, never once glancing his way. When it was his turn, Nathan gave a bitter chuckle before scrawling his name with more force than necessary.

The moment the divorce was finalized, Evelyn turned toward the exit with purposeful strides. Just as she reached the heavy oak doors, Nathan's control snapped.

"Evelyn!"

She froze mid-step but didn't turn. Nathan's voice was rough when he demanded, "Don't you have anything left to say to me?"

Slowly, Evelyn pivoted to face him. A practiced smile curved her lips as she delivered her parting words: "Congratulations, Mr. Black. You're finally free to marry the woman you've always loved."

The barb hid the shards of glass tearing through her chest with each breath. She could feel the blood draining from her face but held his gaze unflinchingly.

Before Nathan could respond, a deep voice cut through the tension. "Evelyn."

Alexander Prescott approached with Natalie Brooks at his side. Nathan's jaw clenched at the sight of them. Couldn't the bastard wait five minutes before swooping in?

"We should grab drinks soon, Nathan," Alexander said casually, already guiding Evelyn away with a protective hand at her elbow.

Nathan watched their retreating figures, his expression darkening by the second. The slam of the courthouse door echoed like a gunshot in the silent lobby.

Inside Alexander's car, the air was thick with unspoken sympathy. "Where to?" he asked gently.

"The Black estate. I need to collect my things." Evelyn kept her eyes fixed on her lap, fingers twisting the diamond band she'd forgotten to remove.

The drive passed in heavy silence. Neither Alexander nor Natalie offered empty platitudes - they simply let the quiet surround her like a cocoon.

When they arrived, Alexander turned off the engine. "We'll wait right here."

Evelyn frowned. "Don't you two have plans today?"

Natalie reached across the seat to squeeze her hand. "Our only plan is being here for you."

###Chapter 394

Evelyn's lips curved into a faint smile as she nodded. "Alright."

Stepping out of the car, she made her way into the mansion. Leonard sat in the grand parlor, his reading glasses perched on his nose as he scanned the financial section of the newspaper. His silver eyebrows shot up when he noticed Evelyn's unexpected return.

Before he could utter a word, Evelyn spoke first. "Leonard, may we talk?"

The gravity in her tone and the shadows beneath her eyes sent an icy premonition down Leonard's spine.

The study's mahogany doors clicked shut behind them. Evelyn sank into the leather armchair, her fingers brushing against the signed divorce papers laid out on the desk. Leonard's breath hitched when his gaze landed on the documents. His weathered hands trembled slightly as they gripped the armrests.

"Evelyn... you and Nathan..." His voice cracked like dry parchment.

The confirmation hung heavy between them. He'd always feared this day would come, yet part of him had clung to the hope that their bond might survive.

Evelyn pressed her lips together before answering. "I'm sorry, Leonard. I know this isn't what you wanted for us." She traced the edge of the document with one manicured nail. "Some stories aren't meant to have happy endings."

"Is Serena the reason?" Leonard's knuckles turned white.

"Serena was merely the catalyst." Evelyn met his gaze steadily. "The truth is, Nathan never loved me. Not truly. And that..." Her voice wavered for the first time. "That's something no amount of time can fix."

Leonard opened his mouth, then closed it. He'd witnessed the stolen glances, the unconscious ways Nathan would reach for Evelyn when he thought no one was looking. But perhaps those fleeting moments hadn't been enough to build a lifetime upon.

"Is there truly no other way?" The plea in his voice made Evelyn's chest tighten.

She shook her head slowly. "We've danced this waltz too many times, Leonard. Each repetition only leaves us more bruised." A weary sigh escaped her. "Sometimes the kindest cut is the cleanest."

Her eyes, usually so vibrant, looked dull with exhaustion. "I need to breathe. To remember who I was before I became Nathan's wife."

Leonard felt something inside him splinter. How had he never noticed how much of herself she'd sacrificed? The realization struck him like a physical blow - his daughter-in-law had been drowning in silence for years.

"My dear girl," he murmured, reaching across to squeeze her hand. "You've carried this burden alone for far too long."

"Leonard." Evelyn turned her palm to clasp his fingers, her engagement ring catching the light. "You'll always be family to me. I promise to visit whenever I can."

"Of course!" Leonard nodded vigorously, his eyes suspiciously bright. "And when you find that lucky man who deserves you - because mark my words, you will - bring him straight to me." His voice thickened. "Nathan was a fool to let you go."

A genuine smile touched Evelyn's lips for the first time that evening. "I'll hold you to that." She arched one perfectly shaped brow. "And if you happen to meet any eligible bachelors..."

"Consider it done!" Leonard's answering grin didn't quite reach his eyes. He'd make it his personal mission to find someone worthy of her - someone who'd cherish Evelyn the way his son never had.

###Chapter 395

Evelyn returned to her room after the conversation, gathering her few possessions with swift efficiency. The suitcase clicked shut with finality as she descended the stairs, her heels echoing through the grand foyer.

"Nathan's not here to see you off?" Winston's voice held surprise when he spotted Evelyn with her luggage. His expression softened with unspoken regret. The divorce papers had been signed too quickly in his opinion.

"Goodbye, Winston."

She flashed him a bright smile that didn't reach her eyes. "I'll visit when I can."

The older man nodded stiffly. "Take care, Miss Hartley. I hope life treats you kindly."

"Thank you." The words tasted like ash as she turned toward the door.

Evelyn walked away without glancing back at the mansion that had been her prison for three years. The weight of her decision settled on her shoulders like a mantle of freedom. The woman who had loved Nathan Black to the point of self-destruction no longer existed.

Alexander took her suitcase wordlessly while Natalie squeezed her hand in silent support. The trio moved toward the waiting car under the watchful eyes of the household staff.

Meanwhile, Margaret Hayes nearly dropped her teacup when Leonard delivered the news. "Divorced? Already? But Evelyn worshipped the ground Nathan walked on! That girl would have walked through fire for him!"

Her fingers trembled against the porcelain. Though she'd never approved of Evelyn as a daughter-in-law, the abruptness of the separation left her strangely unsettled. This wasn't how aristocratic marriages ended.

"Leonard, how could you let this happen?" she demanded. "Didn't you try to stop them?"

Leonard's face darkened. "Stop them? After how our son treated her? This divorce is the best thing that could've happened to that poor girl." He massaged his temples. "Do you think I didn't try? But Evelyn's mind was made up. The banquet incident was merely the last straw - years of neglect brought her to this decision."

He added bitterly, "Perhaps now they'll both find some peace. Evelyn deserves someone who'll cherish her properly."

Margaret found no rebuttal to her husband's logic.

At the new penthouse, Evelyn's friends helped unpack while carefully avoiding any mention of Nathan. Laughter and gossip filled the space as they transformed the sterile rooms into a home. Evelyn moved through the motions with practiced ease, but the shadows beneath her eyes betrayed her carefully constructed composure.

That evening, as they gathered around the dining table laden with Evelyn's cooking, she broke the unspoken rule first. "You don't need to tiptoe around me like I'm made of glass." Her lips curved in a wry smile. "Strangely enough, I feel... lighter."

Natalie seized the opening. "Of course you do! Staying in a marriage where your husband's heart belongs to another woman is emotional torture. This divorce is your liberation!"

Alexander remained uncharacteristically silent. He'd always believed Nathan cared for Evelyn in his own way. But now... He shook his head. What did it matter? The marriage was over.

###Chapter 396

"And there's something else..." Evelyn's voice broke the silence suddenly.

"I refuse to be the woman who's always waiting to be abandoned."

Her words trembled as she spoke, tears welling up in her striking blue eyes.

A silent understanding passed between Natalie and Alexander, their expressions mirroring the pain in Evelyn's confession.

Taking a steadying breath, Evelyn continued, "Nathan does care for me in his own way. He doesn't completely ignore my existence... But his affection is shallow, like a puddle after summer rain. When Serena calls, he runs to her without hesitation. Is this my destiny? To always be the second choice? Nathan drowns in guilt over Serena. Leonard had her imprisoned, and now she's been kidnapped. Nathan believes these tragedies are his fault. He thinks he can't abandon her now."

A bitter laugh escaped her lips. "Is he wrong? No. He's being honorable, staying true to his principles. But..." Her voice cracked. "His devotion to Serena is destroying me piece by piece. I'm exhausted. I can't keep pouring my heart into a marriage that only brings me pain. Divorce is the only solution - it's better for both of us."

Natalie immediately reached across the table. "You're absolutely right! Your life should be about you, not some man who can't appreciate you! There are plenty of fish in the sea!"

"Don't waste your tears on someone like Nathan," Natalie added fiercely. "He doesn't deserve them."

Alexander frowned thoughtfully. "Evelyn, you mentioned Serena was kidnapped... Could you tell us more about that?"

"Oh, I forgot you didn't know." Evelyn wiped her eyes and recounted the harrowing events.

By the time she finished, both Natalie and Alexander wore matching expressions of shock and outrage.

Natalie slammed her palm on the table, making the silverware jump. "Unbelievable! He left you alone at the pool? You could have died!"

Alexander's face darkened, his jaw tightening with barely contained anger.

He realized this must have been the breaking point for Evelyn - the moment she lost all faith in her marriage.

The party incident had simply confirmed what she already knew in her heart.

Struggling for words, Alexander remained silent.

From Nathan's perspective, his actions might have seemed justified. But those very choices had shattered the woman who loved him.

"Divorce is absolutely the right decision!" Natalie declared passionately. "Why suffer with such a husband? Evelyn, I'm proud of you! You're free now - no more prison of unrequited love! We should be celebrating!"

Initially saddened by the divorce news, Natalie now felt only relief and joy for her friend.

She jumped up excitedly. "Let's go to The Velvet Lounge after dinner! Not to mourn, but to celebrate new beginnings! A toast to Evelyn's freedom! This calls for champagne!"

###Chapter 397
"Absolutely! Time to turn the page." Evelyn's smile radiated pure, unshackled relief.

Alexander let out a slow breath before nodding. "Alright. After dinner, we celebrate properly."

The trio finished their meal and headed straight for The Velvet Lounge.

"To Evelyn's fresh start!" Natalie declared, lifting her champagne flute with infectious energy.

Following her lead, Evelyn and Alexander raised their glasses. The crystalline chime of clinking glassware filled the air between them.

"I still can't believe Serena's audacity! She staged that fall and had the nerve to accuse you," Natalie fumed, swirling her drink violently.

Evelyn remained composed. "She wanted Nathan to blame me. To push him toward divorce."

Natalie scoffed, flicking her wrist dismissively. "And he actually bought that pathetic act?"

Eyes lowering, Evelyn murmured, "He claims he saw me reaching out."

"So what?" Natalie shot back. "Reaching out could mean anything! Why assume you pushed her? Anyone who truly knows you would never doubt you like that."

The words wrapped around Evelyn like a warm embrace. She realized truths didn’t need defending before those who mattered. And for those who didn’t? No explanation would ever suffice.

"None of it matters now. It’s over," Evelyn said with a fragile smile.

"About that maid… Do you recognize her?" Alexander interjected suddenly.

Evelyn shook her head. "The Grants employ dozens. I barely know half."

Alexander’s lips curled. "Bold move, framing you without understanding the stakes."

Natalie turned to him. "You think she’s involved?"

"Leonard suspects something," Evelyn mused. "They didn’t fire her—just docked six months' pay. Keeping her close to watch."

"Sharp as ever," Alexander remarked approvingly.

"Enough talk!" Natalie raised her glass again. "More champagne!"

Evelyn gave her a warning look. "Pace yourself unless you want to end up under the table."

"I just want tonight to be special," Natalie pouted.

"Special doesn’t require excess," Evelyn countered gently.

Natalie fell silent, exchanging a knowing glance with Alexander. Both recognized Evelyn’s calm as a carefully constructed facade.

Just as Natalie opened her mouth to speak, Alexander suddenly stiffened. "Look over there—"

###Chapter 398

Evelyn's and Natalie's gazes followed Alexander's pointed finger.

At a nearby booth, three middle-aged women were seated. One of them was clearly harassing a young man who appeared to be in his late teens, likely a college student. The boy had striking features - sharp cheekbones, tousled dark hair, and an air of quiet dignity about him. The woman beside him was running her manicured fingers along his thigh while attempting to slip her other hand beneath his crisp white shirt.

The young man's ears burned crimson as he repeatedly pushed her hands away, attempting to stand. But the woman - a platinum blonde with too much jewelry - clung to his arm like a limpet. To make matters worse, she pulled out a thick wad of bills from her designer purse and waved them in his face. His expression twisted between humiliation and barely contained fury.

"There goes Vanessa again," Natalie muttered with undisguised contempt. "Preying on young men like some cougar in heat."

"Who is she?" Evelyn asked, her delicate brows knitting together.

"That's Vanessa Delacroix, wife of the Delacroix Group chairman," Natalie explained in a hushed tone. "She's notorious in high society circles. Has a particular... appetite for handsome young men. Once she sets her sights on someone, she won't take no for an answer. Countless boys have fallen victim to her... advances."

Evelyn's normally cheerful expression darkened, her lips pressing into a thin line of disgust.

Suddenly, a booming voice cut through the restaurant. "You shameless whore! How dare you disgrace me like this!"

All heads turned toward the commotion.

A heavyset man with thinning hair and a florid complexion stormed toward Vanessa's table, his meaty fist raised threateningly.

Vanessa turned deathly pale, scrambling to compose herself. "Darling! Wait, let me explain! I wasn't cheating - he came onto me! The little gold-digger wouldn't take no for an answer even after I told him I was married!"

The young man's eyes widened in outrage. "That's a lie! I'm just a wine steward doing my job! She's been harassing me for the past twenty minutes!"

Vanessa shot him a venomous look before turning back to her husband. "Sweetheart, why would I jeopardize our marriage? He's clearly lying to save face!"

"Yes, Mr. Delacroix, Vanessa would never betray you!"
"The boy's clearly after money - we all saw him proposition her!"
"She's completely devoted to you!"

Vanessa's friends chimed in with practiced ease, spinning their web of lies with sickening synchrony.

"You're all lying!" The young man's voice cracked with barely restrained fury. He turned desperately to nearby diners. "Please, someone tell them the truth! Tell them I didn't do anything!"

"I didn't see anything."
"I was facing the other way."
The other patrons either averted their eyes or murmured vague non-answers. No one stepped forward.

Watching the young man's helpless expression, Evelyn felt a familiar pang in her chest. She knew all too well the sting of false accusations and the crushing weight of being abandoned when you needed help most. Her delicate fingers curled into fists. Without another word, she rose from her seat and strode purposefully toward the unfolding drama.

###Chapter 399

The middle-aged man's face hardened with absolute conviction in his wife's fabricated story. His furious gaze locked onto the young man, veins visibly pulsing at his temples. "You insolent brat! Daring to make advances on my wife? Have you lost your mind?" His hand shot up, poised to deliver a brutal slap.

"Enough!" Evelyn's commanding voice sliced through the tension like a blade.

The man whirled toward the interruption. Rage still contorted his features until recognition dawned. "Mrs. Black!" he gasped, the anger draining from his face. The way he addressed her made something flicker in Evelyn's piercing gaze.

"Mrs. Black, what seems to be the problem?" he asked, his tone now carefully measured.

Evelyn didn't mince words. "I witnessed your wife sexually harassing that young man. She was stroking his thigh and attempting to slip her hand beneath his shirt. When he tried to leave, she physically restrained him and forced money into his palm."

The color drained from both the middle-aged man and Vanessa Delacroix's faces simultaneously.

The young man stared at Evelyn with undisguised awe. Never had he expected someone of her stature to intervene on his behalf.

Vanessa looked like she'd been struck. Her cheeks burned crimson, but she knew better than to challenge Evelyn directly. Turning to her husband with trembling lips, she began, "Darling, let me expl—"

"Silence! We'll discuss this at home," he snarled, his voice dripping with venomous promise. The threat in his eyes made Vanessa shrink back.

Evelyn turned her attention to Vanessa, then gestured decisively toward the shaken young man. "Mrs. Delacroix, consider this your only warning. He's under my protection now. If I hear even a whisper of you approaching him again..." She let the unspoken threat hang in the air.

She remembered Natalie's warning about Vanessa's obsessive nature—how she never let go of prey once marked. That knowledge had prompted Evelyn's unusually direct intervention.

Vanessa's face twisted with barely contained fury. She'd marked that handsome waiter as her next conquest, planning to have him one way or another. Now Evelyn's interference had ruined everything.

"Of course not. I wouldn't dream of it," Vanessa forced through clenched teeth, her humiliation complete. Without another word, she turned on her heel and fled, the click of her designer heels echoing her disgrace.

Her husband lingered just long enough to offer Evelyn an embarrassed nod before chasing after his wayward wife.

Evelyn glanced at the young man. "You're safe now," she said simply. Without waiting for gratitude, she turned to leave.

The young man blinked rapidly, as if emerging from a nightmare. "Wait!" he called out desperately. "Please—at least tell me your name?" His voice cracked with emotion. "I'll never forget what you did for me today."

"Don't mention it," Evelyn replied coolly over her shoulder, already walking away with regal poise. She waved a dismissive hand as she disappeared into the crowd.

What Evelyn couldn't possibly know was that this single act of defiance would trigger consequences far beyond anything she could imagine.

###Chapter 400

Nathan was still buried in paperwork when his phone buzzed violently against the mahogany desk. The sudden vibration made his fountain pen skid across the contract he was reviewing.

He grabbed the device, thumb swiping to reveal a WhatsApp notification from Theodore. A video attachment glowed ominously on the screen.

His pulse quickened as he tapped play. The moment Evelyn's face appeared, his breath hitched. But as the footage continued, his knuckles turned white around the phone.

Who the hell was this punk touching his wife?

Before he could process the rage boiling in his veins, another message arrived - a voice note this time. Theodore's smug voice filled the silent office.

"Got this little gem from an anonymous sender. Seems someone wants you to know your wife's been cozying up with some young stud." The mocking tone dripped with barely concealed amusement.

Nathan's jaw clenched so tight his molars ached. So this was Evelyn's new life post-divorce. How... entertaining.

He told himself the fury coiling in his gut was purely about reputation. About the humiliation of people thinking his ex-wife was parading around with some boy toy. It had nothing to do with jealousy. Absolutely nothing.

With measured precision, he typed out a reply. "Evelyn and I are done. Don't bother updating me on her activities anymore."

Sixty seconds hadn't passed when his phone rang. Theodore's name flashed across the screen.

Nathan answered with a terse, "What?"

"You're really cutting ties with Evelyn?" Theodore's voice carried undisguised curiosity.

"We're divorced," Nathan stated evenly, though his grip threatened to crack the phone's screen. "Her life is no longer my concern. Clear?"

The silence on the other end was palpable. Theodore clearly hadn't expected this development. The reality that Nathan had actually let Evelyn go seemed to stun him into momentary speechlessness.

"You actually let her walk away?" The question slipped out before Theodore could censor himself.

Nathan recoiled as if struck. "Of course I did!" His voice rose half an octave. "This is exactly what I wanted, isn't it? Finally free of that marriage. Couldn't be happier!"

A beat of silence. Then, as if remembering something, he added sharply, "Weren't you the one who promised to celebrate my freedom? Tomorrow works."

Theodore exhaled audibly. It was painfully obvious to him that Nathan had developed feelings for Evelyn, even if the stubborn bastard refused to admit it. This divorce reeked of regret already.

"Fine," Theodore conceded. "Tomorrow night. I'll pick the place and text you details."

"Perfect." Nathan ended the call with a violent stab of his finger. He inhaled deeply, trying to quell the storm raging inside him. But as he attempted to refocus on work, Evelyn's voice echoed in his mind: "He's under my protection."

Goddammit!

With a vicious curse, Nathan slammed his laptop shut, grabbed his keys, and stormed out. When he arrived at the Grant family estate, he found Leonard still awake in the study. The older man took one look at his son's thunderous expression and sighed.

"Well?" Leonard's voice was ice. "Are you pleased with how this turned out?"

###Chapter 401

Nathan's face remained an unreadable mask as he spoke with deliberate precision. "Absolutely satisfied. This outcome aligns perfectly with my expectations."

Leonard's expression darkened like gathering storm clouds, his fury barely restrained. "Splendid! Marvelous! Just don't come crying with regrets later!" he snapped, exhaling sharply through flared nostrils.

"That won't be necessary," Nathan replied icily, his composure unshaken.

"Do you honestly believe Evelyn pushed Serena down those stairs?" Leonard demanded abruptly.

Nathan met his father's piercing gaze without flinching. "My own eyes witnessed her reaching out at that precise moment."

"She was trying to pull Serena back, not push her!" Leonard countered instantly, his voice rising.

Nathan remained silent, his features carefully schooled into neutrality. Leonard's frustration mingled with weary resignation as he studied his son. "After all these years of marriage, do you truly not know Evelyn's character? Can you genuinely picture her committing such violence?"

The silence stretched between them, though a faint crease appeared between Nathan's brows. Leonard released a bitter chuckle laced with sarcasm. "Now I understand why Evelyn was so determined to divorce you. You've never trusted her, not for a single moment."

Nathan's pupils contracted sharply at the accusation. Was that true? Had trust always been absent between them? The realization struck him like a physical blow.

Before he could respond, Leonard continued in a lowered voice, "But what's done is done. The divorce papers are signed; dwelling on it serves no purpose. Nathan, I want you to seriously consider - is this truly the outcome you desired?"

"Don't answer me now. Just think about it carefully." With those final words, Leonard rose and ascended the stairs, leaving Nathan alone in the cavernous living room.

Nathan sat motionless, stunned, as if caught in a thick fog. Only after several long minutes did he shake himself from his daze. His brow furrowed in troubled thought before he forcibly pushed the disturbing reflections aside and headed upstairs.

The moment he entered the master bedroom, an unsettling emptiness assaulted his senses. Evelyn's vanity stood barren - all her skincare and makeup products gone. His pulse quickened as he strode toward the walk-in closet.

Throwing open the doors, his breath caught. Every single garment belonging to Evelyn had vanished. She... she'd packed everything so thoroughly, so quickly. Was she that desperate to escape their home? White-hot rage surged through his veins.

Perfect! This was exactly what he'd wanted, wasn't it? Then why did fury burn through him instead of relief? He should be celebrating his newfound freedom!

Nathan slammed the closet doors with enough force to rattle the walls and stormed out. That night, Evelyn didn't return to the Black mansion. Instead, she found herself at Eleanor Sinclair's residence.

Eleanor looked up in surprise when Evelyn appeared. "Darling, what brings you here?" she asked, immediately noticing Evelyn's red-rimmed eyes.

The simple question made tears well up again. Evelyn sniffled, her voice trembling. "Grandmother, may I stay with you tonight?"

Eleanor's heart clenched at her granddaughter's distress. "Of course, my dear. You'll stay right here with me."

After Evelyn had washed up and settled into bed, Eleanor gently probed, "Now tell me what's happened."

Propped against the headboard, Evelyn kept her gaze lowered as she spoke with forced calm. "Grandmother, Nathan and I... we're divorced now."

Eleanor's face froze. "When did this happen?" she asked, her voice tight with concern.

###Chapter 402

"Just today," Evelyn answered softly, her voice barely above a whisper.

"Did something happen? Why did you two separate so suddenly?" Eleanor's tone remained composed, though her eyes betrayed deep concern. She had received an invitation to Leonard's birthday celebration but had politely declined with a prior engagement excuse. Thus, she remained unaware of the dramatic events that had unfolded at the gala.

Evelyn didn't hold back, recounting every painful detail from both the holiday villa incident and Leonard's disastrous banquet. As the story unfolded, Eleanor's face darkened with growing fury. She could never have imagined the depths of suffering her beloved granddaughter had endured—Evelyn had nearly lost her life! The revelation made Eleanor's blood boil.

"My dear, you did absolutely nothing wrong. Your decision was courageous and right," Eleanor said firmly, placing a comforting hand over Evelyn's trembling ones. "Nathan never deserved you. Ending this marriage is your liberation." Her wise eyes searched Evelyn's face. "Can you imagine spending another decade trapped in that loveless cage?"

A fragile smile touched Evelyn's lips. "Exactly! I refuse to be anyone's afterthought ever again." Even as she spoke these words, hot tears began tracing paths down her pale cheeks.

The sight of Evelyn's silent weeping made Eleanor's own eyes sting. She pulled her granddaughter into a warm embrace, murmuring, "Let it all out, my darling. Here with me, you don't need to wear that brave mask."

Those tender words shattered Evelyn's last defenses. Like a dam breaking, her carefully controlled composure collapsed completely.

All day she had maintained perfect poise—through the courthouse proceedings, through signing the papers, through every polite goodbye. But now, curled against Eleanor's shoulder, Evelyn sobbed with gut-wrenching intensity. Each ragged breath carried months of pent-up anguish.

From the moment she'd stepped into the divorce court that morning, excruciating pain had been clawing at her insides. Yet she'd kept repeating her mantra: This is freedom. This is survival. Nathan Black would no longer own any piece of her heart.

Now, in her grandmother's safe embrace, every suppressed emotion came flooding out. Her body shook with the force of her weeping as she gasped between sobs, "Grandmother... I swear... this is the last time... I'll ever cry for Nathan! After tonight... he's dead to me!"

"That's my strong girl," Eleanor whispered, stroking Evelyn's hair as her own tears fell. "By sunrise, he'll be nothing but a bad memory."

The raw pain in Evelyn's cries tore at Eleanor's heart. Yet she knew this purging was necessary—only by fully feeling this grief could her granddaughter truly move forward.

When the storm of tears finally began to subside, Evelyn sniffled and whispered a promise: "I'll find real love one day, Grandmother. Someone who sees me as their first choice, their only choice."

"Of course you will," Eleanor affirmed fiercely, dabbing at her own damp cheeks. Evelyn deserved nothing less than complete devotion.

The emotional exhaustion eventually pulled Evelyn into a fitful sleep. Before bed, she pressed chilled spoons against her swollen eyelids, though morning still found them puffy. After freshening up, she slipped out of the Prescott estate quietly.

It wasn't until breakfast that Grace noticed her daughter's return the previous night. Sipping her tea, she casually inquired, "Mother, when did Evelyn come home last night?"

###Chapter 403

"You were already fast asleep when I came in last night," Eleanor Sinclair replied softly. After a brief hesitation, Grace Monroe asked, "Did something happen?"

The room fell silent for a moment before Eleanor released a heavy sigh. "Evelyn and Nathan got divorced."

"What?" Isabelle Laurent gasped, her face frozen in shock.

Grace was equally stunned. "They divorced? When did this happen?"

"Yesterday," Eleanor answered calmly.

"But why?" Grace pressed, confusion evident in her voice.

"They simply weren't meant for each other," Eleanor explained simply.

Grace bit her lower lip. "Evelyn must be... devastated, isn't she?"

Eleanor nodded with another sigh. "She cried all night. But this is something she needs to face. Time will heal her wounds."

"What a tragedy. How could they just end things like this?" Isabelle said, though secretly, she couldn't deny the flicker of satisfaction she felt. The divorce worked in her favor.

"Just remember not to mention this in front of Evelyn," Eleanor cautioned.

"Understood," Isabelle replied promptly.

"Don't worry, Mom. I won't bring it up," Grace assured her.

When Evelyn Hartley arrived at the hospital, she grabbed a quick breakfast in the cafeteria before heading to the locker room to change. Just as she was about to leave, she nearly collided with Lila Sinclair.

Lila smiled brightly. "Evelyn, do you have a moment?"

Evelyn's brows furrowed slightly before she nodded in agreement.

They moved to a quiet corner for privacy.

"What do you want to talk about?" Evelyn asked directly.

Lila didn't beat around the bush.

In a composed tone, she asked, "Evelyn, doesn't it hurt to be falsely accused?"

Evelyn's eyebrows twitched, her sharp gaze piercing through Lila. What was she playing at?

Lila continued smoothly, "Funny thing—I happened to witness your argument with Serena Cole at the banquet that night."

Evelyn's eyes narrowed dangerously.

Seeing Evelyn's silence, Lila pressed on, "I saw everything... Serena tripped and fell down the stairs on her own. You didn't push her. But..." She shrugged dramatically. "What does it matter? No one believes you. Even with Leonard Grant defending you, people still think you're guilty."

Lila shook her head in mock sympathy. "Tell me, Evelyn... Would you like me to help clear your name?"

Evelyn couldn't help but laugh coldly. If Lila truly wanted to help, why wait until now? She knew Lila would revel in seeing her condemned. So why this sudden offer of assistance?

Clearly, Lila wanted something from her. That was the only reason she'd bring this up now.

###Chapter 404

With this thought flashing through her mind, Evelyn curved her lips into a faint smile, feigning surprise. "Is that so? You'd actually help restore my reputation? That would be wonderful!"

Lila mirrored her smile, though her eyes remained calculating. "We're sisters, after all. Of course I'd want to help clear your name."

She paused deliberately before adding with meaningful emphasis, "But... there's something I need from you in return."

Evelyn tilted her head, playing along with exaggerated curiosity. "Oh? And what might that be?"

Without hesitation, Lila made her demand. "Evelyn, you're already an attending physician at Grand Oaks General while I'm still just an intern. Don't you think people will laugh at me? So I need you to speak to Mr. Holloway about giving me a permanent position. Given your... special relationship with him, I'm sure he'd listen to you."

Evelyn nearly laughed at the audacity. Lila wanted a permanent position at Grand Oaks? She might as well wish for the moon.

Maintaining a polite facade, Evelyn shook her head. "I'm sorry, Lila, but that's not something I can help you with."

Lila's expression darkened instantly at the immediate rejection. She quickly adopted a wounded tone. "Then I'm afraid I can't help you either. Without proper standing, who would take my word seriously? Especially since we're sisters - people might think I'm just covering for you."

The threat hung heavy between them - help for help, or nothing at all.

Lila waited expectantly, certain Evelyn would crumble and beg.

But to her shock...

Evelyn simply sighed. "Very well. I suppose I'll just have to live with the misunderstanding."

Lila's face froze in disbelief. This wasn't the reaction she'd anticipated.

Her lips pressed into a thin line. "Evelyn, think carefully. If this isn't resolved, everyone will always believe you pushed Serena down those stairs. Your reputation will be permanently tarnished. Are you really willing to live with that?"

Evelyn shrugged casually, her voice dripping with indifference. "People will believe what they want. I can't control their thoughts, can I?"

"But doesn't it bother you?" Lila pressed. "This could affect your entire life!"

Evelyn's smile never wavered. "Do I look affected to you?"

Lila found herself speechless, her expression hardening into something ugly.

The truth was undeniable - Evelyn seemed completely unaffected. Moreover, Leonard had publicly announced her status as Nathan's wife during his birthday celebration. Now everyone in their circles knew Evelyn was Mrs. Black, and they were all clamoring for her favor.

This realization only deepened the bitter resentment coiling in Lila's chest.

###Chapter 405

Evelyn's jaw tightened as a sudden realization flashed across her face. "Don't you care what Mr. Black thinks of you? His reaction made it clear he believed Serena when she accused you of pushing her down the stairs."

At Lila's words, a fleeting shadow crossed Evelyn's eyes - a brief glimpse of bitter amusement.

The divorce papers were signed. Did Nathan's opinion even matter anymore?

"It's irrelevant," Evelyn responded coolly.

Lila's frustration became palpable.

Before she could retort, Evelyn spoke with calm finality. "Defend my reputation if you wish. Stay silent if you prefer. This conversation is over. I have patients waiting." Without hesitation, she turned and walked away.

Her steps never faltered.

Watching Evelyn's retreating figure, Lila seethed with a toxic mix of anger and anxiety.

How could Evelyn remain so indifferent?

Damn her!

This was supposed to be Lila's opportunity to secure her position at the hospital, but Evelyn refused to play along!

Clutching her phone, Lila opened a video from her gallery - clear footage of Serena deliberately tumbling down the stairs.

But showing Evelyn this evidence was never part of the plan.

Even if Evelyn complied, Lila would only verbally claim to have witnessed Serena's fall.

The video would remain her secret weapon.

Whether people believed her testimony didn't matter.

She secretly reveled in Evelyn's tarnished reputation - why would she genuinely help restore it?

The video was merely insurance for future leverage.

With this thought, Lila pocketed her phone and strode away.

Meanwhile, in the VIP suite of Grand Ins General Hospital...

Serena's face lit up as Nathan entered. "Nathan," she cooed.

He approached her bedside, his voice gentle. "How are you feeling today?"

"The pain has lessened," she replied sweetly.

Nathan sat beside her, his intense gaze locking onto hers. "Serena, I need to ask you again - are you absolutely certain Evelyn pushed you that day?"

Serena's pulse skipped.

Why was he questioning this now?

###Chapter 406

Had he discovered the truth?

Though her mind spun with frantic thoughts, Serena's face remained perfectly composed.

She nodded slightly. "Yes. Is something troubling you, Nathan?"

"Do you believe I'm being dishonest?"

Nathan remained silent, his piercing gaze dissecting every microexpression on Serena's face. It felt like he could see straight through her carefully constructed facade.

Beneath the hospital blanket, Serena's nails dug into her palms.

Breathe. Stay calm.

There was no way Nathan could have found evidence that Evelyn hadn't pushed her. This was just another one of his psychological games.

After several tense seconds, Nathan finally looked away. Her reaction had given nothing away.

When he spoke again, each word carried deliberate weight.

"Serena, we've known each other for years." His voice turned dangerously soft. "You should know by now that deception is the one thing I cannot tolerate."

A cold, humorless laugh escaped his lips.

"Every person who's ever lied to me has regretted it deeply." His glacial eyes locked onto hers again. "So don't even consider deceiving me."

The unspoken threat hung heavily between them. Serena's pulse hammered against her ribs. Though Nathan's expression remained neutral, the pressure radiating from him made the air feel thick, suffocating.

For one terrifying moment, she nearly confessed everything.

But no—all her sacrifices would be for nothing. The truth could never come out.

Serena forced a serene smile. "Of course I know that, Nathan. You can trust me completely."

Nathan's eyes darkened, his face unreadable. After a weighted pause, he simply said, "Good."

He stood abruptly, towering over her hospital bed. "Rest well." Without another word, he strode from the room. This time, she didn't try to stop him.

Only when his footsteps faded completely did Serena finally exhale. A cold sweat dotted her forehead. Her heart still raced violently.

Nathan was suspicious—that much was clear. But she'd played her part flawlessly. Still, she couldn't afford to relax yet.

"Serena!"

The sudden voice made her jump. She whirled to see Dylan standing in the doorway, grinning like he'd just won the lottery.

"You scared me half to death!" She wiped her damp palms on the sheets.

Dylan's eyes sparkled with excitement. "You'll never guess what just happened!"

###Chapter 407
"What's the latest update?" Serena demanded, her fingers tightening around her phone.

Dylan didn't keep her waiting. "Evelyn and Nathan are officially divorced!" His voice crackled with barely contained excitement.

Serena's breath hitched. Her lips parted in shock before curling into a triumphant smile. "You're joking. Are you absolutely sure?"

"Positive!" Dylan confirmed. "My contact at the courthouse verified it. The papers are signed—Nathan and Evelyn are done."

A laugh bubbled up from Serena's chest. "Unbelievable! This is perfect!" Her pulse raced, warmth flooding her veins.

"Right? Best news we've had in months!" Dylan agreed, though his grin faltered slightly. Was he celebrating for her... or himself?

Serena exhaled sharply, satisfaction gleaming in her eyes. "Every sacrifice was worth it." The pain, the scheming—all of it had led to this moment.

Dylan leaned closer, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "See, Serena? This proves how much Nathan cares about you. The second he found out Evelyn pushed you down those stairs, he didn't hesitate to end things."

Serena's expression softened, a delicate flush rising to her cheeks. The heavy knot in her chest unraveled, leaving only sweet anticipation.

"Exactly," she murmured, tilting her chin up. "I've always been the one he truly valued. Evelyn was just... a distraction."

Victory sang in her blood. She'd outmaneuvered Evelyn again.

Dylan straightened, adopting a more measured tone. "First step's complete. Now we focus on the next goal—making you Mrs. Black."

Serena's nails dug into her palms. "That's the only outcome I'll accept."

After a beat, Dylan added, "But we can't rush it. Let Nathan breathe for a week or two. Let the divorce settle."

Serena waved a dismissive hand. "I've waited years. What's a few more weeks?" Her smile turned razor-sharp. "Patience is my specialty."

Dylan nodded approvingly. "Good. We'll play this perfectly."

That evening, at The Rooftop's private dining room, Nathan sat with Theodore, Alexander, and Dylan as crystal ss clinked.

Theodore raised his drink first, smirking. "To Nathan! Finally free of that gold-digger!"

Nathan's jaw tightened imperceptibly, but he lifted his ss without comment. The sharp chime of glass echoed through the room.

Setting his drink down, Nathan turned to Alexander with a frosty smile. "This must be exactly what you wanted, Prescott."

Alexander arched a brow, unbothered. "Indeed." He met Nathan's gaze head-on, amusement dancing in his eyes. "And I have you to thank for it."

The air between them turned glacial. Theodore and Dylan exchanged uneasy glances. Dylan frowned, unable to resist asking, "Alexander, tell me honestly—do you actually have feelings for Evelyn?"

###Chapter 408
Alexander's eyes flashed briefly before he gave a firm nod. "Absolutely," he declared. If he was going to play this role, he had to commit fully. There was no backing out now.

Dylan hesitated, then frowned. "But... wasn't Evelyn Nathan's wife? Even if they're divorced now, isn't this a bit..."

Alexander answered without hesitation, "I spoke to Nathan about it. He made it clear he has no lingering feelings for Evelyn and doesn't care if I pursue her."

He paused, casting a glance at Nathan before adding, "If Nathan still loved her, I wouldn't interfere."

Nathan's expression remained unreadable, but the icy glint in his eyes sent a chill through the room.

Theodore glanced between the two men, sighing internally. Dylan's gaze darkened, a flicker of something unspoken crossing his features. If Alexander could openly chase Evelyn, and Nathan didn’t object... Did that mean he could try his luck too?

Dylan stiffened, mentally scolding himself. What was he thinking? Since when had he considered pursuing Evelyn?

Before he could dwell on it further, a server’s voice cut through his thoughts.

"Good evening, do you have a reservation?"

Dylan turned toward the entrance—and froze.

Evelyn walked in, radiant as ever, her arm linked with a strikingly handsome man. Dylan’s gaze immediately darted to Nathan, whose jaw clenched visibly. A storm brewed in Nathan’s eyes, his expression darkening.

Dylan frowned. Weren’t they divorced? Why did Nathan look like he wanted to murder someone?

Nathan fought to suppress the frustration coiling inside him. Seeing Evelyn so unaffected, so effortlessly stunning, grated on him. She was supposed to be heartbroken. Devastated. Not... glowing.

Had their marriage meant nothing to her?

Evelyn’s eyes found Nathan almost instinctively. A flicker of emotion passed through her before she quickly looked away, guiding Julian Hawthorne to their table.

Once seated, Julian leaned in. "Is that man your...?"

Evelyn didn’t need him to finish. "An old friend," she replied smoothly.

Julian arched a brow but said nothing. The tension in the air told him everything.

Meanwhile, Dylan smirked, raising his glass toward Nathan. "Cheers to finally being free of the woman you couldn’t stand."

###Chapter 409

His booming voice cut through the restaurant chatter like a knife. There was no way anyone could pretend not to hear.

Evelyn's fingers tightened momentarily around her wine glass before she schooled her features into perfect composure.

Nathan picked up his glass with deliberate calm, clinked it against Dylan's with an audible chime, and drained it in one smooth motion.

Meanwhile, Julian turned to Evelyn with sincere admiration. "Dr. Hartley, my family owes you a tremendous debt. Without your intervention, my aunt might not be with us today." His voice dropped to a heartfelt whisper, "You're our guardian angel."

Evelyn offered a warm smile. "Please, it was nothing any decent person wouldn't have done."

Julian shook his head firmly. "That's where you're wrong. In today's world, most people would rather look away than get involved. Your courage sets you apart."

A shadow crossed his face as he added, "My aunt wanted to be here personally, but she wasn't feeling well this morning. She'll thank you properly next time."

Evelyn's medical instincts kicked in. "If she's frequently unwell, I'd recommend a thorough check-up. Early detection is crucial."

"Of course," Julian nodded. "I'll take her to the hospital tomorrow."

"Good," Evelyn approved with a professional nod.

The meal progressed with minimal conversation.

Yet Julian proved an attentive host, discreetly refilling Evelyn's glass before it emptied, his manners impeccable.

His constant attentiveness made Evelyn's cheeks warm with slight embarrassment.

Midway through dinner, she excused herself to visit the ladies' room.

As she dried her hands, preparing to return, Evelyn froze at the sight of Dylan leaning against the corridor wall.

Her expression immediately darkened, irritation flashing in her hazel eyes.

She squared her shoulders and walked forward, gaze fixed straight ahead.

Just as she passed him, Dylan's voice stopped her. "Evelyn."

She halted but didn't turn.

Dylan's lips curled in a knowing smirk as he studied her rigid posture. "We need to talk."

Evelyn finally turned, her smile frosty. "I believe we said everything there was to say, Mr. Reeves."

Dylan chuckled darkly. "Oh, but there's more. Don't you want to hear about Nathan's little hospital visit this morning?"

Without waiting for a response, he continued, "He went to see Serena. Doted on her like she was made of glass. And guess what? He told her about your divorce immediately."

His smirk widened. "Even promised he'd marry her the moment she's ready."

###Chapter 410

Evelyn's chest tightened as her breathing became shallow and uneven.

She clenched her fists, reminding herself not to fall for Dylan's provocations—his words were nothing but venom meant to poison her mind.

Yet each syllable pierced her heart like shards of glass.

Of course Nathan would be free to marry Serena now that their divorce was finalized. That had always been his ultimate goal.

And naturally, he'd rush to share this joyous news with his precious Serena first.

The bitter thought twisted Evelyn's stomach into knots.

Noticing her silence, Dylan pressed on. "Nathan invited us out tonight. Said he's finally unchained and wants to celebrate."

His lips curled into a mocking smirk as he locked eyes with her. "See how little you meant to him, Evelyn?" he taunted.

Evelyn's expression remained frozen, but her eyes turned glacial. "Are you finished?" she asked, her voice dripping with frost.

Without waiting for a response, she pivoted on her heel to leave.

Dylan's hand shot out, fingers closing around her wrist like a vise.

Evelyn wrenched her arm free with such force it sent a sharp pain through her joints. Her face twisted in disgust as if she'd touched something vile.

Dylan's face darkened at her reaction.

He inhaled sharply through flared nostrils. "Evelyn... we could still be friends," he forced out between clenched teeth.

Evelyn turned slowly, her laughter hollow and mirthless. "Friends? With you? Don't make me laugh." She strode away without a backward glance.

Dylan stood rooted to the spot, fury contorting his features.

With a guttural snarl, he kicked a nearby trash can with such force it toppled over, spilling its contents across the pavement.

"Damn bitch!" he spat, his entire body trembling with rage.

How dare she look at him like he was beneath her? She was the discarded one, the unwanted wife! The audacity of that washed-up divorcee to treat him with such contempt!

His chest heaved as dark thoughts swirled in his mind.

Suddenly, an idea struck him.

He yanked out his phone and stabbed at the screen.

The line connected instantly. "Dylan?" came Adrienne's sultry voice.

"I'm coming over," he growled, his tone leaving no room for argument.

Adrienne's breath hitched audibly on the other end.

###Chapter 411

The line went silent for a brief moment before she finally answered, "Understood. I'll freshen up and wait for you."

"Good," Dylan replied sharply, his tone clipped.

With that, he abruptly ended the call, his thumb pressing the red button with deliberate force.

Tucking his phone into his pocket, he turned on his heel and strode away without a backward glance.

Dinner concluded swiftly, leaving Evelyn and Julian with no reason to linger.

They rose from their seats and made their way toward the exit.

As they approached the parking lot, Julian turned to Evelyn. "Dr. Hartley, allow me to drive you home."

Evelyn shook her head gently. "That's very kind, but I can manage on my own."

"But—" Julian hesitated, clearly wanting to insist.

Before he could finish, Evelyn suddenly lost her footing, lurching forward unexpectedly.

Julian reacted instantly, his hand shooting out to grab her arm and pull her against him.

Evelyn's forehead collided with his chest with a dull thud.

"Ouch!" Her nose stung from the impact against his firm torso, her face twisting in discomfort.

"Dr. Hartley, are you all right?" Julian asked, his hands steadying her shoulders, concern etched across his features.

"I'm fine—really," she murmured, though a sharp pain shot through her ankle.

She had stepped on an uneven cobblestone, twisting her foot awkwardly.

Just as Julian bent to examine her injury, a sudden force shoved him aside.

Caught off guard, Julian staggered back several steps before regaining his balance.

Evelyn wobbled precariously, but before she could fall, a strong arm wrapped around her waist, pulling her into a secure embrace.

"Are you hurt?" Nathan demanded, his brow furrowed as he studied her face.

He had just arrived when he saw Julian catching Evelyn mid-fall.

A surge of possessiveness had overtaken him, clouding his judgment.

Driven by irrational jealousy, he had stormed over and pushed Julian away without thinking.

As Nathan held her close, Evelyn stiffened.

She quickly extricated herself from his grasp, her expression guarded. "I'm perfectly fine," she stated coolly.

"Dr. Hartley, let me take you to the hospital," Julian insisted.

Before Evelyn could respond, Nathan cut in, "That won't be necessary."

###Chapter 412


"I'm taking her to the hospital."

Nathan's voice cut through the air like winter frost.

"I don't need either of you. I can manage on my own," Evelyn stated firmly, rejecting both offers without hesitation.

She gave Julian a brief nod before turning away, her steps uneven as she limped toward the parking lot.

Nathan's jaw tightened as he watched her retreating figure.

In three swift strides, he caught up with Evelyn, bent down, and scooped her into his arms effortlessly.

"Nathan!" Evelyn gasped, her arms instinctively wrapping around his neck as he lifted her.

His expression remained unreadable as he carried her toward his sleek black car.

"Put me down this instant!" Evelyn demanded, her voice sharp despite the pain. "Nathan Black! Are you deaf? I said put me down!"

She struggled against his hold, but his grip only tightened.

Ignoring her protests, Nathan carefully deposited her into the passenger seat and shut the door with finality.

Julian didn't intervene.

He stood motionless, observing the scene with keen interest.

Alexander and Theodore lingered nearby, having witnessed the entire exchange.

A knowing smile played at the corners of Julian's lips.

Even after their divorce, it seemed Nathan hadn't completely severed his ties to Evelyn.

The man clearly still cared for her.

How fascinating.

Julian adjusted his cufflinks before turning toward his own vehicle.

Theodore glanced at Alexander, amusement coloring his tone. "Does that look like indifference to you?"

Alexander smirked but remained silent.

Dylan, however, frowned deeply, concern etching lines across his forehead.

Could Nathan actually have feelings for Evelyn?

"Let's go," Alexander said quietly.

With that, they dispersed.

Meanwhile, inside Nathan's car...

After several minutes of tense silence, Evelyn spoke through gritted teeth. "Pull over. Now."

Nathan kept his eyes fixed on the road, maintaining speed as if he hadn't heard her.

###Chapter 413
Evelyn drew a steadying breath, keeping her expression carefully neutral as she measured each word. "Nathan, our divorce is final. Let's just wish each other well and move on, okay?"

Nathan's eyes narrowed dangerously.

Without warning, he slammed on the brakes.

The car jerked to a violent stop.

In one fluid motion, Evelyn unbuckled her seatbelt, shoved the door open, and stepped onto the sidewalk.

She walked away without looking back, her slight limp doing nothing to diminish her resolve.

As Evelyn's retreating figure grew smaller, Nathan's face darkened with conflicting emotions.

Suddenly, he threw open his door and stormed after her.

Before she could react, he hauled her over his shoulder like a sack of flour.

Evelyn dangled upside down, her stomach pressed uncomfortably against his broad shoulder.

"Nathan! Put me down!" she shrieked, pounding his back with her fists.

"Stop struggling," he growled.

Evelyn went rigid with outrage, but Nathan was already striding back to the car.

He shot her a warning glare. "Unless you want me to call your grandmother and have her drag you to the hospital herself, shut up and behave."

Evelyn seethed, rendered speechless by his audacity.

She considered unleashing her fury but thought better of it.

It wasn't worth the energy.

In her current state, getting to the hospital alone would be challenging.

If Nathan was determined to play chauffeur, she'd let him.

Silence fell between them.

Nathan drove to Silvercrest General Hospital.

After an examination, the doctor prescribed anti-inflammatory spray and ice therapy.

Leaving the consultation room, Nathan guided Evelyn to a temporary ward.

When a nurse delivered the ice packs, Nathan positioned them carefully around Evelyn's swollen ankle.

Task completed, he straightened with icy detachment. "I'm leaving."

He didn't wait for a response, turning on his heel and exiting the ward.

Evelyn's gaze lingered on the empty doorway.

Her lips parted slightly as if to speak, but no words came.

This was what she'd wanted—for Nathan to go.

Yet with each passing moment, she realized how desperately she needed space from him.

His mere presence, every glance and gesture, still had the power to unravel her completely.

###Chapter 414

Evelyn was resolute in breaking free from the past.
All she wanted now was to carve her own destiny, far away from Nathan Black.

Little did she know, Nathan hadn't actually left the hospital.
He stepped aside, pulled out his phone, and dialed Walter. "Escort Evelyn home," he ordered tersely.

As the call ended, frustration coiled tightly in his chest.
Why was he still doing this?
Evelyn had made it painfully clear she wanted nothing to do with him.

Yet, leaving her alone in that state was unthinkable.
Nathan raked a hand through his hair, torn between duty and desire.
The divorce had left him feeling like a stranger to himself.

He barely recognized the man he'd become.
Only when Evelyn limped into Walter's car did Nathan finally turn away.

At The Velvet Lounge, a voice cut through the murmur of conversation.
"Did you hear? Nathan Black and Evelyn Hartley are already divorced."

Lila Sinclair froze mid-step, her stiletto hovering above the marble floor.
Her pulse spiked as the words registered.
Divorced? Already?

A man at the nearby booth leaned in conspiratorially.
"That news has been circulating in our circles for weeks."

"But why would Black suddenly divorce her?"

"Isn't it obvious?" Another man smirked, swirling his whiskey. "Serena Cole. Evelyn pushed her down the stairs, and bam—divorce papers filed the next day."

A third guest sighed dramatically.
"Seems Black never stopped loving his ex after all. If Leonard Grant hadn't forced them apart years ago, Serena would be Mrs. Black by now."

Lila's lips curled into a triumphant smile.
This was better than she'd dared hope.

"Honestly," a voice sneered, "Evelyn's downfall was inevitable. Imagine being discarded right after your true identity as Black's wife was revealed. Pathetic."

"But Leonard clearly favors her as a daughter-in-law. He defended her publicly at the gala."

"What does that matter?" The first man scoffed. "The Grant empire answers to Nathan now. Without his affection, Evelyn's nothing. We should all start paying our respects to Serena—she's clearly the future."

Lila's manicured nails dug into her clutch.
Finally, karma was delivering justice.
She'd always known Nathan could never truly love that nobody.

The champagne in her glass suddenly tasted sweeter.
This called for celebration.

###Chapter 415

Lila Sinclair couldn't suppress the smug satisfaction curling in her chest. Without the Black family's protection, how long could Evelyn Hartley keep up her haughty act? The thought alone made her lips curl into a smirk as she strolled toward the restroom, humming a carefree tune under her breath.

Meanwhile, Evelyn had just returned to the Caldwell residence after leaving the hospital. The moment she stepped inside, she found Cassandra Blake and Julian Montgomery in the living room, along with Olivia Sinclair and Ethan Caldwell.

"Evelyn, you're back!" Olivia exclaimed, immediately rising from the sofa the second she spotted her.

"Olivia," Evelyn greeted with a soft smile, moving toward her.

But Olivia's expression darkened the moment she noticed Evelyn's uneven gait. She rushed forward, concern etching deep lines across her forehead. "What happened to you?"

"Just a minor sprain. It's nothing serious," Evelyn dismissed lightly, waving a hand.

"You need to be more careful," Olivia chided, her voice laced with worry. She reached out, gently steadying Evelyn by the arm, her touch feather-light yet firm.

"Evelyn," Cassandra called out softly, her tone dripping with false sympathy. She hurried over as well, reaching for Evelyn's other arm as if eager to help.

"I'm fine, really," Evelyn insisted, subtly pulling away from Cassandra's grasp.

"Let us assist you," Cassandra murmured, her grip tightening just slightly. "It'll ease our minds."

Once seated on the sofa, Evelyn couldn't help but study Cassandra from the corner of her eye.

Though she had no concrete proof that Cassandra and Julian had drugged her that night, the suspicion clung to her like a second skin.

Cassandra met her gaze head-on, offering a saccharine smile that didn’t reach her eyes. Her expression remained perfectly composed, betraying nothing.

After a while, Cassandra and Julian excused themselves politely.

The moment they were inside their car, Julian turned to Cassandra, his face grim. "Did you notice how Evelyn was looking at you? Do you think she suspects something?"

Cassandra didn’t so much as flinch. "What is there to worry about?" Her voice was steady, almost bored.

A slow, calculated smile curled her lips.

"Evelyn has nothing but baseless suspicions. That drug leaves no trace. No matter how hard she digs, she’ll find nothing."

That night, Cassandra had indeed tampered with Evelyn’s drink—not with an aphrodisiac, but with an experimental alcohol enhancer she’d procured from the black market. The effects had been more potent than she’d anticipated, confirming the drug’s strength.

But she hadn’t expected Evelyn’s extreme reaction after getting drunk. As a result, her plan with Julian had failed spectacularly.

"You’re right," Julian conceded with a stiff nod. Then, his expression darkened. "Looking back, it’s a good thing our plan didn’t succeed. Otherwise..."

Cassandra’s jaw clenched. "Who would’ve guessed Evelyn is Nathan Black’s wife?"

###Chapter 416

"At this point, I'm afraid we can't proceed with our plan," Julian murmured, his voice laced with hesitation. The mere thought of crossing Nathan's wife sent a chill down his spine.

Cassandra clenched her fists, frustration twisting her features. "Damn it, this is infuriating! We had the perfect opportunity! Why did Evelyn have to be Mr. Black's wife?"

After a tense pause, she added through gritted teeth, "Now, convincing Evelyn to marry you and securing an alliance with the head of the Caldwell family is impossible. But we shouldn't abandon all efforts to get close to her."

"Building a favorable relationship with her could still benefit us."

Julian was about to agree when realization struck. "However, given our last encounter, Evelyn is wary of us now. It won't be easy to arrange private meetings with her anymore."

Cassandra's eyes darkened as she lowered her voice. "We'll find a way."

Julian fell silent, the weight of her words settling heavily between them.

In the grand living room of the Caldwell residence, Olivia's voice was thick with disbelief. "You're serious? The two of you divorced?"

Beside her, Ethan frowned, his concern evident.

"Was this your decision or Nathan's?" Olivia pressed, her tone sharp. The answer mattered more than she let on.

"It was mine," Evelyn replied, her voice steady.

Olivia's expression softened slightly. "That's somewhat better."

"Did the recent incident push you to end things with Nathan?" Ethan asked, his gaze searching.

Evelyn shook her head gently. "No, it wasn't just one event. There were too many unresolved issues that slowly drained my hope for our relationship. That's why I chose to walk away."

She paused briefly before continuing, her tone composed. "It was a well-considered choice." Her face betrayed no sorrow, though her fingers tightened imperceptibly around her teacup.

Evelyn pressed her lips together, then met Olivia's gaze. "Olivia, do you remember our phone conversation that day?"

Caught off guard, Olivia hesitated before offering a small smile. "So, you felt being with Nathan brought you more pain than happiness? Is that what led to this?"

"Yes." Evelyn nodded. "I won't deny that I haven't fully let go of him. His words and actions still affect me more than they should. But with time, I believe that influence will fade, and I'll move on completely."

Despite her calm delivery, a dull ache settled in her chest, and the back of her throat burned.

Olivia and Ethan exchanged glances after Evelyn's confession.

After a beat, Olivia spoke up. "You've made your choice, and we support you. Nathan is just one man—there are plenty of others out there! Someone far better suited for you will come along."

Ethan nodded firmly. "Absolutely! With Evelyn's qualities, she’ll have no trouble finding someone who treats her right."

Olivia's eyes gleamed with sudden determination. "Now that Evelyn is single, we should arrange some introductions for her. I'll have a list prepared by tomorrow."

###Chapter 417

Evelyn gasped in shock. "Olivia! That's completely unnecessary," she protested immediately.

But Olivia wouldn't budge. "Unnecessary? It's absolutely crucial! We must begin arranging introductions for you immediately. If you meet the right person, you could date for eighteen months before considering marriage. Honestly, we're already behind schedule."

"No, Olivia, that's far too rushed." Evelyn shot Ethan a pleading glance, silently begging for intervention.

Hiding his amusement, Ethan turned to Olivia with a gentle smile. "Your heart's in the right place, but let's not move too quickly."

"Evelyn just ended her marriage. She needs time to heal before considering new relationships. Perhaps we should wait a few months before matchmaking."

Evelyn nodded vigorously. "Exactly, Olivia. I need more time, please."

Olivia considered their words before declaring, "Fine. I'll postpone the introductions by five days."

Evelyn's jaw dropped. "Five days? Olivia, isn't that still—"

"Too long?" Olivia interrupted sharply. "Would three days be better then?"

Evelyn found herself speechless. After all, these were just preliminary meetings—nothing binding.

With a resigned sigh, Evelyn conceded. "Five days is acceptable."

"That's my girl." Olivia beamed triumphantly.

Forcing a tight smile, Evelyn chose silence.

At the Sterling mansion, Lila returned home and sought out Victor in his study.

"Lila? What brings you here?" Victor inquired when she entered.

Cutting straight to the point, Lila revealed, "Father, at Nostalgia Lounge today, I overheard something shocking. People were saying Mr. Black and Evelyn have divorced."

"What?" Victor exploded from his chair, face contorted with shock.

Lila hesitated before continuing, "It's just gossip, but they're saying at Leonard's birthday party, Evelyn pushed Serena down the stairs. Mr. Black was so enraged he divorced her immediately."

Victor's face darkened with uncontrollable fury. "That imbecile!" he spat, veins bulging at his temples.

Evelyn and Nathan's marriage had lasted years. While the Sterlings hadn't gained financially from the Black family, the connection carried immense prestige. Especially after Leonard formally acknowledged Evelyn, Victor's life had transformed—business deals flowed effortlessly, people treated him with newfound respect. It was everything he'd ever wanted.

Now, just as he basked in this golden era, news of the divorce spread. The Sterlings would become laughingstocks! Worse still, the reason made it painfully clear who Nathan truly loved—Serena. Evelyn wasn't just discarded; she'd been exposed as nothing more than an obstacle between the star-crossed lovers.

###Chapter 418

The realization burned through him like wildfire, making his knuckles turn white with tension. How could he possibly face anyone now?

"Father," Lila murmured with deceptive sweetness, "I think Evelyn must be devastated right now. Shouldn't we call to see how she's doing?" Her words only intensified Victor's scowl.

Drawing a sharp breath through clenched teeth, he growled, "You're right, Lila. I should call her immediately."

Watching Victor's reaction, Lila barely suppressed her smirk. She knew exactly how this would play out. Her father would unleash his fury on Evelyn, just as planned. The memory of Evelyn rejecting her help that day still amused her. Why bother explaining when Nathan had already chosen Serena over her without hesitation? Though her initial plans had failed, this outcome was far more satisfying.

"Lila," Victor's sharp voice snapped her from her thoughts, "hand me your phone."

Her eyes widened in feigned surprise. "Oh? Of course." She hesitated just long enough to seem natural before retrieving her phone.

Victor snatched it with grim determination and dialed Evelyn's number.

At the Caldwell residence, Evelyn had just collapsed into an armchair when Lila's name flashed on her screen. She stared at the caller ID, her brow furrowing, before finally answering.

"You foolish girl!" Victor's enraged voice exploded through the receiver.

Evelyn's lips curled into a frosty smile. "Mr. Sterling," she replied icily. "To what do I owe this... pleasure?"

Victor wasted no time. "Evelyn, is it true you and Mr. Black divorced?"

The question caught Evelyn off guard. She hadn't expected him to know so soon. It didn't take long to realize Grace must have spread the news. With the truth out, there was no point denying it.

"Yes," she answered briskly.

Victor's expression darkened instantly, his fury palpable even through the phone. "You idiot!" he roared. "This is entirely your fault! If you hadn't pushed Serena down those stairs, Mr. Black would never have divorced you! Everyone knows how important she is to him. How dare you provoke him like that? Were you deliberately sabotaging yourself?"

A bitter taste filled Evelyn's mouth. Her father truly didn't care about her at all. Yet in his tirade, he'd accidentally spoken one truth: Serena was indeed the most important person to Nathan.

With eerie calmness, Evelyn asked, "Who told you Nathan initiated the divorce?"

There was a brief silence before Victor responded, "What are you implying? If Mr. Black didn't file... Are you saying you were the one who asked for the divorce?"

"That's correct," Evelyn replied coolly. "I filed for divorce."

Victor's mind reeled. "What?!"

###Chapter 419

"I've made myself perfectly clear. Do I need to repeat it?" Evelyn's voice was icy, cutting through the tension like a blade.

For a moment, Victor Sterling thought he had misheard. "You!" he finally bellowed, his face turning crimson with rage. "Have you lost your mind? How dare you demand a divorce?"

Beside him, Lila Sinclair stiffened in shock. Had she heard correctly?

Evelyn Hartley—the woman who had once been utterly devoted to Nathan Black—was the one who had initiated the divorce? It seemed impossible. Lila was certain Evelyn was lying out of wounded pride.

Evelyn's voice sliced through the silence, sharp and unyielding. "Why shouldn’t I be the one to ask for a divorce?"

Victor’s expression twisted with fury, his self-control shattering. His words spilled out, venomous and cruel.

"Evelyn, you are nothing but an illegitimate child of this family. The fact that Mr. Black married you was the greatest stroke of luck you’ll ever have! With your pitiful background, you should be groveling in gratitude that he even looked at you! And yet, you have the audacity to demand a divorce? Who do you think you are? Know your place!"

The moment his tirade ended, silence descended—heavy and suffocating, both in the study and over the phone.

Evelyn clutched her phone so tightly her knuckles turned white. Her heart felt as though it had been stabbed, her eyes burning with unshed tears. But she refused to let them fall.

Lila stared at Victor in disbelief. She had always known he was cold toward Evelyn, but hearing him lash out like this still stunned her.

After what felt like an eternity, Victor seemed to realize the weight of his words. His lips pressed into a thin line.

Just as he was about to speak, Evelyn’s voice cut through the silence. "Mr. Sterling," she said, her tone eerily calm, "am I truly your daughter?"

Victor froze. A flicker of unease passed through his eyes before his expression hardened again.

Within seconds, he regained his composure. "Evelyn, what kind of nonsense is this?" he snapped. "Now that you have the Caldwell family’s backing, you think you can discard your own father?"

Evelyn let out a derisive laugh at his baseless accusations. "I’ve never heard a father speak to his daughter the way you just did."

Victor took a sharp breath. "Evelyn, I demand you apologize to Mr. Black immediately! Tell him your decision was a mistake. Beg for his forgiveness and reconcile at once!"

Evelyn scoffed. "Mr. Sterling, my divorce from Nathan is final. Your approval—or lack thereof—changes nothing. If there’s nothing else, this conversation is over. And please, don’t contact me unless absolutely necessary."

She didn’t wait for his response before ending the call.

Emotions surged within her, dragging her spirits down like an anchor. But she refused to dwell on it. She had known for years that Victor held no affection for her. What kindness could she possibly expect from him now?

Taking a deep breath, Evelyn set down her phone and walked toward the bathroom. She reminded herself not to let the words of someone so insignificant wound her.

Yet, Victor’s cruel words echoed in her mind.

It wasn’t just him. Many saw her marriage to Nathan as a godsend for an illegitimate daughter like her. She was supposed to be grateful.

That was why everyone thought she had lost her mind when they learned she was the one who had asked for the divorce.

###Chapter 420

Evelyn Hartley had reached her breaking point with Nathan Black. His complete indifference had shattered whatever lingering affection she might have held. Standing under the scalding shower spray, she let the water cascade over her face, wishing it could wash away the pain as easily as it rinsed away her tears.

The night brought no respite. Each time exhaustion dragged Evelyn into sleep, nightmares yanked her back awake. By dawn, dark circles shadowed her bloodshot eyes as she mechanically prepared for another day at the hospital.

Lila Sinclair's smirk was barely concealed when she intercepted Evelyn in the corridor. "Evelyn," she purred, feigning concern, "since you and Mr. Black are... no longer together, perhaps I could help clear your name? Who knows - maybe there's still a chance for reconciliation?" The venomous delight beneath her words was unmistakable.

Evelyn's bitter laugh echoed down the sterile hallway. "This is exactly what you've been waiting for, isn't it, dear sister?"

Lila's gasp was theatrical. "How could you think that? As family, I'm hurt you'd—"

"Save it," Evelyn cut in coldly. "Regardless of my marital status, Nathan would never look twice at you. Not now, not ever." Shouldering past her stepsister, Evelyn strode toward her office without a backward glance.

Lila's perfectly manicured nails dug into her palms. That pathetic woman had no idea what was coming. In every measurable way - pedigree, beauty, connections - she outclassed Evelyn Hartley. And soon, Nathan Black would realize it too.

The afternoon sun cast long shadows when Nathan emerged from Serena Cole's private room. He barely registered Lila's presence until she stepped into his path, her designer dress clinging to carefully curated curves.

"Mr. Black," she breathed, "might we talk?" Her lashes fluttered with practiced demureness.

Nathan's expression remained impassive. "We have nothing to discuss." He moved to step around her.

Lila's hand shot out, fingers brushing his sleeve. "It's about Evelyn." The name dripped from her lips like poison.

Nathan froze. For the first time, his glacial gaze focused on her face. Lila suppressed a triumphant smile. She had his attention now. The game was afoot.

###Chapter 421

At the mention of Evelyn's name, Nathan froze mid-stride. He turned slightly, his piercing gaze locking onto Lila with calculated intensity. "What exactly are you trying to say?"

Lila swallowed hard, relieved he was listening but irritated by his icy demeanor. She steadied herself before speaking again, her voice trembling just enough to sound sincere.

"I hope you won't blame Evelyn too harshly," she began, choosing her words with care. "I believe she acted impulsively when she accidentally pushed Serena down the stairs. It wasn't deliberate. Wouldn't it be a tragedy to let such a moment destroy your marriage?"

Nathan arched an eyebrow, his expression unreadable. "So you're also convinced Evelyn pushed Serena?"

Lila hesitated, thrown off balance by his direct question. "I..." she stammered, feigning reluctance as if burdened by a heavy secret.

Nathan's sharp eyes narrowed. "Speak plainly," he commanded coldly.

Taking a shaky breath, Lila blurted out, "I witnessed it!"

His gaze turned razor-sharp. "You saw it?" he echoed. "You're claiming you actually saw Evelyn push Serena?"

"Yes," Lila nodded, pausing briefly before confirming her statement.

Nathan fell silent, his face an impassive mask that revealed nothing. Lila couldn't decipher his thoughts, and the uncertainty gnawed at her. Attempting to gauge his reaction, she softened her tone. "Mr. Black, I don't believe Evelyn meant to do it. You were married before—you understand her better than anyone. How about this? As Evelyn's sister, I'll apologize to Serena on her behalf. Please... Don't hold this against Evelyn any longer."

Lila straightened, confidence returning as she played the role of the devoted, selfless sister. She was certain Nathan would be impressed by her sincerity.

But his gaze only grew colder. "Are you absolutely certain you saw Evelyn push Serena?" he pressed.

"Yes," Lila affirmed, nodding firmly, though a flicker of unease shone in her eyes.

Did Nathan know something she didn't?

Instead of responding immediately, Nathan let out a soft chuckle—a sound that sent chills down Lila's spine.

"I despise being lied to," he said, his voice low but cutting. "Ms. Sinclair, if I discover you've deceived me, the consequences will be more than you can bear."

Lila's eyes widened instantly. She quickly averted her gaze, masking the panic rising within her. Her heart pounded violently. The more her fear grew, the harder she fought to maintain composure. She had already committed to the lie—there was no turning back now. She had to stick to her story. If she confessed the truth to Nathan, the fallout would be catastrophic. She had no choice but to gamble that Nathan possessed no proof Evelyn hadn't pushed Serena intentionally.
###Chapter 422

When Lila thought of that, the storm in her gaze stilled, replaced by carefully cultivated composure. She forced a small, practiced smile and met Nathan's piercing stare.

"Don't worry, Mr. Black," she said smoothly. "I'm telling the truth."

Nathan tilted his head slightly, his voice laced with quiet intensity. "Are you now?"

With that, he turned away, his broad shoulders and commanding presence making the air feel heavier as he left. Lila exhaled sharply once he was gone, her fingers trembling slightly at her sides. Nathan had a way of making the room shrink around him, his mere presence enough to make her pulse race. But the lie was already out there. Now, she could only hope he'd never dig deep enough to uncover what she'd hidden.

Biting her lip, Lila spun on her heel and strode off.

After her shift, Evelyn returned to Sterling Manor, exhaustion weighing on her shoulders. At dinner, Grace kept sneaking extra helpings onto Evelyn's plate, her worried glances impossible to ignore.

Evelyn set her fork down with a sigh. "Mom, why are you looking at me like I'm a stranger?"

Grace hesitated, her lips parting before she found the words. "It's just... I'm concerned."

Evelyn offered a faint smile, though her gaze dropped to her plate. "There's no need. I'm fine."

"Evelyn," Grace began carefully, "I know this hasn't been easy. Maybe you should talk to Mr. Black again. There might still be a way—"

"Did Victor put you up to this?" Evelyn's voice turned sharp, her eyes flashing up.

Grace sighed in frustration. "Evelyn, he's your father. And he's not wrong. You still have feelings for Nathan, don't you? If that's the case, then why not—"

"Why not what?" Eleanor's cool voice cut in, her expression unreadable.

Grace fell silent under Eleanor's stern gaze.

Eleanor's tone was measured. "Evelyn knows what she's doing. We shouldn't interfere under the guise of concern."

Grace nodded. "I understand."

Eleanor's expression softened slightly as she turned to Evelyn. "You have surgery tomorrow morning. Make sure you rest well tonight."

Evelyn gave a brief nod. "I will."

Grace's eyes flickered with something unspoken before she smiled. "Yes, tomorrow's a big day—your first surgery as attending physician. You should be well-rested."

###Chapter 423

Eleanor Sinclair's brow creased as she responded, "This isn't about making history. It's about what's best for the patient."

Grace Monroe pressed her lips together briefly before answering, "I understand. I was merely making conversation."

She turned back to Evelyn Hartley, curiosity brightening her features. "When is the procedure scheduled?"

"Tomorrow at eight in the morning," Evelyn replied.

Eleanor's expression softened with concern. "Will your injured ankle interfere with your performance?" she asked.

Evelyn offered a reassuring smile. "Don't worry, Grandma. I'll manage just fine."

Eleanor nodded. "That's good to hear."

The following morning, as Evelyn prepared to leave for the hospital, Grace approached her holding a container. "Here." She extended it toward Evelyn. "I made you breakfast. Take it with you."

Evelyn blinked in surprise. It had been years since her mother had prepared breakfast for her.

Grace gently pushed the container into her arms with a soft smile. "Well? Don't just stand there. Take it," she urged.

Evelyn's lips curved slightly. "Thank you, Mom." She tucked the container under her arm and left the house, unaware that this day would be anything but ordinary. A day that would nearly claim her life.

Evelyn arrived at the hospital early and quickly changed into her white coat. She retrieved the breakfast Grace had prepared and began eating. Though she disliked the artichoke dish, she finished everything, not wanting to waste food.

With breakfast done, she started preparing for the upcoming surgery. When the time came, Evelyn proceeded to the operating room. Today marked her debut as lead surgeon, a significant milestone since her promotion to attending physician.

The surgery began smoothly. The resident doctors and surgical nurses assisting Evelyn were impressed by her speed and precision. Her movements were both swift and fluid, as if she had decades of experience.

But during a critical moment, her colleagues noticed an unexpected tremor in her hand as she held the scalpel.

"Dr. Hartley, are you alright?" one of the doctors asked, breaking the tense silence.

Evelyn's face tightened momentarily. She shook her head calmly. "I'm fine."

She dismissed the incident and continued the procedure. As the surgery progressed, however, Evelyn's breathing became shallow, and her hands trembled again. Still, she remained determined to complete the operation.

She couldn't afford distractions now, not at this pivotal moment. She steadied herself, focusing intently. Yet as time passed, she grew increasingly uncomfortable.

###Chapter 424

Evelyn's breathing became increasingly labored, perspiration forming along her hairline faster than she could wipe it away.

"Dr. Hartley, are you certain you're alright? You don't look well," one of the surgeons voiced his concern, his brow furrowed.

"Dr. Hartley, please," another doctor interjected urgently, "if you're unwell, you must tell us immediately. Don't push yourself beyond your limits."

Evelyn drew a deep breath, her voice carrying a slight tremor as she responded, "I know my own body better than anyone. I'm perfectly capable of continuing this procedure."

She recognized these symptoms all too well - the unmistakable signs of an allergic reaction. Yet the source of the allergen remained a mystery.

Suddenly, a violent spurt of blood erupted from the surgical site.

"Dr. Hartley! We've got a major hemorrhage!" a nurse cried out in alarm.

With laser focus, Evelyn pinpointed the bleeding source. "Dr. Hartley! The patient's BP is crashing!" the same nurse shouted again, her voice thick with panic.

Despite the escalating crisis, Evelyn maintained perfect composure, her expression revealing nothing but intense concentration.

Two attending physicians exchanged knowing glances. They'd been quietly instructed by Dominic that should Evelyn falter during this surgery, they weren't to intervene immediately. If she showed any weakness, they were to suggest bringing in another surgeon.

This was Evelyn's first procedure as lead surgeon. Any misstep would give Dominic the perfect opportunity to question her competence.

Seizing the moment, one doctor cautiously asked, "What's our next move here?"

"Perhaps we should call for backup?" the other suggested, his tone carefully neutral.

The scrub nurse frowned, urgency coloring her voice. "We're at a critical juncture! Bringing in another surgeon now would waste precious time. Every second we delay increases the patient's risk!"

"But continuing like this will only worsen the patient's condition!" the first doctor countered, frustration bleeding into his tone.

"Enough!" Evelyn's sharp command sliced through the tension.

The OR fell silent, all eyes turning toward her.

She took a steadying breath before speaking. "There's no need for additional surgeons. I have this under control." Her voice rang with quiet confidence.

But one doctor remained unconvinced. "Dr. Hartley, I understand this is your first lead surgery and that its success is important for your career. But this isn't about your pride - it's about the patient's life. Given the circumstances, you can't handle this alone. If we don't get help immediately, we're risking the patient's survival!"

Evelyn paused, her grip tightening around the scalpel.

###Chapter 425

Her breath caught for just a second. Then, with slow, measured control, she exhaled and steadied herself.

Her hands moved with practiced precision. Allergic reactions weren’t new to her—she knew her limits. She was certain she could handle this. There wasn’t a shred of doubt in her mind.

Besides, as the nurse had reminded her, the patient’s condition was too dire to wait for another surgeon.

"Nurse, wipe my sweat," Evelyn ordered, her voice rough but unwavering.

"Right away, Dr. Hartley." The nurse quickly dabbed at the beads of perspiration forming on Evelyn’s forehead.

Her breathing had turned shallow and labored now. Her throat tightened, her skin burned with relentless itching, and heat radiated from her flushed face beneath the surgical mask. Still, she pushed forward, forcing her focus onto the procedure. Just a little longer, she told herself. The patient’s life hung in the balance—failure wasn’t an option.

"Dr. Hartley," the skeptical doctor spoke up again, his tone laced with thinly veiled mockery. "You’re overexerting yourself. If you collapse, the patient will suffer for it."

"Honestly, you should—" another doctor began.

But before he could finish, a nurse’s voice cut through. "The bleeding’s stopped! Blood pressure’s rising!" she announced, surprise evident in her tone.

"What?" The two doctors leaned in, eyes widening as they stared at the monitors.

The entire surgical team froze, disbelief shifting to awe. The patient’s vitals were stabilizing. Despite her worsening condition, Evelyn had pulled it off. Admiring glances flickered toward her from every corner of the room.

Evelyn’s focus never wavered, her hands moving with deft precision as she continued working.

After what felt like an eternity, she finally spoke, her voice strained but firm. "Prepare for suturing."

The doubtful doctor stepped forward. "Dr. Hartley, let us handle the sutures. You’ve done more than enough."

Evelyn gave a weak nod. She opened her mouth to respond, but the words never came. Her vision blurred, the operating room spinning violently around her.

Before anyone could react, her legs gave out, and she crumpled to the floor. "Dr. Hartley!" "Someone call for help!" "Is she breathing?"

When Evelyn came to, it felt like a thick wad of cotton had been shoved down her throat, choking her breath and leaving behind an unbearable, maddening itch. Her entire body burned with uncontrollable irritation.

Lifting her arm, she examined it—tiny, angry red welts covered her skin, clustered so densely they looked like a grotesque patchwork. The sight alone would’ve sent anyone with trypophobia into a panic.

###Chapter 426

Evelyn's chest constricted as she realized her face must be equally covered in those angry red welts. With a defeated exhale, she forced herself upright and grabbed a surgical mask. At least this would spare others the horror of her current state.

She had just settled back against the pillows when the hospital room door burst open with an ominous creak. In walked Leonard and Nathan.

"Evelyn, what happened?" Leonard demanded, his cane striking the floor rapidly as he hurried to her bedside. Deep worry lines etched across his forehead.

Evelyn blinked in surprise. "Leonard... I mean, Mr. Grant? What are you doing here?" She fumbled over the address, quickly correcting herself as if remembering something important.

Nathan's expression darkened instantly, his jaw clenching. "Mr. Grant?" It seemed Evelyn was determined to put distance between herself and his father—and by extension, him.

Leonard's eyebrows shot up, his exasperation palpable. "I heard you collapsed during surgery! Do you know how terrifying that was? I nearly had a stroke rushing over here."

Evelyn offered a weak smile, her voice barely above a whisper. "I'm sorry for worrying you."

"But as you can see, I'm perfectly fine."

Leonard's face clouded over, his voice rising. "Fine? Look at yourself! Covered in hives, struggling to breathe, and you call this fine? You knew you were having an allergic reaction yet insisted on finishing that surgery! What were you thinking? The attending physician said if you'd arrived even thirty seconds later, you might not have made it!"

His grip on the cane tightened. The memory of how close Evelyn had come to death still shook him. She clearly didn't value her own life enough.

Evelyn shifted uncomfortably. "It wasn't that serious. I've had reactions like this before. I know my limits. That patient's life was hanging by a thread—if I'd left, they might have died. I couldn't just abandon them."

Leonard's eyes blazed with frustration. "You think you know your limits? That's dangerously naive! Every situation is different. What if this time had been worse? What if you'd died? You're so focused on saving others that you completely disregard yourself. Do you have any idea how terrified I was?" His voice cracked with emotion.

Evelyn's defiance wavered, her gaze dropping to the sheets. "You're right. I'm sorry. I was wrong, and I promise it won't happen again. Please don't be too upset—it's not good for your health."

Leonard shook his head, releasing a long, weary sigh. "You... You'll be the death of me one day."

An uncomfortable silence settled over the room, broken only by the steady beep of hospital monitors. Nathan, who had remained silent at the foot of the bed, studied Evelyn intently.

###Chapter 427

Nathan's piercing gaze traveled over Evelyn's trembling hands before settling on the inflamed red welts peeking out from beneath her medical mask. The angry rash spread across her forehead and around her delicate eyes.

An unfamiliar tightness gripped his chest. Seeing Evelyn in such distress sent waves of discomfort through him. The sight was unbearable.

Suddenly, a realization struck him. "Did you know you're allergic to artichokes?" His deep voice cut through the sterile hospital air.

Evelyn's eyelashes fluttered at the sound of Nathan's voice. Since he and Leonard had entered her room, she'd deliberately avoided acknowledging his presence - not even granting him a single glance. Yet now, her traitorous heart skipped a beat at his familiar tone.

The meaning of his words finally registered. "Allergic to artichokes?" she repeated, her tired eyes lifting to meet his intense stare.

"Yes." Nathan's voice dropped to a gravelly murmur, his dark eyes locking onto hers with unsettling intensity.

Evelyn quickly averted her gaze, her fingers nervously twisting the hospital blanket. "I... I had no idea," she admitted softly.

Nathan's jaw tightened. "When did you consume artichokes? Who served them to you?" The edge in his voice betrayed his concern.

"This morning," Evelyn confessed. "My mother prepared breakfast for me."

Nathan's expression darkened instantly. The crease between his brows deepened into a harsh line. "What was your mother thinking? Doesn't she know about your allergy?" The words came out sharper than intended.

Leonard turned toward Nathan with a knowing look, a faint smirk playing on his lips though he remained silent.

Evelyn shook her head weakly. "She couldn't have known. I've never eaten artichokes before today. If she'd known, she never would have included them."

"Still, that's incredibly careless," Leonard muttered, unable to mask his disapproval.

After a weighted pause, Leonard cleared his throat. "Evelyn, your only focus right now should be recovery. I don't want to see you back at work until you're completely healed. Understood?"

Evelyn nodded obediently. "Understood. Please don't worry about me."

Leonard rolled his eyes dramatically. "You always make me worry," he huffed before turning to Nathan with sudden authority. "Nathan, I'm assigning you a task. You'll stay here and monitor Evelyn's recovery. Ensure she doesn't sneak back to work prematurely."

Before Nathan could respond, Evelyn's face paled. "That's completely unnecessary!" she protested. "I promise I'll behave. There's no need to inconvenience Nathan like this."

###Chapter 428

Leonard dismissed her with a careless wave. "Your promises mean nothing to me. The decision is final. If you refuse Nathan's presence, I'll personally supervise you. Is that what you desire?"

Evelyn's shoulders sagged in resignation. "Leonard..."

"Enough," Leonard's voice cut through like steel. "I'm leaving now. Nathan remains with you."

He rose, turning his piercing gaze toward Nathan. "Watch over her. If anything happens, I'll hold you responsible."

With that, Leonard adjusted his cane and strode toward the door.

"Leonard!" Evelyn called out, one last attempt at protest.

But he didn't even glance back, merely offering a dismissive hand gesture as he exited.

The door clicked shut, plunging the room into heavy silence.

The air between Evelyn and Nathan grew thick with unspoken tension.

Before Nathan could speak, Evelyn shattered the quiet.

"You needn't waste your time here, Mr. Black," she said calmly. "Attend to your own affairs. I'll manage perfectly well alone."

Nathan's expression darkened. "Did you not hear Leonard's words?" His voice dripped with ice.

"I'm quite capable, Mr. Black. Should Leonard inquire, I'll confirm your diligent supervision. You've no cause for concern."

Evelyn maintained her composure, but her indifference only fueled Nathan's frustration.

He studied her with an intense, probing stare, as if his gaze could peel back layers to reveal her hidden thoughts.

Then, his lips curved into a knowing smirk.

"What frightens you so, Evelyn?" he murmured.

Her eyes narrowed almost imperceptibly at the question.

She lifted her chin, meeting his gaze directly.

"Afraid? What an odd notion, Mr. Black. Why ever would I fear anything concerning you?"

Nathan chuckled lowly. "Only you can answer that. If you're truly unafraid, why this desperate attempt to rid yourself of me? What about sharing this space terrifies you so?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together, exhaling slowly through her nose.

###Chapter 429

"I genuinely prefer not sharing space with you, Mr. Black," Evelyn stated, her composure unshaken.

Nathan's expression turned stormy at her words.

"We're divorced now," she continued evenly. "A clean break is what I want."

She hesitated briefly, as if weighing her next words carefully, then added with deliberate emphasis, "I have no interest in keeping connections with exes."

Nathan's face darkened further, a tempest of emotions swirling in his piercing gaze.

The atmosphere around him crackled with barely restrained tension.

Abruptly, he let out a humorless chuckle and gave a curt nod.

"Good. That saves us both unnecessary complications."

Without waiting for her response, he spun on his heel and strode out, the door slamming shut with finality behind him.

Silence engulfed the hospital room.

Evelyn lowered her gaze, her features carefully blank.

This was necessary, she reminded herself. The divorce was final—lingering attachments would only complicate matters.

She exhaled deeply, sinking back against the pillows and closing her eyes.

Outside in the corridor, Nathan remained rooted by the door.

His jaw clenched as unfamiliar frustration burned through him. Logically, this outcome was ideal—exactly what he'd wanted.

Yet Evelyn's icy detachment, her effortless dismissal, ignited something primal within him.

Drawing a steadying breath, he pulled out his phone and dialed Eleanor.

Inside the room, Evelyn lay motionless, exhaustion weighing her down yet sleep remaining elusive.

The creak of the door interrupted her thoughts.

She turned toward the sound, her expression hardening instantly.

"What do you want?" she demanded coldly.

Serena smiled sweetly as she wheeled closer to the bed. "Just checking on my dear sister-in-law."

Though half her face was obscured by a mask, the angry red rashes covering Evelyn's skin were unmistakable.

Serena's eyes gleamed with malicious satisfaction.

###Chapter 430

Evelyn couldn't help but feel a twisted satisfaction seeing Serena in such distress.

A dark part of her wished those angry red welts on Serena's face would never fade, leaving the woman permanently disfigured.

As for Serena, she eyed Evelyn warily, unsure why her rival had suddenly appeared.

They hadn't crossed paths since Leonard's birthday gala.

"What do you want?" Serena snapped, her voice sharp as broken glass.

"Oh, nothing important," Evelyn replied with saccharine sweetness. "I simply heard you collapsed during surgery and thought I'd check on you."

Serena's expression remained stony, offering no response. Noticing the silence, Evelyn pressed further. "Did you and Nathan finalize the divorce?"

She already knew the answer but wanted to hear the words from Serena's own lips.

Serena looked up, a bitter smirk twisting her features. "Yes, it's done. Congratulations - you finally got what you wanted after waiting so long for us to split. Your little scheme worked perfectly."

"Scheme?" Evelyn feigned innocence, her eyes widening with theatrical shock. "Ms. Hartley, I have no idea what you're implying."

"Cut the act," Serena hissed, her nails digging into the hospital sheets. "We're alone here, Evelyn. That night at Leonard's party, you threw yourself down those stairs and blamed me. Have you no dignity left?"

Evelyn's face morphed into a mask of wounded virtue. "How dare you accuse me! You pushed me! And now you're trying to twist the truth?"

She'd never admit to framing Serena.

That would be idiotic. Even in this private room, who knew if Serena was recording their conversation?

Serena had expected this denial.

She simply stared at Evelyn with icy detachment. "We both know what really happened."

"I'm tired of your games. Get out. I need rest."

The dismissal was clear, but Evelyn remained rooted to the spot, a triumphant smile playing on her lips.

"If you're asking whether I'm pleased about your divorce from Nathan, then absolutely. But let's be honest - this was inevitable. Nathan only married you because of me. He never cared for you, not even for a second. Now that I'm back and Leonard can't control him anymore, of course he'd leave you. With you gone, what was always mine has finally returned to me."

Her voice dripped with smug certainty, as if stating an undeniable truth.

###Chapter 431

A sudden realization seemed to strike Serena, her lips curling into a triumphant smirk. "Oh, I almost forgot," she purred, her voice dripping with false sweetness. "Nathan told me he'd marry me whenever I say the word. When our wedding day comes, you simply must attend!"

The venomous intent behind her words was unmistakable—this entire visit had been carefully orchestrated to wound Evelyn.

Of course, Nathan had never actually promised to marry her. That was nothing but a vicious fabrication.

But truth didn't matter to Serena. All that mattered was watching Evelyn's heart shatter beneath her carefully aimed barbs.

Each syllable struck Evelyn like shards of glass, embedding themselves deep in her chest.

For one terrifying moment, the world tilted, her lungs refusing to cooperate as the air turned to lead in her throat.

She clenched her fists, nails biting into her palms as she fought to maintain her composure. Not a single crack in her armor would she allow.

Drawing a steadying breath, she met Serena's gaze with icy precision. "Naturally," she replied, her voice colder than winter frost. "I wouldn't miss it."

"Perfect! Well, I won't take up any more of your time. Do get some rest."

With a final glittering smile, Serena wheeled herself out, the cheerful click of her wheelchair echoing down the hallway.

The moment the door shut, Evelyn's carefully constructed mask crumbled. All color drained from her face.

She'd known this was coming. From the moment the divorce papers were signed, Nathan's remarriage was inevitable.

Yet hearing the words spoken aloud still felt like having her ribs pried open with rusty pliers.

Hot tears threatened to spill as she squeezed her eyes shut, willing the pain away.

CRASH!

The door burst open with enough force to rattle the walls.

Evelyn's head snapped up, hastily blinking away unshed tears.

"Evelyn! Sweetheart, are you alright?" Grace's voice trembled with barely restrained panic as she rushed forward.

"Darling, how are you feeling?" Eleanor followed close behind, her aged hands fluttering anxiously.

Evelyn forced a weak smile. "I'm fine, really. There's no need to fuss."

Grace's face crumpled with guilt. "This is all my fault! I should never have put artichokes in your omelet. I had no idea about your allergy!"

Before anyone could react, Grace delivered two sharp slaps to her own cheeks. The sound cracked through the room like gunshots.

###Chapter 432

"Mom! Stop that!" Evelyn gasped in horror, bolting upright to seize Grace's wrist. "It was an accident. Why are you punishing yourself like this?"

Eleanor glared at Grace. "Grace, you must break this cycle of self-blame. You always do this when something goes wrong."

Grace pressed her lips into a thin line, remaining silent.

Eleanor continued firmly, "You can't hold yourself accountable. None of us knew about Evelyn's artichoke allergy. You shouldn't torture yourself for something you couldn't have known."

Grace's frown deepened. "But thinking about her collapsing during that surgery... I just can't—"

She paused, then continued with visible remorse. "If I hadn't made that breakfast, she wouldn't have had the allergic reaction. She fainted right in the middle of performing surgery and couldn't complete it successfully."

Her voice broke. "It was her first time leading as a surgeon! I... I can't stop blaming myself—"

Before Grace could continue, Evelyn interrupted, "Mom, please don't. I did complete the surgery successfully."

"What?" Grace's expression shifted dramatically.

Then realization dawned. She quickly schooled her features and asked suspiciously, "How could you have finished? Nathan told your grandmother you collapsed during the procedure. Evelyn, are you just saying this to make me feel better?"

Evelyn froze momentarily.

She hadn't expected Nathan would have shared those details with Eleanor.

Recovering quickly, she explained, "Yes, I did faint, but only after I'd pushed through to complete the surgery. The operation was successful."

"You... You foolish girl!" Grace's voice rose sharply, frustration etching her features. "You knew you were unwell yet chose to continue instead of getting help! Do you have no regard for your own safety?"

Grace's chest heaved with barely contained anger.

"She's right, Evelyn. That was dangerously reckless. Your health should always come first," Eleanor said, shaking her head disapprovingly.

Evelyn felt compelled to defend her actions. "The patient was critical. There wasn't time to call another surgeon."

"I've had allergic reactions before and knew I could last long enough. See? I'm fine now, aren't I?"

"You were playing Russian roulette with your life! You'll be the death of me!" Grace exclaimed, her anger palpable.

###Chapter 433

Evelyn softened her voice as she responded, "Please don't be upset, Mother. I won't take such reckless actions again."

Grace turned her face away, appearing to ignore Evelyn, yet a shadow of something unreadable flickered across her features for just a moment.

"Swear to me you'll never pull such a dangerous stunt again," Eleanor commanded, fixing Evelyn with a piercing glare.

"I promise! Truly!" Evelyn nodded fervently, her eyes shining with sincerity.

"That's better," Eleanor replied, her stern expression softening slightly.

After a brief pause, Eleanor added thoughtfully, "Now that we know Evelyn has an artichoke allergy, we'll eliminate them from all our meals moving forward."

As Lila reached for the hospital room door handle, ready to push it open, she froze mid-motion at Eleanor's words.

Her face underwent a subtle transformation as the implications sank in.

What had she just overheard?

Evelyn was allergic to artichokes?

Could this possibly mean...

A sudden realization struck Lila like lightning. Without wasting another second, she whirled around and rushed down the corridor.

Inside the private hospital suite, Eleanor suggested Grace stay overnight to monitor Evelyn, but Evelyn quickly protested, insisting she'd be perfectly fine alone.

After several rounds of gentle debate, Eleanor finally conceded with visible reluctance.

That evening at the Sterling family mansion...

A soft knock echoed through Diana's bedroom.

"Enter," came the muffled response from within.

Hearing permission granted, Lila turned the knob and stepped inside.

Diana looked up from her evening television program with a warm smile. "Lila, darling, what brings you here at this hour?"

Lila settled onto the plush sofa beside her mother. "There's something important I need to ask you."

Diana muted the television. "What's troubling you, sweetheart?"

"Evelyn and I share the same birthday, correct?" Lila cut straight to the chase, bypassing any pleasantries.

"Yes, that's right." Diana nodded, curiosity coloring her features. "Why do you ask?"

After a calculated pause, Lila continued, "Then... would you happen to know where Grace gave birth to Evelyn?"

"I'm afraid I don't have that information." Diana shook her head slowly, studying her daughter with growing confusion. "Lila, why are you suddenly interested in this?"

###Chapter 434

Lila Sinclair blinked rapidly before exhaling sharply. "It suddenly occurred to me today, so I had to ask. Every time I remember how Father betrayed you so early in your marriage, I feel this unbearable mix of fury and heartbreak!"

Diana Prescott's expression remained unreadable, her features schooled into perfect neutrality. "That chapter is closed," she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper.

Lila's eyes narrowed to slits, her lips pressing into a bloodless line.

With deliberate precision, she demanded, "Mother, I simply can't comprehend this. You're the strongest woman I know. Father betrayed you decades ago. Why endure it? Why not walk away?"

A flicker of tension crossed Diana's face before vanishing like morning mist.

"These are matters too complex for you to understand," she replied with practiced calm.

Lila's hands clenched into fists. "Mother! You always say that when I ask! I'm not a child anymore. Stop treating me like one! And don't feed me that nonsense about loving Father too much to leave. We both know that's not true. If you truly loved him, how could you tolerate his infidelity? How could you welcome Grace's bastard child into our home without protest?"

Diana's eyelashes fluttered briefly. "Your father bears sole responsibility for his actions. Evelyn is blameless in this."

Lila's frown deepened, frustration etching lines between her brows. "Fine, Evelyn's innocent. But what about Grace Monroe? You don't even treat that homewrecker with contempt! You simply ignore her existence! You've never lifted a finger against her! Even knowing she'd take your place the moment you left, you never cared! This isn't how someone in love behaves."

She drew a shuddering breath before continuing, "And let's not pretend otherwise - you and Father haven't shared a bedroom since I can remember. Mother, I need to understand why. Please, just tell me the truth."

Her voice cracked on the final plea.

Diana's brows knitted together as she listened, the lines around her mouth tightening.

Finally, she sighed. "Yes, there are... complications between your father and me. But Lila, now isn't the time for explanations. I promise you'll know everything when the time is right."

Lila bit down hard on her lower lip.

She'd expected this response.

Diana never surrendered secrets easily.

Yet despite knowing this, the unanswered questions burned like acid in her chest.

"Enough for tonight, Lila. Go to bed. I'm exhausted," Diana said, effectively dismissing her daughter.

"Goodnight, Mother." Defeated, Lila turned away.

###Chapter 435

"Sleep well," Diana murmured.

Lila Sinclair rose from the chair and exited her mother's bedroom.

The moment the door clicked shut, Lila's carefully maintained mask shattered.

Unease had coiled in her stomach all day.

The discovery that Evelyn Hartley shared Diana's artichoke allergy had unsettled her deeply.

What troubled her more was recalling Evelyn's identical seafood allergy - another eerie parallel to Diana's medical history.

Could such specific allergies truly be coincidental?

Or was there some hidden connection she hadn't uncovered?

The unanswered questions gnawed at her.

Her attempt to probe Diana for information had yielded nothing.

Lila's thoughts swirled like autumn leaves caught in a whirlwind.

A sudden realization made her inhale sharply, fingers tightening around the banister.

She forced herself to breathe evenly.

Perhaps she was imagining patterns where none existed.

Just another meaningless coincidence.

Biting her lower lip until she tasted copper, Lila retreated to her bedroom.


###Chapter 436

The moment Evelyn caught the sharp edge in Nathan's tone, her delicate brows arched slightly in response.

Nathan didn't beat around the bush. He cut straight to the chase.

"We've consulted your physician," he stated matter-of-factly. "He confirmed your allergic reaction was caused by consuming artichokes. Our investigation revealed the hospital cafeteria served no dishes containing artichokes yesterday. So where exactly did you have your breakfast?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together briefly before answering truthfully, "I didn't eat at the cafeteria. I had the breakfast my mother prepared for me."

Nathan's expression remained stern as he continued, "Dr. Hartley, you're well aware of Grand View General's regulations. All surgeons scheduled for procedures must consume only meals provided by the hospital cafeteria—emergency surgeries being the sole exception. This protocol exists to guarantee food safety and prevent any complications that might affect patients. You knew the rules. You knew you had surgery scheduled yesterday morning. Why then did you disregard protocol?"

Faced with Nathan's direct questioning, Evelyn bit her lower lip, momentarily speechless.

The hospital's policies were clear, and she'd knowingly violated them—all because she couldn't bring herself to reject Grace's thoughtful gesture.

"My mistake," Evelyn admitted without hesitation, offering no excuses.

Seeing her immediate acknowledgment, Nathan's rigid posture relaxed marginally.

"Very well," he conceded.

"Your violation of protocol caused your allergic reaction and endangered a patient. According to hospital regulations, disciplinary action will be taken. Any objections?"

Evelyn lowered her gaze. After a brief silence, she responded evenly, "None."

"Good. Focus on your recovery. Rest well."

With that, Nathan turned sharply and exited the room, his team filing out behind him.

The instant the door closed, Evelyn collapsed back onto her pillows, her body sinking into the crisp hospital sheets.

She'd expected this outcome long before it arrived.

Grand View General Hospital never compromised on its rules.

No exceptions. No special treatment. Consequences came for everyone equally.

In that regard, the institution maintained perfect equity among its staff.

Evelyn's disciplinary measures were implemented with startling efficiency.

Within two hours, the notice appeared on every bulletin board throughout the hospital.

The penalties were severe: a three-month suspension of Evelyn's performance bonuses coupled with an official reprimand to be circulated hospital-wide.

###Chapter 437

The hospital corridors buzzed with hushed whispers as doctors paused to read the disciplinary notice about Evelyn Hartley. Their expressions shifted between disbelief and unease.

A young resident shook his head. "Dr. Hartley violated protocol by skipping breakfast, but this punishment seems excessive."

"Exactly!" Another doctor chimed in. "She performed that emergency surgery while suffering an allergic reaction. The patient would've died without her quick thinking."

"Did you hear she collapsed right after completing the procedure? That's dedication!"

"Yet the Medical Board won't even acknowledge her sacrifice," muttered a nurse, adjusting her glasses.

The group fell silent until an OR nurse leaned in conspiratorially. "I know why this happened." All eyes turned toward her. "Dr. Pierce from Cardiac Surgery and Dr. Patel from the Medical Board... let's just say they're more than just colleagues."

Understanding dawned on their faces.

"So it's personal revenge?"

"Disgusting! Using official channels for private grudges."

The whispers grew more animated, though no one dared speak above a murmur. The Medical Board controlled their promotions and assignments - crossing them meant career suicide.

One by one, the doctors dispersed, but the scandal spread faster than any hospital gossip before. By lunchtime, every department knew about the injustice.

Meanwhile, Grace Monroe entered Evelyn's room carrying a steaming meal. Her face was tight with concern. "Evelyn, I saw the notice. This makes no sense! You saved a life under impossible conditions!"

She set down the food tray with a clatter. "Instead of praising your heroism, they're punishing you? What kind of twisted system is this?"

###Chapter 438

Evelyn sighed softly. "There's a strict policy at our hospital - all surgeons must eat in the cafeteria before operations. But that morning, I had the breakfast you so lovingly prepared at home. I ended up violating the rule."

"What?" Grace's eyes widened in disbelief. "Your hospital actually enforces such a regulation?"

"Yes," Evelyn confirmed with a gentle nod.

"Oh darling!" Grace's hands flew to her cheeks. "If there was such a rule, you should have skipped my breakfast! Now look what happened - not only did you have an allergic reaction, but you're facing consequences too. I feel absolutely terrible!" Her eyes immediately welled up with tears.

Evelyn reached out to comfort her. "Mother, please don't blame yourself. You woke up at dawn to make me that meal. How could I possibly refuse your kindness? None of us knew about my artichoke allergy. Without that, everything would have been fine. This isn't your fault at all."

With tender care, Evelyn dabbed at Grace's tear-streaked face with a tissue.

Sniffling, Grace spoke with heartfelt sincerity. "Evelyn, I take full responsibility! I promise this will never happen again. Starting today, our household will be completely free of seafood and artichokes."

A warm smile touched Evelyn's lips. "That's not necessary, Mother. The rest of you should enjoy whatever you like. Don't restrict yourselves because of me."

"Absolutely not!" Grace declared with sudden fierceness. "Those things harmed my precious daughter! Our entire family now despises them - we'll never touch such ingredients again!" Her voice trembled with protective anger.

Evelyn simply pressed her lips together in a quiet smile, choosing not to argue further.

"Sweetheart, are you thirsty? Let me get you some water," Grace offered gently.

"That would be lovely," Evelyn agreed.

Grace rose gracefully, taking the glass in her delicate hands as she moved toward the water dispenser. As she turned away, the faintest hint of a satisfied smile played at the corners of her mouth.

After spending some additional time with Evelyn, Grace finally gathered her things and departed with the empty lunch container.

Not long after, a firm knock sounded at the hospital room door.

The door swung open to reveal a tall, imposing figure silhouetted in the doorway.

Evelyn's breath caught as her pupils dilated sharply at the unexpected visitor.

It was Nathan.

Before she could utter a word, Nathan's assistant, Walter, entered carrying a thick stack of documents. Evelyn blinked in confusion. What was happening?

Walter placed the papers neatly on the side table, nodded respectfully to both Nathan and Evelyn, then discreetly exited the room.

"Nathan," Evelyn began cautiously, her brow furrowing slightly. "What brings you here?"

###Chapter 439

Nathan's face was like a thundercloud, his voice dripping with ice. "Father demanded I stay here with you today. Otherwise, I'd be locked out of the Grant mansion."

His piercing gaze swept over Evelyn. "Pretend I don't exist. This isn't my choice - just following Leonard's orders." The words cut through the air like shards of glass.

Snatching up a stack of files, he buried himself in paperwork.

Truth be told, Leonard's ultimatum had forced his hand.

Yet he could've refused.

Could've walked away.

Why had he agreed to stay with Evelyn? That was a question he deliberately avoided examining.

Evelyn's teeth sank into her lower lip, emotions churning too turbulent to voice.

Silence stretched between them.

She resolved to treat Nathan like furniture - present but insignificant.

More importantly, she needed to harden her heart against his presence.

With steely determination, Evelyn steadied her breathing.

The clock ticked relentlessly as neither spoke.

Nathan remained engrossed in documents while Evelyn scrolled through her phone.

An uneasy truce settled over the hospital room.

CRASH!

The door flew open with violent force.

Both heads snapped toward the intrusion.

Dylan wheeled Serena into the room, her wheelchair squeaking against the linoleum.

Twin frowns creased Evelyn and Nathan's foreheads.

Dylan opened his mouth - then froze at the sight of Nathan lounging on the sofa.

Their expressions morphed into identical masks of shock.

"Na-Nathan?" Serena's voice quivered. "What are you-"

His retort came like a whip crack. "I could ask you the same."

"We heard Ms. Hartley was hospitalized with allergic reactions," Dylan recovered smoothly. "Came to check on her."

Evelyn nearly snorted. Check on her? More like check on their handiwork.

Did they think her stupid enough to believe this charade?

Dylan's eyes narrowed. "Why are you here, Nathan?"

"Leonard's orders." Nathan's tone left no room for argument.

Serena's knuckles whitened around her wheelchair grips, her face twisting into something ugly.

###Chapter 440

The divorce papers were signed. Evelyn Hartley and Nathan Black were officially no longer tied to each other.

Yet Leonard Grant still insisted Nathan remain by Evelyn's side.

And...

Nathan had complied.

After their divorce, Nathan owed Evelyn nothing. He could have refused Leonard's unreasonable demand.

But he chose to obey.

Why would he do such a thing?

Serena Cole didn't want to dwell on it.

She feared what answer her mind might conjure up.

Dylan Reeves' expression darkened as well.

Evelyn had been hospitalized for days now.

Each time Nathan came to visit, he barely stayed sixty seconds before rushing out like the room was on fire.

But today, Nathan had brought his work documents into Evelyn's hospital room. The message was clear - he planned to stay with her indefinitely.

What had changed his mind now?

Originally, Serena and Dylan had come to Evelyn's hospital room to torment her.

Serena had been determined to unleash all her pent-up frustration and humiliation upon Evelyn.

She never expected to find Nathan here.

His presence was like a slap across her face.

For a long moment, she stood frozen, speechless.

Finally finding her voice, she turned to Evelyn with false sweetness. "If you needed company during your hospital stay, you should have said something sooner, Miss Hartley! I could have asked my cousin to keep you company. He's quite free. Nathan, however, is extremely busy. Running between the hospital and his company must be exhausting. Besides..." Her voice took on a mocking tone. "You and Nathan are divorced now. It's highly inappropriate for you to keep troubling him like this."

Serena spoke as if she were Nathan's current girlfriend.

With the divorce finalized, nothing stood in her way now.

Evelyn responded with an icy chuckle. "Honestly, having Nathan here is more of a nuisance than a comfort."

But it was Leonard's order, so neither she nor Nathan had a choice.

"Since you're so eager to help, Miss Cole," Evelyn continued smoothly, "why don't I give you Leonard's number? You can discuss this matter with him directly."

That instantly silenced Serena.

She wouldn't dare contact Leonard Grant.

###Chapter 441

Nathan's expression darkened instantly at Evelyn's dismissive words, his piercing gaze turning glacial.

Did his very presence irritate her so deeply? Was he truly such an inconvenience to her?

Damn it all!

Could she possibly despise him this much?

With deliberate indifference, Evelyn stated, "If you have no further business here, Miss Cole and Mr. Reeves, you may leave now."

Serena realized with bitter clarity that Nathan's presence made her original intentions impossible to fulfill.

She couldn't bear to remain a moment longer.

Turning to Nathan with practiced sweetness, she murmured, "Nathan, would you mind escorting me back to my room? Perhaps... stay with me awhile?"

Her heart hammered violently against her ribs as she made the request.

The thought of being publicly rejected in front of Evelyn filled her with dread.

Such humiliation would be unbearable.

At Serena's plea, Nathan instinctively sought Evelyn's reaction.

Evelyn met his gaze with icy detachment, as though Serena's request meant nothing to her.

This indifference stoked Nathan's frustration into white-hot anger.

Very well. If this was how she chose to behave, he would respond in kind.

"Certainly," Nathan replied smoothly to Serena, setting aside the documents and rising to his feet.

A fleeting emotion too quick to identify flashed through Evelyn's eyes before vanishing.

Nathan approached Serena and inquired, "Is the wheelchair uncomfortable for you?"

Serena sat stunned, scarcely believing her luck.

After a brief pause, she recovered swiftly and nodded. "Yes, quite uncomfortable actually."

Without hesitation, Nathan bent and lifted Serena effortlessly into his arms.

He carried her from the room without so much as a backward glance.

Evelyn's face remained an impassive mask, but inside, fresh agony lanced through her heart.

It felt as though invisible claws had materialized from thin air, crushing her heart with relentless pressure.

Dylan shot Evelyn a smug, triumphant smirk before hastily pushing the wheelchair after Nathan.

Within moments, Evelyn stood alone in the cavernous emptiness of her hospital room.

###Chapter 442

Evelyn propped herself up slightly on the hospital bed, her distant gaze fixed on the horizon outside the window.

She had known this would happen.

Yet when she saw Nathan choose Serena over her without a second thought, the pain still cut through her heart like shards of glass.

At least they were already divorced.

She clung to the hope that with time, these lingering feelings would fade.

One day, nothing he did would affect her anymore.

Taking a deep breath, Evelyn schooled her features into perfect neutrality.

Inside the elevator, Nathan carefully lowered Serena back into her wheelchair.

His voice was low when he spoke. "You're injured. You shouldn't be moving around like this."

Serena's eyes flickered with something unreadable.

Was he actually scolding her for visiting Evelyn?

"Nathan, Dylan and I just wanted to check on Evelyn," Dylan quickly interjected.

Nathan's icy glare silenced him. "Since when are you friends with Evelyn?"

He knew exactly how Evelyn felt about these two.

Dylan opened his mouth, then closed it again.

Finally, he muttered, "We won't bother her again."

Only then did some tension leave Nathan's shoulders.

After settling Serena in her room, Nathan took the chair beside her bed. "Rest now," he said tonelessly.

Serena worried her lower lip between her teeth. "Nathan... are you still planning to stay with Ms. Hartley?"

"Yes."

"Can't you refuse?" Her voice trembled. "You're divorced now. She's not your responsibility anymore."

"My father requested it."

"You could say no!" Serena insisted.

A quiet sniffle escaped her. "It hurts me," she whispered, "seeing you in her room like this."

Nathan's response was measured. "Divorced or not, Evelyn was my wife."

Serena's face fell instantly.

His words...

Did he still feel some obligation toward Evelyn? If so, how could they ever truly move on?

No. She wouldn't allow this.

###Chapter 443

Just as Evelyn was about to speak, Nathan's phone rang sharply.

Nathan stood abruptly, answering the call as he moved toward the exit.
"What happened?" His voice was clipped.

It was Walter on the line.
Walter hesitated before speaking. "Mr. Black, I—"
He swallowed hard. "Ms. Hartley just called me."

Nathan's grip tightened around his phone.

Walter continued, voice strained. "She demanded I collect all your files from her hospital room immediately."
A beat of silence.
"And she said if I'm not there within the hour..."

Nathan's jaw clenched. "Spit it out."

Walter exhaled. "She threatened to shred everything."

The air around Nathan turned glacial.

Perfect. Just perfect.

His already simmering fury flared hotter.
"Get over there now," he bit out, each word razor-sharp. "Those documents better be in my hands within the hour."

Even through the phone, Walter could feel the lethal edge in Nathan's tone.
"Right away, sir."

Nathan ended the call.

For several seconds, he stood motionless, a dark storm brewing around him.
Then, with measured control, he returned to Serena's room.

Serena took one look at his expression and frowned. "Nathan? What's wrong?"

"Nothing concerning you." His reply was curt.
He grabbed his coat. "Rest. I have business to handle."

Though disappointment flickered across her face, Serena nodded. "Of course. Don't let me keep you."

Nathan left without another word.

The elevator doors closed behind him.
His car tore out of the parking garage.
The city blurred past as he drove toward Blackstone Holdings.

The next morning, Leonard insisted Nathan visit Evelyn at the hospital.
Nathan agreed—then sent Walter in his place.

The tension in Evelyn's hospital room was thick enough to slice.

Walter stood stiffly by the door, clutching a sealed envelope.
"Ms. Hartley," he began carefully, "Mr. Black asked me to—"

Evelyn cut him off with a raised hand.
Her smile was ice. "Tell Nathan if he wants his files, he can come get them himself."

Walter's throat went dry.
This was going to be a very long day.

###Chapter 444

Nathan sent Walter in his place to check on Evelyn.

The call came through just as Nathan stepped into his office. "Yes?" he answered tersely.

"I'm at the hospital, Mr. Black. But the nurses informed me Ms. Hartley was discharged this morning," Walter reported.

"Discharged?" Nathan's grip tightened on his phone.

"Indeed. I spoke with her physician. He confirmed her condition had stabilized enough for outpatient care with daily IV treatments. Given Ms. Hartley's medical expertise, the doctor approved her release," Walter explained.

Nathan ended the call without another word.

An unfamiliar tightness gripped his throat.

He remained seated, the leather chair suddenly unbearable.

Damn it all!

Why should he care about her discharge? Yet the thought did nothing to ease the restless irritation coiling in his chest.

At the Sinclair residence...

Evelyn had stubbornly insisted on leaving the hospital, leaving Eleanor powerless to stop her.

She knew her own condition better than anyone - whether convalescing in a sterile room or her own bed made little difference.

Most importantly, she couldn't bear another encounter with Nathan.

This was her escape.

Propped against silk pillows, Evelyn reached for a medical journal when her phone vibrated.

Sebastian's name flashed across the screen.

"Hello," she answered, masking her fatigue.

"How are you feeling?" Concern laced his voice.

"Much improved," she lied smoothly.

"I heard about the incident. Don't worry - I'll ensure a proper investigation," Sebastian promised, having just returned from overseas negotiations.

Evelyn gave a hollow laugh. "No need. I did violate protocol first."

"This goes deeper than protocol, Evelyn. Dominic and Victor have been close for years. This was clearly retaliation for that cardiac case last month. Focus on recovering - I'll handle everything." The line went dead before she could protest.

###Chapter 445

Evelyn's piercing gaze lingered on her phone screen as she placed it down with deliberate slowness.

So that was the truth behind everything.

No wonder Nathan had been so distant lately.

There were layers to this situation she hadn't anticipated.

At Grand Ins General Hospital, in the Medical Section Chief's office...

Sebastian stood with his arms crossed, his stormy expression darkening the room.

Nathan offered a polite smile. "Mr. Holloway, you've returned from your business trip?" he inquired smoothly.

Sebastian wasn't in the mood for pleasantries. "Nathan, don't you think your disciplinary action against Evelyn was unjust?" he demanded, cutting straight to the point.

Nathan maintained his composed demeanor. "Ah, so that's what this is about. No wonder you seemed agitated, Mr. Holloway." He paused briefly before continuing, "Evelyn violated protocol, and I administered appropriate disciplinary measures according to hospital regulations. Where exactly lies the injustice?"

A cold chuckle escaped Sebastian's lips. "You only saw her violation. What about the fact she completed that critical surgery despite suffering an allergic reaction? Did you conveniently overlook her professional dedication? Or was that omission intentional?" His words carried unmistakable accusation.

Nathan countered, "As lead surgeon, wasn't completing the operation her fundamental responsibility?"

"That's not the point!" Sebastian's voice sharpened. "She was risking her life while battling anaphylaxis. Had she stepped down for her own safety, no one would have blamed her. Yet she chose to prioritize her patient's survival over her own wellbeing. Isn't that precisely the kind of medical devotion we should commend? Doesn't that merit recognition rather than punishment?"

Nathan fell silent, momentarily caught off guard.

He drew a deep breath, about to respond, when his phone interrupted with an insistent ring.

Answering briskly, he said, "Yes?"

Whatever he heard made his brow furrow deeply.

"Understood. I'll be there immediately," he responded before ending the call.

Turning back to Sebastian with renewed composure, Nathan stated, "Mr. Holloway, the hospital director requires my presence."

"You're welcome to wait here if you wish."

Without awaiting a reply, Nathan moved toward the exit.

After brief hesitation, Sebastian decided to follow Nathan to the director's office.

When they arrived, Director Liam looked up in surprise at Sebastian's unexpected presence.

Recovering quickly, he gestured them forward. "Mr. Holloway, since you're here, you might as well join us." He paused meaningfully before continuing, "This morning I received a formal complaint regarding the handling of Evelyn's disciplinary case."

"It alleges serious misconduct in our Medical Section's proceedings."

###Chapter 446

She had deliberately violated protocol by skipping her pre-surgery meal in the cafeteria.

Yet even while suffering anaphylactic shock, Evelyn Hartley miraculously completed the complex cardiac procedure.

The moment the last suture was tied, she collapsed unconscious on the operating room floor.

"Such selfless dedication to patient care deserves recognition, not punishment," declared the petition circulating through Mercy General.

Nathan Black's voice turned icy as he continued reading. "Instead of commending her sacrifice, Dr. Hartley received disciplinary action without acknowledgment of her heroic efforts."

"This gross miscarriage of justice cannot stand," the document concluded.

Sebastian Holloway's face drained of color when he heard the petition being presented to the hospital board.

He never expected his subordinates would dare challenge his authority through official channels.

Were they insane?

What concern was Evelyn's situation to them? Why were they so passionately defending that reckless woman?

But Sebastian gravely underestimated the petition's significance.

This wasn't merely about protecting Evelyn - it was a calculated strike to safeguard every physician's rights.

With similar incidents potentially affecting any medical professional, systemic change became imperative.

The staff united behind this cause, determined to prevent future unjust punishments through collective action.

"Dr. Hartley's actions merit both recognition and reward," the hospital director announced during the emergency meeting. "However, protocol violations cannot be ignored."

"The original penalty of three months' bonus forfeiture and public reprimand shall be replaced with full bonus reinstatement and an official commendation."

Thus, her heroic deed effectively canceled out the infraction.

Turning to Sebastian, the director's expression hardened. "Your mishandling of this situation caused widespread staff unrest and necessitated this formal grievance."

"As such, you will forfeit three months' performance bonuses and receive a public reprimand."

Sebastian's jaw clenched so tightly his teeth ached.

The disciplinary action had backfired spectacularly - now he was the one being punished.

###Chapter 447

Just as Sebastian Holloway opened his mouth to speak, the hospital director cut in sharply, "That concludes our discussion! You're dismissed!"

Clenching his jaw, Victor Sterling swallowed his fury though his stormy expression betrayed his true feelings.

Striding out of the director's office, he turned abruptly to face Nathan Black. "Mr. Holloway, for the record, I handled Evelyn Hartley's case with absolute impartiality! No personal feelings were involved!"

Nathan responded with an icy smirk that didn't reach his eyes. "Impartial? You might want to examine your own conscience!"

With those cutting words, Nathan brushed past him, leaving Victor standing alone in the corridor, fists trembling at his sides.

This should have been his perfect opportunity to put Evelyn in her place while gaining Dominic Pierce's favor.

Instead, he'd become the one suffering consequences.

Within the hour, two notices appeared on the hospital bulletin board.

The first commended Evelyn's exemplary performance.

The second detailed Victor's formal disciplinary action.

Staff members gathered around the announcements, exchanging satisfied glances and quiet murmurs.

Their collective efforts had borne fruit.

Lila Sinclair observed from the periphery.

Her face remained carefully blank, but a flicker of resentment darkened her eyes. Why did Evelyn always land on her feet?

Just when it seemed certain Evelyn would face punishment, she received public recognition instead!

Worse still, Victor had been caught in the crossfire and disciplined because of Evelyn.

Now the entire staff at Grand Oaks General Hospital would think twice before crossing Evelyn.

Wouldn't this only strengthen Evelyn's position?

The thought made Lila's stomach churn with envy.

"During morning rounds, I overheard Dr. Hartley's mother apologizing to her," a nurse suddenly whispered. "Apparently it was her own mother who prepared the breakfast that triggered Evelyn's allergic reaction!"

"What? Her own mother didn't know about her allergies?"

"That's unbelievable! What kind of mother forgets her daughter's medical conditions?"

"Exactly!"

As the gossip reached Lila's ears, a calculating gleam entered her eyes.

She'd known this particular detail since the incident occurred.

###Chapter 448

A dark realization crept into her thoughts.

Had Grace known about Evelyn's artichoke allergy this entire time? Was that breakfast sabotage?

Lila pressed her lips into a thin line, her eyes clouded with suspicion as the pieces fell into place.

"Actually, the hospital's annual blood drive is next Saturday."

"I should focus on eating nutritious meals this week. Last time I donated, my blood sugar dropped dangerously low."

A nurse's cheerful voice interrupted Lila's scheming.

"Planning to bulk up before donating?"

"Exactly! Can't hurt to try!"

Lila gave them an unreadable smile before walking away.

The blood drive would be perfect timing. Evelyn would surely be back at work by then - and undoubtedly participate.

This was her golden opportunity to obtain Evelyn's blood sample.

The unanswered questions had haunted her for weeks, stealing both her appetite and sleep.

She would uncover the truth, no matter the cost.

Clenching her fists in determination, Lila strode down the hallway with purpose.

Meanwhile, Sebastian wasted no time updating Evelyn.

"Dominic was so focused on settling scores for Turner that he didn't consider the public backlash. Now it's blowing up in his face."

"Just focus on recovering at home. Only return when you're completely better, alright?" Sebastian advised.

"Understood," Evelyn replied calmly.

After their conversation ended, Evelyn's phone rang again immediately.

Her face lit up when she saw the caller ID.

"Vivian!" she answered eagerly, her voice brimming with joy.

"How are you holding up, darling?" came the warm, familiar voice.

"I'm fine. How are you and mentor? When are you coming back? I miss you both terribly!" Evelyn responded with a smile.

###Chapter 449

"We're doing great. We'll be back before the month ends," Vivian Delacroix responded cheerfully.

"That's wonderful! Just tell me the exact time and I'll personally pick you up at the airport," Evelyn Hartley replied eagerly.

Vivian chuckled. "Of course, I'll keep you updated. But actually, I called to discuss your solo concert. When are you planning to hold it? Mr. Baldwin has been pestering me nonstop about it."

Evelyn sighed deeply. "Vivian, my life's been absolute chaos lately. I'm not ready for that yet."

"You can't keep postponing it forever," Vivian chided gently. "Your fans are practically begging on social media. It's crucial you don't delay any longer. You must hold a concert in Owathe this year—no excuses."

"Alright, alright!" Evelyn conceded. "We'll go over the details when you return, okay?"

"That's the spirit!" After a brief pause, Vivian changed the subject. "How are things with your father and... your husband?"

Evelyn's lips pressed into a thin line before answering. "My father and I barely speak these days. And as for my husband..." She hesitated, her eyelashes fluttering briefly. "He's now my ex-husband."

Silence stretched on the other end as Vivian processed this unexpected revelation.

She'd never imagined things would turn out this way.

After a long pause, Vivian spoke softly. "I know you well, Evelyn. If you've made this decision, it means they've hurt you beyond repair—so deeply that you've given up trying to fix things. And you know what? That's perfectly okay. Some relationships aren't meant to last, no matter how hard we try. There's no point forcing what isn't there."

"I understand," Evelyn replied with quiet determination. "Don't worry about me. I'll be fine."

"Good. Don't let it drag you down," Vivian said gently, her voice laced with concern.

They continued talking for a while longer before finally ending the call.

A week passed in a blur.

Evelyn's allergic reaction had completely vanished; the angry red welts on her skin had faded without a trace.

Fully recovered, she returned to work.

###Chapter 450

The morning Evelyn returned to the hospital coincided with the annual blood drive. Without a second thought, she rolled up her sleeve and donated.

When Olivia and Marcus discovered she'd hidden her severe allergic reaction from them, their expressions darkened. "You could have died!" Olivia's voice trembled with barely contained fury.

After extracting a solemn promise that Evelyn would never conceal medical emergencies again—and securing her reluctant agreement to a blind date—they finally relented.

That evening found Evelyn seated across from a strikingly handsome man at an intimate bistro in downtown Manhattan. The candlelight cast dancing shadows across his chiseled features.

"Ms. Hartley, I presume?" His deep baritone resonated through the quiet space as he extended a well-manicured hand. "Harrison Whitmore."

The way his gaze lingered on her face made Evelyn's cheeks warm. "Evelyn Hartley," she replied, shaking his hand before they settled into their plush velvet chairs.

After the waiter took their orders, Evelyn didn't mince words. "Mr. Whitmore, I believe in honesty." She met his hazel eyes squarely. "I'm not looking for a relationship right now. This was Olivia's doing."

Harrison's smile faltered momentarily. He'd been instantly captivated—not just by her delicate beauty, but by the quiet strength radiating from her. Her bluntness, however, caught him off guard.

After a beat, he chuckled softly. "I admire your directness. No pressure, of course." He swirled his wine thoughtfully. "Though I'd be honored if you'd consider me a friend?"

Evelyn's shoulders relaxed slightly. "Friends I can manage."

"Excellent." Harrison produced his phone with a charming smile. "Shall we exchange contacts then?"

As Evelyn added his number, Harrison studied her profile. "I understand," he said gently. "Divorcing Nathan Black isn't something one recovers from overnight."

Her fingers stilled on the screen. How much had Olivia told him? Before she could respond, the waiter arrived with their appetizers, providing a welcome distraction.

The conversation flowed surprisingly easily after that. Harrison proved to be witty and perceptive, steering clear of personal topics. By dessert, Evelyn found herself actually enjoying his company.

When he walked her to her car later, the autumn breeze carried the scent of fallen leaves between them. "Thank you for tonight," Evelyn said sincerely. "It wasn't what I expected."

Harrison's smile held a hint of something unreadable. "The pleasure was entirely mine, Evelyn." He hesitated, then added, "For what it's worth? I think you're worth waiting for."

As his words settled over her, Evelyn realized with a start that for the first time in months, the thought of moving on didn't fill her with dread.
###Chapter 451

"You might need some time to adjust."

Evelyn's eyes flickered slightly at those words.

After a pause, she nodded. "That's partially true."

"I understand," Harrison said with genuine warmth. "Time has a way of healing all wounds. And if you ever decide to open your heart again, I hope you'll consider me."

His directness caught Evelyn off guard, leaving her momentarily speechless.

She offered an awkward smile but remained silent.

From that moment, Harrison skillfully shifted the conversation to lighter topics.

He proved to be an engaging conversationalist, his witty remarks drawing several genuine laughs from Evelyn.

Their dinner progressed with surprising ease, the atmosphere at their table unexpectedly pleasant.

Unseen by them, this cheerful scene hadn't escaped notice.

Across the restaurant, Theodore observed them with an inscrutable expression.

Casually pulling out his phone, Theodore recorded a brief thirty-second clip of Evelyn's table.

With a knowing smirk, he sent it to Nathan.

Two minutes later, Theodore made the call.

"Hello," Nathan answered tersely.

"Did you see what I sent you?" Theodore inquired.

Silence.

Undeterred, Theodore continued, "Do you know what Evelyn's doing right now?" Without waiting for a response, he chuckled darkly. "She's on a blind date."

Nathan's grip on his phone turned white-knuckled. "A blind date?" His voice dropped to an arctic chill.

How soon after their divorce was this? And already Evelyn was dating?

"Who told you this?" Nathan demanded.

"Olivia," Theodore replied casually. "She's been arranging potential matches for Evelyn. Scouting the field, so to speak."

Nathan's expression darkened instantly.

Damn it all!

Why were the Caldwells moving so quickly?

And Evelyn...

Hadn't she already promised herself to Alexander? Then why this blind date? Had she kept her relationship with Alexander hidden from her family?

###Chapter 452

"Nathan," Theodore said, his voice playful yet sharp, "don't you have any thoughts about this?"

Nathan let out a cold chuckle. "Evelyn and I are divorced, Theodore."

"Whether Evelyn goes on dates or remarries, it's none of my business," he stated flatly.

His tone was detached, his expression unreadable.

Theodore arched a brow. "Fine, if that's how you feel. Guess I overstepped. Get back to work then. I'll finish my dinner."

He hung up abruptly, leaving no room for reply.

Nathan stared at his phone, replaying the video clip.

The man seated across from Evelyn had said something that made her laugh.

Nathan's jaw tightened.

When Evelyn was with him, her face had always been guarded, distant.

But now, with this stranger, she looked...

Happy.

A bitter laugh escaped him.

He reminded himself it didn't matter.

It couldn't matter.

They were divorced.

Her life was no longer his concern.

Yet no matter how many times he repeated this, the image of Evelyn smiling at another man burned like acid in his chest.

The rest of Nathan's evening passed in a haze of restless irritation.

Work documents lay forgotten on his desk.

Meanwhile, when Evelyn returned to the Caldwell estate, Olivia practically pounced on her, eyes sparkling. "Well?" Olivia demanded, pulling Evelyn into the sitting room. "How was Harrison?"

Evelyn hesitated. "He was... pleasant," she offered carefully.

Olivia waved a dismissive hand. "Translation: boring. Don't worry darling, I'll arrange someone more exciting tomorrow."

Evelyn suppressed a sigh.

Resistance, she realized, was pointless.

True to her word, Olivia scheduled another date for the following afternoon.

By the third evening, Evelyn finally caught a reprieve.

###Chapter 453

Leonard had extended a dinner invitation to her.
Grateful for the distraction, Evelyn met him after her shift ended.

"Leonard!" Her face lit up with genuine warmth as she approached him.

He arched an eyebrow, amusement dancing in his gaze. "You've been quite occupied lately, haven't you?"

The smile on Evelyn's lips wavered slightly.
She knew exactly what he was hinting at.

"It's not by choice," she admitted with a dry chuckle. "Olivia has been relentless. It's hard to refuse her."

Leonard nodded, a knowing laugh escaping him. "Well, Olivia and Marcus are certainly invested in your future. From what I gather, the candidates they've lined up for you are rather impressive."

Evelyn pressed her lips together, offering only a faint smile in response.

After a brief silence, Leonard leaned forward, his expression turning serious. "But Evelyn," he said softly, "are you and Nathan truly finished?"

He had always believed she would only find happiness with Nathan.
Yet now, the woman before him seemed lighter, more content than he'd seen her in years.

It struck him suddenly—her newfound joy had nothing to do with Nathan.
Perhaps leaving him had been the best decision she'd ever made.

Before Leonard could continue, Evelyn spoke, her voice gentle but firm. "Leonard, I know you still hope for reconciliation, but it won't happen. I hate to disappoint you, but I need to be honest."

Leonard studied her for a long moment.
Then, understanding dawned in his eyes.

With a resigned nod, he said, "Alright. I won't bring it up again. Maybe Nathan simply wasn't meant for you. Evelyn, if I come across someone suitable, I'll introduce you immediately."

A soft smile curved her lips. "Thank you."

"Now, let's eat," Leonard said warmly, returning her smile.

"Of course," Evelyn agreed, her tone noticeably lighter.

Their conversation shifted effortlessly to lighter topics.
Leonard didn't mention Nathan again.

Midway through their meal, the door to their private room swung open abruptly.

Leonard turned, eyebrows lifting in surprise.
"Nathan? What brings you here?" he asked.

###Chapter 454

Evelyn froze for just a heartbeat before regaining her composure.

"I heard you were dining here, so I came to escort you home," Nathan murmured in that deep, velvety voice of his as he stepped into the private dining room.

Though his words were meant for Leonard, his piercing gaze remained locked on Evelyn.

"Join us then," Leonard offered casually.

Nathan took a seat but remained silent, his presence casting an unspoken tension over the table.

Evelyn and Leonard continued their lively conversation about art exhibitions in Paris, deliberately ignoring the brooding man at their table.

When Evelyn excused herself to freshen up, she didn't expect to find Nathan waiting for her in the dimly lit hallway.

He leaned against the marble wall with deceptive casualness, one hand in his pocket, the other holding a cigarette that trailed smoke toward the ceiling. His eyes darkened when they met hers.

"Evelyn," he said, his voice dangerously soft. "Has it really been so short a time since our divorce that you're already moving on?" Each word was precise, cutting through the air like shards of ice.

Evelyn's expression remained impassive.

"That's none of your concern, Mr. Black," she replied coolly, stepping forward to walk past him.

In one fluid motion, Nathan caught her wrist and spun her around, pinning her against the wall with his body. His free hand slammed against the wall beside her head, caging her in.

His dark eyes burned with intensity. "None of my concern?" he repeated, his voice rough with barely contained emotion. "We divorced barely a month ago, and here you are, dining intimately with another man? Have you considered how this makes me look?"

Evelyn's eyes flashed with fury as she met his gaze unflinchingly.

"Your reputation?" she spat. "Why should I care? We're nothing to each other now. Your precious image is the least of my worries."

Nathan's jaw tightened. Before he could respond, Evelyn continued, "Besides, wasn't it you who couldn't wait to be with Serena? You—"

"Who told you I wanted Serena?" Nathan interrupted sharply, his grip on her wrist tightening almost imperceptibly.

###Chapter 455

Evelyn's face turned to stone as she glared at him, a sardonic smirk playing at the corners of her lips. "Why bother pretending with me, Mr. Black? Serena herself told me everything. She said the moment she decides to marry you, you'd say 'I do' without hesitation."

Her eyes turned icy as she continued in a frosty tone, "So, Nathan, take good care of Serena. As for me—your ex-wife—you needn't concern yourself with my life anymore."

Nathan's brows knitted together at her words, a dangerous glint flashing in his stormy eyes.

Then, as if struck by sudden realization, his expression shifted.

A cruel smile twisted his lips as he let out a chilling laugh. "So you agreed to those blind dates because of what Serena told you?" he demanded.

Evelyn's frown deepened, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "I went on those dates because I wanted to, not because of you, Mr. Black. Your arrogance truly knows no bounds."

When Nathan heard this, his piercing gaze narrowed, a predatory gleam flickering within.

He spoke in a deceptively soft voice, "Evelyn, do you really think any man in Owathe would dare touch you if I forbid it?"

Evelyn's frustration mounted as she shot him a scorching glare.

Just as she was about to erupt, a sudden laugh escaped her lips, her smile turning knowing. "Nathan, what exactly are you doing right now? Could it be... jealousy? Does seeing me with another man bother you?"

Nathan's expression faltered momentarily, irritation flashing across his features.

"Jealous?" he snapped, his voice rising sharply. "You're delusional if you think that!" His tone oozed contempt, as if she'd suggested the most absurd notion.

The derision in his voice, combined with the disdain in his eyes, struck Evelyn like a physical blow.

Her face went blank instantly.

Meeting his gaze with icy detachment, she stated, "You're the one being ridiculous here, Nathan."

"Our divorce is final. From now on, let's stay out of each other's lives."

She paused deliberately.

Then, as if remembering something important, she added with calculated calm, "Oh, and one more thing—when you and Serena get married, be sure to send me an invitation."

Evelyn shoved Nathan away and turned sharply on her heel.

But she'd barely taken three steps when Nathan seized her wrist again, yanking her back with such force that she slammed against the wall once more.

Evelyn scowled, irritation etching her features.

Before she could speak, Nathan's glacial tone cut through the air. "Evelyn! Did you actually just ask for an invitation to my wedding with Serena?"

###Chapter 456

The air around Nathan turned glacial, his presence radiating an almost tangible chill.

His words sliced through the silence like shards of broken glass, each syllable scraping against Evelyn's nerves. "Is that so?" His voice was dangerously soft.

Evelyn met his gaze unflinchingly, her lips curving into a practiced smile. "Indeed, Mr. Black. It's only fitting for your ex-wife to bless your new union, don't you think?"

Her tone remained steady, though internally, her heart was being shredded by invisible claws.

Nathan's piercing stare seemed to strip away all her defenses, leaving her soul bare before him.

After an agonizing silence, his mouth twisted into a cruel smirk. "How... thoughtful of you. Don't worry, we'll make sure you receive your invitation personally."

Evelyn's breath hitched imperceptibly.

She squared her shoulders, lifting her chin defiantly. "I'll be counting the days."

Without another word, she brushed past him, refusing to look back even as she felt his burning gaze on her retreating form.

Nathan watched her go, his expression darkening like gathering storm clouds, the veins in his temples pulsing visibly.

When they both returned to Leonard in the private dining room, their masks were perfectly in place.

Yet Leonard, ever perceptive, didn't miss the electric tension crackling between them.

After dinner, the trio made their way to the parking garage.

As Leonard settled into his luxury sedan, Evelyn offered him a warm smile. "Take care, Leonard."

"Will do, my dear." He nodded affectionately. "Text me when you get home."

"Of course. Goodnight."

With a final wave, Evelyn turned on her heel and walked away, pointedly ignoring Nathan's existence entirely.

Nathan's brow furrowed as he watched her go, then turned to study Leonard's impassive face.

He'd fully expected Leonard to suggest he drive Evelyn home - it would have been characteristic of the older man's meddling. The fact that he hadn't... was telling.

Without a word, Nathan slid into his sports car, revved the engine, and disappeared into the night.

Meanwhile, Leonard pulled out his phone as his car merged onto the freeway. "Leonard here," he said when the call connected. "We need to talk about our little problem..."

###Chapter 457

"Reginald, your grandson Sebastian is approaching thirty, isn't he? Has he found someone to settle down with yet?" Leonard cut straight to the chase.

With a deep sigh, Reginald Montgomery replied, "Don't even ask! He's still single and shows zero interest in dating. It's driving me mad. At this point, I wouldn't be surprised if he brought home a man and introduced him as his boyfriend!"

Leonard chuckled. "Well, I might have someone perfect for him. How about I introduce them?"

Reginald's eyes lit up instantly. "Really? Who is she? I've been searching everywhere! That boy has impossible standards—none of the women I've introduced have caught his attention. He always comes back from dates without even a second glance."

Without hesitation, Leonard said, "You know Evelyn Hartley, don't you? What do you think about her as a match for Sebastian?"

At that moment, Nathan slammed on the brakes, jerking the car to an abrupt stop.

Leonard lurched forward, caught off guard, and barely managed to steady himself by grabbing the back of the passenger seat.

"What the hell are you doing?" Leonard snapped, glaring at Nathan. "Have you forgotten how to drive?"

Nathan didn't respond. His jaw was clenched, his fingers gripping the steering wheel so tightly his knuckles turned white. His dark eyes burned with fury as he shot a sharp, icy glare at Leonard through the rearview mirror.

Had Leonard lost his mind? He wanted to set Evelyn up with Sebastian?

Nathan wasn't the only one in shock. On the other end of the line, Reginald was equally stunned.

"Leonard, are you serious? Is this some kind of joke?" Reginald demanded.

Leonard remained calm. "We've been friends for decades, Reginald. Do you think I'd joke about something like this?"

"You—you—" Reginald sputtered, completely baffled.

Undeterred, Leonard continued, "You must have heard about Nathan and Evelyn's divorce by now. My son never appreciated what he had in her."

###Chapter 458
Evelyn is extraordinary.

The Caldwell family has already started arranging blind dates for her, so I thought, why not introduce her to your son? Sebastian is an outstanding young man.

If you agree, I'll arrange for Sebastian and Evelyn to meet.

If you're uncomfortable with the idea, we can simply pretend this conversation never happened."

There was a long pause on Reginald's end before he sighed deeply. "You truly care for your former daughter-in-law, don't you? I've never heard of anyone playing matchmaker for their ex-daughter-in-law before."

"I believe this is a wonderful opportunity," Leonard replied smoothly. "Evelyn deserves the best. My son doesn't."

Reginald hesitated before responding, "Let me think about it. I'll get back to you soon."

"Very well." Leonard ended the call and set his phone down.

The moment he did, Nathan's furious voice erupted in the car. "Father, have you lost your mind? You're trying to set Evelyn up with someone? Why?"

Leonard turned to face Nathan, his expression unreadable. "You and Evelyn are divorced. Why shouldn't I?"

"But this—it's absurd! She was your daughter-in-law!" Nathan ground out between clenched teeth.

"And now she's not. Consider it a new experience, courtesy of your father," Leonard shot back without hesitation.

Nathan fell silent, his jaw tightening.

He took a slow, controlled breath and said nothing more, restarting the car with a sharp turn of the key.

The rest of the drive passed in suffocating silence.

Nathan's anger was palpable, his presence icy and oppressive.

In the back seat, Leonard watched him with quiet amusement, a faint smirk playing at his lips.

So now Nathan was angry? He couldn't accept this?

Good.

Where had this fury been when it actually mattered? Now, it was far too late.

When they arrived at the Grant residence, Nathan didn't even step out of the car.

The moment Leonard closed the door behind him, Nathan sped off without a word.

Watching the car disappear down the driveway, Leonard scoffed.

Leaning on his cane, he made his way inside.

Meanwhile, at the exclusive private room in Nathan's club,

Theodore choked on his drink, coughing violently as he processed Nathan's words.

###Chapter 459

"What... What did you just say?" Nathan's voice trembled with shock.

"Wait, so your father actually wants to set Evelyn up with his old friend's grandson? This is ridiculous!" Theodore's jaw dropped, his eyes widening in disbelief.

Honestly, he hadn't seen this coming at all!

For a moment, he thought he'd misheard.

Nathan remained silent, downing his whiskey in one gulp, his expression darkening with barely contained rage.

Theodore, still struggling to process the news, shook his head. "What the hell is Leonard thinking? This makes no sense," he muttered.

Then he turned to Nathan, his expression turning serious. "Nathan, now that you know Evelyn is going on blind dates, doesn't that bother you?"

Nathan's sharp gaze intensified. His voice came out low and dangerous. "Of course it bothers me! Evelyn and I just finalized our divorce. And now she's already dating? What does that say about me?"

Theodore raised an eyebrow. "Is that all? You're only upset because of how it reflects on you? Not because you can't stand the thought of Evelyn with someone else?"

Nathan fell silent, his throat tightening as if something were lodged there, preventing him from speaking.

Seeing Nathan's reaction, Theodore decided not to push further.

Nathan's silence was answer enough.

Theodore was certain Nathan still had deep feelings for Evelyn and couldn't bear the idea of her moving on.

He just wouldn't admit it.

"Nathan, be honest with yourself. Has your life actually improved since divorcing Evelyn? Are you truly happier now?" Theodore asked suddenly.

At this, Nathan frowned.

He thought about everything that had happened recently—his constant mood swings, the weight pressing down on him.

He had to admit that lately, he'd been snapping at everyone, constantly on edge.

Still, he refused to believe this had anything to do with Evelyn.

This was his problem, and his alone!

Nathan took a sharp breath, his words coming out icy. "Evelyn is already seeing Alexander."

"What?" Theodore froze, his expression one of complete shock.

After a long pause, he managed to ask, "Since when?"

###Chapter 460

Nathan's piercing gaze darkened with dangerous intensity. "At my father's birthday gala that night, Alexander personally told me he intended to confess his feelings to Evelyn."

His jaw clenched as he forced out the next words. "And I heard it myself—Evelyn accepted his confession."

Theodore immediately shook his head. "That can't be right! You and Evelyn were still married then. Anyone with eyes could see she was in love with you! Why would she accept Alexander's confession? And if they're really together, why is Evelyn going on blind dates now? There must be some mistake," he insisted, his expression grave as he tried to make sense of the situation.

Nathan let out a bitter laugh, his eyes like shards of ice. "A mistake? What kind of mistake could possibly explain this? I heard Evelyn's response with my own ears!"

Theodore opened his mouth to argue but ultimately remained silent. This was something he'd have to verify with Alexander directly.

Changing the subject quickly, they continued their conversation until the drinks were finished. As they left the private room and descended to the parking lot, Theodore suddenly spotted a familiar vehicle.

"Wait—isn't that Alexander's car? He—" Theodore's words cut off abruptly as his eyes widened.

Following his gaze, Nathan's expression instantly darkened.

Inside the car, Alexander was gently kissing the cheek of the woman beside him in the passenger seat. Her eyes were closed, clearly intoxicated.

The woman was none other than Alexander's adopted sister—Isabelle Whitmore.

Nathan's entire demeanor turned glacial, the air around him dropping several degrees. Even Theodore shivered beside him.

Nathan's sharp, cold stare fixed on Alexander through the car window. Sensing the impending explosion, Theodore braced himself, certain Nathan would lash out.

Perhaps feeling the weight of that lethal gaze, Alexander suddenly turned and noticed them standing nearby. His face froze when he realized they'd witnessed everything.

###Chapter 461

Alexander felt the weight of the moment pressing down on him.

His gaze flickered uneasily between Nathan and Theodore.

Taking a deep breath, he exited the car, the door clicking shut behind him with finality. He cleared his throat awkwardly as he approached them.

Before Alexander could speak, Nathan closed the distance in three quick strides and swung his fist.

The impact resonated through the parking garage like a gunshot.

Alexander's head snapped sideways from the force of the punch to his left cheek. He staggered back, barely catching himself.

Theodore's eyes widened in shock.

"Alexander! What the hell was that in the car? Are you playing some twisted game with Evelyn and me?" Nathan's voice trembled with barely contained fury, the veins in his neck standing out sharply.

Steadying himself, Alexander gingerly touched his throbbing cheek.

His fingers came away stained red from his split lip.

Theodore moved closer, confusion etching his features. "Alexander, I thought you cared about Evelyn. So why did you—"

"Give me one moment," Alexander interrupted, pulling out his phone with slightly shaking hands. He dialed Gabriella Prescott, requesting she come immediately with the family driver to collect Isabelle.

Ending the call, he turned back to the men. "Go wait in the private room. I'll join you shortly."

Theodore hesitated, then nodded in understanding. This wasn't the place for such a conversation.

Nathan shot Alexander one last searing glare before storming toward the elevators, Theodore following closely behind.

Alone now, Alexander wiped the blood from his mouth with his thumb.

He bitterly regretted ever claiming feelings for Evelyn. That single lie had earned him two punches from Nathan - though he couldn't deny he'd deserved them both.

Forty minutes later, Alexander entered the private room.

"Is Isabelle home safe?" Theodore asked immediately.

"Yes." Alexander sank onto the plush sofa.

Theodore tossed him an ice pack wrapped in a linen napkin. "For the swelling."

###Chapter 462

Gratefully, Alexander accepted it and pressed the ice pack against his swollen cheek.

The entire time, Nathan remained silent, his imposing presence filling the room with tension.

Theodore finally broke the silence. "What's really going on here, Alexander?"

Alexander hesitated for a brief moment before confessing, "Evelyn and I are just friends. The person I've always loved is Isabelle." Isabelle was Catherine's nickname.

Theodore looked stunned. "What? You're in love with Catherine?"

Nathan's eyes darkened as he fixed Alexander with an intense glare.

"Yes," Alexander admitted with a sigh. "I let everyone think I had feelings for Evelyn to make you jealous. I hoped it would make you realize your own feelings for her. There's nothing between Evelyn and me. She knows I'm in love with Isabelle."

Nathan's pupils constricted sharply at this revelation. This wasn't what he had expected.

"On Leonard's birthday, when you and Evelyn were in the garden, what did she promise you?" Nathan demanded.

"Leonard's birthday?" Alexander thought for a moment before remembering. "Isabelle's boyfriend wanted her to accompany him on a business trip to Soling. I didn't want her to go, so I asked Evelyn to take Isabelle out for drinks and get her drunk so she could throw Isabelle's phone in the pool. Evelyn refused at first, saying it was too underhanded, but I begged her to help me. After much persuasion, she finally agreed."

When he finished explaining, Alexander asked Nathan, "What's wrong?"

How dare he ask that?

Nathan's expression turned thunderous.

Theodore interjected, "So when Evelyn agreed, she wasn't agreeing to be with you?"

"Of course not," Alexander said.

Suddenly realizing something, he turned to Nathan. "Did you think Evelyn had agreed to be with me then?"

Nathan didn't answer, but his face said it all.

He had indeed believed that.

Alexander and Theodore exchanged glances, unsure how to respond.

Rubbing his temples as if suffering from a headache, Alexander said wearily, "This is my fault, Nathan..."
###Chapter 463

I had anticipated that you and Evelyn might separate after Leonard's birthday celebration. That's precisely why I deliberately mentioned confessing my feelings to Evelyn—to provoke a reaction from you.

Never did I imagine you'd overhear my private conversation with Evelyn and misinterpret the entire situation."

"Out of all possible approaches, you chose to fake romantic feelings for Evelyn? That's practically begging for disaster!" Theodore snapped, glaring daggers at Alexander.

"Jealousy has always been an effective catalyst for revealing true emotions. I simply didn't predict it would fail with Nathan," Alexander responded with a helpless shrug.

Turning directly to Nathan, he pressed on, "But you must confront your genuine feelings. Ask yourself this—can you honestly claim to feel nothing for Evelyn?"

Nathan believed the answer should have come easily. Yet the words stuck in his throat like stubborn glue.

"You and Serena ended things years ago. Only you know whether any lingering affection remains. Life's too short, Nathan. Do you truly want to watch the woman you love marry someone else while you're trapped in a loveless marriage?" Alexander challenged.

The mere suggestion twisted Nathan's stomach into knots.

Theodore added his voice, "Nathan, it's painfully obvious to both Alexander and me that you're in love with Evelyn. You're just too damn stubborn to admit it. While we've always been closer to Serena and genuinely hoped you'd reconcile... as your closest friends, we only want your happiness. Don't make a decision you'll regret forever."

The raw sincerity in Theodore's words hung heavily in the air.

Nathan remained silent, his expression unreadable. Yet both men recognized their words had struck home.

There's an art to knowing when to stop—and they'd reached that delicate point.

With practiced ease, Theodore shifted the conversation elsewhere.

The next day...

###Chapter 464

At the prestigious Grand Ins General Hospital, in the exclusive VIP ward...

The moment Nathan stepped through the door, Serena immediately sat up in bed. "Nathan," she breathed, forcing a fragile smile onto her pale face.

Nathan moved toward her with measured steps, his piercing gaze locked onto Serena's nervous expression.

His voice was dangerously calm when he spoke. "Did you tell Evelyn that I promised to marry you whenever you wished?"

Serena's carefully constructed composure shattered instantly.

Never in her wildest dreams had she imagined Evelyn would betray her confidence like this! She'd only said those words because she was certain Evelyn would never repeat them to Nathan.

Yet here they were...

Panic flashed across Serena's delicate features.

Dylan stood frozen in the corner, not daring to make a sound. After all, he'd been the one who first planted that poisonous seed in Evelyn's ear.

Nathan needed only one look at Serena's reaction to confirm the truth.

His handsome face darkened with barely contained fury.

"Serena," his voice was glacial, "you know how much I detest deception."

Serena's bottom lip trembled as she twisted the hospital sheets between her fingers. "Nathan, I know I shouldn't have said that to Evelyn," she whispered. "I wasn't thinking clearly."

She swallowed hard before continuing. "When I saw you two together in that hospital room... something inside me snapped. The jealousy was unbearable. I was terrified you'd reconcile and I'd lose everything. So I... I said things I shouldn't have."

Nathan's expression grew even more contemptuous at her explanation.

"Who I choose to be with," he said icily, "is my decision alone. No one else gets a vote."

His eyes turned to steel. "Don't ever pull a stunt like this again."

Without waiting for her response, Nathan spun on his heel and strode toward the exit.

"Nathan! Wait!" Serena cried out desperately, scrambling to the edge of the bed. "Please, just let me explain—"

But Nathan didn't even hesitate. The door clicked shut behind him with finality.

All color drained from Serena's face as she collapsed back against the pillows, her entire body shaking.

###Chapter 465

Nathan moved closer, his hand gently resting on Serena's trembling shoulder in a comforting gesture.

"Don't overthink this, Serena," he murmured softly. "Nathan's just upset right now. That's all there is to it."

Serena shook her head violently, her face still drained of color. "He's furious because I never should have spoken to Evelyn that way..."

"But if he doesn't care about Evelyn, why would my words affect him so much? He must care!" The realization hit Serena like a bucket of ice water.

Dylan's brow furrowed with concern as he processed her words. Before he could respond, Serena suddenly grabbed his hand with desperate urgency. "Dylan... do you think... could Nathan have developed feelings for Evelyn?"

A visible shock passed through Dylan's features, his pupils contracting sharply. He hesitated before responding firmly, "Absolutely not! Nathan loves you. How could he possibly have feelings for Evelyn? You're letting your imagination run wild, Serena. Nathan has always despised manipulative behavior. He's angry, but Evelyn isn't the reason."

He allowed his words to sink in before continuing, "Think about it logically - if Nathan had feelings for Evelyn, why would he have divorced her in the first place?"

Serena's tense expression softened slightly as she considered this. She nodded slowly. "You're right... if he cared for her, the divorce wouldn't have happened."

Dylan smiled in relief. "Exactly! And remember how Nathan reacted when Evelyn pushed you down those stairs? He ended their marriage immediately. Doesn't that prove where his loyalties lie?"

Gradually, the tension drained from Serena's shoulders, and a small smile touched her lips.

"See?" Dylan said firmly. "There's nothing to worry about. Nathan's heart belongs to you, not Evelyn." His words were as much for his own reassurance as for hers.

Serena's breathing steadied as Dylan's logic calmed her racing thoughts.

Meanwhile, at the Sterling family mansion, Lila sat alone in her room clutching the freshly delivered paternity test results. The crisp manila envelope felt heavy in her hands as waves of fear washed over her.

For the first time, she admitted to herself how terrified she was. Terrified that the contents of this report might shatter her world completely.

With trembling fingers, she finally tore open the envelope, bypassing all the preliminary pages to go straight to the final results.

She took a deep, shuddering breath before looking down at the conclusive statement.

Her eyes widened in shock, then relief flooded her features as a triumphant smile spread across her face. She knew it! There was no possible way Evelyn could be related to her mother! All her worrying had been for nothing.

Chapter 466

The revelation that both Evelyn Hartley and Diana Prescott shared allergies to seafood and artichokes turned out to be nothing more than a strange coincidence. The DNA results confirmed it—just an odd twist of fate.

A weight lifted from Lila Sinclair's chest, but one nagging thought remained: Did Grace Monroe, Evelyn's birth mother, know about her daughter's allergy? Had Grace intentionally served that dish to Evelyn, or was it merely an unfortunate oversight?

Curiosity burned in Lila's eyes. She hastily tucked the report away and dashed from her room toward Diana's.

Bursting into Diana's embrace, she exclaimed, "Mommy!"

"You little troublemaker," Diana murmured affectionately, stroking Lila's hair gently.

Clutching Diana tightly, Lila declared, "You're my only mother. You must love only me, understand?"

"What's gotten into you? Why so clingy all of a sudden?" Diana asked softly, continuing to smooth her daughter's locks.

Nestled in her mother's arms, Lila's mind wandered. The memory of her earlier suspicion—that Evelyn might be Diana's daughter—sent an icy shiver down her spine.

Lila felt reassured now. She was certain she and Evelyn couldn't possibly share parents. Their backgrounds were too different, their stories too mismatched. Evelyn was simply an illegitimate child. That was the undeniable truth. She'd been overthinking everything.

Diana patted Lila's back with a warm smile. "Enough dramatics. I have news—your cousin Nathaniel has been transferred to the Owathe Police Department."

"Really?" Lila's eyes widened with shock. She sprang up, face glowing with excitement as she turned to Diana.

Diana chuckled. "Yes, it's confirmed. Nathaniel starts next Monday and will arrive in Owathe within days."

"That's wonderful! Now I can see Nathaniel whenever I want!" Lila's joy was palpable. Then her expression dimmed slightly. "It's too bad Julian is always so busy. I haven't seen him in ages."

Diana nodded. "Julian's been filming in Chixdontely. Once he wraps up this project, he should finally get some time off."

Lila sighed. "Julian's an international superstar now—always working nonstop. When he returns, I'll take him out to relax and have fun."

"You should," Diana agreed, ruffling Lila's hair with tender affection.

Lila embraced Diana again, her face radiating complete trust and devotion.

Thankfully, Diana was hers alone—not Evelyn's mother. The thought of sharing Diana with Evelyn made Lila's stomach churn. She could never accept that. With this comforting certainty, Lila gradually closed her eyes, content.

###Chapter 467

At midday inside The Velvet Spoon...

"Alexander, what happened to your face?" Evelyn gasped, her eyes widening at the purple bruise marring Alexander's cheekbone. Her manicured fingers hovered near his injury without touching.

"Evelyn! This is the second black eye I've gotten thanks to you!" Alexander hissed through clenched teeth, his usually playful eyes burning with accusation.

Evelyn's breath hitched as realization struck. Her voice dropped to a whisper. "Nathan did this?"

"Who else would dare?" Alexander launched into the full story - how Nathan had overheard their conversation, misinterpreted their relationship, and confronted him last night.

Evelyn's delicate fingers curled into fists as the pieces clicked together. "So Nathan thinks I agreed to be with you because of what he overheard?" Her voice trembled with disbelief.

"Exactly!" Alexander confirmed, rubbing his sore jaw.

A storm of emotions crossed Evelyn's face - confusion, hurt, then bitter amusement. The irony cut deep. After everything they'd shared, Nathan still didn't understand her at all. If he did, he'd know she could never be with Alexander. Her heart had always belonged to one man.

Even when they were married, even at their lowest point - did Nathan truly believe she'd betray their vows so easily? The thought carved a fresh wound in her already bruised heart.

Alexander didn't need words to read her pain. With a sigh, he softened his tone. "Love makes fools of us all. Nathan heard me say I wanted to confess to you, then heard your agreement. His imagination did the rest."

Evelyn offered a hollow smile, the disappointment settling like lead in her stomach. At least their divorce papers were already signed.

"Don't mistake his actions," Alexander continued. "That punch proved how much he still cares. He thought I was hurting you by kissing Catherine."

Evelyn's lashes fluttered at this revelation.

"Speaking of which," Alexander suddenly grinned, "don't I deserve compensation for my suffering? Look what your ex-husband did to my perfect face!" He pouted dramatically, gesturing to his injury.

Despite herself, Evelyn chuckled. "Serves you right for putting on that ridiculous act in front of Nathan," she teased, shaking her head. "None of this would've happened if you hadn't pretended to be in love with me."

Alexander clutched his chest in mock outrage. "After everything I sacrificed for you! And this is the thanks I get?" His exaggerated pout finally drew a genuine laugh from Evelyn.

###Chapter 468

Evelyn burst into laughter at that. Then, she said, "Alright, alright! I appreciate your good intentions, and I'm truly grateful for your help, Alexander. But didn't I assist you too? Serena didn't end up going to Soling that day."

"That's true," Alexander admitted with a sheepish grin. He was about to continue when Evelyn's phone rang.

She pulled it out and answered. "Olivia."

"Evelyn, don't forget about your blind date tonight," Olivia reminded her over the phone.

"I know!" Evelyn replied with a hint of resignation. "Seven o'clock at the Milnd Restaurant, right?"

"Exactly!" Olivia responded cheerfully. "Don't worry, I'll be there on time," Evelyn assured her.

"Perfect. I'll be waiting at home for your good news. Well, I won't keep you any longer."

"Bye!" With that, Olivia hung up as abruptly as she had called.

"Another blind date tonight?" Alexander asked as Evelyn tucked her phone away.

Evelyn let out a resigned sigh before nodding. "Yes, Olivia has been setting them up nonstop. She's got me going on a blind date every other day!"

Hearing this, a complicated mix of emotions flickered across Alexander's face. He quickly composed himself and cleared his throat. "If you don't want to go, why not just say no?"

Evelyn shook her head and explained, "Olivia's been working tirelessly to find me a suitable match. She's screening men from all over the country. My rejections don't deter her—not really. I know her main goal is for me to meet other men. She hopes it'll help me move on from Nathan faster. How can I refuse such kindness? It's just a meal, after all. Nothing ever comes of these dates, so they're no big deal. Olivia's enthusiasm will wane eventually, and she'll stop arranging them sooner or later."

A wistful look entered her eyes, and a faint smile touched her lips as she added, "Besides, maybe I'll actually meet someone I like on one of these blind dates."

Alexander's gaze intensified. "Evelyn... Are you sure you want to let go of Nathan completely?"

"Absolutely." Evelyn's response was swift and firm.

Alexander straightened, his expression turning serious. "Evelyn... If, by some chance, Nathan realizes he's fallen for you... If that happens, would you be willing to give him—or the two of you—another chance?"

"Not a chance!" Evelyn shot back without hesitation, her voice resolute.

Alexander's expression froze instantly. He was taken aback by Evelyn's immediate and unwavering response.

His brows furrowed in confusion as he asked, "Why not? Evelyn, don't you still have feelings for him?"

###Chapter 469

Evelyn lowered her gaze, her long lashes trembling slightly. When she spoke, her voice was eerily calm, devoid of any emotion. "I won't lie—I still love him. But I'm exhausted. I can't keep loving him like this anymore. So whether Nathan cares about me or not... it doesn't matter to me now."

Her words lingered in the air, delivered with such detachment it was as if she were discussing the weather. There was no trace of heartbreak in her tone.

The more composed Evelyn appeared, the more unsettled Alexander became. After all this time, Nathan had finally realized his feelings for her, yet now Evelyn...

Then again, Alexander understood. Evelyn had truly let go of Nathan, and with that, any hope for their relationship had vanished.

Deciding not to push further, Alexander chose silence. Some things were better left untouched.

Yet later that evening...

Sitting in his car after dinner, Alexander hesitated only a moment before sending Nathan the details of Evelyn's blind date.

Five minutes later, his phone lit up with Nathan's name.

Alexander answered. "Yes?"

Nathan's voice carried restrained tension. "What is this you sent me?"

"The time and location of Evelyn's blind date tonight," Alexander replied casually.

On the other end, Nathan's expression darkened. "She's going on another blind date? Today?"

"Mm. Thought you should know. What you do with that information is up to you." Alexander kept his tone neutral.

There was a long pause before Nathan responded, his voice tight. "Understood. Thanks, Alexander."

Alexander rolled his eyes dramatically. "Save your gratitude. Just promise not to punch me again, alright? I'm starting to develop a reflex."

Nathan actually chuckled at that. "Fine, fine. I apologize. Happy?"

"Not good enough," Alexander countered. "From now on, you're paying for all our meals and drinks. Consider it emotional compensation."

"Deal," Nathan agreed without hesitation.

"Now we're talking. Gotta go." Alexander ended the call with a smirk.

That evening, Nathan arrived at The Silver Spoon restaurant. He chose a secluded table by the window, his gaze fixed on the entrance.

###Chapter 470

The restaurant door swung open moments later, revealing Evelyn Hartley's elegant silhouette. She glided across the floor like a shadow, choosing a secluded table by the window.

A well-dressed man immediately rose from his seat upon spotting her. "Ms. Hartley," Donovan Sinclair greeted with practiced charm, extending his hand. His smile never faltered as they exchanged pleasantries and sat down.

From his hidden vantage point, Nathan Black's jaw tightened. The sight of Donovan's smug expression made his blood boil. But then something unexpected happened - Evelyn said something that wiped the smirk right off Donovan's face.

Donovan's fingers twitched against the tablecloth. His father's orders had been explicit: secure Evelyn's affection by any means necessary. Yet here she was, calmly rejecting his advances before dinner even began.

This wasn't going according to plan.

Forcing his features into a mask of understanding, Donovan leaned forward. "Ms. Hartley, I completely understand your hesitation. After a recent divorce, jumping into another relationship must seem daunting. But sometimes life's greatest joys come when we least expect them."

Evelyn offered a polite but distant smile. "That's kind of you, but I'm really not looking for anything romantic right now."

"Perhaps if we-"

"Mr. Sinclair," Evelyn interrupted smoothly, "shall we focus on our meal?"

Donovan's eyes darkened. Beneath the table, his fingers flew across his phone screen, updating his father about this unexpected development. The reply came swiftly, making his lips curl into a dangerous smile.

When Evelyn excused herself to the ladies' room, Donovan seized his opportunity. After a quick scan of the room, he produced a small packet from his pocket. The white powder dissolved instantly into Evelyn's wine glass as he stirred it with a dessert spoon.

He thought no one saw.

He was wrong.

From the shadows, Nathan watched every movement with growing fury. His hands clenched into fists as Donovan's crime unfolded before him. The moment Evelyn disappeared around the corner, Nathan was on his feet.

Donovan barely had time to register the approaching figure before Nathan's fist connected with his jaw.

###Chapter 471

The restaurant erupted in gasps as Donovan Sinclair crashed to the floor with his chair. "Holy shit!" "What the hell just happened?" "Did that guy really punch him?" Patrons whispered in shock, their eyes wide.

Nathan Black's fist had landed with brutal precision, leaving Donovan dazed and struggling to focus. Before the older man could recover, Nathan was already hauling him up by the collar like a ragdoll and slamming his face into the table. The sickening crack made several diners flinch.

Not a single soul moved to help. Even the manager who'd come running froze mid-step when he recognized the attacker as Nathan Black.

Evelyn Hartley emerged from the restroom just then, her face paling at the chaotic scene. She rushed forward.

"Nathan! Stop this right now!" Evelyn grabbed his arm, trying to pull him away from Donovan.

Nathan's brows were drawn tight, his dark eyes burning with primal fury. He looked every inch the predator about to strike. Turning to Evelyn, his voice came out icy. "Ask him what he put in your drink."

Donovan went sheet-white at the accusation. Evelyn's gaze faltered, confusion flashing across her features. What was Nathan implying? Why was he claiming her as his?

Gasping for air, Donovan managed to croak, "Mr. Black... aren't you and Ms. Hartley already divorced?"

Nathan's expression remained stone-cold. "Divorced or not, she's still my ex-wife. Who gave you the right to lay hands on her?"

"I was wrong, Mr. Black! A moment of madness—I swear it won't happen again! Please, have mercy!" Donovan's words tumbled out in a panicked rush, his entire body trembling.

"Mercy?" Nathan's lips curled into a humorless smirk. Abruptly, he released his grip. Donovan staggered back, gulping air like a drowning man. His relief lasted exactly three seconds.

Nathan reached for the tainted drink on the table. He lifted the glass and set it before Donovan, his voice dangerously calm. "Drink this, and you walk away."

Donovan froze, staring at the glass like it contained venom. Beads of cold sweat dotted his forehead as his pupils dilated in terror.

"Mr. Black—" he began weakly.

Nathan cut him off with a voice like sharpened steel. "Or should I pour it down your throat myself?"

Every word carried the lethal precision of a guillotine's blade.

Donovan's entire body shook, his teeth sinking into his lower lip hard enough to draw blood.

###Chapter 472

Nathan knew there was no escape unless he drank the poisoned wine. With trembling fingers, he grasped the crystal glass, brought it to his lips, and swallowed the contents in one desperate gulp.

Slamming the empty glass onto the marble table, he turned to Donovan with bloodshot eyes. "Mr. Sinclair... May I go now?" His voice cracked under the strain.

Donovan remained silent. His icy gaze bore into Morse, clinically observing every twitch of the drugged man's muscles. He wanted to witness firsthand how the substance would unravel his prey.

The wait wasn't long.

Within minutes, the drug took hold. Morse's movements became jerky and uncontrolled. His pupils dilated wildly, his face flushed scarlet, and his fingers clawed at his collar like trapped animals. "Burning... I'm burning..." he slurred repeatedly.

Nathan's expression darkened, his jaw clenching so tight a muscle jumped in his cheek. His patience had evaporated.

He snapped his fingers at the cowering manager standing several feet away. "Call the police. Immediately."

"Right away, sir," the manager stammered, signaling frantically to his staff. He moved toward Morse, intending to restrain him before the man started stripping in front of the horrified diners.

But Morse lunged first.

With shocking strength, he grabbed the manager and mashed his lips against the man's cheek in a sloppy, drugged kiss.

The restaurant froze. Silverware clattered onto plates as guests gasped in collective horror.

Nathan saw red. His hands curled into fists, every instinct screaming to tear Morse limb from limb.

The drug had fully possessed Morse now. He staggered through the dining room like a rabid animal, grabbing at anyone within reach, attempting to kiss them with wet, desperate smacks. The potency of the substance was terrifying.

Nathan's thoughts immediately flew to Evelyn. If she had taken that drink...

White-hot rage exploded through his veins. His knuckles turned bone-white from how tightly he clenched his fists. The fury threatened to consume him entirely.

Without warning, Nathan seized Evelyn's wrist and dragged her toward the exit. His grip was iron, unbreakable. Evelyn stumbled in her heels, struggling to match his furious pace as he stormed through the restaurant doors.

Only when they reached the deserted parking lot did Nathan finally release her.

He whirled to face Evelyn, his rage palpable in the cold night air. "What kind of gutter trash were you meeting tonight?" he snarled, voice razor-sharp. "You agreed to a date with that animal? Have you lost all sense?"

Evelyn opened her mouth to respond, but Nathan cut her off with another blistering tirade. "Do you have any idea what would've happened to you tonight if I hadn't been there?"

Evelyn pressed her lips into a thin line, her long lashes fluttering against suddenly pale cheeks. "How was I supposed to know?" she shot back.

She'd never imagined Morse would dare drug her in a public restaurant. She'd trusted Olivia's judgment, believing anyone her friend introduced would be respectable. But even Olivia had been deceived.

###Chapter 473

"You were unaware?" Nathan's fury burned crimson. "Then you never should have accepted this absurd arranged meeting!" His voice cracked like thunder, raw with frustration.

Evelyn flinched at his intensity, her composure slipping for just a heartbeat. But she steeled herself instantly.

"Evelyn! Must you really subject yourself to these matchmaking games? Are you so desperate to throw yourself at the first available man?" Nathan's words carried the weight of a thousand unspoken confessions.

She met his stormy gaze, her expression serene yet unyielding. "Absolutely. I intend to rebuild my life and erase every trace of you from it," she countered.

"Over my dead body!" Nathan's control shattered. His eyes turned feral, veins throbbing at his temples as his entire frame trembled with barely contained rage.

Evelyn's icy laughter sliced through the tension. Without sparing him another glance, she pivoted on her heel.

But Nathan moved like lightning. His fingers closed around her wrist, yanking her against his chest.

Before Evelyn could protest, his hand cradled the base of her skull as his mouth crashed down on hers.

Shock paralyzed her for one electrifying second.

Then instinct took over. She fought like a wildcat, but Nathan's arms were iron bands around her.

His kiss deepened with primal urgency, his teeth grazing her lower lip in silent demand.

Evelyn kept her lips sealed tight, her body rigid with defiance.

Growing desperate, Nathan changed tactics. His tongue traced the seam of her mouth with devastating patience. When she gasped involuntarily, he struck—plundering her mouth with single-minded intensity.

The metallic tang of blood flooded their kiss as Evelyn bit down hard.

Nathan recoiled with a hiss, but she wasn't finished. Sinking her teeth into his lower lip, she tasted copper.

Seizing her chance, Evelyn shoved him away with every ounce of strength.

Nathan staggered back, his smoldering gaze locked on her. Blood painted his lips like some dark aristocrat from a gothic novel—beautiful and terrifying.

He swiped the crimson streak with his thumb, the gesture chilling in its casualness.

Evelyn's chest heaved with fury. "Nathan Black! Have you completely lost your mind?"

He advanced again, cradling her face between his palms. Their foreheads touched as he growled through clenched teeth, "Listen carefully, Evelyn. No more blind dates. No other men. That's not a request—it's a decree."

###Chapter 474

The air between them crackled with unsaid words.

Evelyn's pulse hammered against his fingertips where they still framed her face. "You don't own me," she whispered, her breath mingling with his.

Nathan's grip tightened imperceptibly. "Don't I?" His voice dropped to a dangerous murmur. "After everything between us?"

A car horn blared nearby, shattering the moment.

Evelyn jerked back as if electrocuted. Her fingers flew to her swollen lips, still tingling from the brutal kiss.

Nathan's expression darkened when he noticed the gesture. "Run if you want," he said softly. "But we both know you'll never outrun this."

Without waiting for her reply, he turned and strode away, leaving Evelyn standing alone in the gathering twilight, her entire world tilting on its axis.
###Chapter 474

Evelyn's breath hitched when Nathan's words pierced the air. Her pulse stuttered, but she quickly schooled her features into perfect composure.

Long lashes cast shadows over her stormy gaze as she deliberately avoided his piercing stare. "You lost all rights to dictate my life the moment those divorce papers were signed," she stated coolly, each word measured and precise.

Without hesitation, she pushed past him. The click of her heels against the marble floor echoed through the hallway as she walked away without a backward glance. Every step carried her further from the man who still had the power to unravel her.

Nathan watched her retreating figure, his jaw clenching as an unfamiliar ache spread through his chest.

Later that evening at the Caldwell estate, Evelyn recounted the night's disturbing events to Olivia.

"You're joking!" Olivia gasped, her teacup clattering against its saucer.

Marcus and Ethan's expressions darkened simultaneously. "That Donovan Sinclair has completely lost his mind!" Ethan exploded, slamming his fist on the armrest.

Marcus's knuckles turned white around his whiskey glass. "The bastard deserves to rot in hell for this."

Tears welled in Olivia's eyes as she reached for Evelyn's hand. "This is entirely my fault. I should have vetted him more thoroughly before introducing you. If anything had happened to you..." Her voice broke.

Evelyn squeezed her hand reassuringly. "Some people are masters of deception. Donovan clearly knew how to play the perfect gentleman around his elders."

Olivia's spine straightened with determination. "I'll make sure he faces consequences for this."

Nodding, Evelyn excused herself to seek solitude in her room. The evening's events swirled through her mind like a tempest.

Meanwhile, Nathan received a call from Walter upon returning to the Black residence.

"Mr. Black," Walter's cautious voice came through the line. "Donovan Sinclair was hospitalized under police custody. Despite emergency treatment, the drugs haven't metabolized. The doctors say... the only way to flush his system is through sexual intercourse."

Nathan's grip tightened around his phone, his expression turning glacial. Even through the phone, Walter could feel the dangerous energy radiating from his employer.

After a weighted pause, Nathan gave quiet, precise instructions that sent chills down Walter's spine.

###Chapter 475

The moment Nathan ended the call, Walter swallowed hard, realizing the severity of the situation. The Sinclair family was about to face devastating consequences.

By dawn, the Sinclair empire was already crumbling. Their flagship company, Sterling Holdings, was hit with a cascade of disasters. Regulatory violations halted multiple projects overnight. Operational secrets were leaked to the press, and long-buried scandals suddenly resurfaced.

Major investors pulled out without warning, canceling all ongoing partnerships. Banks froze credit lines for critical ventures. Within hours, Sterling Holdings became synonymous with corporate collapse.

The precision of this takedown left no doubt—the Sinclairs had angered someone with immense power.

Before anyone could process the shockwaves, explosive news spread through elite circles: Donovan had tried to drug Evelyn at a high-end restaurant, with Nathan witnessing everything.

High society gasped at Donovan's audacity. But they were even more stunned by Nathan's ruthless retaliation. Clearly, his goal wasn't just punishment—it was complete annihilation of the Sinclair dynasty.

One truth became undeniable: despite their divorce, Evelyn still held Nathan's protection. Those who'd considered targeting her immediately reconsidered their plans.

Inside the Sinclair mansion, Donovan paced like a caged animal. Nathan's counterattack had been swifter and deadlier than anticipated, leaving his entire family defenseless.

Taking a shuddering breath, Donovan grabbed his phone. The first call went unanswered. So did the second. On the third attempt, just as he was about to give up, a familiar voice answered.

"Hello?" Giselle's tone was cool.

"You have to help me!" Donovan's voice cracked with desperation.

"Help you?" She laughed bitterly. "After Mr. Black's declared war on your family? Who could possibly intervene now?"

Rage twisted Donovan's features. "Giselle! Don't play innocent! You gave me those drugs! This was your plan to humiliate Evelyn! Now that everything's exposed, you expect me to take the fall alone? Never!"

A shadow crossed Giselle's face. She exhaled slowly before responding in a measured tone. "Calm down. Yes, Mr. Black caught you red-handed. But the Sterlings won't abandon our allies. With our resources, your family can recover—if we handle this carefully. Understood?"

###Chapter 476

"I don't get it at all!" Donovan snapped, his voice sharp with frustration.

On the other end, Giselle rolled her eyes before responding, "Listen carefully. I'm not abandoning you. But my help has to stay behind the scenes—no public involvement. This stays between us. Understood?"

After a deliberate pause, she added in a measured tone, "Donovan, your family already crossed the Black family. Do you really want to make enemies of the Sterlings too?"

His expression darkened further. "Is that a threat?" he demanded.

"Consider it a reality check," Giselle countered smoothly. "Think it through. If you rat me out to Mr. Black, claiming I ordered you to drug Evelyn, do you really think he'll spare you? And do you imagine the Sterlings would let this slide? You'd have both powerful families hunting you down. The choice is yours."

She hung up before he could reply.

Donovan stood frozen, his face ashen. Minutes passed before he mechanically descended the stairs.

The moment his foot hit the foyer, the sound of shattering porcelain erupted. His father Franklin was demolishing the tea set, his face purple with rage.

When Franklin spotted Donovan, his glare could've melted steel. "I told you to charm Evelyn Hartley! To build bridges with the Caldwells! Not to—" He hurled a vase against the wall. "—try to drug her! Have you lost your mind? And getting caught by Nathan Black? You've destroyed our family's reputation!"

Collapsing onto the sofa, Franklin looked decades older.

Donovan couldn't meet his father's eyes.

Finally, when the tirade ended, Donovan approached. "Father, let me explain—" He laid out Giselle's entire scheme without omission.

This only inflamed Franklin further. "You idiot! She played you like a fiddle!" He gripped the armrests until his knuckles whitened.

After composing himself, Franklin continued icily, "But she's not wrong about one thing. Confessing to Mr. Black won't save you. You still attempted to drug Evelyn. That's unforgivable. And exposing Giselle means war with both the Blacks and Sterlings—a death sentence for us."

Franklin's gaze sharpened. "Do you have proof of Giselle's involvement?"

"Yes," Donovan said quickly. "I recorded everything."

###Chapter 477

A satisfied smirk curled on Franklin's lips.

"Excellent!" he declared. "This evidence will guarantee the Sterlings' cooperation from now on."

Donovan nodded vigorously, eyes gleaming with approval.

"We must visit the Caldwell residence immediately to apologize to Marcus and the others. Pray they'll show us mercy," Franklin stated firmly.

"Understood," Donovan replied promptly.

Meanwhile, in the VIP suite of Grand Ins General Hospital, Serena's face darkened as she processed the news. A cold dread crept into her chest.

The sharp rap of knuckles interrupted her thoughts before the door swung open. Nathan strode in with purposeful steps.

"You came," Serena breathed, hastily straightening her posture. She'd summoned him urgently - this matter demanded immediate attention.

Nathan settled into the chair beside her bed with deliberate calm.

"Rumors are circulating," Serena began carefully, "that you're punishing the Sinclairs because Donovan attempted to drug Ms. Hartley during their dinner. Is this accurate?"

"Absolutely," Nathan confirmed without hesitation.

Serena's carefully maintained composure cracked at his blunt admission. Forcing a strained smile, she continued, "Given Ms. Hartley is your ex-wife, I understand your need to intervene."

Nathan's piercing gaze held hers for a long moment before he spoke. "I came to deliver important news."

Serena's pulse stuttered.

"W-what is it?" she stammered.

"I owe you an apology. I must retract my promise." His voice remained steady, betraying no emotion.

Serena's eyes narrowed to slits. Her trembling lips parted as she demanded, "Nathan, what exactly do you mean?"

"I can't marry you." The words fell like a guillotine's blade.

The declaration struck Serena like a physical blow. Her world tilted violently, the ground crumbling beneath her. Several agonizing seconds passed before she could form words.

Her face turned ashen. When she finally spoke, her voice was barely audible. "Why? Is this... because of Ms. Hartley?"

Nathan met her gaze unflinchingly. "Yes. I've realized I'm in love with Evelyn," he confessed.

Serena's entire body went rigid. Her pupils dilated as the truth sank in - this wasn't a nightmare, but devastating reality. Disbelief warred with anguish in her shattered expression.

###Chapter 478

The initial shock gave way to a searing pain that contorted her delicate features. What had Nathan just confessed? That he'd fallen for Evelyn Hartley? How was that possible? When had these feelings developed? And what did that make Serena? Where did she stand in his heart now?

"Nathan, this has to be some cruel joke! Tell me you're lying!" Serena's voice cracked, her face twisted in anguish.

Nathan remained eerily composed.

His gaze met hers steadily, voice low but unshakable. "I would never joke about something this important."

Last night's events flashed through his mind - catching Morse slipping something into Evelyn's drink had unleashed a primal rage he'd never experienced. The mere thought of what might have happened if he hadn't intervened made his blood run cold. If Evelyn had actually consumed that tainted cocktail...

The memory ignited fresh fury. In that moment, he'd recognized an undeniable truth - the idea of Evelyn with anyone else was unbearable. That's when he'd finally admitted it to himself: he was irrevocably in love with her.

"No!" Serena shook her head violently, tears welling in her eyes. "I refuse to believe this! You're lying to me!"

She lunged forward, grasping Nathan's hands desperately. "Nathan, you've always loved me! We were going to get married! You can't just take that back! This isn't happening - it can't be!"

Gently but firmly, Nathan extracted his hands from her grip, a shadow of guilt crossing his features. "Serena," he said softly, "I know I broke my promise, and for that, I'm truly sorry. But I can't marry you now. If there's anything I can do to make this right..."

"I don't want your damn compensation!" Serena screamed, her voice raw with despair. Tears cascaded down her cheeks like a broken dam.

Nathan watched her breakdown with detached calm. He acknowledged his guilt for breaking their engagement, but that was the extent of his emotions toward Serena now. His only obligation was finding some way to make amends.

"How could you do this to me? How can you just throw away everything we had?" Serena sobbed, her entire body trembling with grief.

The pain was so overwhelming she felt numb, as if the world had drained of all color and meaning.

How had things come to this? When had Nathan developed feelings for Evelyn Hartley of all people?

Abruptly, Nathan rose from his chair. "I have matters to attend to," he stated coolly. It was clear Serena needed time alone to process everything.

Without waiting for a response, he turned on his heel and strode from the room.

###Chapter 479

Nathan's words struck Serena like a physical blow. Her tears froze mid-stream as she straightened her posture abruptly, her wheelchair creaking as she pivoted toward the door where Nathan stood with his back turned. The casual way he walked away shattered what remained of her composure.

Fresh tears erupted with twice the intensity, streaming down her flushed cheeks.

Losing Nathan meant losing everything. This couldn't be happening. She wouldn't allow it.

With sudden resolve, Serena flung aside her hospital blankets. The wheels of her chair squeaked against the linoleum as she propelled herself toward the Cardiac Surgery wing.

Evelyn Hartley had just finished consulting with a patient's family in the corridor when a shrill voice sliced through the hospital's sterile air.

"Evelyn Hartley!"

Every head turned toward the disturbance. Evelyn's brow furrowed in confusion as she spotted the approaching wheelchair.

Before Evelyn could speak, Serena launched her verbal assault. "How dare you? After six years of keeping us apart! Nathan divorced you and promised to marry me!" Serena's voice cracked with emotion. "Why can't you let go? Why poison his mind against me? Are you that desperate to steal another woman's fiancé?"

The memory of Nathan's cold dismissal fueled Serena's outburst. She needed to make Evelyn understand.

Time seemed to freeze in the hospital corridor.

Doctors froze mid-stride. Nurses dropped charts. Even the cleaning staff gaped at the unfolding drama.

Evelyn's expression darkened instantly. "Have you completely lost your mind? What ridiculous accusations are these?"

"Ridiculous?" Serena's laugh bordered on hysterical. "Then why can't you stay away from my future husband? The divorce is final! He's mine now!" Her voice broke as fresh tears spilled over. "Please, Dr. Hartley... I'm begging you. Let Nathan go. We've suffered enough already. Don't destroy our chance at happiness."

Her desperate plea softened even the most skeptical onlookers.

Murmurs rippled through the gathered staff.

"I never would've guessed Dr. Hartley was that type of woman..."

###Chapter 480

"Looks can be so deceiving, can't they?"

"Is this Nathan we're talking about? Nathan Black from the prestigious Black family?"

"Oh my goodness! No way! That means Dr. Hartley used to be Mrs. Black?"

"Wait, I just remembered something! Didn't Serena used to date Mr. Black? Their scandal was everywhere! I heard Mr. Black divorced Evelyn after she allegedly pushed Serena down the stairs at Leonard's birthday party. The very next day, he filed for divorce!" This juicy tidbit came from a patient's relative.

"Is that true? Evelyn sounds absolutely vicious, and she's a doctor? Preaching about saving lives while behaving like this? How disgraceful!"

A chorus of disapproving murmurs and mocking laughter erupted, all directed at Evelyn.

In the midst of this, Serena couldn't hide her smug satisfaction. This was exactly the outcome she'd wanted—to tarnish Evelyn's reputation so thoroughly that she'd be forced to leave the hospital.

Despite the accusatory glares and harsh whispers, Evelyn remained composed, as if the gossip wasn't about her at all.

Seizing the moment, Serena feigned distress and turned to Evelyn. "Ms. Hartley, now that you and Nathan are divorced, can't you just leave us alone?"

"That's right, Dr. Hartley! It's time to move on from your ex-husband!"

"Exactly! Your behavior is shameless!"

"You already pushed Miss Cole down the stairs once. Isn't that enough?"

The cruel, scornful words cut through Evelyn like knives.

With deliberate steps, she closed the distance between herself and Serena.

Stopping mere inches away, a faint smirk played on her lips as she said, "So, I stole your man? You think I'm still hung up on Nathan?"

"Yes!" Serena straightened, her posture radiating self-righteous indignation.

Evelyn let out a soft chuckle and nodded.

Without another word, she reached into the pocket of her white coat and pulled out her phone.

Watching this, Serena felt a sudden pang of unease.

Then, she heard Evelyn say into the phone, "Mr. Black, could you come to the Cardiac Surgery Department at Grand Oaks General Hospital immediately?"

Serena's expression shifted instantly at those words.

Nathan's concerned voice came through the phone. "Why? Is something wrong?"

"You'll see when you get here." Evelyn ended the call before he could ask anything else.

###Chapter 481

Evelyn turned to Serena with a knowing smile.

Fear shot through Serena's body like ice water. She gnawed at her lower lip before snapping, "Stop playing games! Nathan is swamped with work. There's no way he'd come here! Just stay away from him from now on!"

With that, she tried to wheel herself away.

But her wheelchair jerked to a sudden stop.

Evelyn held the chair firmly, her expression serene. "No need to rush off, Miss Cole. Mr. Black is already on his way. Don't you want to hear what he has to say?"

"This is ridiculous! Nathan isn't coming! You're just lying to everyone!" Serena struggled against Evelyn's grip, but the wheelchair wouldn't budge.

"Whether I'm lying or not, you'll see soon enough," Evelyn said calmly. "Though your desperation to leave makes me wonder... are you afraid of facing Nathan?"

Serena's face twisted with fury as she glared at Evelyn.

Evelyn stood her ground.

Within ten minutes, Nathan arrived.

The moment he appeared, the hospital corridor fell silent. All eyes turned in shock. No one expected Evelyn's call would bring the powerful CEO here so quickly.

Serena's expression changed completely when she saw Nathan approaching. As he strode into the Cardiac Surgery Department and took in the scene - Evelyn and Serena at the center of a crowd - his brow furrowed with concern. He went straight to Evelyn, completely ignoring Serena, which sent whispers rippling through the gathered staff.

"What's going on?" Nathan asked Evelyn in a low, urgent voice.

Evelyn met his gaze with surprising intensity. "There are some things I need to ask you publicly, Mr. Black."

"Ask away," Nathan replied without hesitation.

"When you proposed to me," Evelyn began, her voice clear and strong, "were you truly single? Or did you already have a girlfriend?"

Nathan took in the tense atmosphere and answered immediately, "I was completely single at the time."

He had ended things with Serena to protect her, and he'd been honest about that.

Evelyn continued, "During our marriage, wasn't it often Serena who called you late at night?" Nathan paused only briefly before nodding. "Yes."

Serena's face drained of color. His blunt admission hit her like a slap. She hadn't expected Nathan to reveal everything so easily, without any concern for her reputation.

###Chapter 482

Gasps rippled through the gathered crowd like wildfire.

No one had expected this explosive revelation. The truth was laid bare—Serena had been the one desperately clinging to Nathan, not the other way around. But what shocked Evelyn most was Nathan's unnerving composure.

Drawing a shaky breath, she leveled her gaze at him. "Did you divorce me because you thought I pushed Serena down those stairs?"

Nathan's piercing eyes never wavered. His voice cut through the tension like steel. "You filed the divorce papers."

The hallway erupted in murmurs. Even Serena's face drained of color. Evelyn had initiated the divorce? This changed everything.

Evelyn squared her shoulders. "Have I ever tried to win you back since our divorce?"

Every spectator held their breath as Nathan's answer came, soft yet devastating. "It's me who can't move on from you."

A stunned silence blanketed the corridor. Serena swayed in her wheelchair, her carefully constructed facade crumbling.

Evelyn's chest tightened with conflicting emotions—anger, confusion, something dangerously close to hope.

She inhaled sharply. "Mr. Black," her voice turned glacial, "we're divorced. Your relationship with Serena—or anyone else—is none of my concern. Stay away from me."

Without waiting for a response, she spun on her heel and marched away, her stilettos clicking like gunshots against the marble floor.

Nathan's expression darkened. The pieces clicked into place—Serena's poisonous lies. His jaw clenched.

Only when Evelyn disappeared around the corner did he turn to Serena. The look he gave her made her blood run cold.

Wordlessly, he gripped the handles of her wheelchair and pushed her forward. The air around him turned arctic, his stormy mood palpable.

The moment they left, the hallway exploded with chatter.

"Did that just happen?"
"So Dr. Hartley never stole Serena's man? Mr. Black proposed after they'd already broken up!"
"And did you hear? Serena kept calling Nathan at night with excuses—that's textbook mistress behavior!"

###Chapter 483

"Besides, after the divorce, it was Mr. Black who kept pursuing Dr. Hartley! He admitted it himself! How could Serena claim Dr. Hartley was the one clinging to Mr. Black? That makes no sense!"

"We were so quick to believe Serena's accusations and doubt Dr. Hartley earlier. How foolish of us."

"Yet Dr. Hartley stood her ground fearlessly! She called Mr. Black here to set the record straight, completely shutting Serena down."

"Her confidence spoke volumes! Clearly, Serena was spinning lies, and Mr. Black's support for Dr. Hartley was absolute."

The crowd murmured in agreement. With Evelyn and the others gone, the spectacle ended, and people began dispersing quickly.

On their way back to Serena's hospital room, Nathan remained silent, not uttering a single word to her. Only when they were inside did he finally speak, his voice icy. "What exactly did you say to Evelyn earlier?"

Caught off guard, Serena instinctively denied it. "I didn't... I didn't say anything." Her first reaction was always to lie.

Nathan fixed her with a piercing stare, his eyes narrowing slightly. "If you tell me the truth now, we can skip the part where I check the surveillance footage. What do you think?" he said coolly.

Serena's expression faltered. She bit her lip hard, cornered. Finally, she admitted, "I... I only asked Ms. Hartley to stay away from you."

She hesitated, then lifted her tear-filled eyes to Nathan, her voice trembling with hurt. "Nathan, I've waited for you all these years. Now that you're finally divorced, you could marry me. But instead, you say you've fallen for Evelyn and can't marry me anymore! How am I supposed to accept that? I know it must be because of something Evelyn said to you. That's why I had to beg her to leave you alone."

After hearing Serena's confession, Nathan's expression darkened. He took a deep breath, his gaze intense. His voice was thick with emotion as he said, "Since the divorce, Evelyn has never once sought me out, let alone pestered me! It's always been me who couldn't let her go."

"I'm the one who's been holding on to her!"

Serena had heard these words from Nathan before, but she refused to believe them. How could Nathan be the one obsessed with Evelyn?

Before she could respond, Nathan spoke again, his voice growing more forceful with each word. "I can't adjust to life without Evelyn. I can't stop thinking about her. I can't stand the thought of her with other men. It's all me. Do you understand now?"

Disbelief and denial flashed in Serena's eyes, turning them red. She couldn't accept his words. Each syllable felt like a knife twisting in her heart. The pain was unbearable. Tears streamed down her face uncontrollably.

Even as Nathan saw her distress, his expression remained cold. He clenched his jaw and said, "Serena, this is your final warning—don't approach Evelyn again. If you need to vent your frustrations, come to me."

###Chapter 484

Without another word, Nathan turned on his heel and walked away.

"Nathan!" Serena's desperate cry echoed through the air.

He didn't even flinch, his broad shoulders set in rigid determination as he strode toward the exit.

"No—" Serena's anguished scream tore through the silence as she collapsed to her knees, fingers clawing at her perfectly styled hair.

The hospital corridors buzzed with whispers all afternoon. Everywhere Evelyn went, she felt the weight of curious stares from her colleagues. Some nurses eyed her with barely concealed jealousy, while the interns regarded her with newfound wariness. She ignored them all, focusing on her charts with practiced indifference.

As evening fell, Evelyn changed out of her scrubs and headed toward the parking garage. The moment she spotted the familiar silhouette leaning against her car, her steps faltered.

Nathan stood waiting, his imposing frame illuminated by the flickering garage lights. When their eyes met, electricity crackled between them. Evelyn was the first to look away, marching purposefully toward her vehicle.

Her fingers had just brushed the door handle when Nathan's hand shot out, blocking her path. "We need to talk," he said, his deep voice resonating in the concrete space.

Evelyn tilted her chin up, meeting his intense gaze without flinching. "Mr. Black, I believe I've made my position clear. There's nothing left to say."

She attempted to open the door again, but Nathan's grip was unyielding. A silent battle of wills ensued, their locked gazes speaking volumes.

After what felt like an eternity, Nathan finally released his hold. Evelyn wasted no time slipping into the driver's seat and slamming the door shut with deliberate force. From fastening her seatbelt to revving the engine, she pointedly avoided looking his way.

Through her rearview mirror, she saw Nathan watching her departure before climbing into his own luxury car. Soon, his headlights appeared behind her, maintaining a steady distance no matter how many turns she took.

When they reached her neighborhood, Evelyn abruptly pulled over. Storming toward Nathan's vehicle, she rapped sharply on his window. He emerged with infuriating calm.

"Nathan, how long do you intend to stalk me?" Evelyn demanded, her voice tight with frustration.

His response came measured and low. "There's something important we need to discuss, Evelyn."

"Will you leave me alone if I refuse?" she countered icily.

Nathan said nothing, his piercing gaze answering for him.

Evelyn exhaled sharply, closing her eyes briefly before meeting his stare again. "Fine. What is it?"

"I owe you an apology. I never expected Serena to confront you like that," Nathan said, his voice uncharacteristically soft.

Evelyn blinked, momentarily caught off guard before regaining her composure. "Apology accepted. Anything else?"

Nathan stepped closer, his intense eyes searching hers. "Serena lashed out because I told her our engagement was over." He paused, his next words deliberate. "I've come to realize... my feelings for you run deeper than I imagined."

###Chapter 485

Evelyn's expression remained carefully neutral, though her jaw tightened momentarily. She lifted her gaze to meet Nathan's, shock clearly written across her delicate features. Her voice trembled slightly as she responded, "Nathan Black! Have you lost your mind? What kind of ridiculous nonsense are you spouting now?"

Nathan didn't flinch, his piercing blue eyes holding hers with unsettling intensity. "I mean every word. I know exactly what I'm saying and how I feel," he declared firmly.

Without breaking eye contact, he reached out and placed his hand gently on her shoulder, his touch sending an unexpected jolt through her. His voice dropped to a husky whisper. "Evelyn Hartley, I'm in love with you."

Evelyn's reaction was instantaneous. Her dark eyes dilated, and she quickly looked away, her long lashes casting shadows that concealed the storm of emotions raging within. Her chest rose and fell rapidly, betraying her racing heartbeat despite her outward composure. The sudden confession left her reeling.

Part of her wondered if Nathan might be suffering from some temporary insanity or fever-induced delirium to make such an outrageous declaration.

After what felt like an eternity, Evelyn finally gathered enough composure to meet Nathan's gaze again. The moment their eyes locked, her breath caught in her throat. In the depths of his intense stare, she saw her own reflection staring back at her, vulnerable and exposed. The intensity made her want to look away again, but she forced herself to maintain the connection.

Drawing a deep, steadying breath, Evelyn pressed her lips together briefly before responding with forced calm. "I... see."

Nathan's brows knitted together in confusion. This wasn't the reaction he'd anticipated. "That's all?" His voice carried an edge of frustration.

"What more do you want from me, Mr. Black?" Evelyn countered sharply, her green eyes flashing with defiance. "Were you expecting me to swoon? To burst into tears of joy and throw myself into your arms?" Her voice dripped with sarcasm.

Nathan was momentarily speechless. He'd prepared himself for various possible reactions - anger, disbelief, even happiness - but this cool dismissal wasn't among them. The woman before him remained an enigma, her walls firmly in place despite his heartfelt confession.

"Are we finished here, Mr. Black? May I leave now?" Without waiting for a response, Evelyn turned on her heel and strode purposefully toward her waiting car.

Nathan watched her retreating figure, a mixture of frustration and bewilderment crossing his handsome features. He ran a hand through his dark hair, exhaling sharply as she disappeared into the vehicle.

Inside the car, Evelyn's hands trembled slightly on the steering wheel. She closed her eyes, taking several deep breaths before starting the engine and pulling away with more force than necessary.

When Evelyn arrived at the Caldwell family estate, Olivia met her at the door with news. "The Sinclairs came by earlier to apologize," Olivia informed her, shaking her head. "We sent them away immediately."

Looking genuinely remorseful, Olivia added, "I'm so sorry, Evelyn. This whole mess is entirely my fault."

Evelyn reached out and squeezed Olivia's hand reassuringly. "It's alright, really. Your intentions were good."

"But perhaps we should put any more matchmaking attempts on hold for now, don't you think?" Olivia considered for a moment before nodding in agreement. Some things, she realized, were better left to unfold naturally.

Evelyn exhaled in quiet relief. At least for the time being, she wouldn't have to endure any more awkward setups - a small but welcome reprieve from the emotional turmoil of the day.

###Chapter 486

Olivia hesitated, her voice laced with caution as she inquired, "Evelyn, about you and Nathan... Is there something more between you two?"

At Olivia's question, a shadow of emotion flickered across Evelyn's face.

Nathan's unexpected confession suddenly replayed in Evelyn's mind like an unwelcome echo.

Before Evelyn could formulate a response, Olivia continued. "You've heard about Nathan's actions toward the Sinclair family, haven't you? His extreme reaction... Doesn't that make you feel anything?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together momentarily before answering, "No, my feelings toward him haven't changed." Yet Olivia could clearly see the storm of emotions swirling beneath Evelyn's composed exterior. Choosing not to press further, Olivia simply gave Evelyn's shoulder a reassuring squeeze.

After their evening meal, Evelyn retreated to the sanctuary of her bedroom. Standing beneath the steaming shower, she closed her eyes, letting the water cascade over her. Her thoughts were in complete disarray, a tangled mess she couldn't begin to unravel.

Despite her constant reminders to remain unaffected by Nathan's words and actions, she found herself failing miserably. His simple, straightforward confession had shattered her carefully constructed emotional walls, leaving her frustrated beyond measure. Never in her wildest dreams had she anticipated such a declaration from him. His words had ambushed her defenses, disrupting the fragile peace she'd worked so hard to rebuild.

What infuriated her most was how deeply Nathan could still affect her.

That night, sleep proved elusive. Evelyn tossed and turned until well past two in the morning before exhaustion finally claimed her.

The next morning, she dragged herself through her routine, stifling yawns as she descended the stairs for breakfast. After forcing down some food, she headed to the hospital, choosing to drive herself for the first time in weeks.

As she navigated the familiar streets, a flash of blue caught her eye - a luxury car parked along the roadside that she recognized instantly. Her foot instinctively tapped the brakes. After a brief hesitation, she accelerated again, speeding toward her destination.

The blue car fell in behind her without hesitation.

Evelyn drove without stopping, and Nathan made no attempt to intercept her. He simply maintained a steady distance, shadowing her progress like a silent guardian.

Only when Evelyn entered the underground parking garage of Grand Oaks General Hospital did Nathan finally turn his car around. It seemed his only purpose had been to ensure her safe arrival at work in his own stubborn way.

The entire situation left Evelyn perplexed, but she refused to dwell on it. There were patients waiting, charts to review - she had work to do.

After yesterday's dramatic events, the hospital staff and patients' families regarded Evelyn with newfound respect. She acknowledged their changed demeanor with professional detachment, showing no outward reaction.

Around noon, a nurse's voice interrupted her concentration. "Dr. Hartley, you have visitors."

"Understood," Evelyn replied, setting down her pen. She closed the medical chart on her desk and stepped out of her office.

In the hallway stood Julian and his aunt. Evelyn's professional mask softened into a genuine smile as she approached them, greeting the pair warmly.

###Chapter 487

"Dr. Hartley," Clara began, her dark eyes shimmering with emotion. Her hands trembled slightly as she hesitated to reach out, uncertain of the proper etiquette.

Julian cleared his throat. "Clara insisted on seeing you for her follow-up appointment."

Before he could elaborate, Clara interjected, "Dr. Hartley, I can never thank you enough. You literally brought me back from death's door."

Evelyn's warm smile never faltered. "I only did what any doctor would, Clara. Please don't mention it."

"I feel absolutely dreadful about canceling our dinner plans last week," Clara confessed, wringing her hands. "Would you allow me to make it up to you with lunch today? My treat."

Evelyn automatically started to refuse, "That's really not necessary—"

"Please," Clara interrupted firmly, "this isn't just politeness. It would mean the world to me."

Trapped by the older woman's sincerity, Evelyn relented. "Alright then. This afternoon?"

Clara's entire face lit up like sunrise. "Perfect! We'll choose a nice place, and Julian can—"

"I drove myself today," Evelyn cut in gently. "Just text me the address. I'll meet you there."

"As you wish," Clara conceded gracefully.

At precisely noon, Evelyn pulled into the valet parking of La Belle Époque, the upscale French restaurant Clara had selected.

Throughout the meal, Clara maintained a firm grip on Evelyn's hand between courses, showering her with gratitude until Evelyn's cheeks burned with embarrassment.

Over seared scallops and truffle risotto, Evelyn learned several surprising facts. Clara wasn't Julian's biological relative but had been the Hawthorne family's housekeeper for decades. Having raised Julian since infancy, he regarded her as his true mother.

Their conversation flowed effortlessly. By dessert, they'd exchanged numbers and made tentative plans for a spa day.

It was then Julian casually remarked, "Dr. Hartley, I hear you've been quite active on the dating scene lately?"

Evelyn's fork froze mid-air. She swallowed hard before answering, "Ah... yes. Unfortunately."

Clara's eyes sparkled with sudden interest. "You're single, Evelyn? What are your thoughts on Julian here?"

Julian's expression remained carefully neutral, though his fingers tightened around his wine glass. He'd deliberately steered the conversation this direction, knowing Clara would seize the opportunity. His beloved nanny had been nagging him about settling down for years, and her obvious approval of Evelyn made this the perfect setup. Yet throughout lunch, Evelyn had barely glanced his way. Did he truly leave so little impression? The thought stung more than he cared to admit.

Evelyn nearly choked on her champagne. After an awkward pause, she forced a polite smile. "Clara, let's not joke about such things. These dates are just to appease my friends. Besides..." Her voice dropped. "My divorce was finalized barely three months ago. I'm not ready for anything serious."

###Chapter 488

Clara blinked rapidly, her eyes widening in shock. The revelation that Evelyn Hartley had been previously married left her momentarily speechless. After collecting herself, she responded carefully, "Given you've just ended a marriage, perhaps it's too soon to consider new relationships. But I do hope you'll keep Julian in mind for the future. He's truly one of a kind."

Evelyn was taken aback by Clara's persistent endorsement of Julian despite learning about her divorce. She forced an awkward chuckle and quickly diverted the conversation. "Clara, you must try this dish. The flavors are exquisite."

Skillfully steering the discussion toward safer topics, Evelyn managed to ease the momentary tension. The remainder of their lunch passed pleasantly enough.

By meal's end, Clara had grown even more fond of Evelyn. As they walked together toward the parking lot, Evelyn spotted a familiar figure leaning against her car—Nathan Black. Her brows knitted together in irritation. Julian's eyes narrowed sharply at the sight of Nathan, his curiosity instantly piqued.

"Evelyn, who is that gentleman?" Clara inquired, her tone laced with polite interest.

"Just an acquaintance," Evelyn replied tersely. After a brief pause, she added, "Clara, I should be going now. Let's plan another outing soon."

"Of course," Clara responded with a warm smile.

Evelyn strode to her car, opened the door, and slid into the driver's seat. Without invitation, Nathan climbed into the passenger side. The engine roared to life as Evelyn pulled away.

Watching the departing vehicle, Clara turned to Julian with a puzzled expression. "There seemed to be... tension between Evelyn and that man," she observed.

"That's Evelyn's ex-husband," Julian explained. A knowing smile played at his lips, his eyes reflecting complex emotions. Clearly, Nathan still held significant sway over Evelyn's heart.

This revelation intrigued Clara. "So that's the famous Nathan Black! He certainly carries himself like a distinguished gentleman," she remarked, casting a sideways glance at Julian. "But Julian, that question you asked Evelyn earlier was rather forward. What's gotten into you?"

Julian merely narrowed his eyes, maintaining his silence.

"Are you developing feelings for Evelyn?" Clara pressed.

Julian responded with nothing more than an enigmatic half-smile, though his lack of denial spoke volumes. Clara returned the expression with one of her own—equal parts knowing and amused.

Meanwhile, as Evelyn navigated through traffic, she shot Nathan an irritated glance. "First you followed me this morning, now you're stalking me at lunch. What exactly are you playing at?"

Nathan answered with infuriating calm, "Isn't it obvious? I'm courting you."

Evelyn nearly swerved the car in surprise. "Courting me?" The words sounded absurd even as she said them. This had to be some twisted joke.

A cold laugh escaped her lips. "Nathan, this is ridiculous."

###Chapter 489
Nathan's jaw tightened visibly. "You don't trust me?" His voice was low, edged with frustration.

At the traffic light, Evelyn slammed the brakes and turned to face him. Cold determination flashed in her eyes. "We're divorced, Nathan. It's over."

Nathan leaned back against the seat, unfazed. "Divorce papers don't erase history. We can always start over."

Evelyn let out a sharp, humorless laugh. "There's no 'we' anymore. That ended the day you signed those papers."

Her words struck like a blade. Nathan's expression darkened, his fingers curling into fists. He studied her profile—the stubborn set of her jaw, the way she refused to meet his gaze. "You don't get to decide that alone," he countered.

Evelyn's grip on the steering wheel tightened. Without another word, she pulled over the moment the light turned green. "We're not going the same way. Get out."

Nathan exhaled sharply but didn’t argue. He stepped onto the curb, the door clicking shut behind him. Before he could turn around, Evelyn’s car sped away, leaving him standing in the wake of her defiance.

Watching her taillights disappear, Nathan smirked despite himself. Being dumped on the side of the road? That was a first.

Later that afternoon, Evelyn was sorting patient files when Lila’s excited squeal cut through the quiet of the office. "Mom! What are you doing here?"

Evelyn looked up to find Diana Prescott standing near the nurses' station. Dressed in a tailored plum suit, her dark hair swept into an elegant chignon, Diana carried herself with effortless poise. She smiled warmly at Lila. "I had some free time and thought I’d finally see where you work. Brought treats for your team."

Lila beamed, immediately snatching a macaron from the lavish spread being unloaded by Diana’s attendants. The other doctors murmured appreciative thanks.

"Mrs. Prescott, you’re too kind!"

"Please, have a seat!"

The staff’s deference was palpable—everyone knew Diana’s lineage as the eldest daughter of Soling’s prestigious Sinclair family.

One doctor, oblivious to the tension, called out, "Dr. Hartley, your mother’s here! Aren’t you going to say hello?"

Evelyn froze mid-signature, her pen digging into the paper. Lila’s face twisted with fury. "If you don’t know the facts, keep your mouth shut!" she snapped. "That’s my mother!"

The emphasis on "my" hung in the air like a slap. The room fell silent, glances exchanged in confusion. Did that mean… Evelyn and Lila weren’t sisters?

Setting the file aside, Evelyn approached Diana with measured steps. "Hello, Diana."

Diana gave a curt nod. "Help yourself to the refreshments," she said, her tone carefully neutral, her smile never reaching her eyes.

###Chapter 490
"Thank you, Diana," Evelyn Hartley murmured, pouring herself a steaming cup of coffee before returning to her patient charts.

The brief exchange sent ripples of curiosity through the hospital staff lounge, though no one dared voice their questions aloud.

Just then, one of Lila Sinclair's admirers piped up. "These imported snacks and champagne are so luxurious! We're truly fortunate to enjoy such treats, all thanks to Lila!"

"Absolutely! This lavish spread is courtesy of Lila and her mother," another colleague chimed in.

Lila offered a practiced, gracious smile. "I'm simply delighted you're all enjoying yourselves."

Diana Prescott didn't linger, excusing herself after only a brief stay.

The moment Diana left, Evelyn gathered her medical files and exited without a backward glance.

Seizing the opportunity, Lila exchanged a meaningful look with one of her companions. The woman immediately took the bait. "Lila, is it true you and Evelyn share the same father but different mothers?"

All conversation ceased as Lila confirmed with a serene nod. "Yes, Evelyn and I have different mothers."

The woman frowned dramatically. "But wait - didn't you mention sharing the same birthday? How can that be unless..." Her voice trailed off suggestively.

"The timing..." Murmurs spread through the room like wildfire.

Lila's cheeks flushed pink as she feigned embarrassment. "Yes, my father was... involved with Evelyn's mother while still married to mine."

Gasps filled the air. "So Evelyn's mother was the other woman? That would make Evelyn..."

The unspoken word - illegitimate - hung heavy in the sudden silence. Shock rippled through the gathered doctors, many struggling to reconcile this scandalous revelation with the composed surgeon they knew.

"Please," Lila said softly, "let's not use such labels. Evelyn is my sister, regardless of circumstances."

"You're far too kind! After everything, you still treat her with such grace," the woman marveled.

Lila affected a stern expression. "I won't hear another word about Evelyn's parentage, or I'll be quite cross."

The room fell silent, but the damage was done. Within hours, whispers about Evelyn's origins spread through the hospital corridors like wildfire, becoming the day's hottest gossip.

When the rumors reached Evelyn, she remained impassive. She'd anticipated Lila would weaponize their family history eventually. The gossip meant nothing to her - one couldn't choose their birth, after all. What did legitimacy matter when scalpel skills spoke louder than bloodlines?

Noticing Evelyn's apparent indifference, Lila's smile tightened. Was her stepsister truly unshaken, or merely putting on a brave face? Either way, watching Evelyn's reputation tarnish brought Lila a quiet, vicious satisfaction.

###Chapter 491

The Montgomery estate buzzed with rare excitement as Sebastian, Reginald's eldest grandson, emerged from his research lab to join the family dinner. As the meal progressed, Reginald turned to Sebastian with a curious glint in his eyes. "Sebastian, Leonard wants to introduce you to someone. Would you be interested?"

"Really?" Sebastian's father, the current head of the Montgomery family, nearly choked on his wine. "Who exactly does Leonard wish to introduce? Do we know her?" Victoria Montgomery, Sebastian's mother, leaned forward with thinly veiled suspicion.

Reginald answered without hesitation. "You've all met her before. She's Nathan's ex-wife, Evelyn Hartley."

"What? Evelyn?"

"That's preposterous!"

"How could this happen?"

The dining table erupted in shocked exclamations from Sebastian's parents and younger sister. Yet amidst the chaos, a spark of genuine interest flickered in Sebastian's usually impassive eyes.

Sebastian's father slammed his napkin on the table. "Father! Leonard must be joking, surely? Why would he think to introduce his former daughter-in-law to Sebastian? It's completely—"

"Leonard is deadly serious," Reginald interrupted calmly. "He holds Evelyn in the highest regard." The elderly patriarch paused meaningfully before adding, "He even mentioned that Nathan was a fool to let someone like Evelyn slip through his fingers."

Victoria's manicured nails dug into the tablecloth. "Meet her for what purpose? Sebastian could have any eligible woman in the city! Yes, Evelyn might be beautiful and accomplished, but her background is problematic! An illegitimate child with a failed marriage? She's utterly unsuitable!"

"Exactly! Evelyn would never be worthy of joining our family," Sebastian's sister sneered, tossing her hair over one shoulder.

Then came the bombshell.

"Grandfather," Sebastian's calm voice cut through the tension, "please arrange the meeting with Evelyn at your earliest convenience."

The silverware clattered against fine china as stunned silence gripped the room.

"Sebastian, have you lost your mind?"

"Darling, what nonsense is this?"

Reginald's eyebrows shot up in genuine surprise. His typically aloof grandson had never shown interest in matchmaking before. "You're serious about this, Sebastian?"

The young scientist nodded once, his expression unreadable. "Absolutely. Please inform Leonard I'm available whenever suits Evelyn's schedule."

"Excellent! I'll call Leonard immediately," Reginald declared, already reaching for his phone.

Victoria's face twisted in frustration. "Sebastian, that woman is—"

"Mother," Sebastian interrupted smoothly, "let's enjoy our meal." His tone left no room for argument.

Victoria slumped back in her chair, her dinner suddenly tasting like ashes.

###Chapter 492

After the evening meal, Reginald Montgomery retreated to his private quarters and dialed Leonard Grant's number. "Leonard, I've discussed your proposal with Sebastian, and to my astonishment, he's agreed! Please coordinate a suitable time for Sebastian and Evelyn to meet," Reginald announced.

On the receiving end, Leonard nearly dropped his phone in shock.

When their previous conversation had concluded earlier that day, Leonard had been plagued by second thoughts. Suggesting his former daughter-in-law meet his friend's distinguished grandson suddenly seemed like a terrible idea. He'd comforted himself with the knowledge of Sebastian's pride as the Montgomery heir - surely the young man would never seriously consider meeting Evelyn Hartley, Nathan Black's ex-wife, no matter how accomplished she was.

Yet against all expectations, Sebastian had accepted. Leonard was completely unprepared for this development.

"Sebastian actually agreed? Reginald, tell me you didn't pressure him into this," Leonard demanded skeptically.

Reginald's weary sigh traveled through the line. "Leonard, you know Sebastian better than that. No one can make that boy do anything against his will. He agreed voluntarily - even said his schedule was completely open. Can you believe it? Normally I have to beg him to come home for Sunday dinner - he's always buried in corporate takeovers. But suddenly he's cleared his calendar?" The older man's voice dripped with exasperation.

Leonard's eyes narrowed thoughtfully. This unexpected enthusiasm suggested genuine interest. Before he could respond, Reginald continued, "So please check with Evelyn about her availability. Let's arrange this meeting promptly."

A cautious pause followed. "I'll see what I can do," Leonard finally conceded. "But we must proceed carefully. Remember the Wagner incident when their son tried to drug Evelyn's drink? She's been understandably wary of arranged meetings since then. We may need to approach this gradually."

"Understood," Reginald agreed. "We'll proceed with discretion, but let's not delay indefinitely."

"Agreed," Leonard replied before ending the call.

Margaret Hayes, who had been observing quietly beside him, finally spoke. "Did Sebastian truly consent?"

Before Leonard could answer, the butler announced, "Mr. Black has arrived."

As Nathan entered the parlor, Leonard's expression shifted subtly. Turning back to Margaret, he confirmed, "Indeed. Sebastian even claimed to have an open schedule. Now everything depends on Evelyn."

Nathan's jaw tightened visibly at the mention of Evelyn's name, tension radiating from his rigid posture.

"Does this mean Sebastian has genuine interest in Evelyn?" Margaret asked, her surprise evident.
###Chapter 493

"Yes," Leonard replied, exchanging a glance with Nathan. "I've already discussed this with Reginald. We'll arrange for Sebastian and Evelyn to meet soon. I—"

Nathan interrupted sharply, his voice leaving no room for debate. "There will be no meeting!"

Margaret turned to face her stepson, her lips curling in disbelief. "Do you honestly think you can dictate Evelyn's life now? The divorce papers are signed. She's no longer your concern."

Nathan's jaw tightened, his piercing gaze unwavering. "I've come to realize I'm in love with Evelyn. I won't stand by while she dates another man."

The declaration stunned Leonard and Margaret into silence, their shock evident.

"Nathan," Margaret finally managed, her voice trembling slightly, "what did you just say?"

With deliberate calmness, Nathan repeated, "I love Evelyn Hartley, and I intend to win her back." This time, there was no mistaking his words. The older couple exchanged uneasy looks.

Leonard let out a derisive chuckle. "You're realizing this now? It's too late! The divorce is finalized!"

"A divorce doesn't erase feelings. People reconcile all the time—and we will." Nathan's confidence was absolute, his conviction unshakable.

"You really believe Evelyn would take you back after everything?" Leonard challenged.

"Without question. I know she still loves me. She'll come back to me because that love never died." Nathan's certainty rang through the room.

Leonard's laughter turned cold. "She loved you during your marriage too, yet she still left you."

Nathan's intense gaze never wavered. "I didn't understand my own heart then. Now that I do, I'll make this right."

Crossing his arms, Leonard asked skeptically, "Have you even told Evelyn how you feel?"

"I have," Nathan confirmed.

The admission surprised Leonard, who'd assumed Nathan's pride would prevent such vulnerability.

After a beat, Leonard pressed, "And how did she respond?"

Nathan's momentary hesitation spoke volumes. Seeing this, Leonard smirked in triumph.

"Don't think confessing changes anything. Do you know why Evelyn was so determined to divorce you? She's moved on—from you and from whatever you thought you had together!"

Nathan absorbed the verbal blow silently, knowing the truth in Leonard's words.

After a weighted pause, he met Leonard's gaze squarely. "Which is exactly why I need your help."

###Chapter 494

Leonard arched one brow in silent inquiry. "You're asking for my assistance? I'm not certain I grasp your meaning."

"Evelyn has been deliberately evading me," Nathan stated bluntly. His fingers tapped an impatient rhythm against his thigh. "I can't even secure five minutes of her time. But she trusts you—could you arrange a private dinner where we might speak properly?"

The older man's expression remained carefully neutral, revealing nothing of his thoughts.

Margaret broke the tense silence, her voice laced with maternal concern. "Nathan, are you absolutely certain about your feelings for Evelyn? Have you considered all the implications?"

Nathan's jaw clenched as her words triggered a vivid memory from earlier that day.

He'd witnessed Evelyn exiting the elevator with Julian Hawthorne and Clara Fernandez. Though he hadn't caught their conversation, whatever Julian said had made both women laugh brightly. The BergWind CEO had watched them with such open affection that the trio could easily be mistaken for a happy family.

A visceral wave of possessiveness crashed over Nathan. His hands curled into fists so tight his knuckles turned white. Only years of disciplined self-control prevented him from striding across the lobby and planting his fist in Hawthorne's smug face.

The mere thought of Evelyn with another man sent white-hot agony lancing through his chest. He couldn't—wouldn't—tolerate it. The very idea was unacceptable.

Meeting Margaret's gaze squarely, Nathan declared with absolute conviction, "I've never been more certain of anything in my life. She's mine."

"And what of Serena?" Leonard interjected sharply.

Nathan's frown deepened momentarily before he answered with brutal honesty. "I've already severed that connection completely."

Leonard blinked, visibly startled by his son's ruthless decisiveness.

Margaret turned to her husband, pressing gently, "Darling, Nathan has finally recognized his true feelings. He's handled the situation with Serena honorably. As his parents, shouldn't we support him? Besides, you've always adored Evelyn as a daughter. Surely you don't want to see her married to someone else?"

Though privately harboring reservations about Evelyn, Margaret prioritized her son's happiness above all else.

Nathan's gaze locked onto Leonard, a rare flicker of vulnerability surfacing.

Leonard exhaled slowly, avoiding immediate commitment. "I'll need time to consider this."

"How much time?" Nathan demanded, unable to mask his impatience.

Leonard shot him an exasperated look. "Must you rush everything? After years of indifference, suddenly you can't wait? Learn some damned patience!"
###Chapter 495

Without another word, Leonard rose abruptly and strode out before Nathan could respond.

Margaret turned to Nathan with a gentle sigh. "Your father needs time to process this."

Nathan gave a curt nod in acknowledgment.

For the next several days, Nathan made it his personal mission to shadow Evelyn's every move. His sleek black sedan trailed her vehicle like a silent guardian, maintaining just enough distance to avoid detection yet close enough to intervene if needed.

Evelyn had grown accustomed to his persistent presence. She deliberately ignored him, refusing to acknowledge his existence as she went about her daily routine.

One evening, Leonard extended a dinner invitation to Evelyn. After finishing work, she drove herself to the upscale restaurant.

Halfway there, Evelyn realized something was different. The familiar black sedan was conspicuously absent from her rearview mirror. A flicker of confusion crossed her features before she scowled at herself. Why should she care whether he followed her or not? His actions were none of her concern.

Arriving at the restaurant, Evelyn parked and made her way to the private dining room. Finding it empty, she settled onto the plush sofa to wait for Leonard.

Moments later, the door creaked open. Evelyn looked up expectantly, only for her expression to darken when she saw who entered.

What was Nathan doing here?

In truth, Nathan had arrived earlier but waited outside, fearing Evelyn might leave if she saw him immediately. Only after she'd entered did he make his move.

"Where's Leonard?" Evelyn demanded, her voice sharp with barely concealed irritation.

"He's not coming," Nathan replied calmly, closing the door behind him. After a deliberate pause, he added, "I arranged this meeting."

Evelyn's eyes narrowed, though her face remained composed. "Nathan, I have nothing to say to you. This conversation is over."

She stood abruptly, grabbing her purse as she moved toward the exit.

As she brushed past him, Nathan's hand shot out, fingers wrapping around her wrist.

"At least stay for dinner," he implored.

"No," Evelyn snapped, wrenching her arm free.

But before she could take another step, Nathan bent swiftly and scooped her into his arms with effortless strength.

Evelyn gasped at the sudden movement, her arms instinctively looping around his neck for balance.

"Nathan Black! Put me down this instant!" Her voice was laced with fury, though her body remained trapped in his firm embrace.

###Chapter 496

"I simply wish to share a meal with you," Nathan murmured, his deep voice husky with emotion as he carried Evelyn toward the dining table.

"I refuse to eat! Release me this instant!" Evelyn struggled violently in his arms, her voice sharp with defiance.

Nathan carefully deposited her onto a chair, his strong hands gripping her shoulders firmly. "You will dine with me tonight, whether you wish to or not," he declared.

"Is that so?" Evelyn let out a bitter laugh. "And what precisely will you do if I continue to refuse, Mr. Black? What's your brilliant plan then?"

"Then I shall feed you myself!" Nathan's gaze turned dangerous, his tone leaving no room for argument.

Evelyn stared at him, utterly speechless.

Had this man completely lost his senses?

Releasing her shoulders, Nathan's expression softened unexpectedly. His eyes held a quiet vulnerability as he spoke in a gentler tone. "Evelyn, can we have one proper conversation?"

When Evelyn saw the raw sincerity in his gaze, something twisted painfully in her chest - an uncomfortable mix of frustration and another emotion she refused to name.

After a tense pause, she steadied her breathing. "What exactly do you wish to discuss?"

"Our future together," Nathan stated with deliberate emphasis.

Evelyn's head snapped up, her eyes locking with his. The intensity in his stare made her pulse quicken, an electric tension crackling between them.

She quickly averted her gaze, forcing a dry chuckle. "There is no future for us, Nathan."

"If you desire it, there can be," he countered without hesitation.

"Well, I don't!" Evelyn fired back immediately.

Nathan's eyes darkened, a flash of pain crossing his features before he masked it. The swiftness of her rejection struck him like a physical blow.

He leaned closer, his voice dropping to a serious timbre. "Evelyn, tell me truthfully - what are you afraid of?" Before she could respond, he continued, "Is this about Serena? I've already ended things with her completely. I made it abundantly clear that you're the only one I want, which is why I've called off our engagement."

Evelyn had heard similar words from Nathan before, yet they still sent an unwanted jolt through her heart despite her best efforts to remain unaffected.

Now she understood why Serena had stormed into the Cardiology Department that day, eyes blazing with fury, ready for confrontation.

Shaking off the memory, Evelyn pressed her lips together tightly. "That's between you and Serena. It has nothing to do with me."

Nathan shook his head vehemently. "It has everything to do with you! You have feelings for me, and I'm deeply in love with you! We—"

###Chapter 497

Before Nathan could complete his sentence, Evelyn interrupted sharply. "That's ancient history."

Her tone was ice-cold, final. "Now... I feel nothing for you."

Nathan's pupils dilated violently, his face transforming into a mask of unreadable emotions.

Two heartbeats later, his voice emerged like distant thunder. "I don't buy that," he challenged.

Evelyn let out a derisive laugh, dripping with apathy. "Believe what you will. It means nothing to me," she countered.

"Evelyn, look at me!" Nathan's command vibrated with barely restrained passion.

Rolling her eyes, Evelyn finally met his gaze. She articulated each syllable with precision: "I said..."

"I don't feel any—"

Her declaration was cut short as Nathan bridged the gap between them, capturing her lips in a searing kiss.

Nathan cradled Evelyn's head with one hand while his other arm locked around her waist, pulling her flush against his body.

The kiss intensified, fueled by years of pent-up longing.

Evelyn fought like a wildcat, her fists hammering against Nathan's unyielding chest in desperate protest.

But Nathan stood immovable as granite, rendering her struggles futile.

The explosive moment ended as abruptly as it began.

After several electrifying seconds, Nathan withdrew—but not before giving her lower lip one last tantalizing tug.

Resting his forehead against hers, a roguish smirk played on his lips.

His voice dropped to that velvety baritone that always unraveled her. "Your pulse is racing for me, Evelyn. Just confess—you still want me."

His warm breath caressed her skin, that hypnotic voice weaving its familiar spell around her heart.

Evelyn couldn't ignore the storm raging in her chest.

Composure? She'd lost it completely.

Shoving Nathan away, she snapped, "Don't flatter yourself! Everyone's heart beats—except corpses!"

Nathan straightened, that infuriating smirk never wavering, eyes glittering with triumph.

The subject was abruptly dropped. When their food arrived, they ate in loaded silence.

Periodically, Nathan would place choice morsels on Evelyn's plate, which she pointedly ignored, pushing them aside without acknowledgment.

A shadow of resignation flickered through Nathan's gaze, yet his expression remained tender—almost unbearably affectionate.

###Chapter 498

"From this moment on, you're forbidden from going on any more blind dates," Nathan declared abruptly, his voice leaving no room for argument.

Evelyn didn't even look up from her meal. "Not only will I keep dating, but I'll see at least two men every single day," she countered.

Nathan's expression darkened instantly, his mood turning stormy.

He inhaled sharply through his nose. "For every date you go on," he threatened through clenched teeth, "I'll personally ensure it becomes a complete disaster."

Evelyn merely rolled her eyes. "Whatever you say," she dismissed with a careless wave of her hand.

Her nonchalance only fueled Nathan's irritation further.

Before he could respond, his phone suddenly rang.

Glancing at the screen, he saw Dylan's name flashing. His brow furrowed slightly as he considered answering, but ultimately pushed the phone aside, letting it ring.

Evelyn noticed, curiosity flickering in her gaze.

She silently guessed it was either Dylan or Serena calling.

The ringing stopped, only to start again moments later.

This time, Nathan rejected the call immediately.

But the caller was persistent - the phone rang again almost instantly.

With obvious reluctance, he finally answered. "What?" His voice was icy.

"Nathan, you need to get to the hospital immediately! Serena... she tried to kill herself!" Dylan's panicked voice crackled through the line.

"What?" Shock transformed Nathan's features instantly.

Dylan rushed to explain. "She slit her wrists in the bathroom! There was blood everywhere when we found her. They've taken her to emergency surgery, but it's bad - really bad. Nathan, you have to come now! I don't know if she'll make it..." Desperation colored every word.

"I'm on my way." Nathan ended the call abruptly and turned to Evelyn, his expression grave. "That was Dylan - Serena attempted suicide. I have to go to the hospital."

Evelyn's eyebrows lifted slightly at the news. Serena tried to kill herself? The surprise flickered across her face for only a moment before she schooled her features into indifference. "Go ahead. You didn't need to tell me," she said coolly.

Nathan stood immediately at her dismissal. But after a few steps, he paused and turned back. "Do you want to come with me?" he asked unexpectedly.

Evelyn let out a humorless laugh. "No thank you. I have no interest in getting involved in your drama with Serena."

Nathan studied her for a long moment before finally leaving without another word. The room fell into heavy silence. Evelyn picked up her teacup, taking a slow sip as her gaze drifted to Nathan's empty chair, her expression unreadable but her eyes shadowed with complex emotions.

###Chapter 499

Truth be told, a tiny fissure had momentarily cracked open in Evelyn's carefully guarded heart. Maybe it was the intoxicating warmth of the moment or the tender atmosphere that clouded her judgment. For a heartbeat, she'd almost given in to Nathan's plea. Thank heavens Dylan's call had jolted her back to reality. Nathan remained Nathan—the man who always put Serena first. Nothing had changed.

Once again, she found herself abandoned. The only difference this time was Nathan's half-hearted invitation to tag along. Looking back, that brief spark of hope in her chest now seemed utterly ridiculous.

She picked up her fork with renewed determination, focusing on the exquisite meal before her. Such delicious food shouldn't go to waste just because of emotional turmoil.

Thirty minutes later, Evelyn stepped out of the restaurant, deciding a stroll might clear her mind. Her footsteps were measured as she wandered down the street. Surprisingly, her mood wasn't as devastated as she'd expected. After all, this was familiar territory. Hadn't it always been like this?

Even if Nathan admitted his feelings for her, his sense of duty toward Serena remained unshakable. Whenever Serena summoned him, he came running without hesitation. And that so-called suicide attempt? Evelyn knew better. Serena would never actually harm herself—it was just another manipulative ploy to tighten her grip on Nathan, feeding his guilt and sense of obligation.

Evelyn was certain Nathan would never break free from Serena's web. Strangely, this realization brought an unexpected lightness to her chest. Their twisted relationship was no longer her burden to bear.

Just as she turned to head back, a rough cloth suddenly covered her mouth and nose. Evelyn's hands flew up instinctively, clawing at the strong arm holding the fabric in place. Before she could react further, another muscular arm locked around her shoulders, immobilizing her.

A sharp, chemical odor assaulted her senses. "Chloroform!" Her mind screamed in alarm.

Eyes narrowing, Evelyn held her breath and drove her elbow backward with all her strength. Her attacker grunted in pain, his grip loosening momentarily. Seizing the opportunity, she twisted free, gasping for air.

But victory was short-lived. An iron-like arm suddenly wrapped around her throat, cutting off her airway. Evelyn's fingers scrabbled desperately at the crushing pressure as her vision began to spot.

With her last ounce of strength, she stomped hard on her assailant's foot. His pained cry was music to her ears as his grip faltered. Without hesitation, Evelyn grabbed his arm, bent forward, and flipped him over her shoulder with a satisfying thud.

Coughing violently, she didn't hesitate—her fist connected with his face in a resounding punch.

###Chapter 500

"Ah!" The attacker's scream pierced the night air as Evelyn's foot connected with his ribs.

Gasping for breath, Evelyn delivered three rapid kicks to the man's temple. "You'll pay for this, bitch!" he snarled through clenched teeth, blood trickling from his nose.

Her vision blurred as another kick landed. The world tilted dangerously. Staggering backward, Evelyn barely registered the sedative's effects taking hold. Across from her, the assailant groaned as he pushed himself upright.

Every movement sent fresh waves of pain through the man's battered body. His murderous advance halted when approaching footsteps echoed nearby. Glaring at Evelyn's defensive stance, he spat on the pavement before limping into the shadows.

Evelyn collapsed against a park bench, her chest heaving. That last confrontation had drained her completely. Without the timely interruption, she might not have survived - the drugs made her limbs feel like lead, and her attacker had been frighteningly strong.

"Miss? Do you need help?" A young woman's voice cut through Evelyn's haze.

Looking up through sweat-dampened bangs, Evelyn saw a concerned couple hovering nearby. "Please," she rasped between coughs, "call the police."

The woman already had her phone out. "Already dialing!"

Police sirens wailed within minutes. Two officers took Evelyn's statement with growing concern. "Ms. Hartley," the senior officer exchanged a look with his partner, "we need you at the station. Your description matches a suspect in our current investigation."

Evelyn's fingers trembled as she nodded. "Of course."

Her legs buckled the moment she stood. Strong hands caught her before she hit the pavement. "Easy there," the officer murmured. "We'll get you medical attention first. Our detectives can take your formal statement at the hospital."

"Thank you," Evelyn whispered, leaning heavily on the officer's arm. Every muscle screamed in protest.

At the emergency room, doctors documented the angry red ligature marks circling Evelyn's throat - deep enough to draw blood in places. They swabbed beneath her nails for DNA evidence while an IV dripped fluids into her arm.

Captain Dominic Kingsley of Major Crimes arrived as the nurses finished their work. "Ms. Hartley," he said gravely, "your attacker matches the description of a serial rapist we've been tracking." Evelyn's IV line trembled as her breath caught. "Three victims in the past month. You're the first to fight back."
