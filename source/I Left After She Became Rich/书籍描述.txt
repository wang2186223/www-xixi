I worked myself to the bone to pay off my girlfriend's debts, only to discover her "poverty" was a lie to make her rich ex jealous. Humiliated, I vanished. Now she's back, claiming it was all for us. But can I trust the woman who shattered my heart, especially when a new love offers me everything she never did?
