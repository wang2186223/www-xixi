###Chapter 1

My girlfriend had accumulated a massive debt to treat her mother's illness.

To repay the debt, we worked at the company during the day and took on part-time jobs in the evenings and weekends.

That day, I disguised myself as a male ghost NPC, lurking in the corner of an escape room, ready to scare the incoming guests as per the routine.

Soon, a couple stumbled in, disheveled and kissing.

The man gasped:

"Camille, let me see the lace lingerie I gave you today. I want to tear it apart!"

"We've already torn seven today... and we still have to go to the hotel for your mother's birthday tonight..."

I thought it was a coincidence. Camille's mother was in a vegetative state, hospitalized for years.

The next second, the woman noticed me and threw the warm lingerie and cash at my face.

"Shut your eyes and get out!"

Blood seeped from my forehead, but I stood frozen.

That voice belonged to the woman I had loved for three years.

...

"Ethan, what are you doing? Don't disturb Ms. Grandelle and her boyfriend. Get out now!"

The manager's voice in my earpiece snapped me back to reality.

I picked up the props and fled the room in disarray, the sounds of intimacy following me.

When I reached the front desk, I looked down at what I was holding.

Among the plastic props and red paint was the lingerie and the stack of money.

The money was thick, at least twenty thousand dollars, brand new and sequentially numbered. No wonder it had cut my forehead.

If this money hadn't been thrown at me while my girlfriend was intimate with another man, I would have been thrilled.

I might have even taken a photo and sent it to Camille, boasting:

"Look, we have enough for your mother's medical expenses this month. You don't have to work so hard."

But now... Ms. Grandelle?

Was this really the same person who, to save money for her mother's treatment, split every dollar, shared a rental apartment with me, ate instant noodles, and promised me happiness?

If the man inside was her boyfriend, what was I?

The items in my arms fell to the ground with a dull thud.

Several wealthy young women sitting at the front desk glanced over and chuckled knowingly:

"Camille's unattainable love just returned, and she's already this eager. She's torn dozens of lingerie these past few days, hasn't she? She's so generous, each piece costs over a hundred thousand dollars. Isn't she afraid that poor guy will find out?"

"Why should she be? Camille is rich. What can that poor guy do even if he finds out? Liam went abroad three years ago, and Camille only dated that guy out of spite. Now that Liam is back, what does that guy matter? It's a pity Camille had to pretend to be poor for three years."

"Camille has always been a romantic, swearing she'd only marry Liam and spend money on him. No other man could touch her. That Ethan actually believed her lies, working hard to help her repay debts and save her mother. It's hilarious..."

Their words struck me like thunder, causing my insides to ache.

They were excitedly watching the monitor, and I followed their gaze, my breath catching.

Under the night vision camera, the woman was on top of the man, passionately entangled, expressing their longing.

Even in the dim light, even with only a side profile, I recognized her instantly.

I had never seen Camille so passionate and wild in the three years we were together.

She suddenly looked at the camera, quickly covered Liam with her jacket, and grabbed a skull to throw at it.

"Get out! How dare you watch Liam? I'll gouge your eyes out if you look again!"

The screen turned to static, and someone awkwardly rubbed their nose:

"The light is so dim, and she covered Liam so well. What could we see? Camille is so protective."

"A few days ago, we joked about admiring Ethan's physique, and she just smiled and nodded. But Liam is her heart and soul. The treatment is different."

I clenched my fists, then let them go weakly.

It turns out that when faced with an unbearable truth, the first reaction isn't anger but disbelief.

The manager reminded me three times that I could remove my makeup and leave, but I stubbornly remained in place.

I couldn't believe that the person they described as playing with emotions was the woman I had loved for three years.

An hour later, the woman walked out of the escape room, arm in arm with Liam.

The bright light outlined Camille's delicate face, shattering my self-deception completely.

Liam's neck was covered in hickeys. He noticed the wound on my forehead and said apologetically:

"Hey, man, my girlfriend has a bit of a temper. Sorry about that. Don't take it to heart. She's just very possessive of me."

"Camille, compensate him."

Camille's eyes met mine, and I thought she recognized me.

I hoped she would explain, even if she denied the "girlfriend" title, making me feel less like a joke.

Instead, she took out a check, scribbled a number, and tossed it at my feet, saying coldly:

"Keep your mouth shut. If you spread any rumors that tarnish Liam's reputation, I won't let you off."

After three years together, I could recognize her in the dark.

Now, I stood right in front of her, only wearing NPC makeup, yet she was too busy warning me not to damage her "boyfriend's" reputation.

Did she really not recognize me, or had I never mattered to her?

Camille linked arms with Liam and walked toward the Bentley outside, opening the door for him and fastening his seatbelt before driving away.

From start to finish, she didn't look at me again.

As I watched the limited-edition Rolls-Royce with the "A" license plate, a bitter feeling welled up inside me.

Because we were saving money to repay debts and pay for medical expenses, we couldn't afford a car, only a second-hand scooter.

Countless times, when luxury cars with handsome men passed by, Camille would point at them and say to me:

"Ethan, just wait. I'll make sure you ride in a car like that one day. The passenger seat will be yours alone."

Back then, I thought that even if I had to ride a scooter for the rest of my life, having her say that made me the happiest man alive.

Now she had a luxury car, but the man in the passenger seat wasn't me.
###Chapter 2

I returned to the apartment after removing my makeup.

A photo of Camille Grandelle's mother was saved on my phone.

The check lay quietly on the table.

The amount was enough to cover a year's worth of medical expenses.

Camille Grandelle.

How many more secrets are you hiding?

The sound of keys turning came from the door.

I quickly stuffed the check into the drawer.

"Ethan, I got my paycheck."

Camille walked in carrying strawberries.

She held up the bag with a bright smile.

"Your favorite strawberries, fresh and sweet."

Her gaze suddenly stopped on my forehead.

Her smile froze instantly.

"How did you get hurt?"

She rushed over and cupped my face.

Her fingertips gently touched the wound.

"Does it hurt?"

I turned my head away from her touch.

"I accidentally scratched it."

My eyes fell on the strawberries.

"Don't always buy such expensive things."

She smiled and pinched my cheek.

"How could spending money on you be a waste?"

"Ethan, I want to give you the whole world."

"You've suffered with me."

"I'll work hard to make sure my baby has a good life."

Silence spread through the air.

Her sweet words were still moving.

But the lingering scent of Liam Valentine's perfume on her was sickeningly sweet.

Camille didn't notice my unease.

She laughed when she saw my phone screen.

"Most people like to look at beautiful women."

"Why are you looking at an old lady?"

"Old and ugly."

I was stunned.

"You don't recognize her?"

She looked completely confused.

"No, I don't."

"Is she a relative of yours?"

"We should bring gifts and visit her sometime."

She grabbed her coat and hurriedly put it on.

"I have a part-time job tonight."

"I can't have dinner with you."

"Wait for me to come back."

The door closed softly.

I stood there, feeling cold all over.

It was she who took me to the hospital back then.

Pointing at the old woman on the hospital bed, she choked back tears.

Saying it was her mother.

But now she claims she doesn't recognize her?

I followed Camille's car in a taxi.

She entered a luxury mall.

When she came out, she was wearing an expensive gown.

The hotel lobby was brilliantly lit.

Liam Valentine was in a tailored suit.

He was cooing to a noblewoman.

Her features resembled Camille's.

Camille walked up and handed over a gift box.

"Mom, happy birthday."

Her voice was clear in my ears.

A sense of absurdity washed over me.

Anger and heartache intertwined.

I thought of the past three years.

She was always worried about medical bills and debts.

I felt for her struggles.

I worked tirelessly to share the burden.

As soon as my paycheck came in, I transferred it to her.

I went hungry, drinking water to fill my stomach.

I fainted multiple times but didn't dare go to the hospital.

It was all a lie.

That sick mother never existed.

Her weariness and sorrow.

Were only because Liam had gone abroad.

Everything I had done was a joke.

The banquet was halfway through.

Eleanor Grandelle stood up to announce.

"Thank you all for coming to the birthday gala."

"I have some good news to share."

"Camille and Liam have been childhood sweethearts."

"Their engagement party will be held in three days."

"Please do come."

The guests congratulated them.

Someone asked curiously.

"I heard Camille has a boyfriend?"

Eleanor's face darkened instantly.

"Some poor, low-class thing."

"Worthy of our Grandelle family?"

"Camille was just playing around."

"A social climber trying to become a phoenix?"

All eyes turned to Camille.

She was silent for a moment, then smiled faintly.

"Mother is right."

"Just a social climber."

"Let's do as you say."

I looked up in shock.

Liam giggled and hugged her.

Camille took out a diamond solitaire.

She slipped it onto his ring finger.

Amid cheers, she kissed his fingertip.

That ring was worth two hundred million.

I looked down at the ring on my finger.

She gave it to me on our first anniversary.

A few hundred dollars, not even pure silver.

It had long since tarnished and turned black.

But I couldn't bear to take it off.

Hiding in the corner like a voyeur.

Watching them hold hands as they accepted toasts.

Camille drank all the alcohol for Liam.

She handed him juice with a gentle tone.

"You're allergic to alcohol, drink this."

Liam leaned on her shoulder happily.

"Camille, you're so good."

Memories flooded back.

She had a weak stomach.

At every drinking session, I drank for her.

I would rather drink until my stomach bled.

Than let her touch a single drop.

I cared for her meticulously for three years.

Now she was risking her health for someone else.

Camille drank a lot that night.

Liam helped her towards the guest room.

Reason told me to leave.

But my feet followed against my will.

The door was slightly ajar.

Ambiguous sounds came from inside.
###Chapter 3

My fingers trembled as I dialed Camille Grandelle's number.

The phone rang over a dozen times before she answered.

Her voice came through, hoarse and breathless:
"Ethan?"

I choked out the words:
"Camille, let's get married."
"I don't need a dowry."
"I'll work hard to support you."
"Come back now."
"We'll go get the marriage license right away."
"Please?"

Tears streamed down my face uncontrollably.
I knew how pathetic I sounded at that moment.
But love makes you lose all reason.
If only she would come back.
I could forgive everything.

Camille was silent for a moment.
Then she chuckled softly:
"Silly, why are you crying?"
"I never said I wouldn't marry you."

Her voice was as gentle as if she were soothing a child:
"Mom is still in the hospital."
"I'm not in the mood for marriage right now."
"I can't let you bear all the burden alone."
"When she gets better, I'll earn more money."
"We'll buy a house and a car."
"Then I'll marry you in style."
"Just wait a little longer for me."

Suddenly, there was a muffled groan on the other end.
She spoke hurriedly:
"I have a part-time job that will keep me busy late."
"I won't be coming back."
"Remember to lock the door."
"I'll bring you something nice to eat."

The call ended abruptly.
The sounds from the bedroom became increasingly unbearable.
I numbly put down the phone.
Letting the tears soak my shirt.

On the way back, a torrential rain poured down.
The rain mixed with my tears blurred my vision.
My head grew heavier.
My steps became slower.
The last thought before I lost consciousness—
Camille, I won't wait for you anymore.

I woke up in the hospital.
The nurse said a kind stranger had brought me in.
Three days had passed.
There were no messages from Camille on my phone.
She used to say goodnight no matter how busy she was.
And remind me to eat breakfast.

The nurses' chatter drifted into my ears:
"The Grandelle heiress is getting engaged!"
"To the Valentine family's young master."
"She bought all the fireworks in the city for the proposal last night."
"And there was a drone show!"
"Thousands of drones formed a heart!"
"So romantic..."

I listened in a daze.
Suddenly, my phone rang.
It was my part-time manager:
"Ethan, there's a bachelor party tonight that needs a mascot performance."
"The pay is good."
"I specifically recommended you."
"Don't let me down."

I wanted to refuse.
But the manager had always been kind to me.
So I agreed.
I wouldn't use Camille's check.
I had given her all my savings.
But I still needed to survive.

I used the money from my escape room part-time job to pay the medical bills.
For the first time in three years, I spent money on myself.
After all, she didn't need this small amount anymore.

A bitter smile formed on my lips.
Camille's "experience of ordinary life" was over.
It was time for her to return to her prince.
They were truly a match made in heaven.
We were never from the same world.
These three years were just a dream.
Now that the dream was over.
We would each return to our rightful places.
###Chapter 4

I never imagined that the client who booked the bachelor party would be Liam Valentine.

The dim lighting in the private room cast a seductive glow. Liam lounged lazily on the leather sofa.

Surrounding him were several well-dressed men and women, all eyeing me with amusement.

Liam casually tossed a set of clothes at my feet.

"I heard Mr. Roland is quite skilled at entertaining guests," he said with a mocking smile.

"Put this on and liven things up for my friends."

It could hardly be called clothing.

A few flimsy pieces of fabric barely stitched together, leaving little to the imagination.

Maintaining my professionalism, I calmly replied, "Mr. Valentine, this is beyond our service scope."

"I have prepared a Doraemon costume and can perform magic tricks for everyone."

Before I could finish, a sharp slap landed on my face.

The burning pain spread instantly.

Liam's fake warmth vanished, replaced by icy coldness.

"In your line of work, the customer is always right," he said.

"If you won't change, I'll have to have a word with your manager."

His casual tone was laced with threat.

I knew he had the power to shut down the manager's business.

I couldn't let others suffer because of me.

I bent down to pick up the outfit.

Just as my fingers touched the fabric, Liam spoke again.

"Wait," he said, swirling his glass with a malicious grin.

"Be professional. Take off your clothes first."

"Do it in front of everyone, so you can't pull any tricks."

The men on the sofa chuckled suggestively.

Their gazes slithered over my body like sticky snake tongues.

Finally, I understood.

Liam had been toying with me from the start.

"I'm sorry, but I can't take this job," I said, turning to leave.

Two burly men immediately blocked my path.

One of them kicked the back of my knee.

The excruciating pain forced me to my knees.

Liam stood up and walked over.

He grabbed my hair, forcing me to look up.

A dozen slaps rained down on my face.

"Poor trash should speak on their knees," he sneered.

Leaning close, he whispered in my ear, "Camille said her mother was seriously ill? Owed a lot of money?"

"It was a lie."

"She just wanted to make me jealous, so she used you."

"Who knew you'd take it seriously and even propose?"

"The hundreds of thousands you transferred to her, she used it all to please me."

"Every time I replied to her message, she sent me a hundred thousand as a gift."

"Too bad it wasn't enough, gone in no time."

"Even as a simp, you're a failure."

He yanked open my collar.

"Did you seduce Camille with this body?"

"Today, I'll let you seduce to your heart's content."

The men closed in.

Rough hands tore at my clothes.

I struggled fiercely.

Annoyed by the noise, Liam grabbed a bottle and smashed it over my head.

The sound of shattering glass pierced my eardrums.
###Chapter 5

Warm liquid trickled down my temple.

My vision was stained with crimson.

Consciousness wavered in a dizzying haze.

The sound of fabric tearing pierced the air.

The door was kicked open with a loud crash.

"What are you doing?!"

Camille Grandelle rushed in and pushed them away.

She reached out to help me.

I violently shook her off.

My eyes fixed on her designer gown.

A bitter smile twisted my lips.

"Camille, was it fun to deceive me?"

"It's not what you think..."

"At this hour, you should be working at KFC. What fast-food joint lets employees wear hundred-thousand-dollar dresses? Your daily wage couldn't even buy a thread of that fabric."

Camille fell silent.

Liam Valentine sneered from the side.

"Sharp eyes. Found out Camille's rich and couldn't wait to cash in?"

"I always said no one would willingly be a simp. You probably figured out Camille's background and clung to her, dreaming of climbing up. How pathetic."

Rage and despair burned in my chest.

I had only loved someone sincerely.

Wanted to share her burdens.

Never trampled on anyone's feelings.

Why should I endure such humiliation?

I slapped Liam across the face.

Camille's expression instantly changed.

She shoved me away.

Shielded the sobbing Liam behind her.

"Ethan Roland! How could you hit him?"

I pointed at my bleeding temple and laughed coldly.

"He smashed a bottle on my head, and you're upset over a slap?"

"Camille, the game of playing poor princess is over. We're done."

I turned to leave.

Camille caught up and grabbed my wrist.

"Ethan, don't go. I actually..."

Liam suddenly interrupted with a tearful voice.

"Camille, you're carrying our child. Mom's waiting at home to celebrate."

Camille's fingers trembled.

After a moment's hesitation.

She finally let go.

"Ethan, don't make a scene now. Go home and wait for me. I'll explain everything tomorrow."

She hurried away with Liam.

I watched her retreating figure with a bitter laugh.

Tomorrow?

Tomorrow's your engagement party.

No, with a child on the way, you'll probably just get married directly.

My phone vibrated.

A message from the manager.

"Ethan, the client is very satisfied. Here's your payment."

The transfer amount was staggering.

Mr. Valentine sure is generous.

Camille's messages kept coming.

"Ethan, it's not what you think. Let me handle this, then I'll explain. Just give me a little more time, okay?"

Three years.

I've waited long enough.

The clock struck midnight.

Our fourth anniversary.

And she's about to become someone else's bride.

I sent one final message.

"Camille, happy engagement."
###Chapter 6

The phone vibrated in my palm.

Camille Grandelle's name flashed repeatedly on the screen.

I didn't answer.

Letting the ringtone echo in the silence.

"Why do you always look so disheveled every time I see you?"
A voice came from beside me.

Chloe Roscente stood by the roadside, appearing out of nowhere.

She glanced at the wound on my temple, her brow furrowing slightly.

She opened the car door and gestured for me to get in.

Then she went to the pharmacy to buy iodine and band-aids.

As the cotton swab dipped in disinfectant touched the wound, the phone rang again.
Chloe continued her task without pause. "Not going to answer?"

I turned my head.

The car window reflected my pale face.

"What's the point?"
"To hear her spin more lies?"
"Tonight she'll be busy taking care of Liam and their child."

Chloe remained silent.
She carefully applied the band-aid, her movements gentle.

I remembered the first time I saw her, in that escape room.
Everyone else was gathered around the monitor, laughing.
Only she sat quietly in the corner, like a painting.

After Camille and the others left, she approached me.
Her eyes swept over the scattered bills and underwear on the floor.
"Don't step on that filth."
"She's not worthy of you."

I asked if she had recognized me then.
Chloe's lips curved slightly. "I saw you a few times from afar when I drove Camille home."

See.
Even a stranger could remember my face.
Yet the person who shared my bed for three years couldn't.

I handed the check to Chloe.
Only taking back what I had spent on Camille over those three years.
The rest I entrusted her to return.

In this relationship, we're even now.

Chloe drove me to the airport.
Before I boarded, she asked softly, "Really not taking anything with you?"

I looked back at the rental apartment.
Every item bore Camille's mark.

"No."
"It's better to end it completely."

The phone vibrated incessantly.
Texts and missed calls flooded the inbox.

I blocked all contact without hesitation.
Then turned and walked through the security checkpoint.

The plane roared into the night sky.
Finally leaving this city behind.
###Chapter 7

In the Grandelle family mansion, the private physician stood before Camille Grandelle, calmly reporting the examination results.

Liam Valentine was in good health.
Camille was not pregnant.
The delayed menstruation was merely a symptom of hormonal imbalance.

Camille impatiently waved the doctor away.
She picked up her phone to send me a message, only to find that I had blocked her on WeChat.
When she called, all she heard was the cold, monotonous busy tone.

She recalled the last message I had sent, and her expression gradually darkened.
She couldn't understand how I had come to know those things.

She grabbed her coat and headed for the door.
But Chloe Roscente blocked her path.

"There's no need to look for Ethan Roland."
"He's left the city and won't see you again."

Camille frowned.
"My boyfriend's whereabouts are none of your business. What gives you the right to make decisions for him?"

Chloe sneered.
"I personally took him to the airport."
"While you were off with Liam, he had already decided to leave."
"Camille, you don't deserve him."

Camille was instantly enraged.
"Ethan is my man. It's not your place to interfere!"

Chloe threw a suitcase at her feet.
The lid popped open, and stacks of cash tumbled out.

"Your man? Then what is Liam to you?"
"Camille, you're too greedy."

"Do you think Ethan would stay by your side forever?"
"He's a person, not an object. He has feelings too."
"That day when you threw Liam's underwear and money in his face, he was already heartbroken."

"Ethan asked me to tell you this."
"You deceived him for three years. He only took what was rightfully his."
"From now on, you owe each other nothing. You'll never see each other again."

Camille's eyes widened in disbelief.
She finally realized that the NPC in the escape room that day was me.

She hadn't recognized me.
So, all her conversations with Liam had been overheard by me?

She suddenly remembered that I had mentioned working part-time at an escape room.
But I hadn't told her the specific location.

All the strange occurrences of the past few days now made sense.
No wonder I had a cut on my forehead when I returned home—it was from the cash.

And the photo of the elderly woman in the hospital bed.
It had seemed familiar, but she couldn't place it.

Now she remembered everything.
That was...

Chloe watched her pale face with a cold gaze.
"Remember now?"
"To spite Liam, you made up an excuse and let someone else sacrifice three years of their youth."
"All that talk about repaying debts and saving your mother—did you not see how much Ethan suffered these three years?"

"Even your lies are half-hearted."
"You forget your own words in an instant, yet you make others give their all."
"Why drag him into your little game with Liam?"

"Now that you're engaged to your Unattainable Love, you just kick him aside."
"Someone like you doesn't deserve him!"

"Shut up! I never intended to abandon him!"
Camille snapped, cutting her off.

Suddenly, she noticed the bias in Chloe's words.
And the hidden affection that couldn't be concealed.

She grabbed Chloe by the collar.
"I thought of you as a sister, but you've been coveting my boyfriend?"
"You like Ethan, don't you?"

"So what if I do?"
"If you had treated him well, I could have kept it to myself forever."
"But the way you've treated him, I'll protect him. I won't let you hurt him anymore!"

Camille punched her hard.
"Dream on! Ethan is mine. No one can take him away!"
"I'm going to find him and bring him back!"

She turned to leave, but Liam, who had just arrived, grabbed her.
"Camille, the engagement party is in a few hours."
"Are you really going to look for that substitute?"

Camille slapped him across the face.
"Shut up! Who gave you the right to call him that?"
"Don't think I don't know what happened at the party."
"And what you wanted to do to him."

"Liam, we were over the day you left me to go abroad."
"You know why we slept together, why we're engaged."
"But don't push me."

"I'm going to find Ethan now."
"Since I'm not pregnant, the engagement party can be postponed."

Eleanor Grandelle spoke coldly.
"Camille, have you forgotten what you promised me?"
"If you walk out that door today, you're no longer a Grandelle."
"There are plenty of others in the family waiting to take over the company."
"Are you sure you want to postpone the engagement party?"

"Once you fulfill your promise, you can do as you please."

Camille's steps faltered.
Her fists clenched tightly, nails digging into her palms.
Her silence spoke volumes.

Eleanor smiled with satisfaction.
Liam happily embraced her.

Only Chloe looked on with disdain.
She took out her checkbook, wrote a number, and threw it at Camille's feet.

"Congratulations, Ms. Grandelle."
"I won't be attending the engagement party. Here's my gift."
"But remember, this is your last chance."
"I hope you won't regret it."

Camille watched her retreating figure, her knuckles white.
She screamed inwardly.

No, this isn't the last chance.
Ethan wouldn't really leave me.
Just wait until I marry Liam and conceive an heir.
Once I have control of the Grandelle Group, I'll bring him back.

Then, no one can separate us!
###Chapter 8

As the plane landed in the small coastal town, a news notification popped up on my phone about the union of the Grandelle and Valentine families.

The engagement party had been upgraded directly to a wedding ceremony.

Camille Grandelle was in such a hurry to marry Liam Valentine.

Despite the rushed preparations, the wedding was still extravagantly luxurious. The crystal hall, filled with imported flowers, sparkled in the photos.

The comments section was buzzing:

"The groom's looks are out of this world, and the bride is a beauty too. A match made in heaven."

"Congratulations to Ms. Grandelle for finally getting her wish and marrying the handsome man."

"Am I the only one who thinks the bride looks more like she's crying than smiling? It's as if she's being forced into this marriage."

I had fantasized countless times about my wedding with Camille.

It didn’t need to be grand or filled with guests. I always imagined it by the sea—because I had never seen the ocean before.

The girl I loved would walk towards me with a bouquet of white flowers, and together we would embrace our future.

Now, I finally saw the sea of my dreams, but she had become someone else's wife. The person standing beside her would never be me.

Suddenly having a substantial amount of savings, I no longer needed to work tirelessly. I wanted to open a small shop.

After looking at several places, the rent was beyond my budget. Adding the cost of renovations, my funds quickly became tight.

Just as I was worrying, the real estate agent contacted me, saying there was a coffee bookstore by the sea that was being transferred at an unbelievably low price.

A combination of coffee and books—it was exactly the kind of shop I had envisioned.

I rushed over and was pleasantly surprised to find that even the decor perfectly matched my taste, requiring no changes. The two-story building even had a few guest rooms on the second floor, making it ideal for running a bed and breakfast.

The most unbelievable part was the transfer price, which was so low it felt like a scam.

On the day of signing the contract, I was stunned when I saw the owner.

"Chloe Roscente? This is your shop?"

She smiled gracefully. "Yes, I've had it for several years. With so many family businesses, I couldn’t manage this little shop anymore. I wanted to transfer it to someone reliable. Since you’re looking to open a shop, consider it as helping me out. I’ve put a lot of heart into this place, and I wouldn’t trust it with just anyone."

"I’m on vacation and want to stay by the sea for a while. It’s not too much to ask for one of the guest rooms upstairs, is it?"

I looked around at the brand-new furniture, clearly just renovated.

But the whims of a wealthy heiress were always hard to fathom. I nodded and signed the contract without much thought.

Not long after, news of the Grandelle CEO’s pregnancy hit the trending topics.

In the photos, Camille walked out of the hospital with Liam, her face expressionless, while Liam beamed with happiness.

Seeing their news again, my heart remained calm.

Chloe said she would only stay for a few days, but she ended up staying for over half a year.

Often, I would be at the front desk doing accounts while she sat quietly in a corner reading. At mealtime, she would take the initiative to cook, saying it was to cover her rent.

I felt a bit guilty since it was her shop and she had transferred it to me at such a low price. But her cooking was indeed exquisite.

It was almost laughable—I had never eaten a meal cooked by Camille. It had always been me taking care of her.

Every time I asked her if she didn’t need to return to work, she would smile and say, "My sister handles the company. I can work online. Besides, I don’t dare go back."

"My sister has made it clear that it’s embarrassing for me to still be single at this age. If I don’t find a husband soon, she’ll kick me out of the family. So, I’m trying my best."

I caught the hint in her words, and my cheeks flushed slightly.

From that day on, our relationship seemed to grow closer.

Time flew by, and several more months passed. Today, two young boys came into the shop, chatting about gossip:

"Did you hear? The Grandelle CEO gave birth to a boy, and he’s adorable. But her husband—what a shame. It should have been a joyous occasion, but he suddenly had a mental breakdown and was sent to a psychiatric hospital."

"There’s even more shocking news. Mrs. Grandelle had a stroke yesterday. Now she’s paralyzed, her mouth twisted, and she can’t speak. She’ll have to live in a nursing home from now on."

My hand trembled, and hot water spilled onto my skin, causing me to gasp in pain.

Chloe rushed over and ran cold water over the burn, her expression pained as if she were the one hurt.

I forced a smile. "It’s okay. I’m not that delicate."

She gently kissed my fingertips and insisted, "No, you have to be delicate. Otherwise, what’s the point of having me around?"

I smiled awkwardly but didn’t push her away. Some feelings were already understood without words.

Suddenly, a familiar voice filled with anger erupted:

"What are you two doing?!"
###Chapter 9

It had been over a year since I last saw Camille Grandelle, and she had changed completely.

The innocence she once had was gone, replaced by a sharpness in her eyes. Yet, a heavy, oppressive aura surrounded her, making it hard to breathe.

The two young boys nearby covered their mouths, their eyes sparkling with excitement.

"Oh my God, it's the CEO of Grandelle Corporation! She's even more stunning than in the photos!"

Camille shot them a cold glance.

"Get lost."

The icy tone in her voice made the boys' eyes well up with tears, and they scurried away timidly.

I frowned at her.

"Ms. Grandelle, you scared my guests."

Camille's gaze was fixed on the hands Chloe Roscente and I were holding together. Her voice came out through clenched teeth.

"Chloe, I'm counting to three. Let go."

Instead of releasing my hand, Chloe tightened her grip.

"It's my boyfriend's hand. I'll hold it whenever I want."

She smirked, her expression full of challenge.

"What, Ms. Grandelle? Are you going to send me to a psychiatric hospital again? Or maybe a nursing home? You're getting crueler by the day."

My eyes widened in shock.

I had no idea Camille was behind those incidents.

Didn't she love Liam Valentine? Why would she do such things to him?

The word "boyfriend" seemed to trigger Camille.

She lunged forward like a madwoman, her fist connecting with Chloe's face.

Chloe immediately shielded me, a trickle of blood appearing at the corner of her mouth.

Camille raised her fist again, but I stepped in front of Chloe.

"Camille, have you lost your mind?!"

Her fist froze mid-air, and she stared at me in disbelief.

"Ethan, you're protecting her?"

"Shouldn't I protect my girlfriend? Or should I protect you instead?"

Camille's face turned pale, and she grabbed my wrist frantically.

"No, I'm your girlfriend! I'm the one you love!"

"Ethan, I know you're angry. I admit I was wrong at first. I couldn't forget Liam, couldn't break my promise to him, so I lied to you. But we were together for three years, and I truly fell in love with you."

"But my mother threatened me with the heir position, forcing me to marry Liam and bear the Grandelle heir. Only then would she allow us to be together. I had no choice but to agree, forcing myself to sleep with Liam, hoping to get pregnant quickly. If I lost my position as heir, I'd have nothing left, and I wouldn't be able to give you a happy life."

"But now it's all over. I've secured Grandelle Corporation, had the child, sent Liam to a psychiatric hospital, and filed for divorce. My mother can't threaten me anymore. We can be together forever. I did all of this for you, Ethan!"

Listening to her, I felt nothing but absurdity and bitterness.

I pulled my hand away and spoke softly.

"But Camille, when we were together, you had nothing. And you know what? I felt like the happiest man in the world."

"I never needed you to give me anything. All I wanted was to be with the person I loved, to have honesty and loyalty. Even if we lived in a rented apartment for the rest of our lives, I would have been content. But you trampled on my sincerity."

"You keep saying you did all of this for me, but it was really for yourself. You could play the 'princess pretending to be a beggar' game on a whim, but you would never truly accept being an ordinary person. I was just an excuse for you."

Camille staggered, her face growing even paler.

"But I really do love you, Ethan. Can't you forgive me just this once?"

I smiled wearily.

"Camille, you might not know this, but I've forgiven you many times before."

"That day in the escape room, if you had just denied being Liam's girlfriend, I would have forgiven you. That night at the hotel, I was outside your door, calling you. If you had come back to me right then, I would have started over with you. But you didn't."

"Do you know how much I hated myself for being so pathetic? Now, I'll never sacrifice my self-respect for anyone again. Go back, Camille. Take care of Liam and raise your child. You've already trampled on one man's heart. Don't destroy another."

In the end, Camille left.

Before she went, she left a property transfer contract on the table. I knew she wanted to make amends.

Chloe snatched the contract, tore it to pieces, and threw it in the trash.

"What kind of dirty thing is this? I don't need someone else to support my husband."

I looked at her helplessly but didn't stop her.

The sincerity I once gave could never be bought back with money.

Later, Chloe and I got married, had children, and then grandchildren, living happily together until our golden years.

Camille never took Liam back.

She raised the boy alone and even bought the neighborhood where we used to rent.
