### Chapter 1

"Guess what? I got dumped again."

The reason was identical to my last breakup.

"Julian, you're just too boring to be with."

"Why can't you be more like Ethan Sullivan? At least he knows how to charm a girl."

I closed my eyes, feeling the metaphorical grass growing thicker on my head.

This was the eighth girlfriend Ethan had stolen from me.

I forced a calm nod and agreed.

The moment she turned away, I grabbed a knife and stormed to Ethan's apartment.

Stealing your best friend's girl? That deserved a thousand cuts in any story.

Standing at his door, I punched in the passcode like I owned the place.

Adrenaline surged through me—I was ready to stab him on sight.

The living room was empty, lights blazing. He had to be in the bedroom.

I marched straight there.

The door swung open—and there he was, completely naked.

Me, who never even watched adult films, was now staring at my childhood friend in all his glory.

The shock to my innocent soul was immeasurable!

Wait—this bastard was working out?!

First looks, then family background, then grades, and now physique?

How many more girlfriends did he plan to steal?

I exploded. "Ethan Sullivan, you absolute bastard!"

He casually tied his robe, not even glancing my way.

"What are you doing here?"

"Didn't you say you were cutting ties with me?"

I hated his condescending tone. I stepped forward to confront him, but the half-head height difference instantly deflated my rage.

Had he grown taller again?

"Ethan, what did I ever do to you? Eight girlfriends—isn't that crossing the line?"

He gave me a sidelong glance. My stomach dropped.

"You didn’t come after me for the first seven. Why now?"

"Did you really like her?" His eyes locked onto mine.

"O-of course! I genuinely liked every single one."

"Really? Your taste is terrible."

"Can’t you pick someone better?"

Was he even human?

Stealing them, then mocking my choices?

What was his game?

Were my girlfriends just that irresistible? Was I his personal target?

Ethan brushed past me toward the living room. I reacted fast, slamming him against the wall.

"I’m warning you—stay away from my girlfriends, or else—"

Ethan laughed arrogantly. "Or else what?"

He had a point. If I could do anything, he wouldn’t have taken eight girls from me.

Defeated, I let go, voice softening. "Just... do me this favor, okay?"

"I don’t want to die alone."

"We’re brothers—go steal someone else’s girlfriend instead."

Ethan’s expression darkened. "Begging me? Where’s that energy when you blocked me without a word?"

"Julian, after your family went bankrupt, instead of rebuilding, you’ve been chasing girls. Don’t you feel ashamed?"

I came for a heart-to-heart. He hit me with a lecture.

This battle was unwinnable.

I slunk back to my dorm.

Ever since my family’s downfall in high school, I’d embraced the slump with my dad. Rebuilding? Never crossed my mind.

But that didn’t justify him stealing my girlfriends!

Damn it—he’d derailed me again.


###Chapter 2

The news of my cheating scandal spread across Stanford University like wildfire.

The entire campus was buzzing about my situation.

They nicknamed me "The Hulk."

My roommate rushed over to comfort me when he heard.

He patted my shoulder and said, "Chill out, man."

"Losing your girl to Ethan Sullivan isn't embarrassing."

"It just means you both have great taste."

"Round it off, and you're basically half a heartthrob yourself."

I was so mad I wanted to kick him.

He dodged and said, "Hold up—I've got an idea."

"If he stole your girlfriend, why not get a boyfriend?"

"Reverse psychology."

"He can't possibly steal a guy from you, right?"

My eyes lit up—this actually sounded brilliant.

Even if I couldn't win, I could at least piss him off.

Seeing my approval, my roommate looked smug.

But then he hesitated.

"Where are you gonna find a boyfriend, though?"

I grinned and dumped the task on him.

Before he could protest, I flopped onto my bed and passed out.

The next day, to my surprise, my roommate actually found me a boyfriend.

He even arranged a meetup at a karaoke bar that night.

I got ready excitedly, completely missing my roommate's uneasy expression.

The guy's name was Zachary Evans.

He was an athlete.

Sunny, handsome, full of energy.

Unlike Ethan's cold, aloof charm, Zach was more down-to-earth and approachable.

He gave me a shy smile and said, "You're not what I expected."

I asked, "How so?"

He replied, "You're quiet. My roommate made you sound like a tornado."

My smile froze.

That jerk had definitely described me as a hyperactive monkey.

Wait—why did this feel like a blind date?

Whatever. As long as it pissed off Ethan, I was game.

I leaned into Zach's chest, mimicking how girls would act.

Gotta practice so I don't blow my cover.

Zach stiffened.

His face turned pink.

I was confused—wasn't he straight?

Just then, the door slammed open.

I nearly jumped out of my skin.

It was my ex, Chloe Watson.

Her eyes widened in shock as she stared at us.

Her voice trembled. "Julian... you're gay?"

"Did getting dumped mess you up that badly?"

I instantly sprang away from Zach.

But when I saw Ethan walk in behind her, I immediately leaned back in.

Defiantly, I said, "So what if I'm gay?"

"Love doesn't care about gender."

"I love him for who he is."

"Are you homophobic or something?"

Chloe quickly shook her head.

Frowning, she muttered, "If you're happy, then fine."

I sneaked a glance at Ethan.

His face was darker than last time—like he wanted to murder me.

I smirked internally. Finally, I'd scored a point.

He spat out two icy words: "Disgusting."

Then he turned and left.

Chloe hurried after him. "Ethan, wait! It's your birthday today!"

Once they were gone, I stood up cheerfully.

I clapped Zach on the shoulder. "Thanks, dude."

"I'll treat you to dinner sometime."

Then I hummed all the way back to the dorm.

I excitedly told my roommate, "Your plan worked!"

"Ethan looked like he'd swallowed a lemon."

My roommate forced a laugh. "Glad it helped."

I noticed his odd expression.

"What's wrong?"

He wiped his sweat and said, "Julian... there's something you should know."

"It's about Zachary Evans."


### Chapter 3

"He played his part so convincingly."

"He was serious about it."

I froze. "What are you saying? He's gay?"

"He likes you. Wants to see you again."

"So you're setting me up on a blind date?"

My roommate nodded nervously before bolting out the door, as if staying a second longer would be fatal.

I stared at the name "Zachary Evans" flashing on my phone screen, fingers trembling as I hastily powered it off.

Late that night, while showering, urgent knocking startled me.

Thinking it was an emergency, I wrapped a towel around myself and went to answer.

Ethan Sullivan stood outside.

He had his own place off-campus.

Him showing up here at this hour was suspicious.

Instinctively, I shielded myself—then remembered we were both men. There was nothing to hide.

The strong scent of alcohol hit me. He never drank.

Had something happened?

"Why aren't you answering your phone?" His tone was sharp.

"It's turned off."

"For this long? Are you avoiding me?"

"Why would I avoid you?"

Internally, I scoffed. I'd rather be laughing at his misery.

Ethan studied me, his tense expression easing slightly when he saw I wasn't lying.

Maybe the alcohol was getting to him—his steps were unsteady, nearly causing him to stumble.

I reached out to steady him, but he angrily shook me off.

"Now I can't even touch you? You used to cling to me in bed, refusing to leave," I muttered under my breath.

Ethan ignored me, sitting on the edge of my bed instead. His gaze landed on the stuffed bear nearby, lips curling in mockery.

"You still sleep with toys at your age?"

I quickly tossed it onto my roommate's bed. "It's not mine!"

Silence stretched between us.

"Today's my birthday," he said suddenly. "Did you forget?"

"I remember," I admitted.

"Where's my gift? You promised to celebrate every birthday with me."

"Wasn't your ex-girlfriend enough?" I needled him. "You actually believed those empty words?"

Ethan's eyes darkened. In one swift motion, he pinned my wrists above my head, slamming me against the wall. "Julian Anderson, you really need to be taught a lesson."

He forced me to meet his gaze, his grip unyielding.

A sense of danger made me struggle instinctively.

But that only made him tighten his hold.

I could see his Adam's apple bob, his breathing growing uneven.

"Julian," he said, voice rough, "if others can have you... why can't I?"

"What... are you talking about?"

His gaze dropped to my lips. "Isn't it obvious?"

"I want to sleep with you."

### Chapter 4

My entire body froze.

What did he just say?

Stealing my girlfriend wasn't enough?

Now he's coming after me too?

What the hell does he want?

I forced myself to stay calm.

"Man, we're both guys."

"This isn't right."

Ethan's eyes darkened.

He wasn't listening at all.

My heart pounded wildly.

My skin burned for no reason.

I shouldn't have provoked him.

The difference in our builds was too obvious.

If we fought, I'd lose.

"Calm down first."

I tried reasoning with him.

"Two men together goes against nature."

He smirked coldly.

"Wasn't it you who said love has no gender?"

"Changing your mind already?"

So he was testing me.

He'd even resort to this kind of trick.

I almost fell for it.

Noticing my distraction, Ethan gripped my chin.

Forcing me to meet his gaze.

"Who's better looking—me or him?"

Truthfully, Ethan was more striking.

But I couldn't let it show.

I swallowed hard.

"My boyfriend, obviously."

Ethan's expression turned icy.

"Boyfriend?"

"Don't think I don't know you're faking it."

"Then why are you doing this?"

Suddenly, his voice softened.

"Julian."

"Don't leave me for someone else."

"I can't stand seeing you with them."

"I went about this wrong."

"It won't happen again."

"Since when do bros get jealous?"

"Actually, I've always—"

Before he could finish, the dorm door slammed open.

Our roommate stood there holding takeout.

"Julian, I came to apologize—"

He froze when he saw Ethan pinning me against the wall.

His expression shifted from shock to understanding.

Setting down the food, he backed away.

"Don't mind me."

"I'll just go."

I shoved Ethan off and yanked our roommate back.

"Don't even think about spreading rumors."

After dealing with him, I turned to find Ethan sprawled across my bed.

No amount of shaking woke him.

Totally intentional.

Our roommate cautiously slid under his covers.

"Just share."

"I'm not sleeping with a dude."

Sighing, I pushed Ethan aside.

Barely making space for myself.

I regretted befriending him in kindergarten.

Our roommate couldn't resist asking.

"You two are nothing alike."

"How'd you become friends?"

"Hence the falling out."

"Why'd you stop talking?"

"Why does he keep stealing your girlfriends?"

"Did you piss him off?"

"No idea."

"Probably bored."

Truth was, Ethan used to treat me well.

Same age, yet he doted on me like a son.

Always shared the best things with me.

Shielded me in fights.

Took the blame alone when teachers caught us.

Even my mom said:

"With Ethan around,"

"I never worry about you."

I thought it'd last forever.

Until my family went bankrupt in high school.

I started avoiding him.

My dad warned me:

"Rich people only care about benefits."

"Lose your worth, and they'll discard you."

When Ethan noticed my distance,

He turned on me too.

Once when I refused to see him,

He ambushed me at school.

Dragged me into the restroom.

Grabbed my throat.

His gaze looked ready to devour me.

"Julian."

"I don't want to be brothers anymore."

In that moment, I believed my father.

His kindness had all been fake.

I shoved him away hard.

"Good."

"Don't contact me again."

"I've hated you forever."

"My dad made me suck up to you."

"Now that he's broke,"

"No need to pretend."

After that, we cut ties completely.

I started dating nonstop.

Normal teenage stuff.

Plus I inherited my parents' looks.

Not as dazzling as Ethan,

But charming enough for girls.

Yet every time a relationship began,

Ethan ruined it.

A month after our fight,

He showed up outside my house.

Eyes bloodshot.

From crying or sleeplessness—who knew?

My resolve wavered. I stepped forward.

But he glared at my girlfriend behind me.

His voice raw with betrayal.

"You blocked me for this?"

"Julian, even wood has feelings."

"How can you have none?"

"Am I really nothing to you?"

Remembering his family shutting me out,

Remembering the girls around him,

I snapped back:

"Don't come find me again."

"I don't want to see you."

That night I sobbed into my pillow.

Mom thought I got dumped.

How could I discard over a decade of friendship?

But if it was all fake,

Why bother continuing?

By morning, Ethan was gone.

I took out my phone.

Saved his number under his name again.

Then Zachary's message popped up:

"Was that guy your boyfriend?"

"Can we meet?"

I didn't reply.

The guy was clearly delusional.

Couldn't even tell who I was dating.

As weather warmed, I switched to short sleeves.

At breakfast, our roommate noticed.

His eyes widened.

"You got a new girlfriend?"

"What?"

He dragged me to the mirror.

A hickey glared from my neck.

I stood there, stunned.


### Chapter 5

It had to be Ethan's doing.

That ungrateful bastard.

No wonder I'd felt a stinging pain on my neck in the middle of the night.

Like something had bitten me.

I scrubbed the spot furiously.

Was he part dog or something?

Even drunk, he couldn't keep his hands to himself.

The more I thought about it, the angrier I got.

I grabbed my jacket to cover the mark.

Then stormed off to confront Ethan.

At the corner outside campus,

I saw Ethan breaking up with Chloe.

His expression was ice-cold.

The breakup was swift and merciless.

A sudden realization hit me.

Was he targeting Zachary next?

I quickly pulled out my phone to warn him.

"Ethan's acting crazy lately. Stay away."

Zachary replied instantly: "Got it!"

Chloe was crying her eyes out.

But Ethan remained completely indifferent.

What a bastard.

Stealing the campus belle, then tossing her aside.

I had chased her for three whole months.

Gritting my teeth in frustration,

I accidentally stepped on a dry twig.

Two pairs of eyes snapped toward me.

I raised my hands. "Just passing by."

Chloe suddenly grabbed a soda bottle.

Her eyes burned with fury as she advanced.

"This is all your fault!"

"Why don't you just die?"

She swung the bottle at my head.

Ethan moved like lightning, shielding me.

Glass shattered against his forehead.

Cold liquid splashed all over me.

He groaned, gripping my shoulders.

"Are you hurt?"

"Answer me!"

I was stunned.

They betrayed me first.

Now she wanted me dead?

Rage exploded inside me.

Especially when I saw blood dripping between his fingers.

Chloe was already reaching for another bottle.

She really meant to kill me.

I snatched one first.

Smashed it at her feet.

Shards flew everywhere.

She screamed, covering her head.

Lucky for her,

she was bundled up.

Otherwise, she'd be the one in the hospital.

I grabbed for a second bottle.

Ethan caught my wrist.

"Julian, calm down."

I shook him off.

Glared at the trembling Chloe.

"Still wanna throw things?"

She ran off, sobbing.

When it came to crazy,

I never lost.

If not for Ethan always preaching

about being a law-abiding citizen,

I would've taught her a real lesson.

At the hospital,

the doctor said Ethan's cut was deep.

"Does it hurt? Will it scar?"

"Do you care if your partner has scars?"

I shook my head.

"If I like someone, it doesn't matter."

His gaze suddenly burned hotter.

"Julian, it's been so long since I've been this close to you."

"Should we get your head checked too?"

Ethan: "..."

After his tetanus shot,

I walked him home.

When I turned to leave,

he grabbed my wrist.

"Your clothes are soaked."

"Change into something dry."

Only then did I notice

my shirt clinging uncomfortably to my skin.

He handed me a white hoodie.

I headed for the bedroom to change.

But he pushed me toward the bathroom instead.

"Shower first."

Fair point.

Soda stains were stubborn.

I couldn't afford to ruin his clothes.

When I came out dressed,

Ethan was staring at his phone,

ears tinged pink.

I crept closer.

"Checking out some girl?"

The screen showed my poolside photo.

This was beyond weird.

A guy checking out another guy's swim photo?

Getting flustered over it?

"Freak!"

He yanked me over,

dug my phone from my pocket,

unlocked it effortlessly.

Deleted all my social media selfies.

That smug smirk

said he'd planned this.

"Afraid I'll steal your spotlight?"

"Afraid you'll flirt with everyone."

"Make trouble for me."

"..."

That dangerous feeling returned.

I didn't dare ask about the hickey.

Who knew what he'd do next?

But his eyes dropped to my neck.

"Don't go back to the dorm tonight."

"The bed's too small."

"Perfect for just me."

"What if I join you?"

"Ethan, say one more word like that—"

"I'll smash my head right here!"

He finally shut up.

But that look as I left

clearly said I'd be back.

Back in the dorm,

my roommate was watching porn.

I relaxed slightly.

This was how straight guys should act.

Who the hell stares at their buddy's swim photos?

Noticing me, he hurriedly closed the video.

"Thought you weren't coming back tonight."

"Does Ethan seem normal to you?"

"Says the guy who blushes at male swim photos."

"You're the weird one here."

"I'm straight as hell!"

"Who said you weren't?"

"..."

As he played games,

he suddenly asked:

"Julian, that mark on your neck."

"Ethan left it, didn't he?"

"Bullshit!"

"That mark appeared after you two slept together."

"He keeps stealing your girlfriends."

"Maybe he actually likes you?"

Still focused on his game, he asked:

"Do you like him?"

"Are you insane or am I?"


###Chapter 6


How could he possibly like me? He probably hates my guts.

Even if he gave me that hickey, it was just to sabotage my relationship with Zachary.

He must have set his sights on Zachary.

Good thing I already warned Zachary not to leave campus.

I remember Ethan has a childhood sweetheart—petite, adorable, the kind that makes guys weak in the knees.

Maybe their families will arrange a marriage.

She’s just abroad right now. Once she’s back, everyone else will be pushed aside.

Thinking about it makes me feel... weird?

That night, Ethan’s face kept flashing in my mind, tossing and turning until sleep was impossible.

I got up for a glass of water before realizing what was wrong.

My damn teddy bear was missing.

I can’t sleep without that thing.

I shook my roommate awake.

Grumpily, he muttered, "Ethan took it. Said it was your birthday gift to him."

I was speechless.

That thing hadn’t been washed in two weeks, soaked in sweat. Couldn’t he smell it?

I grabbed my jacket and stormed to Ethan’s place.

"Why do you have to take everything from me?"

Ethan lounged on his bed, giving me a lazy look. "Stealing your girlfriend or your teddy—pick one."

Obviously, the girlfriend mattered more.

But the sleeplessness was torture. How do you break a habit like that?

Ethan saw my struggle and patted the space beside him.

"Beg me, and I’ll let you sleep here."

"What’s the hesitation? Afraid I’ll eat you? It’s a win-win for you."

Like I hadn’t begged before. No big deal. "Fine, I’m begging. Let me sleep here?"

Ethan nodded, satisfied, then placed the teddy bear between us.

I flopped down. "You promise? No more stealing my girlfriend?"

"Done."

I didn’t catch what he mumbled after.

The bed was too comfortable—I was out the second my head hit the pillow.

"Julian, you got mad today because I got hurt, didn’t you?"

"And you? Why did you block that soda bottle for me?"

"I promised to protect you."

"Childhood promises don’t count. We’re not the same people now."

"To me, you’re still you."

But to me, I’m not me anymore.

After my family went bankrupt, the落差 was too much.

I couldn’t spend freely anymore. Every time I wanted to see Ethan, I had to cross half the city.

I couldn’t afford high-end restaurants; he couldn’t stand street food.

He could treat me every meal, but I couldn’t even afford to return the favor with a street stall.

If I so much as glanced at something while shopping, he’d buy it and save it as a gift for some holiday—even Women’s Day wasn’t spared.

Probably thought I was too poor.

Every time he visited, it was like he wanted to move the entire mall into my tiny apartment.

But seeing those luxury furniture and appliances crammed into my rented shoebox made it clear—

We weren’t on the same path anymore.

His family must’ve felt the same.

The last time I went to see him, their housekeeper blocked the door.

"Ethan’s studying. He can’t see you."

"Aunt Liu, I’m not here to borrow money."

She didn’t answer, just shut the door.

Through the crack, I saw Ethan holding the latest gaming console, a petite, cute girl beside him.

His childhood sweetheart.

Me? Just some bankrupt loser.


### Chapter 7

The midnight dream dragged me back to childhood.

A beautiful boy moved into the neighborhood.

He always sat quietly alone in the yard.

That day I took the neighbor's big dog to find him.

I wanted to see him get scared.

But the dog suddenly went wild.

I was too small and it bit my butt.

Ethan had already run far away.

When he saw me bitten, he immediately turned back.

He picked up a thick branch and beat the dog's head desperately.

My butt was finally freed from the dog's mouth.

I scrambled up a tree.

But his leg got bitten, blood streaming down.

Later he got over a dozen stitches at the hospital.

My parents took me to thank him.

Crying, I grabbed his hand.

"If you don't like me, I'll never come play with you again."

"Please don't die."

Pale with pain, he still smiled at me.

"I won't die."

"I like when you visit me."

"Don't be afraid. I'll protect you from now on."

He remembered that promise for over a decade.

But the things I promised him, I always failed to keep.

In the early morning, I woke up sweating.

My forehead was drenched.

Ethan's arm held me tightly.

I carefully tried to move his hand away.

But he woke up instantly.

"Where are you going?" He sat up without even opening his eyes.

"To the bathroom."

"I'll come too."

"Stop joking, I really can't hold it."

Ethan flipped out of bed and carried me without another word.

He walked straight to the bathroom.

This was beyond embarrassing.

Did that soda bottle this morning knock some sense out of him?

"Can't you just sleep properly?" I was about to lose it.

"Can't sleep. Afraid you'll run away."

"Then what are your hands doing?"

"This makes me feel secure."

"A grown man almost 6'3" needs security?"

"The first year we lost contact, I didn't sleep well once."

"I worried your parents might move you to another city."

"Back then I was just a high schooler, afraid I'd never find you."

"Luckily you stayed."

Suddenly I remembered what my roommate said.

That Ethan liked me.

The atmosphere turned slightly awkward.

I joked on purpose: "You're not secretly in love with me, are you?"

Ethan didn't deny it.

He just stared straight at me.

His gaze made me nervous, so I inched toward the edge.

He snatched away the teddy bear between us.

"Why did you block me?"

"Weren't you the one who turned cold first?"

"You said you didn't want to be brothers anymore."

"Because I wanted to be your man!"

Ethan slowly moved closer.

When I wasn't paying attention, he kissed me.

I didn't react at all.

By the time I came to, he'd already pulled back.

Is this how it feels to kiss your best friend?

My whole body tingled.

"Julian, you're such a blockhead."

"That was me confessing, couldn't you tell?"

"How could anyone tell?"

"Why couldn't you just say it directly?"

"Fine, I'll say it directly then."

"I like you."

"What about you? Do you like me?"

"No!"

"No rush. Sleep on it before answering."

No matter how I cursed, Ethan wouldn't stop.

Frustrated, I touched the wound on his forehead.

"You want to ruin your face?"

"My whole self is yours."

"Stop changing the subject, snap out of it!"

"Can't snap out."

"Julian, feel your heartbeat."

"Don't you want me?"

Seeing his dazed eyes, I suddenly softened.

I kissed his lips first.

"Ethan, listen carefully."

"This is my first time."

"I'm definitely not being the bottom."

"Whatever you say."

When I woke up the next day, my back was killing me.

Ethan was such a liar.

He took all the advantages.

And still complained about my stamina.

One day I'll make him cry.

To recover, I skipped two days of classes.

On the third day I went to campus.

Ran into my roommate at the cafeteria.

He slapped my back hard.

"Where've you been these two days?"

I almost fell over from his pat.

Turned to kick him.

But saw Zachary standing behind him.

Zachary gave me a sunny smile.


### Chapter 8


My eyes widened as I silently mouthed to my roommate.
"How did you bring him here?"

He gave me an innocent look.
"Didn't you say you wanted to treat him to dinner?"

I smacked my forehead.
How could I forget about that?

Well, debts of gratitude must be repaid.

I forced a smile and turned to Zachary Evans.
"What would you like to eat?"

He smiled gently.
"Your choice. I'm not picky."

At least he's easy to please.

During dinner, Zachary kept staring at me with that silly grin.
My roommate made up an excuse and bolted.

I fidgeted uncomfortably but couldn't bring myself to leave early.

"Have you been busy lately? Why aren't you answering calls?"

"I need to explain what happened last time."

"I already know. Don't misunderstand—I just want to be friends."

I let out a sigh of relief.
"You should've said so earlier. You scared me."

Zachary was easy to get along with.
No matter how boring my topics were, he listened patiently.

Aside from the occasional deranged texts from Ethan Sullivan, the evening went smoothly.

A few minutes without checking my phone, and there were already a dozen messages.
"Why is he here?"
"Does he know about us?"
"Why does our relationship have to be a secret?"
"Stop smiling at him. I'm begging you, okay?"

After seeing Zachary off,
Ethan stormed into my dorm like a hurricane.

I explained the whole situation to him.
Only then did his expression soften slightly.

"When will you give me a proper title?"

"No rush. We'll talk after graduation."

"What are you worried about?"

I looked at him amused.
"Afraid of being dumped?"

"Terrified!"

I laughed and kissed him.
The dorm bed was too small—Ethan hit his head when he tried to climb in.

He simply pushed me onto the bed and pinned me down.

"Are you insane? It's nap time. My roommate could come back any minute."

"I'll lock the door."

"Two guys locking themselves in a dorm? That's even weirder."

"Let's go to my place."

"Now?"

"I don't care!" Ethan kissed me again.

Suddenly, the door burst open as my roommate kicked it in.
I immediately shoved Ethan off the bed.

Seeing Ethan on the floor, my roommate looked shocked.
"Were you two... fighting?"

......

Ethan gave a humorless smile.
The air around him turned icy, his gaze murderous.

My roommate nearly wet himself and bolted after dropping his things.

Only after Ethan left did my roommate dare to return.
"Julian, what did I do to piss him off?"
"I nearly died of fright. For the sake of my life, keep him away from our dorm."

Ethan was insatiable.
His mind was always filled with indecent thoughts.

To spare my roommate further distress,
I moved into Ethan's place for summer break.

For the first two weeks, we barely left the house.
I was worn to a shadow, dark circles heavy under my eyes.

"Can you tone it down? At this rate, I'll end up in the hospital."

Ethan reluctantly let go.
"What's wrong? Sore back?"

"What do you think?"

"Fine. I'll cool off."

He headed to the bathroom and turned on the cold water.
I seriously considered making a run for it.

That night, Ethan finally behaved.
I finally got a proper night's sleep.

The teddy bear got kicked off the bed.
I didn't know when I'd broken that habit.

Probably after getting back together with Ethan.
That habit had formed after our fallout, when I'd cry myself to sleep.

Maybe I'd liked him all along.
I was just too naive to admit it.

At noon, Ethan surprisingly took me out for lunch.
Of all times, I ran into Chloe Watson when I went to the restroom.

She glared at me with the same hatred.
"I know you're together."

I suspected she'd been stalking us.
How else would she know? Was it that obvious?

"I know everything about you two. You're disgusting!"

"Oh? So what?"

"Do you think his parents will accept you?"

That was something I hadn't considered.
But whatever. I preferred not to overthink things.

"You'll turn into a leech. After your family went bankrupt, you became nothing. What makes you think you deserve him?"

I flicked water off my hands and smirked.
"He loves me. He wants me. If you're so jealous, go bother him. See if he gives you the time of day?"

Chloe gritted her teeth in rage.
But she held back, probably remembering what happened last time.

I moved to leave, but she grabbed my arm.
"Julian, I'm pregnant."

"I never even held your hand."

"It's Ethan's!"

I fell silent for a long moment before slowly pulling my arm free.

Chloe upped the ante.
"I went to see his parents. They've approved of us. All we need is your blessing."

"Really? Show me the prenatal report."

Her tears dried instantly—she hadn't expected that.

"Who carries that around?"

"You expect me to believe you? Countless girls chased Ethan growing up. He couldn't be bothered to glance at them. As for you—you're the eighth girlfriend who stole me from him. He didn't lay a finger on the first seven. What makes you special? Got a third eye or something?"

"Julian, you—" Chloe was livid.

"Don't come looking for me again. And don't drag Ethan into this. I've got nothing to lose. Push me too far, and I won't hold back."

Chloe left, thoroughly defeated.

After lunch, back at home,
Ethan got a phone call.

He stepped onto the balcony to take it.
I could guess who it was.

When Ethan returned, his face was grim.
Grabbing his jacket, he said he needed to go out.

"Wait here for me. Be good."

Ethan didn't come back that night.
The next morning, as I ate breakfast in the living room, I heard the door open.

I rushed over eagerly.
It was Ethan's father.

### Chapter 9


Uncle Ethan's stern face softened when he saw me.
He affectionately called me by my childhood nickname.
He asked about my parents' well-being.

I gave brief replies.
He settled onto the couch.
He said Ethan was stubborn.
He hoped I could convince him to return home.

"He's my only son," he said.
"I don't want to see him go down the wrong path."

I tried to refuse.
Uncle Ethan cut me off.

He reminded me of the crisis my family had faced years ago.
The Sullivans had helped us then.
"Now it's time to repay that debt," he said.
"Don't indulge his recklessness."

His tone turned sharp.
"If you refuse to cooperate,"
"Your family will suffer the consequences."

"Would you really make your parents homeless again?"

He wasn't wrong.
The Sullivans had saved us back then.

If I were independent, I'd have argued.
But right now,
I couldn't even afford dates without Ethan paying.
And his money?
Still came from his family.

We weren't strong enough
to defy them.

Before leaving,
Uncle Ethan placed a check on the table.
"Consider this tuition support," he said.
"Give my regards to your parents."

It was clearly a dismissal.

Ethan returned late that night,
exhaustion lining his face.
I hugged him and said
I wanted to visit my parents.

He offered to come.
I gently refused.
"Family matters," I said.
"Not for outsiders."

His voice cracked.
"Am I an outsider?"

Then he pulled me into his arms.

I barely slept that night.

At dawn,
while he still slept,
I quietly left with my suitcase.

Two weeks later,
Ethan suddenly appeared.
"Why didn't you answer my calls?" he demanded.
"Why didn't you come back?"
"Are you in trouble?"

I dragged him aside,
away from my parents' view.
Coldly, I said,
"I'm bored of this."

He pressed carefully.
I stated it plainly:
"I don't like you."
"It was just a fling."

He promised to treat me better.
"Feelings grow with time," he pleaded.

I cut him off.
"I'm straight," I said.
"I won't keep playing this game."

"So am I," he countered.
"But this isn't a game."
"I want forever with you."

He grabbed my hand,
voice breaking.
"Please," he begged.
"Don't abandon me again."

I shook him off.
Turned away.
"Don't come looking for me," I said.

Then I blocked him everywhere.

Once, he'd asked if I'd block him again.
I'd sworn I wouldn't.

He'd said if that day came,
he wouldn't chase me.
Just work to become better.
To build us a future.

True to his word,
Ethan never reappeared.
Never asked for reconciliation.

Yet part of me still waited.

After years of depression,
my father fought with my mother.
Then used their savings
to open a small diner.

Years of business dinners
had refined his palate
and cooking skills.

At first, business was slow.
But word spread.
Customers came.
Eventually, it became a viral spot.

I helped after work.

A regular—an elderly lady—often teased me.
Asking about my salary.
Asking if I had a girlfriend.

My mother would laugh, pushing me toward the kitchen.
"He's still young," she'd say.

The lady persisted.
"I'll introduce someone!"

"Not yet," my mother deflected.

A weak excuse.

Lately, rumors swirled at work.
New management was coming.
The first act? Mass layoffs.

I'd already planned my exit.
I'd take over the diner.

Then came the promotion notice.

My coworkers gaped.

The boss summoned me.

When I saw the new owner,
I froze.

It was Ethan.


### Chapter 10

I froze in place, forgetting even to greet him.

Ethan Sullivan sat behind the massive desk, dressed in a perfectly tailored dark suit, his sharp gaze piercing through gold-rimmed glasses.

Who would have thought my ex-lover would become my boss?

I glanced down at my cheap office attire.

In front of him, I always felt inferior.

Ethan didn’t even look up, engrossed in reviewing documents.

I didn’t dare breathe too loudly, afraid one wrong move would get me fired.

I stood there the entire afternoon.

Clearly, he was deliberately making things difficult.

My colleagues’ initial envy turned to pity.

"Julian’s so unlucky. The new boss is using him to assert authority."

"Glad it’s not me."

"Better behave these days."

The next day, I was called into his office again.

This time, he made me wait on the sofa.

His gaze kept flickering toward me, making me squirm.

I couldn’t take it anymore. Slamming my hands on the table, I snapped, "Ethan, I give up. I quit, okay?"

Finally, he looked up, lips curling. "Quit? Who’s going to pay your $5,000 mortgage?"

I deflated instantly. "Then what do you want?"

Leaning back lazily, he said, "Try pleasing me. Maybe I’ll give you a promotion and raise."

"Why should I?"

"Because you still think about me."

"Narcissist."

Ethan suddenly stood, pinning me against the desk. "Did you miss me all these years?"

"No!" I turned my face away.

"Really?" His gaze turned intense. "But I thought of you every single day."

Missed me? Making me stand all afternoon is how you show it?

"Let me go first."

He released me. "Free tonight? We could—"

A sharp knock from his assistant interrupted him.

Ethan gave me a long look before hurrying out.

I leaned against the desk, heart pounding.

How had he become even more attractive than before?

Money really is the best skincare.

Our breakup hadn’t been pleasant, but was it worth holding a grudge this long?

Maybe I should give in. A promotion would mean a raise.

Ethan disappeared for days—rumor had it he was on a business trip.

At the end of my shift, I overheard the receptionist whispering:

"The new boss has a fiancée. Childhood sweethearts."

"Game over. Thought I had a shot at being Mrs. Sullivan."

A petite figure flashed through my mind.

So she was back.

They really did suit each other.

I was restless all evening, making mistakes while helping at the family restaurant.

Mom shooed me home. "Go rest if you're tired. Don’t make more work for us."

The ten-minute walk felt endless.

As I neared my apartment, headlights flared from a familiar black car.

This vehicle had been parked here every night since Ethan and I broke up.

So it was him.

"Julian, nothing stands between us now." Ethan stepped out, eyes burning. "Will you come back to me?"

In that moment, all hesitation vanished.

I threw myself into his arms. "I love you."

He held me tight, whispering the words over and over.

Late that night, I propped myself up. "What about your fiancée?"

"What fiancée?"

I explained the office gossip.

"That’s you." He chuckled. "I started the rumor to keep others from chasing you."

"Scheming devil." I swatted him. "What about your parents?"

"I call the shots now. Julian, I know you left because of my father, but I can protect you now."

On Thanksgiving, I brought Ethan home to come clean.

To my shock, my parents agreed immediately.

I’d braced for a beating.

Mom smiled. "We heard you crying every night."

"If Ethan had taken any longer, I’d have set Julian up on blind dates."

So that’s what she’d meant by "wait a little longer."

When Christmas Eve’s bells rang, Ethan embraced me by the window.

City lights glittered in his eyes.

He nipped my ear. "Block me again, and I’ll lock you up."

"I won’t. I promise I won’t."
