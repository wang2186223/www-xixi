### chapter 1

The golden retriever my daughter-in-law keeps has a habit of relieving itself anywhere it pleases.

It not only defecated on my bed but also urinated on my vegetative son.

Furious, I decided to sell the dog, but my daughter-in-law thought I was overreacting.

"Don't be so petty. You're already halfway into the grave. Why are you picking on a dog?"

Afraid I might mistreat the dog, she let it sleep with her every night.

One night, I got up and heard strange noises coming from her room.

Worried the golden retriever was up to no good again, I cracked open the door and peeked inside.

What I saw would haunt me for the rest of my life.

One.

"Grace, the dog peed everywhere again!"

"Can't you control it? This house is turning into a kennel!"

I had just opened my bedroom door and nearly slipped on a puddle of dog urine.

I managed to grab the doorframe just in time.

Seeing I hadn't fallen, the golden retriever lounging on the sofa barked at me twice, almost like a taunt.

Liam was the dog my daughter-in-law Grace had raised before marriage. She adored him and brought him along when she married my son.

At first, I liked the golden retriever too, but he never warmed up to me.

I thought he was just shy around strangers, so I didn't pay it much mind.

But ever since my son's accident, the dog had been brought into our home and started causing chaos, showing no signs of obedience.

Lately, he had taken to relieving himself all over the house, leaving a foul stench everywhere.

I had repeatedly urged Grace to train him to use the bathroom properly.

She always agreed, but the dog continued his messy habits.

The house reeked of urine every day, and it drove me insane.

Seeing the dog grinning with his mouth open, I could no longer contain my anger. I stepped forward, ready to teach him a lesson.

Before my hand could reach him, Grace rushed over and shoved me aside.

She pushed me so hard I stumbled back several steps.

As soon as I steadied myself, she shot me a sharp glare.

"Mom, it's just a little pee on the floor. Was it necessary to hit Liam?"

She spoke while checking the dog's body for any harm.

I was already fed up with the dog's behavior. Seeing Grace not only failing to discipline him but coddling him made me even angrier.

I dropped my usual gentle tone and scolded her harshly. "Grace, as his owner, it's your responsibility to teach him how to behave like a proper pet!"

Hearing the word "pet," the dog reacted fiercely.

He seemed to despise the label, baring his teeth and growling at me as if ready to bite.

Seeing this, Grace quickly gathered him into her arms, comforting him and planting a kiss on his snout.

"Good boy, Liam. Don't be angry."

"Liam isn't a pet. He's my most beloved family member!"

Watching the two of them, I felt an inexplicable sense of revulsion.

### 2

She treated that dog like family, but ignored our feelings as her actual family.

Grace Lopez finally calmed the dog down before looking up at me.

Her brows were furrowed, her tone impatient.

"Mom, stop targeting Liam. Dog urine isn't a big deal. We can just clean it up."

Her mention of cleaning made me angrier.

Every sofa, carpet, and piece of clothing soiled by the golden retriever retained a lingering foul odor.

I had to discard everything and buy replacements, resulting in significant recurring expenses.

When I laid out these facts, Grace spoke with a hint of委屈.

"Our family isn't poor. Must you always bring money into this?"

"Mom, I think you look down on me deep down. That's why you constantly use money against me."

She stared directly at me, her eyes reddening.

Remembering Grace's family background, I immediately felt I'd gone too far and softened my tone.

"Grace, don't misunderstand. I don't mean that at all. I've long considered you my own daughter."

I initially disapproved when my son first started dating Grace.

She struck me as somewhat provincial at first glance. But after learning her life story from my son and experiencing her genuine care and consideration, I gradually accepted her.

Grace came from a rural background—a gambling-addicted mother, an alcoholic father—yet worked her way through college.

I admired and sympathized with her. After she married into our family, I indulged her every whim.

Tragically, my son became disabled in a car accident three weeks ago, and Grace seemed to transform into a different person.

Perhaps the stress of caring for my son overwhelmed her. With me busy managing the company, the golden retriever became her only companion at home.

Considering this, I thought perhaps I should be more tolerant of the dog.

So I spoke gently and kindly.

"Grace, I know taking care of Leo has been difficult. I'm not asking much from you."

"Although we're well-off, we still need to live responsibly. You should teach the dog some basic manners."

Grace finally nodded and gave verbal assurances.

Just then, my assistant called. After giving Grace some instructions, I packed and left on a business trip.

Arriving at the company, I opened my handbag to retrieve documents and touched something sticky.

Looking down, I discovered it was the golden retriever's feces.

My recently calmed anger erupted instantly.

I thought the dog only urinated outside my bedroom door. I never imagined it would defecate inside my handbag.

Suddenly I recalled the dog's sinister glare when I left home. Now I was certain it disliked me.

But with urgent company matters at hand, I cleaned up briefly and caught a flight to the neighboring city, deciding to address this properly after my trip.

I never expected the scene awaiting me upon returning home five days later would nearly make me faint.

### 3

On the balcony, my son lay sunbathing on the recliner.

The golden retriever was crouched on top of him, urinating all over his face.

I exploded with rage. Grabbing a broom, I swung it directly at the golden retriever.

"Damn beast, how dare you disrespect my son like this!"

The dog dodged too slowly. Two blows landed on its spine, making it yelp in pain.

Grace Lopez heard the commotion and rushed out of her room. Seeing her beloved dog whimpering on the floor, she immediately started yelling at me.

"Mom, why must you cause trouble the moment you return?"

"Liam did nothing to provoke you. How dare you hit him? Apologize to him right now!"

From the moment she appeared, Grace only defended her dog. She didn't even glance at her husband.

Furious, my hand trembled as I pointed at my son Leo on the recliner.

"Grace, look what this animal has done!"

Hearing me curse the golden retriever, Grace's frown deepened.

"Even if Liam made a mistake, you shouldn't have hit..."

Her words caught in her throat as she followed my pointing finger.

Grace saw the yellow urine stains all over Leo's face and instinctively took two steps back.

"Mom, I'm sure Liam didn't mean to urinate on Leo."

Witnessing her husband being humiliated by a dog, Grace still only thought of making excuses for the animal.

My disappointment in her intensified yet again.

This disobedient beast had truly clouded her judgment. She could no longer distinguish who truly mattered in this family.

Catching my breath, I noticed my bedroom door was open.

Dog excrement was scattered across the floor and even on the bed.

I nearly choked on my anger.

My voice dripped with unconcealed disgust for the golden retriever.

"I was willing to tolerate this creature for your sake."

"But now it has insulted my son. I will not stand for this any longer. You will get rid of it tomorrow."

My tone was icy. Both Grace and the dog flinched.

After recovering from her shock, Grace flatly refused.

"Impossible. I won't agree to this unreasonable demand."

"Besides, Leo adores Liam. If he could speak, he would never let you send Liam away."

"The doctor said Leo needs stimulation. Liam was actually helping him!"

Listening to Grace's shameless justification, I wanted to slap her.

And so I did.

The slap left Grace stunned. After a few seconds, she glared at me furiously.

"I didn't marry into this family to be mistreated by you. Liam is my dog—you have no right to expel him."

"Leo left me a grass widow, and now you seize every chance to bully me too."

Tears began streaming down her face. The golden retriever anxiously wagged its tail, licking her tears away.

The dog shot me a vicious look that sent chills down my spine.

Its gaze was terrifying, filled with raw hatred as if it wanted to tear me apart.

Shaking off the unease—after all, it was just a dog—I spoke firmly to Grace.

"You know exactly how much chaos this dog has brought since it arrived!"

"My previous tolerance doesn't mean you and this beast can dominate my home. If you won't get rid of it, I'll find a way to sell it myself!"

Having delivered my ultimatum, I ignored Grace and her dog. I helped Leo into his wheelchair and headed to the bathroom to clean him.

Behind me, Grace continued making excuses.

"Mom, you're overreacting and being petty. You're halfway to the grave—why pick fights with a dog?"

### 4

Grace remained cold toward me for days after the incident, still refusing to give the dog away.

I ignored her, focusing solely on getting rid of the animal.

Although the dog had calmed down somewhat recently, it still occasionally urinated on my belongings and my son’s things, taunting me.

I began to wonder what I had done to offend it, allowing it to dominate our household.

To lure the Golden Retriever away, I placed a female dog outside our door.

But the creature was clever and completely immune to such temptations.

After considering several options, I finally contacted a dog trader while Grace was out for a beauty appointment.

Only when the Golden Retriever was locked in a metal cage did the weight in my heart finally lift. I thought the beast was gone for good.

To my utter shock, it returned unharmed that very evening.

"Mom, since Liam is back, I’ll let it slide. But if you ever pull something like this again, I’ll divorce your son."

I knew how deeply my son cared for Grace.

As much as we argued, marriage was a serious matter. I didn’t dare make decisions for my son, fearing he would blame me when he woke up.

So I agreed to ignore the dog as long as it didn’t provoke me.

From then on, Grace guarded against me as if I were a thief.

Afraid I might harm the dog, she took it with her everywhere, even sleeping with it every night.

To accommodate herself and the Golden Retriever, she moved my son from the master bedroom to the guest room.

Since I didn’t trust the beast sharing a room with my son anyway, I let it be.

However, after Grace started sharing a room with the dog, she began neglecting my son.

Naturally, I was displeased and intended to remind her to prioritize her husband.

When I pushed the door open, Grace was wearing only a thin lace nightgown. The Golden Retriever had its head resting on her chest, its tongue lolling out.

The way Grace interacted with the dog made me deeply uncomfortable, stirring strange thoughts in my mind.

Grace glanced at me and casually adjusted her clothing. "Mom, couldn’t you knock?"

I averted my gaze uncomfortably.

"I came to remind you that Leo is your husband. You need to distinguish between a person and an animal."

"My compromise doesn’t mean I’ll indulge you. If you don’t want to stay with Leo, you can divorce him. But as long as you’re his wife, you must fulfill your duties. What kind of example are you setting, mingling with an animal like this?"

I deliberately mentioned divorce to test her, and she visibly panicked, nodding meekly.

"Divorce is out of the question. Leo is my husband for life. Even if he never wakes up, I’ll care for him forever."

True to her word, Grace became much more attentive to my son in the days that followed.

She also resumed her previous considerate behavior toward me, easing the tension between us.

To apologize for slapping her in a fit of anger, I even gave her fifty thousand dollars.

Just when I thought our household had finally found peace, another blow struck.

One evening, I attended a social event and drank more than usual. Waking in the middle of the night, I passed by Grace’s room and heard faint, rustling whispers.

Worried the dog was misbehaving again, and fueled by drunken memories of its tongue on Grace’s chest, I cracked the door open slightly. What I witnessed would haunt me for the rest of my life.

### 5

I saw the golden retriever standing upright by the bed like a human. Grace Lopez lay on the edge of the bed, her bare shoulder exposed.

The indescribable scene sobered me instantly.

I never imagined a human and a dog could do something so absurd.

As I covered my mouth in shock, the golden retriever spoke human words.

"We need to get rid of that meddling old hag. She's interfering with our plans!"

Grace replied in a soft, delicate voice. "But that old witch is still the company CEO. We should make her step down first."

The dog hesitated. "With Leo in that condition, transferring shares is impossible."

Grace thought for a moment, then turned and gently touched her stomach. Her eyes shone with determination.

"This child will be our bargaining chip!"

...

Their conversation echoed in my ears, leaving my mind in chaos.

Suppressing my shock and confusion, I held my breath and quietly closed the door.

Back in my room, I finally exhaled. My heart raced uncontrollably.

I closed my eyes, carefully piecing everything together. Soon, I understood the golden retriever's hostility toward me.

They coveted my family fortune. My son's accident was likely their doing.

I had touched that golden retriever myself. It was undeniably a real dog.

Therefore, only one explanation remained - a human consciousness trapped in a dog's body.

Though it sounded fantastical, having witnessed its behavior made it chillingly plausible.

I stayed awake all night and hired a reliable private investigator.

The next morning, the sight of them at breakfast turned my stomach.

As I stood to leave, Grace grabbed my hand.

Her eyes sparkled with hope as she gazed at me.

"Mom, I'm pregnant! The doctor confirmed it yesterday - one month along. It must have happened during that hot springs trip with Leo."

Under normal circumstances, I would have been overjoyed.

But remembering last night's events, I fought back nausea and forced a smile.

"How wonderful! Thank you, Grace, for carrying on our family line."

"The company will have an heir now."

I even took off my jade bracelet and gave it to her.

Seeing my apparent sincerity and happiness, Grace believed her plan was flawless.

"Oh, you're too kind! I'll give you a healthy grandson for sure."

She smiled until her eyes became slits, shooting a meaningful glance at the golden retriever eating dog food.

My stomach churned violently. I couldn't hold back and vomited on the spot.

Grace looked alarmed.

"Mom, are you okay?"

"Just tired from last night's business dinner. I need to rest."

Back in my room, I emptied my stomach completely.

A healthy grandson? Who knew what monstrosity she carried.

Tossing in bed, unable to sleep, I couldn't bear staying in this house.

I rented a new villa. My plan was to move there with my son under some pretext.

But when Grace heard Leo might leave, she became fiercely resistant.

"Mom, those caretakers are too rough. Only I can properly care for Leo."

I tried reasoning with her. "But you're pregnant, you shouldn't overexert..."

Before I could finish, she interrupted urgently.

"I'm Leo's wife. Caring for him is my duty. I'm not afraid of hardship. Besides, with our child here, maybe Leo will sense it and wake up sooner!"

"Mom, focus on your business trip. Leave the household matters to me!"

To avoid raising her suspicions, I left my son behind. He would have to endure this situation a while longer.

Shortly after arriving at the new house, the private investigator knocked with a document folder.

"Mrs. Sullivan, what you asked me to investigate is both bizarre and unnatural!"

I opened the folder. With each page I read, a cold dread crept down my spine.
### 6

Grace Lopez had an ex-boyfriend named Liam Anderson, a local troublemaker from their town.

Grace never attended college. She dropped out after middle school and was lured by Liam into working at nightclubs.

Tired of their impoverished life, they dreamed of climbing the social ladder.

At a party, Grace, working as a nightclub dancer, met my son. Learning he was the sole heir of a wealthy family, she followed Liam's scheme to get close to him.

My naive son, fresh from studying abroad, was captivated by Grace's facade of a hardworking girl from a poor background. He fell right into their trap.

Right after their wedding, they traveled to Thailand.

I recalled my son wanted to take her to the romantic Maldives, but Grace insisted on Thailand.

The day they returned from their honeymoon, my son was in a car crash and became comatose. Grace escaped with minor scratches.

The next day, she brought home that Golden Retriever.

That dog was Liam Anderson.

Grace's insistence on going to Thailand was all part of their soul-swapping ritual.

I flew to Thailand overnight and, after much inquiry, found the white-robed shaman who could break the curse.

"Ajarn, money is no object if you can save my son."

I would pay any price to restore my son's life.

The shaman studied my son's photo and a lock of his hair for a long time before speaking.

"Your son's soul is trapped. At midnight two days from now, his body will be taken over."

Hearing my son's life was at stake, I panicked.

I thought Grace's curse was just to keep him unconscious. I never imagined she wanted to steal his life entirely.

Midnight in two days coincided with my son's birthday.

I knelt before the shaman, begging her to save him.

"Please, I'm begging you. He's my only son."

She glanced at me, closed her eyes for a few minutes, then said, "His fate isn't sealed. I won't let him die, but..."

She held up three fingers. I understood immediately.

"Thirty thousand? No problem."

"Three hundred thousand. US dollars."

"Deal."

Money was the least of my concerns. Three hundred thousand was a small price for my son's life.

Two days passed quickly. I waited outside the shaman's temple, praying silently.

To ensure nothing went wrong, I checked the hidden camera I'd installed at home.

On the screen, Grace had brought a black-robed Ajarn from Thailand.

In the dimly lit living room, candles circled my son's bed.

Liam, the Golden Retriever, lay on top of my son's body.

Grace looked more hopeful than I'd ever seen her.

I heard her say, "Liam, you'll be human again soon. We'll be rich."

The dog barked twice, excited.

I stared at the screen, my palms clenched so tight they hurt.

Shameless thieves. Your dream is about to shatter.

Anticipating the outcome, I looked forward to seeing Grace's despair.

Both shamans performed their rituals as time ticked by.

I deliberately had the white-robed shaman hold back just as Liam's soul was leaving the dog's body.

Liam's cancer-ridden body had long been sacrificed to the black-robed Ajarn, likely used for dark rituals.

I wanted Liam Anderson to become a wandering ghost, forever lost.

Just as expected, the black-robed Ajarn sensed something wrong. No matter what she tried, Liam's soul couldn't enter my son's body.

Evil could not prevail. Their dark scheme failed.

The black-robed Ajarn's ritual broke. She vomited blood onto Grace's face.

Grace froze for a moment, then turned pale. Trembling, she asked, "What happened? Did my boyfriend succeed?"

The black-robed Ajarn shook her head, defeated. "It failed. Someone interfered."

She pointed at the lifeless Golden Retriever. "His soul has been shattered. Gone forever."

### 7

Grace's vision went black as she collapsed to the floor.

She frantically crawled over, shaking the golden retriever violently while weeping pitifully.

"Liam, wake up!"

"We were going to spend the old hag's money together—you can't die!"

"You're about to become a father! Come back to me!"

Seeing the golden retriever had stopped breathing, she began screaming at the empty air.

Only silence answered her.

Her lover was dead, while my son's soul had returned to his body.

The black-robed Ajarn, seeing Grace's hysterical state, grabbed his bag and fled.

Watching this scene, I felt an indescribable satisfaction.

This wasn't over yet. Her punishment was still to come.

I paid the white-robed shaman and took the earliest flight back the next day.

When I pushed open the front door, Grace had already tidied the house.

She was brewing soup in the kitchen, looking surprised to see me but quickly composing herself.

"You're back, Mom. I made soup—let me get you a bowl."

She kept talking to herself, bringing me a large bowl of soup.

I glanced at the slightly murky broth, pretending to accept it while watching for her next move.

I deliberately mentioned the golden retriever. "Where's the dog? Why isn't he home today?"

Pain flashed in her eyes, but she dodged the question. "He was too noisy. I got rid of him."

Then she kept urging me to drink the soup immediately.

Seeing her frantic impatience, I guessed what she was planning.

Meeting her intense stare, I raised the bowl and splashed the soup directly in her face.

I stopped pretending and confronted her directly.

"Grace, so eager to kill me? Too bad your plans failed."

"My son treated you well, and that dead dog is your punishment for harming others!"

Hearing my mocking tone, she finally looked up at me in dazed realization.

Then understanding dawned, her face filled with shock and hatred. "You did this? You killed my Liam!"

She tried to claw at me, but I slapped her to the ground.

"You brought this on yourself. This is what you both deserved."

I looked down at her, my voice cold as ice.

"Liam Anderson deserved to have his soul shattered. He won't be reincarnating anytime soon!"

Grace's eyes burned crimson as she pointed and shrieked at me.

"You old hag! You'll get what's coming to you!"

"You're the one who should die! You're the one standing in our way!"

I burst out laughing.

"I should thank you two thieves for not killing me sooner—otherwise I wouldn't have lived to see your downfall!"

"The thought of you sleeping with a dog makes me sick!"

"You were so desperate you couldn't tell man from beast!"

Grace trembled with rage.

"Shut up, you old hag!"

She glanced toward my son's room and let out a crazed laugh.

"If Liam's dead, your son won't live either."

"What does it matter if you know? I just fed him rat poison. He's probably meeting his maker right now!"

### 8

I thought she would target me first, but she actually drugged my son instead.

"If anything happens to my son, I'll chop that dead dog of yours into pieces and feed it to the pigs!"

Her triumph lasted barely a minute before the police pushed the door open, followed by several doctors.

Grace Lopez was stunned.

Medical staff rushed my son to the hospital immediately. Grace tried to get up and block them, but an officer forced her to the ground, where a pool of blood spread beneath her.

I walked over and showed her the evidence I had collected of her abusing my son during my absence.

She had assumed I would never check my son's body, so she had tormented him without restraint.

Leaning close to her ear, I whispered coldly, "You ungrateful wretch, you belong rotting in prison."

Fortunately, my son received timely medical care and was out of danger.

The doctor even mentioned that his consciousness was gradually returning, showing signs of waking.

Tears of relief streamed down my face.

While Grace was in custody, I hired cleaners to pack and discard every trace of her from the house.

In her closet, they found the decomposing corpse of the golden retriever. I told them to hand it over to the septic tank workers.

That filthy, vile creature deserved to rot in sewage.

With both disgusting presences gone from the house, I felt a wave of relief.

Over the following days, I provided my lawyer with every piece of evidence to ensure Grace received the maximum sentence. I wanted her to never recover from this.

Before her case was resolved, her parasitic parents showed up at my door.

At first, they played the victim, pleading for leniency for their cash-cow daughter.

"We're family, please forgive Grace just this once."

"She's just too naive and was tricked. Let us take her home, teach her some sense, and we'll return her to you properly tamed!"

I leaned against the doorframe, watching them coldly.

Grace's scandal had spread widely online. I had no idea how they still had the nerve to bargain with me.

I let out a scornful laugh and glanced sideways.

"Grace is going to prison, and that's final."

"If you know what's good for you, stay away. Otherwise, I won't hesitate to send you both to join her."

Seeing that I had torn off all pretenses, they dropped their act.

Grace's gambler mother made an outrageous demand. "A million dollars. Give us a million, and we'll act like we never had a daughter. Otherwise, we'll ruin the reputations of both you and your son!"

Her drunkard father chimed in. "Pay up, or we'll be at your door every day."

They threw a tantrum, expecting me to yield. I just rolled my eyes.

I held up my phone, playing the recording I had made. "Extorting over half a million carries a minimum sentence of ten years. Would you like the whole family to reunite behind bars?"

With that, I slammed the door shut, ignoring their howls outside.

I knew these vicious troublemakers wouldn't give up easily. To end this for good, I had to show them I wasn't someone they could push around.

I submitted the recording as evidence, and they were sentenced to fifteen days in jail.

Fifteen days wasn't much, but it was enough to intimidate them. They never bothered me again.

A month later, Grace's trial began.

In court, she tried every trick to evade guilt, but the evidence and videos left no room for denial.

She could only glare at me with pure hatred.

"You old hag, this is all your fault! I curse you to die a painful death!"

"And that half-dead son of yours will join Liam in hell soon enough."

I had never seen such shamelessness. It was truly eye-opening.

I couldn't be bothered to waste words on her. I didn't even grant her a glance.

Just as the judge was about to announce the verdict, Grace summoned some insane strength, lunged forward, and stabbed my neck with a pen from the table.

"Let's all die together!"

Officers quickly restrained her.

Miraculously, the pen missed my artery.

Grace, however, faced a heavier sentence and was ultimately given the death penalty.

On the day of her execution, the hospital called.

My son had woken up.

His first words were an apology.

It turned out that even in his vegetative state, he had been aware of everything Grace had done.
