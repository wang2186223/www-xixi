###Chapter 1

On my twentieth birthday, my parents handed me a portfolio containing profiles of the nation's most prominent heirs.

The gilded album was filled with detailed information about the scions of various elite circles.

I calmly informed my father that I would decide my marriage partner by drawing lots.

In my previous life, I had chosen Zephyr Ashcroft from the Shanghai Elite Circle without hesitation.

Only after our marriage did I discover that his unattainable crush, Seraphina Vance, had been devastated by our union.

In her despair, she turned to alcohol and met with a tragic accident.

She attempted suicide three times.

Zephyr blamed me for everything.

He transferred all my family's assets to Seraphina, completely draining the Valrose fortune.

In the end, he even allowed her to cut the brake lines of our family car.

We perished in the resulting crash.

Now, reborn, I closed my eyes and randomly drew a name.

Unfolding the slip of paper, I saw the name Alistair Cortez from the Fujian Elite Circle.

This heir apparent had been living in seclusion at a temple, detached from worldly affairs.

At the engagement gala, I made a grand entrance on Alistair's arm.

Suddenly, Zephyr burst into the ballroom.

His eyes bloodshot, he grabbed my wrist.

"Astrid, you were supposed to choose me."
-----------

I gently placed the photo of Alistair Cortez in front of my parents.

My mother picked it up and examined it carefully, while my father frowned.

"Astrid, are you sure about the Cortez family?"

My mother worriedly held my hand. "You've always liked Zephyr Ashcroft. Why the sudden change of heart..."

I shook my head firmly. "Since fate has given me a second chance, I'm willing to try."

Images from my past life flashed through my mind, the cold marriage sending shivers down my spine.

My parents exchanged a glance and finally nodded in agreement.

"We'll discuss the marriage alliance with the Cortez family," my father said solemnly. "But both families are prominent. Keep this confidential until the engagement gala."

I softly agreed and turned to prepare for tonight's charity ball.

As soon as I arrived at the venue, reporters swarmed around me like sharks smelling blood.

"Miss Valrose, is it true you're about to get engaged to the Ashcroft heir?"

The camera flashes hurt my eyes. As I raised my hand to shield them, I accidentally met Zephyr Ashcroft's icy gaze.

He stood in the center of the crowd, like an unmeltable iceberg.

"Move aside."

His bodyguards roughly pushed the reporters away, shielding Seraphina Vance behind them.

Seraphina looked pale, leaning weakly against him.

"My heart belongs only to Seraphina," Zephyr's voice was clear and cold. "Even if I'm forced into a marriage alliance, my heart will always be hers."

Seraphina's eyes welled up with tears, and she clung tightly to his waist.

Whispers spread around us.

"Even the Valrose heiress can't compare to the daughter of a nouveau riche."

"How humiliating, throwing herself at him like that."

Seraphina shot me a triumphant look, a faint smile playing on her lips.

I turned away expressionlessly and found my seat.

Fate had a cruel sense of humor—Zephyr's seat was right next to mine.

He sat down, bringing a chill with him.

"Astrid Valrose, how long are you going to keep pestering me?"

His words were like a cold knife, stabbing into my heart.

"I'm not pestering you."

Zephyr slammed his hand on the table, drawing the attention of those around us.

"Then why insist on marrying me? Just because the Valrose family is powerful, you think you can control my life?"

"You're humiliating me. Even if we marry, I won't spare you a glance."

The memories of my past life came flooding back—he had indeed kept his word.

Seraphina chose that moment to approach, tears streaming down her face like broken strings.

She suddenly knelt before me, her voice choked with sobs.

"Miss Valrose, please show mercy. My parents are old, they can't handle this..."

Zephyr immediately helped her up, his eyes filled with disgust as he looked at me.

"If you have a problem, take it out on me. Why hurt Seraphina?"

I was stunned. "I didn't do anything."

"Spoiled heiresses like you never know when to stop."

At that moment, a sycophantic voice chimed in.

"Mr. Ashcroft, this is a gift for you and Miss Valrose's engagement..."

Zephyr snatched the gift box and hurled it at me.

"Apologize," his voice was as cold as ice. "Or I'd rather break the agreement than marry a woman like you!"
###Chapter 2

The edge of the gift box was as sharp as a blade.

It left a bloody mark on my chin.

Gasps echoed around me.

Yet no one dared to come closer.

My fingertips lightly touched the wound.

Warm blood stained my fingers.

Zephyr Ashcroft's face gradually twisted.

It overlapped with the image from my past life.

The way he humiliated me in public for Seraphina Vance.

A chill spread from the depths of my heart.

"I won't apologize."

"I didn't do it."

Zephyr's eyes turned cold.

"Then don't regret it!"

He wrapped his arm around Seraphina and walked away.

His back was resolute.

My parents rushed over.

My mother's hands were trembling.

"Does it hurt, Astrid?"

"Let's go home."

The private doctor carefully treated the wound.

I looked at my parents' anxious faces.

My eyes grew warm.

I thanked heaven for giving me a second chance.

Everything was still within reach.

The Valrose family's business was intact.

My parents were healthy and safe.

I would stay far away from Zephyr.

And Seraphina.

Three days later.

The Cortez family sent the engagement gifts.

The living room was filled with an array of luxurious items.

A jade bracelet lay quietly in a brocade box.

It was the Cortez family's heirloom.

A symbol of their seriousness about this marriage.

A bittersweet feeling rose in my heart.

In my past life, the Ashcroft family had claimed.

That I was the one who clung desperately to marry into their family.

There was no engagement gala.

No dowry.

Even the wedding was just a simple meal.

The Ashcroft elders' sneers.

Zephyr's indifference.

All of it was still vivid in my mind.

The Cortez family's respect made me grateful.

My choice in this life was not wrong.

I decided to personally select a gift for Alistair Cortez.

The century-old shop was filled with the scent of sandalwood.

The old craftsman adjusted his glasses.

"What design would you like, Miss Valrose?"

The blueprint was spread on the table.

I had just pointed to the cufflink design.

When the shop's bell suddenly rang.

Zephyr walked in, holding Seraphina's hand.

His brows immediately furrowed.

"What are you doing here?"

The old craftsman respectfully answered.

"Miss Valrose is preparing her engagement attire."

Zephyr glanced at the design.

He sneered.

"The engraving is tacky."

"Don't waste your time."

I looked down at the "C" on the cufflink.

About to explain.

Seraphina suddenly exclaimed.

"Zephyr, this cheongsam is so beautiful."

She stepped past me to touch the red cheongsam.

Her eyes were filled with desire.

Zephyr's tone instantly softened.

"If you like it, have one custom-made."

"But the concert tonight..."

Seraphina cooed.

"I want to wear it for you."

Zephyr turned to the old craftsman.

"Alter it now."

"Don't waste our time."

I held onto the cheongsam.

"This is my engagement dress."

Zephyr raised a disdainful brow.

"Seraphina looks better in a cheongsam than you."

Seraphina, with her back to him.

Gave me a triumphant smile.

Her voice, however, was pitiful.

"I don't deserve such an expensive dress..."

"Nonsense."

Zephyr shot me a cold look.

"Astrid Valrose is just relying on her family."

The old craftsman stood quietly.

Waiting for my instructions.

The Valrose family had been a patron of this shop for a century.

Our families had a deep connection.

I gently let go.

"Let Miss Vance have it."

Zephyr's expression softened slightly.

"After we're married, I'll have dinner with you once a month."

His condescending tone.

Suddenly made me see the truth.

Ever since he found out the Valrose family was a top-tier elite.

While the Ashcroft family was just nouveau riche.

He had been belittling me to hide his own insecurities.

I once loved him for his disregard of power.

Now it only seemed laughable.

The corners of my lips curved up.

"Zephyr Ashcroft."

"Who told you—"

"That I'm marrying you?"
###Chapter 3

Zephyr Ashcroft's lips curled into a mocking smile.

It was as if he had heard the biggest joke of his life.

"You've been chasing after me since you were eight, saying you liked me."

"Every birthday wish was to marry me by the age of twenty."

"Now that you're finally of age, you're willing to switch to someone else?"

Seraphina Vance leaned softly against his shoulder, her voice dripping with sweet mockery.

"The identity of the Valrose heiress is something many would fight to marry."

"Even if every man in the world lined up to propose," Zephyr pinched her cheek, "she would still only choose me."

The two of them walked away together.

Before leaving, Zephyr tossed out a command, "Have the cheongsam altered and sent to the Ashcroft residence. Change the cufflinks to square diamonds, no engravings."

The old tailor shook his head as he watched their retreating figures.

"Miss Valrose, this..."

"If she likes it, let her have it," I picked up my paintbrush again. "Make the cufflinks as they were. The groom isn't him, so he has no right to dictate."

The evening birthday banquet was a whirl of clinking glasses and laughter.

Seraphina arrived an hour late, followed by Zephyr's personal bodyguard.

The bodyguard carried a red plastic bag, which he threw heavily at my feet.

"Were you waiting anxiously, Miss Valrose? I wanted to return it right after the concert."

"But Zephyr insisted I stay in the car a little longer..."

"You're so magnanimous, surely you won't mind, right?"

The bag opened, revealing the priceless cheongsam crumpled into a ball.

The red silk was stained with blotches of white, glaring and nauseating.

The room fell silent instantly.

Some were indignant, while others waited for the drama to unfold.

"She can tolerate this? She must really love Zephyr."

"What's the use of love? Zephyr only has eyes for Seraphina."

"The Valrose heiress is throwing herself at him to this extent. The family fortune will soon bear the Ashcroft name."

I glanced at it indifferently, "Throw it away."

Seraphina's attempt to flaunt fell flat. She glared at me, gritted her teeth, and walked to the end of the room.

Half an hour later, her Weibo post topped the trending list.

"The happiest thing is wearing the cheongsam my lover gave me and listening to my favorite concert."

The accompanying photo showed them kissing, fingers intertwined.

Marketing accounts quickly dug up my past confession posts, creating a comparison chart for public humiliation.

Zephyr liked the most popular post.

"Astrid Valrose throwing herself at Zephyr" instantly exploded across the internet.

I deleted my account and contacted the PR department.

Ten minutes later, all related hashtags disappeared without a trace.

The day before the engagement gala.

As soon as I arrived at the company, I was forcibly escorted into a car by Ashcroft bodyguards.

In the Ashcroft living room, Seraphina was crying pitifully.

Zephyr was gently comforting her, but his expression turned cold the moment he saw me.

"Astrid Valrose, you're ruthless! Blocking all her accounts? You know she relies on this for her livelihood!"

I frowned, "I only removed the trending topics, I didn't touch her accounts."

"Who else could it be? You're just jealous!"

The sound of crisp heels echoed from the staircase.

Mrs. Ashcroft looked down at me from above.

"Not even married yet and already defying your husband. Such fine upbringing from the Valrose family."

Mr. Ashcroft lounged leisurely, a far cry from his previous deference.

"Since you insist on marrying, we reluctantly agree."

"But the dowry must be at least half of the Valrose fortune."

I was about to refuse when a sharp pain shot through my knee.

The bodyguard forced me to kneel on the ground.

Mrs. Ashcroft gracefully raised her hand, and a servant brought over a tea set.

"A cup of daughter-in-law tea in advance isn't too much to ask, is it?"
###Chapter 4

The scalding teacup was thrust into my hands.

The servant's voice was icy. "Miss Valrose, according to tradition, you must kneel to serve tea to Madam."

The moment my fingertips touched the cup, the searing pain made me jerk my hand back.

The porcelain cup shattered on the floor, pieces scattering everywhere.

"Astrid Valrose!" Zephyr Ashcroft's furious shout came from above. "You don't even know the most basic etiquette?"

I looked down at my reddened fingertips, my voice calm. "I will only serve tea to my future in-laws."

"You didn't want to marry me, did you? Well, I didn't want to marry you either."

As I tried to stand, the bodyguards on either side forcefully pressed down on my shoulders.

I struggled fiercely. "Let go! I'm a Valrose, how dare you—"

A sharp slap interrupted my words.

Madam Valrose stood before me, her eyes filled with disgust. "The engagement gala is tomorrow, and you still don't know your place!"

She turned to Zephyr. "Look at this, the woman who insists on marrying you!"

Zephyr averted his gaze, his tone mocking. "If it weren't for her persistence, I should have married Seraphina."

Seraphina Vance's tears fell instantly. "Zephyr, I dream of marrying you... but how could my family compete with the Valrose family?"

She cried pitifully, and Zephyr immediately pulled her into his arms.

He walked up to me, looking down at me with disdain.

"Astrid Valrose, didn't you use every trick to marry me?"

"Fine. But you must sign an agreement—after marriage, you cannot interfere with anything I do, you cannot return to the Valrose family, and you must dutifully serve my parents, take care of me and Seraphina."

The servant handed over the prenuptial agreement, the black and white text stating "50% of the Valrose family's assets as dowry."

I clenched my fists, refusing to sign, my eyes red as I looked up. "Zephyr Ashcroft! I never wanted to marry you!"

Another slap landed harshly.

Madam Valrose sneered. "The Valrose family is supposed to be prestigious? Raising a daughter who defies her husband!"

"Today, I will discipline you properly for the Ashcroft family, so you don't embarrass us in the future!"

I lost count of how many slaps I endured.

I lost count of how many handprints were left on me.

When they finally let me go, they left me with a warning. "Wear a green dress tomorrow."

Because Madam Ashcroft and Seraphina would be wearing red.

How ridiculous.

The next day at the engagement gala, I still wore the newly designed red cheongsam.

My parents were talking with the Cortez family in the hall, while I greeted guests at the entrance.

It was nearly noon when the Ashcroft family arrived in full force.

They were dressed extravagantly, Seraphina clinging to Zephyr's arm, her red dress and his black suit a glaringly perfect match.

Mr. Ashcroft, who usually bowed and smiled at everyone, held his head high today, as if he were the star of the gala.

Seeing me in a red dress, Madam Ashcroft's face darkened instantly.

"Where are your parents? I want to ask, is this how the Valrose family raises their daughter?"

With so many guests around, I didn't want to cause a scene. "They're inside, you can go directly—"

Before I could finish, Madam Ashcroft rudely poked my shoulder with her finger. "Bring them out to see me!"

I frowned and stepped back, noticing Zephyr approaching expressionlessly.

He stood beside me, pretending to greet guests together.

"Astrid Valrose, you finally got what you wanted, are you happy?"

"But remember, all you have is a title, you'll never have my heart."

His voice dripped with hatred.

As if I had ruined his life.

"Zephyr Ashcroft, I think you've misunderstood, actually today—"

"How dare you ignore me?" Madam Ashcroft suddenly raised her voice, playing a video on her phone—the scene of me kneeling yesterday.

The guests stopped and watched, some pulling out their phones to record.

Even the reporters outside broke through the barriers and crowded around.

"Miss Valrose, is this your compromise to your future mother-in-law?"

"Does your kneeling mean the Valrose family will bow to the Ashcroft family?"

I gasped, quickly grabbing Zephyr's arm. "Make your mother turn off the video!"

But he pulled his arm away, leisurely adjusting his tie.

"If you can learn to be filial to your in-laws, a little embarrassment is worth it."

"Zephyr Ashcroft! Your whole family is insane!"

"What right does someone who begged to marry me have to criticize my family?"

Blinded by rage, I grabbed a thermos from the table, ready to hurl it at him.

But suddenly, a hand reached from behind, gently grasping my wrist.

I turned to see Alistair Cortez standing behind me in a white suit, his gaze calm yet sharp.

"Mr. Ashcroft, how many lives does your mother have, to make my fiancée kneel?"
###Chapter 5

Zephyr Ashcroft's lips curled into a sneer.

"Isn't this the ever-so-ascetic Alistair Cortez?"

"Who would have thought our engagement gala could lure such a distinguished guest?"

"Have your Buddhist devotions addled your brain? Do you mistake my fiancée for your own?"

"Everyone knows Astrid Valrose has been destined to marry me since childhood."

Alistair Cortez shielded me behind him.

Only half of my body was visible.

"Zephyr Ashcroft, take a good look."

"This is my engagement gala with Alistair!"

He followed my pointing finger and turned around.

Before he could read the names on the backdrop, he saw our parents emerging from the inner hall.

My parents had always been kind to him.

But now, they didn't even spare him a glance.

Instead, they smiled warmly at Alistair.

"Alistair, Astrid can be a bit willful at times. Please be patient with her."

"Don't worry, Auntie. I'll take good care of her."

Alistair's gentle, jade-like voice made Zephyr's face darken instantly.

He raised his voice, "Auntie, I'm your future son-in-law."

My mother completely ignored him.

My father looked past him at me, "What happened just now?"

I pointed directly at Mrs. Ashcroft.

"Yesterday, they locked me in the Ashcroft mansion."

"They forced me to kneel and serve tea, forced me to sign a property transfer agreement."

"Today, she played a video in public, trying to ruin the Valrose family's reputation."

My father's eyes turned icy.

Bodyguards immediately seized the phone.

The crowd erupted in uproar.

The onlookers who had been enjoying the spectacle quickly backed away.

Reporters' cameras frantically focused on the Ashcrofts.

"So Miss Valrose is actually marrying Alistair Cortez?"

"Were the Ashcrofts trying to force a marriage?"

Zephyr finally saw the names on the backdrop.

Astrid Valrose, Alistair Cortez.

The six words made his pupils contract sharply.

"So the arranged marriage was never with the Ashcroft heir?"

I heard him gasp.

He reached out to grab me, but Alistair blocked him.

"Mr. Ashcroft, please behave yourself."

"Impossible! You were supposed to marry me!"

Mrs. Ashcroft stood frozen.

Mr. Ashcroft shook his head in panic, "This isn't true..."

After watching the video, my father smashed the phone to the ground.

"You dared to make my daughter kneel? How audacious!"

"From today on, anyone who cooperates with the Ashcrofts is my enemy!"

The Ashcrofts turned pale.

Alistair took my hand and led me towards the ceremonial platform.

Zephyr tried to follow, but Seraphina Vance clung to him desperately.

"Zephyr, now you don't have to marry her!"

"We can be together openly!"

"Get lost! Who do you think you are?"

He shoved Seraphina away and rushed to me.

"Astrid, this must be a misunderstanding, right?"

"You love me, don't you?"

Countless eyes focused on us.

I knew I had to end this once and for all.

I looked straight into his eyes, enunciating each word clearly.

"Zephyr Ashcroft, I stopped loving you long ago."

"You were deluding yourself, thinking I couldn't live without you."

"In reality, I'd rather die than marry you!"

I linked arms with Alistair, revealing the jade cufflinks on his sleeve.

Engraved on them were three letters - A.C.C.

Zephyr's pupils contracted violently.
###Chapter 6

Alistair's fingers traced the sapphire cufflinks, his eyes shimmering with subtle light.

Mrs. Cortez chuckled behind her hand. "This boy is usually as cold as ice, but today he's like spring snow melting."

"Since Astrid arrived, even the corners of his eyes are filled with joy."

My mother patted the back of my hand. "This girl took three years to draw my design sketches. But when she heard about the engagement with Alistair, she came up with ten designs overnight."

"She even personally crafted the cufflink patterns. I, as her mother, have never enjoyed such treatment."

Amidst the laughter, I felt my ears burning.

The mahogany chair quietly moved closer, the warm fabric of his suit brushing against my arm.

"You didn't wear the jade bracelet from your grandmother?"

I leaned closer to his ear. "I want to save it for the wedding day, to match the dragon and phoenix gown."

His Adam's apple moved slightly, a smile spreading from his eyes to the corners of his lips.

His gaze made my heart tremble.

Memories from my past life were like shattered glass, with no trace of him to be found. The familiarity I felt when I drew his photo now turned into a mist lingering in my heart.

He suddenly pushed his ID card in front of me.

On the back of the transparent card holder was a faded ID photo—a little girl with pigtails, grinning with a missing front tooth.

"This is from my elementary school..."

The floodgates of memory burst open. A skinny boy with a southern accent, always cornered on his way home from school. I chased away those bullies with a branch, but he never spoke again.

When we parted, I gave him a plastic ring, soaking his shirt with my tears.

"Little Mute?"

He rotated the sandalwood beads on his wrist, his voice deep like an ancient zither. "After returning to Fujian, I always dreamed of you holding that branch."

"When I came back to find you at twenty-five, I saw you chasing Zephyr all over the city."

"I knelt in the temple for three days and nights. The abbot said I was still tied to the mortal world."

His finger traced my palm. "The day your father called was the final deadline."

His fingers, wrapped in sandalwood scent, suddenly tightened, interlacing with mine.

As the engagement gala ended, the blue lights of a police car cut through the night sky.

My parents and Alistair stood by my side as the lawyer presented surveillance footage and medical records to the police. The Ashcroft family was detained for seven days for illegal confinement and coercion.

Two weeks later, Alistair took me to see mansions across the city.

On our way back, the sky was painted with sunset hues. He was helping me fasten my seatbelt when the car suddenly braked.

Zephyr stood at the wrought iron gate, holding a bouquet of fiery roses, his suit wrinkled like pickled vegetables.

Alistair instantly shielded me.

"Mr. Ashcroft, are you switching careers to become a doorman?"

The roses were thrust toward me. Zephyr's eyes were bloodshot. "I've figured it out, Astrid! All those years when you said you loved me, my heart was actually racing!"

He suddenly knelt, holding up the faded plastic ring. "You proposed to me with this ring in sixth grade. I've kept it for fifteen years!"

Alistair let out a cold laugh. "Mr. Ashcroft, just last week you publicly declared you would only marry Seraphina."

"This is between us!" Zephyr roared, turning to me. "Please, just look at me once more..."

The plastic ring suddenly fell into my palm.

Under Zephyr's ecstatic gaze, I gently turned the inner ring—faded engravings formed a set of initials.

"Alistair," I held the ring up to the light. "Isn't this the farewell gift I engraved with your name?"

The sunset light passed over the ring, clearly revealing the letters "AC."
###Chapter 7

The air froze instantly.

Alistair Cortez took the ring and examined it carefully.
He frowned slightly. "I've never seen this before."

"On the day you transferred schools, the whole class gave you gifts."
"I gave you this ring."
"You said you liked rings hidden in candy, so I searched every supermarket in the city to find it."
"My name is engraved inside."

We turned our heads at the same time.
Zephyr Ashcroft's face turned pale with anger.

"Astrid, you're lying."
"This ring was clearly placed on my desk by you."
"It's proof that you had a crush on me."

Alistair suddenly chuckled.
"A month before I transferred, he and I were desk mates."
"It seems someone took the wrong gift."

The misunderstanding was cleared.
He held the ring gently with his fingertips.

"Good, it finally returned to its rightful owner."
I smiled and extended my ring finger.
The ring slid into place.

Zephyr was still holding the bouquet of roses.
His fingers dug into the petals.

"Even if the ring was a misunderstanding, your love for me wasn't fake!"
He showed his phone screen.
It was filled with sweet messages I had sent him.

I glanced at it indifferently.
"It was love."
"But it ended the day you said you loved Seraphina."

Zephyr's eyes suddenly lit up.
"Because of her?"
He gently put down the bouquet and walked away.

A week later, the Vance family declared bankruptcy.
The nouveau riche couldn't hold onto their wealth.
The company's accounts were full of holes.
Seraphina's extravagant spending made things worse.

I thought it was just a business blow.
Until Seraphina knelt in front of my house.

"Miss Valrose, I was wrong!"
"Please save my father! Zephyr reported him for tax evasion. He'll go to jail!"

I pulled my hand away from her tight grip.
"You should go to the person responsible."

"He did this for you!"
"If you say something, he'll stop!"

I looked down at her pale face.
"But I remember, he loved you the most."

Seraphina trembled.
"I promise to disappear forever. Please show mercy..."

I found it laughable.
"It was you who wouldn't let me go."
"I'm already engaged."

She tried to grab me again.
Suddenly, Zephyr appeared.

He roughly pulled Seraphina away.
"Who gave you permission to harass Astrid!"

Seraphina was in tears.
"What will it take for you to spare the Vance family?"

"You made me lose Astrid."
"This is the price."

After driving Seraphina away, he turned back to me with a tender expression.
"I avenged you. Can you forgive me now?"

Alistair stood up from the couch.
He signaled to the bodyguards.

"Mr. Ashcroft drove her away, and I'll drive you away."
"Fair enough."

Zephyr resisted fiercely.
"This is the Valrose estate! What right do you have!"

I leaned tiredly into Alistair's arms.
The scent of sandalwood filled my nose.

He held me steadily.
"Because we're engaged."
"We're getting married next month."

A loud thud came from behind.
The bodyguard reported in a low voice.
"Mr. Cortez, he fainted after hitting the door."
###Chapter 8

Zephyr Ashcroft was rushed to the hospital.

The doctor stitched up his forehead with eight stitches.

When he woke up, he felt dizzy and couldn't stop vomiting.

The diagnosis was a concussion.

The bodyguards stood by, looking aggrieved.

"We just wanted him to leave. He was the one who ran into the doorframe."

On the hospital bed, Zephyr breathed weakly.

He trembled as he reached out to me.

"Astrid, my head is spinning..."

Alistair Cortez pulled me behind him.

He instructed the bodyguards, "Get him a nurse."

As we reached the door of the hospital room,

Zephyr started vomiting violently again.

The call button was pressed repeatedly.

Watching the medical staff bustling around,

I sighed softly.

"Alistair, let me talk to him."

The door to the hospital room closed gently.

A flicker of joy appeared in Zephyr's eyes.

"Astrid, I know you can't bear to leave me."

"You still care about me, don't you?"

"We can start over now. It's not too late. We'll get married tomorrow. I'll give you the grandest wedding. Whatever you want, I'll..."

"Zephyr, don't you understand?"

I coldly interrupted his fantasy.

"I don't love you. It's not out of spite, nor because of Seraphina."

"I truly don't love you anymore."

His lips trembled slightly.

His face was frighteningly pale.

He shook his head, refusing to believe.

"You used to love me so much."

"Yes, I did love you once."

"But how did you repay me?"

"You were jealous of the Valrose family's status, resentful that I was born at the top of the pyramid, and insecure that the Ashcrofts were inferior to the Valroses."

"So you deliberately used Seraphina to provoke me, publicly declaring that you loved her and not me, saying I was desperate, that I was clingy."

"You stabbed me in the heart so many times. Did you ever think it would hurt?"

Zephyr opened his mouth.

But in the end, he said nothing.

He knew everything I said was true.

The insecurities and jealousy hidden deep in his heart.

Now laid bare.

He didn't even have the courage to look at me.

A long silence spread through the hospital room.

Until Alistair knocked on the door to remind us.

Zephyr finally asked in a low voice, "Astrid, can we really never go back?"

"Even if I change all my flaws, it won't work?"

I shook my head firmly.

"We won't have a future together."

He persisted stubbornly, "How do you know without trying?"

I stood up.

Gazing into the eyes that once made my heart flutter.

"I've tried in my dreams."

"The ending of marrying you is that you would hate me forever, take away the Valrose fortune, and kill me and my parents."

"In the end, you and Seraphina would live happily ever after."

As I turned to leave,

I heard Zephyr's suppressed sobs.

The sound was eerily similar to the cries of my parents and me in the car accident in my past life.

But in this life,

The ending will definitely be different.

On the eve of the wedding,

The Ashcrofts followed in the footsteps of the Vances.

I heard that Seraphina had collected a large amount of evidence.

Not only did she report the Ashcrofts for tax evasion,

But she also exposed them for beating their employees.

The Ashcrofts completely lost their chance to recover.

The Vances and Ashcrofts disappeared without a trace.

Zephyr was also nowhere to be found.

On the day of the wedding,

I put on the Cortez family's heirloom jade bracelet.

Alistair's grandmother came especially.

She brought the yearbook he had cherished for years.

He had carefully preserved the page I wrote on.

The words under the protective film were still clear.

Looking at my childish handwriting,

I couldn't help but laugh.

"Alistair, the place you're going is so far away."

"For me, it's like gazing at the stars."
