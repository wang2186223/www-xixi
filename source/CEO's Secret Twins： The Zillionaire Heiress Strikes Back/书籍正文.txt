###Chapter 1

The June sun blazed mercilessly, its scorching rays baking the asphalt.

Evelyn Roland staggered out of Horizon Tech's headquarters, her white blouse stained crimson with blood.

She clutched the contract in her hand, her lips curling into a bitter smile.

This gunshot wound settled four years of debt with Adrian Valentine.

That rainy night three years ago, when Adrian had stood outside her dormitory holding an umbrella all night—now she knew it had all been an elaborate ruse.

"Director Roland, Mr. Valentine is waiting for you in the conference room," the secretary's voice snapped her back to reality.

The elevator ascended to the top floor. Through the slightly ajar door, a woman's breathy moan drifted out: "Adrian, not so rough..."

Evelyn pushed the door open.

Isabella Langley sat disheveled on Adrian's lap, her lips swollen. At the sight of Evelyn, she scrambled to her feet in panic. "Sis—"

Evelyn strode to the desk and dropped the bloodstained contract alongside the divorce papers.

Adrian leisurely adjusted his cufflinks, his black dress shirt accentuating his lean frame. When his gaze lifted, the disdain in his eyes cut through Evelyn like a blade.

"Horizon Tech's contract," Evelyn rasped. "I've signed the divorce papers."

Adrian's fingers stilled. His eyes flickered over her pallid face. "How did you secure it?"

"Does it matter?" Evelyn laughed softly. "You only care about results, Mr. Valentine."

Isabella suddenly threw herself into Adrian's arms. "You promised to marry me!"

Adrian stroked her hair, his tender gaze sickeningly sweet. "We'll file for divorce today."

But when he scanned the terms of the agreement, his pupils constricted. "Empty-handed?"

"Clean breaks are best." Evelyn turned away, her wound tearing—but the pain in her chest was worse.

Adrian rose with a cold chuckle, his suit jacket brushing her shoulder. "As you wish."
###Chapter 2

Evelyn's lips twisted into a bitter smile. So this was how he truly saw her—utterly worthless.

Outside the civil affairs office, Evelyn Roland and Adrian Valentine each clutched their divorce certificates. The sunlight stung their eyes.

Isabella Langley snatched the document from Adrian's hand, barely containing her glee. At last, she could stand by his side without pretense.

Her feigned concern shifted to Evelyn, only to find the woman more radiant than ever. That cold, untouchable beauty made Isabella's stomach churn.

She'd always hated that face. Now, she'd never have to see it again.

"Sister, the Langleys have disowned you. And with no assets from the divorce... surely you're not planning to sleep on the streets?"

That country bumpkin had been lucky to marry into their world. Now even that luck had run out.

Evelyn almost laughed. Isabella's fake sympathy had grown tiresome.

At eighteen, the Langleys discovered she wasn't their blood and abandoned her in the countryside. Meeting Adrian had been her only light—until two years ago.

When the Langleys found their real daughter, they'd shipped Isabella abroad to "refine" her for the Valentines.

Evelyn only learned the truth upon Isabella's return. The family severed ties without hesitation.

No love lost. She'd only come back to search for her birth parents.

Then she'd overheard Adrian's friends talking. How he'd fallen for Isabella's "innocent charm" during a business trip.

The torrent of explicit photos Isabella sent afterward had been particularly creative.

Few mistresses flaunted their affairs so brazenly.

"Save your concern." Evelyn's icy glance swept over them before she hailed a cab without looking back.

Not a single glance for Adrian.

His knuckles whitened around the divorce papers. She was really leaving?

But why was she walking so stiffly?

The taxi rounded the corner. Adrian remained rooted in place.

"Adrian! We're finally together!" Isabella bounced with excitement.

A cold glint flickered in his eyes, though his voice stayed gentle. "Let me take you home."

"Father will be thrilled!" She could already envision her triumph.

Adrian's smile deepened. "We should share the good news immediately."

Isabella nearly sang with joy. That nuisance was gone for good.

As Adrian's car pulled up to the Langley estate, a call from Horizon Tech's CEO made him gesture for Isabella to go ahead.

"Speak." His tone turned arctic.

Amused laughter crackled through the line. "Your sales director plays rough, Valentine. Pulled a knife to force my signature. I shot her—she dug the bullet out with her bare hands. Never met anyone like Evelyn Roland. She alive?"

Adrian's pupils constricted. "What did you say?"
###Chapter 3

Adrian Valentine ended the call and tapped his slender fingers three times on the desk.

"Find out where Evelyn went."

His assistant responded promptly, "Mr. Valentine, Ms. Roland returned to the villa half an hour ago and took a suitcase."

Adrian's gaze turned icy.

He had expected her to leave, but not this eagerly.

With a gunshot wound, where could she possibly go?

"Who picked her up?"

"A limited-edition Rolls-Royce. The driver was a young gentleman with an extraordinary presence."

Adrian's knuckles whitened, and his phone screen shattered under the pressure.

He tossed the broken device into the trash without expression.

The divorce papers had barely been signed, and already she had a luxury car waiting.

So she had planned her exit all along.

Evelyn, you’re ruthless.

......

The penthouse suite of Regal Heights.

Evelyn was settled onto a recliner by the floor-to-ceiling windows by her eldest brother.

"There’s an emergency at the company. Rest first," he said before hurrying off.

She didn’t mention the gunshot wound.

Sunlight filtered through the sheer curtains, casting a soft glow on her pale face.

Everything here felt achingly familiar.

She hadn’t been home in three years.

Pain radiated from her shoulder to her heart.

Curled beneath the velvet covers, her lashes trembled with unshed tears.

Four years of marriage, gone in an instant.

All those whispered promises had meant nothing in the end.

The real reason for the divorce was her pregnancy.

Adrian’s influence was vast—he could never find out.

She had bitten through her lip during the bullet extraction.

For the sake of the child, she endured the agony.

Thinking of her grandfather’s arrangement, she wiped her tears.

It was time to reclaim her identity as the Roland heiress.

......

Morning light pierced the autumn clouds.

Evelyn stood at the entrance of Regal Heights and removed her sunglasses.

A month of secluded recovery had restored her.

The crimson blazer accentuated her slender waist.

As she opened the car door, she saw Adrian stepping out of the building with Isabella Langley in his arms.

Isabella’s eyes flickered with surprise before settling into a triumphant smile.

"Long time no see, Director Roland."

Evelyn ignored her.

Adrian’s gaze swept over the Phantom parked behind her, his smirk freezing.

"Surviving a gunshot—you’re tougher than I thought."

Each word stabbed like a knife.

"Disappointed, Mr. Valentine?" She strode past him. "I’m here for my personal belongings."

Adrian suddenly seized her wrist. "Walking away empty-handed because you found a better option?"

Evelyn yanked free. "Not as refined as your taste for extramarital affairs."

The sound of shattering glass followed her as she turned away.

"Evelyn!"
###Chapter 4

Evelyn halted mid-step as Adrian's venomous words sliced through the air behind her.

"Evelyn, I'll have someone toss your trash out. Don't soil my space—you're not worthy."

His icy tone stabbed through her chest like a dagger.

He was the one who'd cheated, yet here he was, blaming her.

She whirled around, eyes sharp as blades. "Adrian, isn't the one beside you far filthier?"

Her gaze flickered pointedly toward Isabella.

Isabella paled instantly, as if slapped in public.

"Adrian..." She clutched his sleeve, voice trembling with feigned hurt.

Adrian deliberately pressed a kiss to Isabella's lips. "Be good. I'll take you for that ice cream cake you love tonight."

Evelyn's nails dug into her palms.

She'd loved that bakery's cakes too, but Adrian had always refused, claiming they'd upset her stomach. Turns out, it wasn't the cake—just the person undeserving.

Love and indifference couldn't be clearer.

Isabella smirked, nestling against Adrian's chest.

He studied Evelyn through narrowed eyes. She'd changed—the quiet elegance replaced by razor-edged defiance.

Only now did he notice her outfit. A crimson blazer hugged her curves, a stark departure from her usual muted style.

But what shocked him most was her hair.

Years ago, because he'd mentioned liking long hair, she'd never cut it again.

Now, it barely grazed her ears—sharp, sleek, paired with that fiery red and eyes colder than ice.

Evelyn dialed a former colleague. "Bring my things down. Now."

She wouldn't step foot in this place again.

Minutes later, a file box arrived. She checked its contents, then drove off without a backward glance.

Isabella watched the luxury car vanish, jealousy burning through her. How did Evelyn always land on her feet?

But fine. Adrian was hers now.

"Adrian, Evelyn's new man must be loaded. That car outclasses yours."

His expression darkened. For a month, he'd pulled every string to track Evelyn—and hit dead ends. That mysterious man remained a ghost.

"We're divorced. She's irrelevant." He strode toward the parking lot.

Isabella scrambled after him. A month of scheming, yet he still refused to stay overnight.

"Adrian, wait!" She chased him, heels clicking. Tonight's charity auction had a rare blue diamond—and she'd claim it.

Two blocks away, Evelyn's phone rang. Her grandfather's gruff voice filled the car.

"Girl, secure that blue diamond at tonight's auction."

She arched a brow. "Since when do you care about jewelry?"

"No questions. Just get it." His tone brooked no argument.

"Fine. Send the invite." She hung up, already plotting.
###Chapter 5

The Grandelle Auction House glittered with lights. Every piece on display tonight was a rare treasure.

Adrian Valentine entered with Isabella Langley on his arm. All eyes turned toward them instantly.

Isabella looked radiant in her crimson Valentino gown. The diamond necklace around her neck sparkled, accentuating her flawless complexion.

Feeling the envious gazes from every direction, she lifted her chin with triumph.

As the only woman Adrian had ever publicly escorted, this privilege filled her with pride.

A flicker of disdain crossed her eyes at the thought of Evelyn Roland—the wife he never acknowledged. She nodded gracefully to the crowd.

Adrian's arrival caused a stir.

He strode toward the VIP section but paused when he noticed the reserved throne-like seat at the front.

"Whose seat is that?" He glanced at his friend Julian Roscente.

Julian lounged lazily in his chair, his tousled chestnut hair making him look like a prince from a fairy tale.

"An honored guest personally arranged by the old man," he said with a meaningful smile. "Even I don't know who it is."

Adrian's gaze turned cold. The battle for the Violette Diamond tonight wouldn’t be simple.

Isabella studied the empty throne with curiosity.

The auction hall filled quickly, yet the seat remained vacant.

The host took the stage as the first item was unveiled under heavy security.

Just as anticipation peaked, the side door opened silently.

A slender figure entered at the last possible moment.

Evelyn wore an onyx gown, her porcelain skin glowing like pearls under the lights.

She walked through the crowd without glancing sideways, drawing awed stares in her wake.

Adrian's head snapped up, his gaze locking onto the familiar yet distant figure.

Isabella dug her nails into her palm. "Why won’t she just disappear?"

Adrian's lips pressed into a thin line, recalling the Rolls-Royce that had taken her away. Dark emotions churned in his eyes.

Evelyn remained oblivious to the stares and headed straight for the throne seat.

Gasps filled the room.

Isabella's face paled in disbelief.

Adrian's pupils contracted, his sharp gaze slicing across Evelyn’s profile.

Julian arched an amused brow.

This ex-wife was nothing like the rumors suggested.

"Evelyn." Adrian's icy voice cut through the silence. "That seat isn’t for you."
###Chapter 6

The chandeliers in the auction hall glittered brilliantly, illuminating the gathering of high society's elite. Tonight's spotlight was on the legendary rare violet diamond, drawing the attention of nearly the entire upper class.

Adrian Valentine's cold gaze swept over Evelyn Roland, brimming with disdain. In his eyes, this once-docile woman had no place at such an event.

Evelyn met his stare head-on. The sharp angles of his handsome face were accentuated by the light, but his eyes burned with contempt. She couldn't understand how two people who had once loved each other could end up like this.

Her four-month pregnancy showed in the slight swell of her abdomen, a constant reminder of their shattered marriage. She had wanted to salvage it—until she caught him with Isabella Langley.

"Evelyn, who gave you the audacity to show up here?" Adrian's voice was icy. "When the real guest of honor arrives, don't embarrass yourself."

Her chest tightened. What did she even mean to him?

This relationship had finally woken her up. Some people were never meant to be the light in her life.

Leaning lazily against her seat, she parted her red lips. "If you can be here, why can't I? Judging by the seating arrangement, my credentials seem higher than yours."

Adrian's pupils constricted. The radiant, defiant woman before him bore no resemblance to the melancholic, obedient wife he remembered. Were the rumors of luxury cars and handsome escorts true?

"Here on behalf of your sugar daddy?" he growled, barely containing his fury.

Evelyn smirked. "I earned my place here on my own."

Julian Roscente suddenly tugged Adrian's sleeve, pointing to the guest list. At the top was Sebastian Cortez's name.

"So you've latched onto Sebastian Cortez." Adrian's eyes darkened with rage. "Evelyn, you disgust me."

The words sliced through her heart like a blade.

Was this how low she had fallen in his eyes?

All lingering affection turned to ashes in that moment. She lifted her gaze, her eyes now devoid of warmth. "Adrian, a decent ex should be as silent as the dead."

His Adam's apple bobbed, but no retort came.

Nearby, Isabella curled her lips. In this battle, Evelyn was destined to lose.

"Ladies and gentlemen, we now present tonight's first lot—'Renaissance Masterpiece'!"

The auctioneer's voice sent a jolt through Evelyn. Her disbelieving eyes locked onto the display. How could this painting be here?

It was Alexander Durand's work. But he was already—

Tears welled in her eyes as she watched Adrian raise his bidding paddle.

When their gazes met, Adrian froze. He had never seen Evelyn cry before. The sight of her shattered expression sent an inexplicable pang through his chest.

Who was she crying for?

Evelyn swiftly composed herself, her focus snapping back to the painting. No matter why it had resurfaced, she couldn't let it fall into anyone else's hands.

She quickly texted her assistant Victoria Laurent in the back row: Win that painting at any cost.

The bid had already skyrocketed to ten million. Under Adrian's intimidating presence, no one dared to counter.

"Ten million going once... twice... Any further bids?" the auctioneer called out.
###Chapter 7

A bidding paddle rose abruptly from the last row of the auction hall.

Victoria Laurent's icy voice cut through the room. "Twenty million."

Adrian Valentine narrowed his eyes. "Thirty million."

Without hesitation, Victoria countered, "Fifty million."

Adrian's knuckles turned white. Who dared challenge him?

A dangerous smirk played on his lips. "One hundred million."

Evelyn Roland's fingers trembled slightly. Why was Adrian so persistent? Did he know the painting's secret?

She kept her gaze forward, expression unreadable.

Victoria raised her paddle again. "Two hundred million."

Adrian's brow furrowed. Who was this woman?

A one-hundred-million jump? Such audacity.

Isabella Langley tugged his sleeve. "Adrian, it's just a painting—"

He ignored her. That Renaissance masterpiece felt hauntingly familiar.

The auctioneer's voice shook with excitement. "Two hundred million going once... twice... sold!"

The gavel fell.

"Congratulations to bidder twenty-seven!"

Julian Roscente grinned triumphantly. The painting he'd acquired for two thousand now fetched a hundred thousand times its value.

Little did he know, he'd just lost a billion-dollar treasure.

Evelyn's shoulders relaxed slightly. Why had this missing masterpiece resurfaced after six years?

Pain flickered in her eyes. Alexander, I will avenge you.

When the next lot—a blue-and-white porcelain—was presented, Evelyn caught Julian's smug expression and smirked.

Five minutes later, the porcelain sold for one hundred million.

Finally, the star lot appeared—the Violette Diamond.

Its dazzling brilliance captivated the room.

Evelyn studied it. This ordinary-looking stone—why had her mentor been so obsessed?

The auctioneer announced, "Natural Violette Diamond from the Montagne Perdue, starting at fifty million!"

Gasps filled the hall.

Julian lounged with crossed legs, eyes gleaming.

Adrian's gaze lingered on Evelyn. Post-divorce, she radiated an even colder allure.

His jaw tightened. Had she already secured the Cortez family's backing?

Julian deliberately raised his voice. "Adrian, going all out for Isabella, aren't you?"

Evelyn's lashes fluttered. A sharp pang pierced her chest.

Isabella beamed. Would this diamond be hers?

Bidding skyrocketed to two hundred million.

Julian nudged Adrian impatiently. "Your move."
###Chapter 8

"Five hundred million."

Evelyn's crimson lips parted. "One billion."

Adrian's fingers paused mid-air as he turned to stare at her. "Evelyn, do you even know the rules?"

Jumping the bid by half a billion—she certainly didn't hesitate.

Her gaze remained icy, as if looking at a stranger. "No upper limit, right? Who's the one breaking rules here?"

His brow furrowed. "One point one billion."

Evelyn: "Two billion."

Adrian raised his paddle again, but Julian gripped his wrist.

"Adrian, if you go higher—"

"Hmph!" Adrian cut him off coldly. "Two point five billion."

Evelyn: "Three billion."

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

All eyes snapped toward Evelyn, only to see her aloof silhouette.

Adrian clenched his fists. This was blatant provocation.

Isabella's eyes widened. How could this backwater girl have such audacity?

Wait—where did she get that kind of money?

Evelyn became the instant center of attention.

This should have been Isabella's moment—proof of Adrian's devotion. Now Evelyn had stolen the spotlight.

She was deliberately ruining this for her.

Using someone else's money to show off? Disgusting.

A flame-bright smile curved Evelyn's lips.

Adrian's liquid assets barely topped ten billion. Against her resources? Ten of him wouldn't be enough.

That smile stunned Adrian. In his memories, she only smiled like that for him.

As he prepared to counter, Julian whispered urgently, "Don't be rash. The Sterling Manor heir has returned. Future collaborations matter more."

Adrian glanced at Evelyn, then gritted his teeth and yielded.

Isabella feigned concern. "Let her have it, Adrian. Don't spend so much for me."

Though furious, she prioritized long-term gains.

Evelyn was clearly baiting him—they couldn't take the hook.

The Violet Diamond sold for three billion.

After completing paperwork, Evelyn had bodyguards deliver the gem to the estate before heading alone to the parking garage.

Around the corner, Julian's voice carried.

She froze.

"Don't be upset, Bella. Next time we find a better jewel, I'll make sure Adrian buys it for you. You're all he sees now—there will be plenty of chances."

"That ice queen Evelyn can't compare to your adorable charm. If Adrian hadn't claimed you first, I'd have pursued you myself."

"Remember our bet that Adrian and Evelyn wouldn't last three years? Divorced right on schedule. You're his treasure now—Evelyn isn't fit to polish your shoes."

Evelyn's mouth twitched.

Julian really committed to his bootlicking role.

The Valentines always looked down on her for being the discarded country orphan mistakenly raised by the Langleys.

Little did they know—in her eyes, they were the trash.

"Julian, shut your mouth!"

Adrian's roar echoed.

"Did I lie? Thank God you cut losses early, or Bella would be mine now. That unsophisticated Evelyn—good riddance. You didn't even dare announce the marriage. Suffocated for a whole year, didn't you?"

Julian always suspected Evelyn hid secrets.

Under her clear gaze, he felt like exposed scum.

"You—"

Adrian suddenly stiffened, staring past them.

Evelyn stepped into view.
###Chapter 9

Julian's pupils constricted violently.

Evelyn?!

How could she be at the auction?

His Adam's apple bobbed as cold sweat broke across his back.

The cigar slipped silently from his fingers.

Adrian's gaze shifted, landing on Evelyn's pale face.

The air froze solid between them.

"Evelyn..." Julian's voice trembled.

Her crimson lips curved into a mocking smile.

"An explanation?" Her fingers brushed stray hairs behind her ear. "About how you called me a wooden doll? Or that I'm not fit to polish Isabella's shoes?"

Julian's face drained of color.

"The porcelain vases..." He suddenly remembered.

Evelyn gave a light laugh. "The second piece was a fake. The glaze was too new."

She turned toward the emergency exit.

Elevators made her nauseous since the pregnancy began.

Adrian's stare burned into her back.

So this was why he'd kept her hidden.

A sharp ache pierced her chest.

"Mr. Roscente!" An assistant rushed over in panic. "The buyer discovered issues with the porcelain!"

Isabella's smile froze.

She reached to comfort Julian, but Adrian had vanished.

"Father, I have the documents," she whispered into her phone. "Evelyn will take the fall."

The underground parking garage's fluorescent lights glared harshly.

Evelyn's fingers barely touched the car door when an iron grip seized her wrist.

Adrian pinned her against the vehicle.

"Who is Sebastian?" His thumb traced a fresh mark above her collarbone.

She struggled violently.

His scorching breath seared her ear. "You're not leaving until you answer."
###Chapter 10

Evelyn Roland shot Adrian Valentine a cold glare. "We're over. Who I'm with is none of your business."

"Take your hands off me."

Adrian's lips curled into a sinister smirk, though his tone remained lazy. "Evelyn, are you that desperate? The divorce isn't even finalized, and you're already looking for your next man. Don't pretend you didn't betray me."

"Don't project your filth onto everyone else," Evelyn said coolly. Her fingers pressed precisely against a pressure point on his wrist. "You only married me because of a bet with your friends. Must have been such a burden for you this past year."

A flicker of pain crossed her eyes before she abruptly twisted her grip.

A sharp numbness shot through Adrian's wrist, forcing him to release her.

Frowning, he watched her walk away, an unfamiliar ache settling in his chest.

Her hands had always seemed delicate—how could they hold such strength?

Evelyn had changed.

She was no longer someone he could read.

Inside her speeding car, Evelyn clenched the steering wheel.

Betrayal?

She scoffed.

Typical Adrian—accusing her of the very thing he was guilty of.

Neon lights flickered across her face through the window, casting shifting shadows.

A month had passed.

She still couldn’t figure out where their marriage had gone wrong.

Her phone rang abruptly.

"Sweetheart."

"Grandfather." Her voice was rough.

"I secured the Violet Diamond—just in time for your birthday." His tone was warm. "I’ve commissioned the finest jeweler to craft a set for you."

Evelyn arched a brow lazily. "You’re sure it’s clean? I’d rather not wear it and end up with a target on my back."

"Brat!" He laughed. "Spent half my life building a name, the other half trying to scrub it clean, and you still won’t let me live it down."

"This diamond is special. If you’ve claimed it, you know what it means."

His voice turned serious. "The four-year agreement has ended. From today, Sterling Manor is yours. It’s time for this old man to step back—don’t make me regret it."

Evelyn’s fingers stilled. "Grandfather… do you want a great-grandchild?"

"Hm?" He caught the shift in her tone instantly. "That sounds like a breakup. Let me guess—the man’s an idiot. My granddaughter is stunning, brilliant, and comes from one of the most powerful families. What more could he want?"

Evelyn sighed.

"It’s just a man!" he boomed. "Come home and reclaim your place as the heiress. Give it a few years, and every eligible bachelor in Vienna will be lining up for you."

She massaged her temples.

The old man was getting too modern for his own good.

"Oh," he added, lowering his voice. "That unconscious man you sent back last month… he wouldn’t happen to be the father, would he?"
###Chapter 11

Evelyn thought her grandfather's imagination was running wild.

That had merely been an accident months ago.

How could it possibly have gotten her pregnant?

The corners of her lips curled into a meaningful smile.

"Grandfather, he's not the father. But Sterling Manor will soon have an heir. You should be happy."

The old man snorted. "To be worthy of inheriting Sterling Manor, they'd need at least half your talent."

Evelyn chuckled. "Any child of mine will surpass me."

"If that's true, this old man can close his eyes in peace."

He said it half-jokingly.

Evelyn's expression darkened instantly. "If you keep talking like that, I won't speak to you for a year."

In this world, her grandfather was her only remaining family.

"Silly girl, at my age, it's inevitable. You've rested long enough—return to the company tomorrow."

Evelyn had already planned to.

There were still scum to deal with. The truth about her origins was known only to the Langleys.

And her feud with Isabella needed to be settled.

"Don't worry, Grandfather. The core technology for NovaCore is perfected. I'll handle everything."

His tone turned grave. "Your return will make many people nervous. Be careful."

She understood perfectly. During her four-year absence, she hadn't been idle.

"Don't worry. I'll outlive every last one of them."

"You!" The old man burst into laughter.

After hanging up, Evelyn drove back to Regal Heights.

Regal Heights stood opposite Sterling Manor—both were her properties.

Passing a shopping district, she decided to pick up some necessities.

Her wardrobe was filled with outdated styles from four years ago. Maternity clothes were also needed.

The baby was already four months along. It was time for a checkup.

Entering her brand's flagship store, the manager Sophia Blanchet gaped in shock.

"B-Boss?"

Evelyn lazily arched a brow. "Long time no see."

Sophia's eyes reddened. "Three years! I thought you'd never come back!"

She rushed forward and hugged Evelyn tightly.

"Just went away to train." Evelyn patted her back lightly. "But I'm back now."

"You're staying, right?" Sophia stared at her anxiously.

Amused by her pitiful expression, Evelyn smiled. "I'm staying. I'll officially resume my position in a few days."

"Thank goodness!" Sophia wiped her tears. "I'll pack all the new arrivals for you."

She couldn't resist complaining. "This place is too small. There's no room to work properly."

Evelyn understood immediately. "I'll send for you in three days. You and Zachary will work directly under me. Victoria's team will provide covert security."

Sophia nodded excitedly. Finally, she could truly shine.

Just then, a sharp female voice cut through the air from the entrance.

"Miss Langley, what an unpleasant surprise."
###Chapter 12

Evelyn glanced toward the entrance, her phoenix eyes narrowing with a flicker of cunning. She leaned close to Sophia's ear, whispering just loud enough for them both to hear. "Our money bags just arrived. You know what to do?"

Sophia's lips curved into a knowing smile.

"Understood," she murmured in response.

Evelyn casually pointed at the new collection displayed on the mannequins. "I'll take all of these."

"Of course, Miss Roland." Sophia instantly switched to her professional smile, bowing slightly.

She signaled the other sales associates with a subtle glance, directing them to attend to Isabella and Adrian who had just entered.

Evelyn's gaze inadvertently met Adrian's.

Her eyes remained calm as still water, while his held unfathomable depths.

She quickly averted her eyes, her expression cooling into its usual indifference. Even if she still loved this man, she would never let it show.

Isabella noticed their exchanged glances and immediately clung to Adrian's arm, throwing Evelyn a challenging look. "Miss Roland made quite a splash at the auction. Now you're sweeping up K's new collection? Your man must be very generous." Her voice dripped with envy.

Evelyn smiled serenely. "Isn't it natural for my man to treat me well?"

A sharp glare immediately pierced through her.

She didn't need to look to know it came from Adrian.

He turned to Isabella with gentle eyes, his voice low. "Isabella, I couldn't get you that violet diamond earlier. Buy whatever you like. The woman of Adrian Valentine deserves only the best."

Isabella beamed with delight, shooting Evelyn a triumphant look.

Evelyn lowered her lashes. Such treatment was something she had never experienced.

Adrian had never publicly acknowledged her as his woman.

His cold gaze swept over Evelyn, and seeing her unaffected expression only fueled his anger.

Evelyn smirked inwardly. The difference between being loved and unloved was this stark.

"Adrian, I couldn't possibly let you spend so much," Isabella demurred, though her greedy eyes scanned the boutique's offerings. "But a woman can never have too many clothes. I'll take everything here."

Adrian wordlessly produced his black card. "Charge it."

Sophia feigned hesitation. "Sir, those pieces over there have already been selected by this lady."

Adrian smirked. "I'll pay double."

Sophia pretended to look uncertainly at Evelyn.

Evelyn let her gaze linger on Adrian's handsome face for a moment before curling her lips in derision. "Let them have it. I don't fight over scraps with homewreckers and rabid dogs. It's beneath me."

"What did you say?" Isabella trembled with rage. "Adrian, I'm not—"

She buried her face in Adrian's chest in feigned distress.

Sophia rolled her eyes internally. Such an Oscar-worthy performance.

Adrian's eyes darkened dangerously. "Watch your tongue, Miss Roland."

Evelyn arched a brow, her phoenix eyes radiating dominance. "Did I say anything untrue?"

"Evelyn!" Adrian exploded, his hand shooting out to grip her throat, murder flashing in his eyes. "You're asking for death!"

Evelyn gasped for air, but in his eyes she saw only her own hatred reflected back.

"Let... go..." she choked out.

Sophia's expression turned icy as she instantly moved to strike Adrian.
###Chapter 13

Adrian Valentine released his grip, a flicker of remorse flashing in his eyes.

Five distinct bruises marred Evelyn Roland's pale neck.

"Cough... cough..." She gasped for air, her lungs burning with each ragged breath.

Her heart felt pierced by a blade.

This man was truly merciless.

Only his cruelty could shatter her completely.

Leaning against Sophia Blanchet, Evelyn's gaze turned glacial.

Adrian stepped closer again.

His slender fingers gripped her chin, forcing her to meet his eyes. "Evelyn, remember this—what we had was never real. If you dare show your face again, I'll destroy you."

The farther she stayed, the better.

Evelyn's lips curled, but dark flames smoldered in her eyes.

She wrenched free, agony radiating through her chest. "Adrian Valentine, I'll return your pain tenfold."

Hatred churned in her gaze.

Adrian's knuckles whitened as he suppressed his emotions. "Try me."

A mocking smile played on his lips.

Her only weakness had been their past love.

Evelyn retrieved a wipe from her bag, meticulously cleaning where he'd touched her.

As if scrubbing away filth.

Adrian's expression darkened. "You think you're so pure? Weren't you living it up while I was gone?"

Evelyn stiffened. "What are you implying?"

Isabella Langley cut in sweetly, "Adrian, didn't you promise to buy me a gift?"

She hid her satisfaction.

Their enmity suited her perfectly.

Adrian tossed a card at Sophia. "Wrap everything."

Sophia snatched it angrily.

Evelyn gave her a calming look.

Isabella feigned remorse. "Sorry for taking your dress, Evelyn."

Evelyn smirked. "It suits you—just like that fake innocence."

Malice flickered in Isabella's eyes.

She'd never lost a game of deception.

Evelyn strode away without looking back.

Adrian's words gnawed at her.

He'd changed after returning from Eastalia four months ago.

Now he dared accuse her?

In the car, Evelyn texted Nathan Aldridge:
[Investigate Adrian's Eastalia trip four months ago.]

Nathan replied instantly: [On it.]

After grocery shopping at Regal Heights, Nathan called.

"Boss, Adrian's Eastalia records were wiped clean."

Evelyn frowned. "How?"

"Someone went to great lengths to cover it up."

Sunlight blazed outside.

No matter. Adrian meant nothing to her now.

Hanging up, she dialed Victoria Laurent. "Bring the painting."
###Chapter 14

Victoria's voice came through the phone. "Miss, I'm at the door now."

Evelyn gave a brief acknowledgment before hanging up.

She placed the freshly bought groceries on the marble countertop.

Her throat burned with pain, and her jaw ached faintly.

Slender fingers brushed against her neck as she caught her reflection in the mirror—her gaze icy and detached.

Adrian had been ruthless. But what was a little pain?

She took a deep breath, her expression turning colder.

She had weathered countless storms over the years. She had even tasted love.

From now on, men could stay far away. Nothing would stand in her path to becoming a billionaire.

Half a glass of warm water soothed the hollow ache in her chest.

She had thought her heart wouldn't hurt anymore. Yet the pain still cut deep.

With practiced efficiency, Evelyn sorted the groceries into the fridge and began braising the beef.

Moments later, Victoria walked in.

Everyone around Evelyn had been meticulously selected.

The women were stunningly beautiful, the men tall and striking.

Superior genes, exceptional skills.

These were the elites she had trained since childhood.

At twenty-four, Victoria stood at five-foot-eight, her oval face framed by expressive eyes.

Full lips, pearly teeth, and an aura of cool elegance—she exuded the confidence of a queen.

Evelyn, in contrast, was more reserved, her thoughts as deep and unfathomable as the ocean.

She cherished solitude and trusted few.

Apart from the companions who had grown up with her, she showed no mercy to her enemies.

Their eyes met, and Victoria immediately spotted the bruise on Evelyn's neck.

"Miss, what happened to your neck?" Victoria's voice simmered with suppressed anger.

Evelyn's lips curved slightly. "It's nothing. Victoria, I'm pregnant. From now on, you'll stay here to take care of me. Hire reliable cleaners and gardeners for regular upkeep. Just the two of us will live here."

Victoria's gaze dropped to Evelyn's flat stomach in shock.

"Miss, did someone hurt you? Tell me who it was. We'll make them pay." Her gentle tone was laced with concern.

For the first time, a faint smile touched Evelyn's lips. "Let the past stay in the past. The pregnancy must remain a secret. When the child turns three, they'll be sent to the training camp."

Victoria understood immediately.

"Welcome back, Miss. We've been waiting for you." A genuine smile spread across Victoria's face.

Warmth seeped into Evelyn's frozen heart. "I'm going to rest. Call me when the beef is ready."

Victoria carefully escorted her upstairs, tucked her in, and turned on the humidifier before leaving.

Pregnancy made Evelyn unusually drowsy.

She slept straight through until dawn.

Hunger finally woke her.

By the time she freshened up and went downstairs, Victoria had breakfast ready.

"You were sleeping so soundly, I didn't want to wake you last night." Victoria, dressed in professional attire, smiled warmly.

Evelyn nodded, remembering the years she had spent waking up early to prepare breakfast for Adrian.

Back then, she had done it willingly—out of love.

Now, the thought only made her scoff.

She motioned for Victoria to join her at the table.

After breakfast, Evelyn got down to business. "You and Zachary will be my covert operatives. Investigate Alexander's case. The Renaissance Masterpiece appearing here means the mastermind will make a move soon. Stay alert."

"Sophia and Nathan will be my public assistants."

Victoria approved of the arrangement. Sophia was eloquent, and Nathan was a top-tier hacker.

"No objections here." Victoria grinned.

Evelyn was about to speak when her phone rang.

The caller ID made her expression darken instantly.
###Chapter 15

"Evelyn Roland!"

The man's voice on the phone was icy enough to freeze bone marrow. "You've got some nerve stealing Horizon Tech's trade secrets. Is this your pathetic revenge because I left you?"

Evelyn's fingers trembled. A chill crawled up her spine.

"What nonsense are you spouting at this hour? I wouldn't touch your company's worthless files even if they were handed to me for free."

"Melanie Evans has confessed. She said you ordered her to steal the documents." Adrian Valentine's voice dripped venom. "We have proof—a million-dollar transfer to her account. Return everything within the hour, or else—"

The call ended with a violent click.

Victoria Laurent handed her a steaming cup of tea. "Miss..."

Evelyn stood abruptly, her eyes glinting with frost. "Contact Nathan. I want every detail of Melanie's recent movements. And get Sophia here in ten minutes."

She turned and strode upstairs to change.

When she descended, Sophia Blanchet's car was already idling outside. Evelyn had shed her disguise, her porcelain skin glowing coldly under the sunlight.

"Boss, you were undercover at Horizon Tech?" Sophia gripped the steering wheel.

Evelyn watched the blur of passing scenery. "For a year."

That marriage had been a nightmare.

Sophia slammed the wheel. "Who the hell does Horizon think they are? Accusing you of stealing their plans?"

The car screeched to a halt outside Horizon Tech's headquarters.

Nathan's report arrived simultaneously. Evelyn scanned the screen and dialed Adrian. "Bring your people down here. Now."

"You want a public confrontation?"

"Scared?" Her laugh was razor-sharp. "Perfect. Let everyone see how the great Adrian Valentine frames his ex-wife."

Five minutes later, the revolving doors disgorged a crowd.

Adrian led the pack, his tailored suit accentuating broad shoulders and a narrow waist. Isabella Langley clung to his arm, her face a mask of faux distress.

"Miss Roland," she said, voice quivering, "do you have any idea how important this project is to Adrian? Stealing corporate secrets is a crime..."
###Chapter 16

"Thief?" Sophia Blanchet sneered, her red lips curling in mockery. "Miss Langley, how ironic to hear that from the real culprit. If my boss wanted your pathetic little secrets, she wouldn't need to steal them."

Isabella Langley stared at Sophia's striking face, her nails digging into her palms. This woman was even more beautiful than her.

"Who do you think you are?" Isabella's voice tightened.

Sophia laughed, the sharp tilt of her eyes like a blade. "Who I am doesn’t matter. What matters is that if you dare slander my boss, I’ll make you kneel and apologize."

Isabella's face darkened. Since aligning herself with Adrian Valentine, no one had dared speak to her like this.

Adrian was now the undisputed power in Vienna. In just a few years, he had dominated both the legitimate and underground worlds. His name alone struck fear into hearts.

"Evelyn," Isabella forced down her rage, casting a disdainful glance at Evelyn Roland. "Don’t tell me you’ve picked up some lowlife as your boss now. Typical of a country bumpkin."

Sophia and Evelyn had indeed grown up in an orphanage. But they knew better than anyone—true class wasn’t about birthright.

"Frog in a well," Sophia scoffed.

"Enough." Adrian's deep voice cut through the tension.

His gaze, sharp as a blade, locked onto Evelyn, who had remained silent. "The surveillance shows Melanie handed you files containing our new product details. The evidence is clear. Still denying it?"

Betrayal was one thing. But stealing company secrets? Did she really think so little of him?

Evelyn finally looked up, meeting his disgusted stare. Her heart clenched as if gripped by an invisible hand. "So, you’ve already decided it’s me?"

"Not decided. It’s fact." His tone was ice. "This is theft."

Every word was a poisoned arrow, piercing her anew. Why did it still hurt so much? Why couldn’t she just grow numb?

"Bullshit!" Sophia exploded. "All that pretty packaging and still full of trash! Theft? Really?"

She had protected Evelyn since they were kids. No one got to humiliate her like this.

Isabella shot Melanie a subtle glance.

Melanie stepped forward. "Director Roland, here’s our chat history. You instructed me to steal the files. There’s even the million-dollar transfer in my account. I’ve worked at Valentine Corp for two years—my conscience couldn’t take it anymore. That’s why I confessed to Mr. Valentine."

The air froze.

An invisible pressure radiated from Evelyn.

"Gratitude?" Evelyn chuckled. "My phone’s been off for a month. How did I instruct you? And how do you know that million came from me?"

"It was you!" Melanie retorted boldly. "You were fired and wanted revenge!"

Evelyn glanced at Sophia.

Understanding, Sophia pulled out her phone. "Melanie, here’s footage of you stealing the files. But you didn’t give them to Evelyn—you sold them to Hales. Couldn’t even trace that, Mr. Valentine?"

The video played clearly for all to see—Melanie exchanging documents with a foreigner.

Melanie paled.

Adrian’s eyes darkened. The footage was undeniable.

Isabella’s pulse jumped. "This is obviously fake! How desperate are you to clear your name, Miss Roland?"

"Get your eyes checked." Sophia gave her a mocking once-over. "If your brain’s defective, stay home. You think you could fake something like this?"

Isabella trembled with rage. She’d never met anyone so vulgar.

"You—you’re utterly uncivilized!" Her face flushed crimson, but she dared not swear in front of Adrian.
###Chapter 17

Sophia saw right through Isabella's act.

The fake innocence worked on men, but not on her.

"The evidence is staring you in the face. If you can't even tell what's real, this company might as well shut down."

Sophia never minced words.

"Valentine Group won't collapse!"

Isabella clung to Adrian's arm, shooting Evelyn a venomous glare.

Her plan had been flawless. How did Evelyn get the evidence?

No matter. She'd already leaked the story about Evelyn stealing company secrets online.

This time, Evelyn would be ruined.

Some secrets must stay buried forever.

Adrian would be hers.

Evelyn met Adrian's gaze calmly. "Mr. Valentine, will you clear my name now?"

Sophia cut in first. "You've gone too far. Our boss did nothing wrong, yet you smeared her online. Since you show no mercy, don't expect any in return."

Adrian frowned. Who leaked this so quickly?

Isabella's eyes gleamed with malice. Just wait, Evelyn.

Evelyn opened her phone.

The hashtag #ExValentineEmployeeEvelynRolandStoleTradeSecrets trended at the top.

The comments were a cesspool of vitriol.

Her fingers turned icy. Even after leaving, Adrian wouldn't let her go.

Her heart ached as if sliced by a dull blade.

"Adrian, must you destroy me completely?" Her laugh was hollow. Even divorced, he still tormented her.

Seeing the deadness in her eyes, Adrian felt an inexplicable restlessness in his chest.

She was erasing him from her heart. The realization unsettled him.

But memories of her betrayal and Christian's death hardened him again.

"Sophia, release Melanie's video. If Valentine Group slanders me again, I'll fight back."

Evelyn turned to leave.

Sophia immediately contacted Nathan to handle the footage.

She threw Adrian a scornful look. "Mr. Valentine, your intellect is as barren as the Sahara. I wonder how Valentine Group thrived all these years."

How much of it was actually Evelyn's doing?

Adrian's fists clenched, a storm brewing in his eyes.

With a cold laugh, Sophia followed Evelyn.

Adrian turned to Melanie, his voice glacial. "The video is authentic. Turn yourself in."

Melanie paled. "I'm sorry," she whispered before stumbling away.

Isabella's smile vanished. Her meticulously crafted trap had been dismantled.

If Adrian investigated further...

"Adrian, what about the new product launch? Will this hurt the company?" she feigned concern.

Adrian's lips curled dangerously. "Those who touch what's mine will pay the price."

A chill ran down Isabella's spine.

Adrian watched Evelyn's retreating figure. She'd shed all softness, becoming an unapproachable iceberg.

Just as Evelyn reached her car, Julian suddenly appeared, blocking her path.
###Chapter 18

Evelyn gave Julian a cold glance, her irritation growing at the sight of his charming face.

Her delicate features were frozen in frost, radiating an aura that warned others to keep their distance.

"Julian, what do you want?"

He narrowed his peach-blossom eyes, studying her with curiosity. "Evelyn, how do you know so much about antique appraisal?"

At the auction, she had instantly spotted the counterfeit blue-and-white porcelain—something even the experts hired by the old master had missed.

This version of Evelyn unsettled him.

As a seasoned playboy, he feared women who hid their depths.

The corner of Evelyn's lips curved slightly. "Guess."

Her smile was breathtakingly beautiful, yet it sent a chill down Julian's spine.

"Heh..." He leaned closer, catching the faint, unique fragrance of her perfume.

"Evelyn, you look stunning when you smile. Tell me, how did you spot the flaw in that porcelain?"

For once, his usual carefree expression was gone.

A glint of mischief flashed in Evelyn's eyes. "I won't tell you."

Her voice was soft as a feather, yet carried a lethal allure.

Julian froze, his heart skipping a beat.

Evelyn frowned and took a step back, convinced this man had something wrong with his head.

"Evelyn, now that you're divorced from Adrian, let me pursue you?" Julian blurted out.

She scoffed. "Didn't someone say I was as dull as wood and swore he'd chase Isabella? Your heart changes faster than flipping a page, Julian."

He stiffened.

Right. He had always preferred gentle, sweet women like Isabella.

This thorny rose before him was dangerous.

He hastily retreated.

Evelyn coldly pulled open the car door.

Suddenly, a slender hand landed on Julian's shoulder.

"So you're the one who called my sister stupid?"

He turned and met a pair of striking, defiant eyes. Instantly intrigued, he grinned. "What's your name, beautiful? I'm Julian Roscente—"

Sophia smirked and kicked him hard.

"You're not worthy of knowing my name."

"Ah!" Julian groaned, doubling over in pain.

"Pathetic. Can't even handle a little pain, yet you dare insult people?" Sophia looked down at him disdainfully. "Find a hole to crawl into and spare the world your embarrassment."

With that, she got into the car and sped off.

Julian clutched his stomach, his face twisted in agony and fury.

He had just been humiliated by a woman—and left speechless!

"What are you doing here?" Adrian's icy voice came from behind.

Julian forced himself upright, his expression dark. "That woman hit like a truck..."

Gritting his teeth, he added, "Adrian, that blue-and-white porcelain was fake. Do you have any idea how much we lost?"
###Chapter 19

Adrian Valentine's slender fingers tapped rhythmically against the desk, his eyes glinting with danger. "Your father spent a fortune on that fake antique overseas. Shouldn't you be questioning the old man instead of harassing Evelyn?"

"Do you think I want to be here?" Julian Roscente ran a frustrated hand through his hair. "She took one look at that blue-and-white porcelain and knew it was counterfeit. Since when did your ex-wife know about antiques? Were you aware of this?"

The family patriarch had sent him to consult Evelyn, but with no way to reach her, Julian had no choice but to confront Adrian for her contact details. He hadn't expected to run into her here.

Adrian's gaze darkened. The post-divorce Evelyn kept revealing unfamiliar facets of herself. An antique connoisseur? This was news to him.

"Julian." His voice turned glacial. "Stay away from Evelyn."

Julian's pulse stuttered as he recalled their brief encounter earlier. He'd always despised Evelyn—so why had his heart raced at the sight of her?

"You're divorced now," he drawled with forced nonchalance. "A woman that stunning? Any man would be tempted. If you're not interested in Isabella, maybe I'll pursue her instead."

Adrian's glare could flay skin. "Any updates on the Sterling Manor heiress?"

Julian sobered instantly. "The young mistress just returned after four years abroad. She controls all operations in Eastalia. Rumor says she earned multiple doctorates by eighteen, but she's reclusive—rarely makes public appearances."

A frown creased Adrian's brow. Some elusive clue danced just beyond his grasp.

"What?" Julian smirked. "Hearing about this formidable woman piqued your interest already?"

A lethal glint flashed in Adrian's eyes. "Shut it. Remember what I said—keep your distance from Evelyn."

Julian suppressed a shudder. For a moment, he'd genuinely sensed murderous intent radiating from Adrian.

"By the way," he ventured, "the news claims your ex-wife stole company secrets—"

The temperature in the room plummeted. So Adrian had mistaken the culprit.

Julian scrolled through his phone and blinked in surprise. "Melanie Evans took the files? Netizens are calling this the fastest public humiliation ever. Adrian, a ruthless CEO isn't scary—what's terrifying is becoming the laughingstock yourself."

"Get out."

Julian wisely made his exit.

Inside the car, Evelyn regained her composure.

Melanie's timid nature didn't align with someone bold enough to steal documents and frame another. Something about this didn't add up.

"Sophia," she instructed, "after dropping me home, investigate Melanie Evans."
###Chapter 20

Sophia Blanchet kept her eyes on the road and nodded. "Understood, boss. I'll dig up everything about her. What about the company...?"

Evelyn Roland's fingers brushed her abdomen. Soon, her pregnancy would become visible. If Adrian Valentine discovered it, he would never let this child live.

She knew better than anyone how ruthless that man could be.

There was no turning back between them now. This baby must be born safely—hers alone.

"Have all documents delivered to Regal Heights. Starting today, I'll work from there. Nathan Aldridge will serve as the public CEO, and you'll be my executive assistant. Issue the announcement on the corporate website tomorrow."

Sophia's eyes sparkled. After three years of waiting, her moment had finally arrived.

She could practically see fireworks exploding in her mind, even the toilet seat at home glowing with promise.

"Boss, I've been waiting for this!" Sophia grinned like a villain.

Evelyn's voice remained calm. "Tell Nathan to send over all company records."

Though she had been pulling the strings behind the scenes for years, a few stubborn old-timers still resisted. To them, a young woman would never be fit to lead.

Fine. She would remain an enigma.

Sophia practically vibrated with excitement. "Consider it done!"

Upon returning to Regal Heights, Evelyn walked alone to the rear estate.

Beyond the main mansion, two smaller buildings stood a kilometer away.

She headed straight for the basement.

The moment the secured door opened, a woman stood at attention. "Miss Roland."

Evelyn gave a slight nod. "How is Christian Lefèvre today?"

Gabrielle Flores flashed a dimpled smile. "No change. It's been the same for four months."

On the hospital bed, Christian lay motionless.

Soft light illuminated his pale, handsome features. His long lashes cast shadows beneath closed eyes, oblivious to the world.

Evelyn's chest tightened.

During the fire, she had rescued Adrian first before going back for Christian. But when she returned, Adrian had already vanished.

With Christian clinging to life, she had no choice but to secretly bring him back to the country. Pursued by assassins, she had to leverage Sterling Manor's connections to operate in the shadows.

Christian had briefly regained consciousness, warning her that someone wanted him dead—even Adrian couldn't be trusted.

Only then did she realize the fire had been a plot against Christian. Adrian had merely been a pawn.

After their return, Isabella Langley appeared at Adrian's side.

He would never know she had been the one to save him that day.

The memory of his cold eyes sent a sharp pang through her heart.

"Gabrielle, perform an ultrasound for me," she said abruptly. "I'm pregnant. I haven't had it checked yet."

Going to an outside hospital was too risky. Adrian would find out.

"What?!" Gabrielle's eyes widened.

Evelyn was already walking toward the examination room. "Sterling Manor needs an heir."

Gabrielle hurried after her, instantly understanding. Her voice trembled with excitement. "Miss Roland, how far along are you?"
###Chapter 21

Evelyn slowly lay down and murmured, "Almost four months now."

It was the last night before Adrian left the country. He had held her close until midnight, whispering sweet nothings about how he couldn't bear to be apart from her.

That was the night she conceived.

A flicker of pain crossed Evelyn's eyes as she closed them, allowing Gabrielle to examine her. She had sensed it during her own pulse check but needed confirmation.

Gabrielle carefully lifted Evelyn's shirt, applied the ultrasound gel, and focused on the screen.

After a moment, Gabrielle's eyes welled up. "M-Miss Roland... it's twins."

Evelyn's eyes flew open. Just as she suspected. The confirmation sent an irrepressible wave of joy through her.

She sat up, wiping off the gel, and smiled—a rare sight. "Thank you, Gabrielle. Keep this between us for now."

Gabrielle nodded eagerly. "Of course. Biweekly checkups—I can't wait to meet them."

Neither could Evelyn. The pain Adrian had inflicted dulled slightly at the thought of her babies.

After preparing her acupuncture kit, Evelyn checked Christian's pulse. No change. His brain injury and internal damage had healed, but only time would tell if he woke.

Post-treatment, Evelyn instructed, "Play news broadcasts daily. Monitor his brain activity and update me immediately."

Gabrielle agreed. "Understood. I noticed Victoria's back—may I visit her?"

Evelyn nodded. "From now on, take meals in the main house. Look out for each other."

"Perfect!" Gabrielle beamed.

Evelyn carried her medical case back to the main residence.

Elsewhere, Isabella frantically dialed her father.

"Dad, Evelyn cleared her name. We deleted Melanie's surveillance footage—how did she recover it?"

Their tech team swore it was unrecoverable. Where had Evelyn gotten that video?

"Relax. Adrian won't trace it to us. Your priority is marrying him and becoming Mrs. Valentine."

Isabella exhaled in relief. As long as they weren't exposed.

"Isabella, what are you doing?" A cold voice cut through the air.

She spun around to face Adrian's icy gaze. His towering frame radiated danger.

Remembering her call, she suppressed a shiver.

"Adrian! What brings you here?" She forced a smile, linking her arm through his.

He glanced at her hand dismissively. "There's a gala tonight. You'll accompany me."

Isabella lit up. "Of course! I'll get ready right away. You're so good to me—I love you."

Sunlight outlined his sharp profile as he responded flatly, "Hmm."

His indifference stung, but she masked her disappointment.

Evelyn napped briefly at home.

Pregnancy had made her drowsy.

Descending in the afternoon, Victoria handed her an envelope.

"Miss Roland, this is your invitation to the Tri-Nation Business Summit. The Chairman expects your attendance. It starts at eight—Nathan will handle the arrangements."

Evelyn accepted it lazily. "Has Sophia returned yet?"
###Chapter 22

Evelyn glanced at her wristwatch. "She should be home soon. That girl never misses a meal."

Sophia's lips curved slightly. "True."

"Miss, let's have dinner first." Victoria guided her toward the dining room.

Under the crystal chandelier, Evelyn took her seat. Her gaze lingered on the plate of braised beef glistening with rich sauce. This dish had once been Adrian's favorite too.

Her chopsticks hovered midair. Why did that heartless man keep invading her thoughts?

She closed her eyes briefly. How much longer would it take to erase these memories completely?

Evelyn lowered her lashes, the thick fringe masking the storm in her eyes.

The beef melted on her tongue, its savory flavor blooming. Victoria's cooking was impeccable as always.

Just as dinner ended, Sophia burst into the living room. "Boss! Melanie Evans won't crack. She insists it was all her idea and says she regrets failing."

"Since when do criminals brag about their crimes?" Sophia plopped into the chair opposite Evelyn.

Evelyn tapped the table lightly. There was more to this story.

"Found something. She has a brother on dialysis who just got a kidney match. And guess what? A million dollars appeared in her account yesterday." Sophia slapped a file onto the table.

Evelyn flipped through the documents, her gaze turning icy. "Verified at the hospital?"

"Absolutely! Boss, this is clearly a hired hit!" Sophia smacked the table in frustration.

"Quite the coincidence." Evelyn shut the file. "Trace the money tomorrow. If we hit a dead end..." A dangerous glint flashed in her eyes. "We'll use her brother as leverage."

An eye for an eye—that was her philosophy.

Sophia rubbed her hands eagerly. "When diplomacy fails, bring out the big guns! Let's see who blinks first." Her grin was downright foxy.

Evelyn smiled faintly. Life was never dull with this firecracker around.

As neon lights illuminated the city, luxury cars crowded the entrance of Imperial Palace Hotel.

Sophia suddenly clutched her stomach. "Wait up, Boss!" She bolted toward the restroom.

Evelyn stood alone in the gilded lobby. Tonight's gathering of a thousand business elites meant nothing to her—she'd already handpicked five projects. This was merely a formality.

Then she turned—and froze.

Adrian walked in arm-in-arm with Isabella, both dressed in matching designer outfits, the picture-perfect couple.

Evelyn's breath hitched. She quickly averted her gaze. An invisible fist squeezed her heart.

Isabella's eyes widened. What was Evelyn doing at an event of this caliber?
###Chapter 23

Evelyn's crimson lips curved slightly. "What business is it of yours where I am?"

Her lashes remained lowered, deliberately avoiding Adrian's piercing gaze.

His eyes raked over her flawless makeup like a blade. From the delicate arch of her brows to the plump curve of her lips—every feature was breathtaking.

The black gown hugged her curves, every detail exuding impeccable taste.

With Sebastian's backing, she moved through these elite circles with effortless grace. The once-plain woman now radiated dazzling brilliance.

A chilling aura emanated from Adrian. His usual careless demeanor had vanished completely.

Isabella instantly noticed the change in the man beside her. Since Adrian clearly despised Evelyn, there was no need for pretense.

She lifted her chin haughtily. "Evelyn, I nearly forgot. Now that you've latched onto Sebastian Cortez, you can go wherever you please. Is the great Mr. Cortez gracing us tonight?"

Adrian needed to discuss business with Sterling Manor. Securing Sebastian's support would elevate her status in Adrian's eyes.

With her beauty, seducing Sebastian would be child's play.

Evelyn smirked. "You want to see Sebastian?"

Isabella glanced at Adrian, but his expression remained unreadable.

"Miss Roland, Adrian's business could use a boost. As his ex-wife, why not introduce him to Mr. Cortez?"

Evelyn nearly laughed aloud.

The audacity.

Mocking amusement danced in her eyes. "Isabella, everyone says Adrian adores you, yet you don't understand him at all. He built his empire through sheer ability. Asking him to rely on his ex-wife's connections? That's a slap in his face."

"Besides, if you could bewitch a man like Adrian, Sebastian Cortez should be easy prey."

Isabella's face darkened.

Adrian cut in coldly, "I don't need favors."

Evelyn didn't back down. "And I have no interest in humiliating myself."

Adrian's fury burned. The woman before him stood like black ice—her luminous eyes sharp as daggers.

Evelyn was stunningly beautiful and brilliant. But the shadow in her gaze seemed deeper than before.

What more could she possibly want, now that she had Sebastian?

"Evelyn, can't exes be friends?" Isabella taunted. She wanted Adrian to see how uncouth this country bumpkin really was.

"Friends?" Evelyn nearly choked on the absurdity. Remaining friends after such betrayal? Delusional.

How could two people who'd hurt each other ever interact without resentment?

Her icy gaze swept over Adrian. "A decent ex should vanish like the dead. Seeing trash like you two makes me sick."

"Do I lack friends so badly that I'd choose garbage?"

"Evelyn!" Adrian's handsome face twisted with rage, murder flashing in his eyes.

Must she be so vicious?

He'd never realized how sharp her tongue could be.

Evelyn gave him a disdainful look. "Want me dead? Adrian, what unspeakable crime did I commit to deserve your hatred?"

She took a deep breath, her gaze clear as moonlight. "Pity. My life's worth more than you can afford."

Without another word, she turned and walked away.
###Chapter 24

Adrian Valentine's gaze darkened like an abyss as he watched the retreating silhouette. His knuckles turned white from clenching his fists, suppressing the urge to chase after her.

The figure moved with the grace of a painting, yet carried an air of untouchable distance.

Isabella Langley's eyes flashed with venom when she heard Evelyn Roland's sharp accusation.

A cold smirk curled her lips.

Evelyn, you only have yourself to blame for being so naive.

And blame yourselves for being such a ridiculous couple.

So deeply in love, yet choosing the most childish ways to hurt each other.

"Adrian, let's go," she cooed, slipping her arm through his.

Adrian shook her off with icy disdain. "Know your place. Stay quiet and don't interfere." His voice was steel. "I'm letting your earlier behavior slide only because you once saved me."

Isabella stiffened.

She'd forgotten how fiercely his pride burned—especially when it came to his ex-wife.

"Adrian, I just wanted to help. Did you see how arrogant Evelyn was? She'd never agree to assist you." She lowered her head in feigned hurt.

That fire years ago—she'd merely taken credit for someone else's bravery.

The real savior had been Evelyn, the very woman she'd schemed against.

"Leave." Adrian's glare could freeze hell itself.

Sophia Blanchet emerged from the restroom, finding Evelyn gone but stumbling upon Adrian and Isabella instead.

Her pulse spiked.

Had her boss stormed off because of these two?

"Well, if it isn't Evelyn's little shadow," Isabella sneered.

Sophia halted, eyeing her with disdain. "Sweetheart, did you get hit by a door or just wake up stupid? Who even says 'little shadow' anymore?"

Isabella's face flushed with rage.

"Compared to my boss, you're not even fit to polish her shoes. And mark my words—I'll uncover every dirty secret you two hide." Sophia spun on her heel and strode away.

Isabella stomped her foot. "Adrian—"

"Enough." His patience was threadbare.

Evelyn had always despised these events.

Why show up tonight?

What else was she hiding?

"Adrian!" Julian Roscente sauntered over, champagne in hand. "Thought I saw your ex-wife earlier."

His white suit did little to mask his slouched posture.

"Isabella looks stunning tonight," he remarked absently, though his mind lingered on the glimpse he'd caught of Evelyn.

Divorce had made her breathtaking.
###Chapter 25

A sly smile played on Isabella Langley's lips, her eyes glinting with calculation. She knew exactly how to pluck a man's heartstrings, and Julian Roscente had always regarded her differently.

"Julian, I don't know what I'd do without you." Her voice dripped like honey, her gaze liquid with practiced allure.

What woman didn't enjoy being flattered? She was no exception.

Amusement flickered in Julian's eyes. Though Evelyn Roland outshone Isabella in beauty, the latter's demure charm held its own appeal. Compared to Evelyn's icy demeanor, he preferred Isabella's gentle, flowing tenderness.

"Adrian, Julian... I'm just worried about Evelyn." Isabella feigned concern. "She never continued her education after returning from the countryside at eighteen. With all these business elites here tonight, what if she offends someone..."

Julian scoffed. "Why should we care about her?"

Turning to Isabella, his tone turned teasing. "Bella, even if you came between them, it was Adrian's choice. The fault isn't yours—no need for guilt."

The one who truly hurt Evelyn had always been Adrian Valentine.

Isabella lowered her head, but not before a flash of scheming crossed her eyes. Tonight, she would force Evelyn's hand.

Adrian's expression darkened like storm clouds, the air around him turning frigid.

Sensing his anger, Julian quickly changed the subject. "Speaking of which, Adrian, I heard Nathan Aldridge from Sterling Manor is attending tonight. Didn't you want to meet their heiress? This is your chance. We must secure the NovaCore project."

Adrian's gaze turned inscrutable. "Nathan isn't an easy man to deal with. We'll play it by ear."

Only two companies stood a chance at winning the major contract tonight—Sterling Manor and his own.

The ballroom glittered with chandeliers and designer gowns. Industry titans mingled, champagne flutes in hand, exchanging polished pleasantries.

Evelyn had claimed a quiet corner for herself.

Her striking presence drew sidelong glances, but the don't-approach-me aura she projected kept everyone at bay as she focused on her phone.

"Boss, I'm here." Sophia Blanchet took the seat beside her.

"Has Nathan arrived?" Evelyn glanced up.

"Not yet. He'll contact us when he does." Sophia scanned the room. "Let me get you some food."

Evelyn shook her head. "No need." She checked an incoming call. "I'll take this in the lounge. Notify me when the main event starts."

"Got it." Sophia nodded.

Weaving through the crowd, Evelyn reached the lounge. Her pregnancy symptoms had worsened lately. She threw open every window, letting the night air soothe her nausea.

The call connected. "Sebastian," she said softly.

Sebastian Cortez's voice held concern. "Tessa, how are you feeling? Grandfather mentioned you've started taking over company matters."

Pain flickered in Evelyn's eyes. "Yes. But I'm not ready to reveal my identity yet. I will uncover the truth about Alexander's death."

Sebastian considered this. "Let Nathan handle it. Ease into the business—I'll be back in three months. Take care of yourself."

The call ended. Evelyn gazed out the window. Her family's warmth was slowly thawing her frozen heart.

The door swung open.

A tall figure in a tailored black suit filled the doorway. The intruder's devastatingly handsome face wore a mocking smile.

Evelyn's gaze turned arctic. "Lost your way, Mr. Valentine?"
###Chapter 26

Adrian Valentine took a seat beside her with measured steps, his penetrating gaze locking onto her.

"Evelyn, when did you learn antique appraisal?" His voice was low, betraying no emotion. "And how do you know Sebastian Cortez?"

He lounged lazily against the sofa, but suppressed fury simmered in his eyes.

"Mr. Valentine, we're divorced." Evelyn Roland kept her tone even. "My affairs are no longer your concern."

This was the man she had once loved deeply—yet also the one who had hurt her most.

Years ago, she arrived here with wounds both physical and emotional. It was Adrian's tenderness that had healed her, helping her emerge from the shadow of Alexander Durand's death.

But now...

Evelyn lowered her lashes. The familiar cold scent of him lingered in the air, sending a sharp pang through her heart.

This man had betrayed her.

"You've changed, Evelyn." A dangerous smirk curled Adrian's lips.

She met his icy stare with a bitter laugh. "You've become a stranger to me too, Mr. Valentine."

The formal address ignited Adrian's rage.

In one swift motion, he yanked her into his arms, his grip ironclad around her waist.

His fingers stilled. She felt... fuller than before.

"You've gained weight."

Evelyn's breath hitched. She struggled, careful not to exert herself—terrified of harming the life inside her or revealing her secret.

"Let me go!"

Adrian suddenly crushed his lips against hers.

Evelyn's eyes flew wide. Nausea churned in her stomach.

The memory of these same lips kissing Isabella Langley sent bile rising in her throat.

She shoved him away violently. "Ugh—"

Collapsing to the floor, she dry-heaved uncontrollably.

Adrian's face darkened. "Evelyn, you—"

She actually found him repulsive?

Evelyn lifted her gaze, her eyes glacial. "Adrian Valentine, we're divorced. Your mouth—after touching another woman—makes me sick. Stay away from me..."

Another wave of nausea cut her off.

Staggering upright, she bolted for the restroom.

Adrian remained frozen, his thumb brushing his lips where her scent lingered. His pupils dilated with stormy intensity.

Inside the restroom, Evelyn retched until tears streamed down her face. After rinsing her mouth, she caught sight of her reflection—and froze.

The woman in the mirror had hollow eyes and a gaunt complexion.

"This isn't me..." she whispered.

She'd looked like this ever since Alexander died. Only when Julian Roscente pointed it out had she realized her own transformation.

Dazed, she stepped out—and collided with Isabella Langley searching for Adrian.

"Evelyn? What are you doing here?" Isabella's tone dripped venom.

Evelyn almost laughed. "This is a public space."

Isabella's face twisted. If Adrian hadn't come for Evelyn... where had he gone?
###Chapter 27

"Evelyn, thank you for being sensible and divorcing Adrian. You've returned him to me." Isabella Langley approached in her stilettos, her red lips curling into a victorious smirk.

She idly toyed with her freshly manicured nails. "Do you know why the Valentines treated you like a maid? Because in their eyes, you were nothing but a country bumpkin with no pedigree."

Evelyn leaned against the corridor wall, her expression blank, fingers digging unconsciously into her palms.

"Mrs. Valentine told me herself—if it weren't for the old lady's insistence, Adrian would never have married a nameless orphan like you." Isabella leaned closer, her voice dripping with mock sympathy. "I heard you weren't even registered in the Langley family records. How pathetic."

Evelyn suddenly laughed, sharp and humorless. "Your memory fails you, Isabella. It was Chairman Langley who hid the truth about the switched identities. And now you blame me?"

She straightened, her gaze cutting like a blade. "My affairs with Adrian are none of your concern."

Isabella's face twisted. Her manicured fingers clenched around her purse. "You—!"

"Move." Evelyn stepped past her. "A pregnant woman needs fresh air."

The rapid click of retreating heels echoed down the hallway. Evelyn watched the plane leaves drift past the window, her eyes burning.

Around the corner of the restroom, Adrian Valentine stubbed out his third cigarette. The choked sob of "I hate you" sent his throat bobbing violently.

In the lounge, lilies bloomed in perfect white clusters. Evelyn reached out, brushing a petal, remembering a snowy evening long past. Adrian had burst through the door, chilled to the bone, pulling a bouquet of frost-kissed roses from his coat.

"The florist was still open," he'd said, nose red from the cold, grinning like a boy seeking praise. "The last winter roses, according to the shopkeeper."

What had she said then? Probably scolded him for wasting money. Now, even the memory of her sharp words tasted like honey.

"How stupid," Evelyn muttered, wiping at her damp lashes. A crush at eighteen, heartbreak at twenty-five—just seven years in the end.

"Help—!"

A scream shattered the memory. Evelyn whirled toward the banquet hall, where panicked guests were already flooding into the corridor.
###Chapter 28

Evelyn Roland frowned as another piercing scream echoed through the hallway.

She rose swiftly and followed the sound.

At the end of the corridor, a frail girl was violently shoved to the ground by a man in a tailored suit.

Evelyn discreetly pulled out her phone to record the scene.

"Natalie Lowell, don't forget you're just a worthless asthmatic. You should be grateful I married you at all!" The man's handsome features twisted with cruelty beneath his polished exterior. "If you interfere with my affairs again, I'll end you."

The girl gazed up at him with despair. "Daniel Sherwood, is my presence really so shameful to you?"

He sneered. "What use are you except serving my parents at home? Miss Macmillian is different. Her family are rising stars in Vienna. She can elevate my status!"

Leaning down, he gripped her chin. "I've already won Miss Macmillian's heart. Soon she'll be carrying my child. And you? You can't even produce an egg!"

"Ah!" The girl cried out as he kicked her viciously.

"Cough... cough..." Natalie suddenly struggled for breath, her face turning ashen. "Daniel... help me..."

"Stop faking it." A bejeweled woman emerged, looking down her nose with contempt. "Blame your miserable fate. Dying here would solve everything."

Evelyn's pupils constricted.

This scene felt hauntingly familiar.

As she moved to intervene, Isabella Langley approached in stiletto heels.

"Get off!" Isabella kicked away Natalie's grasping hand from her designer dress. "Disgusting trash!"

Evelyn's eyes turned icy.

Once Isabella departed, she immediately approached, slipping a pill into the girl's mouth.

"Only you can save yourself." Evelyn helped her up. "Come find me in six months. I can cure your asthma completely—let you conceive and bear children like any healthy woman."

A glimmer of hope flickered in Natalie's dull eyes. "Really?"

"Provided you survive until then." Evelyn's tone remained neutral.

The girl gave a bitter smile. "You saw... everything just now?"
###Chapter 29

Evelyn nodded in agreement. "It's truly not worth it. Your mother-in-law was right there, yet she did nothing to help."

Natalie's heart had long turned cold. She would never set foot in the Sherwood residence again.

Wiping away her tears, she felt utterly drained. Though her condition was severe, the medicine Evelyn had given her worked remarkably well.

"May I know your name?"

"Evelyn Roland." She handed Natalie a slip of paper with her phone number.

She wasn't one to meddle, but she couldn't stand bullies preying on the weak.

Natalie leaned against the wall, clutching the note tightly.

"I'll find you in six months. Can you help me contact my father? I want to go home. They took my phone."

Evelyn pulled out her phone and told her to recite the number.

Before she could finish, Natalie collapsed.

Supporting her with one arm, Evelyn dialed the number.

"Hello?" A deep male voice answered.

"Are you Mr. Lowell, Natalie's father?"

"Yes. Who is this? Where is my daughter?"

"She's in the lounge at the Grandelle Hotel. She had an asthma attack and asked me to notify you. She's been given emergency medication and is stable for now."

"Thank you! Is this your number? I'm nearby—I'll be right there."

After hanging up, Evelyn helped the unconscious Natalie to her feet.

Natalie's eyelids fluttered open, tears spilling. "Will he really come? I cut ties with my family for that man... broke my father's heart..."

She remembered her father's anguished plea the day she left: "Natalie, he's not the one. If you ever feel lost, come home. We'll always love you."

"Back then, I thought they were hypocrites. If they truly loved me, why wouldn't they let me be with the man I loved?"

"My sister only had one request—to keep our family background from Daniel. She must have known I'd never be happy."

Natalie let out a bitter laugh. "They say love makes women blind. Outsiders see the truth clearer."

Evelyn felt a flicker of relief seeing her realization. It wasn't too late to walk away.

"Understanding is the first step. Your father said he's coming. Let me take you downstairs."

Natalie nodded weakly. "So tired... haven't slept in three days..."

She had barely rested while preparing her husband's birthday gift.

"Just a few more minutes. I'll get you to the curb. You can rest properly at home."

Natalie fought to keep her eyes open as longing overwhelmed her.

Darkness won. She slumped against Evelyn's shoulder, fast asleep.

Just as Evelyn was about to set her down to wait, a commotion erupted.

"Murder! Someone's dead!" Natalie's mother-in-law stormed in with a crowd, spotting her unconscious daughter-in-law—and immediately scheming.

Evelyn's icy gaze swept over the woman's sharp features. "Madam—"

Daniel charged forward aggressively. "Who are you? What did you do to my cousin?"
###Chapter 30

Evelyn's pupils contracted as she stared at the man in disbelief.

He actually called Natalie his cousin?

"Cousin?" Evelyn's lips curled into a cold smile, her phoenix-like eyes glinting with frost. "Are you sure?"

Daniel frowned, studying the unfamiliar woman before him.

Why did she seem vaguely familiar?

With Miss Sherwood still present, he couldn't let her know Natalie was his wife.

The crowd behind them had already begun murmuring.

"Oh my god, a public murder!"

"Is that woman insane?"

Daniel suppressed a smirk. Natalie had asthma—without medication during an attack, death was certain.

He'd thought her well-dressed appearance meant wealth. Yet when buying a house, she couldn't even produce fifty grand.

Three wasted years.

Now that she was dying, he could finally pursue Miss Sherwood openly.

"This is my friend Natalie Lowell," Evelyn said icily. "You claim she's your cousin? What's your relation?"

"My aunt's daughter." Daniel squared his shoulders.

Evelyn's expression darkened.

"What's your name?"

"Daniel Sherwood!" He blurted it out before paling. "What's your problem? Don't believe me?"

He moved to help Natalie up.

Evelyn stepped back, her gaze sharp as a blade. "You didn't even check her pulse before declaring her dead. Or did you already hope she'd die?"

Natalie stirred awake, Daniel's words chilling her to the core.

No more attachments to the Sherwood family.

Daniel froze.

Hearing his mother's earlier scream, he'd been desperate to rid himself of this burden. Asthma attacks were fatal without treatment.

His eyes flicked to Evelyn.

Porcelain skin, delicate features.

Pity she was Natalie's friend—probably another penniless nobody.

"Miss, I don't know how my cousin offended you," Daniel said mournfully. "But you caused her asthma attack and refused to call an ambulance. What's your game?"

Evelyn's brow furrowed.

The man was a disgustingly skilled actor.

"Turn yourself in now," Mrs. Sherwood snapped. "Or we'll call the police!"

Isabella's eyes gleamed from the crowd.

This opportunity was too perfect to waste.

She turned to find Adrian.

Suddenly, a group of elegantly dressed figures approached. The middle-aged man leading them exuded authority.

Isabella frowned.

Why did he look familiar?

Meanwhile, Evelyn's voice cut through the tension. "Daniel, you know exactly why Natalie had that attack. You watched her die, and now you're blaming me?"

The Sherwoods paled.

"Lies!" Mrs. Sherwood shrieked. "You killed Natalie!"

Evelyn smirked.

How were they so certain she was dead?

Her icy stare made Mrs. Sherwood shudder.

The woman was breathtakingly beautiful—with eyes colder than steel.

Isabella seized the moment. "Evelyn, first corporate espionage, now murder? Just confess!"
###Chapter 31

"Confess?" Evelyn Roland let out a cold laugh, her fingertips tracing the intricate embroidery on her sleeve. "That accusation comes too easily from you, Isabella."

Isabella Langley's eyes reddened, her trembling fingers clutching the champagne flute. "Sister, I know you're upset, but you can't play with people's lives."

Evelyn glanced at Natalie Lowell lying unconscious on the floor, then smirked. "Mrs. Sherwood, your relative has been lying here for ten minutes. Too stingy to call an ambulance?"

Mrs. Sherwood's face paled. Her diamond-studded clutch hit the floor with a sharp clatter.

"Could it be—" Daniel Sherwood lunged toward his wife, but froze when Evelyn's icy glare pinned him in place.

"Spare me the loving husband act." Evelyn kicked him away. "Where was this concern when you stood by and did nothing?"

The chandelier dimmed abruptly.

Theodore Lowell stormed in with twelve black-suited bodyguards. His custom leather shoes crunched over shattered glass as he crouched before Daniel. "Mr. Sherwood, I hear you enjoy gambling with lives?"

"Stop this!" Mrs. Sherwood shrieked, only to be wrestled onto the banquet table by guards.

Natalie coughed weakly in her father's arms. Evelyn tossed a celadon vial toward them. "Take this every first of the month. I'll examine her myself in six months."

As Theodore caught the vial, his fingers brushed against Evelyn's palm—leaving behind a gilded business card.

"Divorce papers!" His roar made Daniel wet his designer suit. "I want signed documents at Lowell Group's reception by sunset tomorrow!"

Leaning against a marble column, Evelyn felt her phone vibrate.

Nathan Aldridge materialized behind her, his gentle features twisting into a fox-like grin. "Miss Roland, Mr. Valentine is looking for you."

"Quiet." Evelyn studied the diamond-encrusted card under the light—revealing micro-engraved words on the reverse: 8 PM tomorrow. Emerald Manor, No.17.
###Chapter 32

Evelyn halted mid-step, her gaze locking onto Nathan's grinning face.

"Too scared?" She arched an eyebrow.

"Boss, the old man would break my legs if he found out." Nathan shrank back.

Evelyn's lips curled into a cold smile. "I can break them right now."

She lowered her voice. "First, I need to uncover the truth about my origins and Alexander's death."

"Second, you'll introduce me as your assistant for now."

Nathan's eyes widened.

"And I'm carrying the heir to Sterling Manor." Evelyn added calmly. "Only a handful of us know."

His gaze dropped to her flat stomach. "Who's the bastard? I'll kill him!"

A frosty glare silenced him. "Mind your CEO persona."

Nathan's knees wobbled.

Evelyn sighed. The man who negotiated billion-dollar deals effortlessly now resembled a scolded child.

"How many projects today?"

At the mention of work, his posture straightened. "All secured except Lowell Group."

"Lowell?" Evelyn's fingers tapped her arm thoughtfully. "I'll join you next time."

——

Across the room, Isabella snapped covert photos of their exchange.

She hurried toward Adrian, phone extended. "Look at Evelyn with this man."

The image showed Evelyn leaning slightly forward as Nathan whispered in her ear.

Adrian's eyes darkened.

Julian peered over his shoulder. "Nathan Aldridge, CEO of Sterling Manor."

"Rumor says the heiress returned but remains unseen. He handles everything." He added.

Isabella tilted her head. "What's her background?"

Julian chuckled. "Mysterious. Multiple PhDs. Sterling Manor's empire? Built by her and Sebastian Cortez."

"I want to date her." He declared shamelessly.

Isabella teased, "How fickle, Julian."

Turning to Adrian, she asked, "Did the contract go smoothly tonight?"

Adrian's fingers tightened around the phone. A cold smirk played on his lips.
###Chapter 33

Adrian Valentine gave a faint nod. "Mm."

Julian Roscente rubbed his hands excitedly. "Isabella, your Adrian is incredible. He even secured the deal with Sterling Manor. Now we just need Mr. Lowell's approval. I heard he didn't show up today. We'll arrange another meeting."

Isabella Langley's eyes lit up.

Though the Langleys were wealthy, they paled in comparison to the Valentines.

If the Valentines secured the contract, the Langleys could benefit too.

"I always knew Adrian was the best." Isabella clung to Adrian's arm affectionately. "Let's grab something to eat. I'm starving."

Adrian lowered his gaze, suppressing the turmoil in his eyes. "Mm."

As they headed toward the dining area, they nearly collided with Evelyn Roland and Sophia Blanchet, who were leaving.

Evelyn walked past Adrian without sparing him a glance.

The familiar scent of her perfume brushed past him, and Adrian's steps faltered. He clenched his fists, resisting the urge to pull her back. The memory of that photo shattered his resolve.

She was better off without him.

In the car, Evelyn remained composed.

She needed to erase that betrayer from her heart completely.

She sent Nathan Aldridge a message:
[Don't invite me to these pointless events again.]

Nathan replied instantly:
[You're heartless! After you left, two women cornered me. Their perfume nearly suffocated me. And you didn’t even wait for me!]

Evelyn smirked:
[Enjoying the attention, I see.]

Setting her phone aside, she reviewed the contracts signed that night. Her fingers paused when she spotted Valentine Group's name.

She refused to let personal feelings interfere with work, but seeing Adrian's name still stung.

Her phone suddenly rang.

The caller ID made her tense.

It was inevitable.

She took a deep breath and answered. "Grandmother."

"Evelyn, your mother-in-law told me Adrian has someone else. That you divorced. Is it true?" The old woman's voice trembled.

Evelyn tightened her grip on the phone. "You already know."

"Oh, child. No wonder you haven’t visited me this past month." Beatrice Valentine choked back a sob. "No matter what, you’ll always be my granddaughter. Can you come see me now?"

Evelyn's eyes burned. "I'll be right there."

After hanging up, she turned to Sophia. "Take me to Sterling Manor."

The Valentine estate stood at the foot of the mountains, just three streets away from Regal Heights.

At the gates, Evelyn asked Sophia to wait in the car.

The grand manor was flanked by towering pine trees.

A servant bowed respectfully. "Miss Roland, the Madam is waiting upstairs."

"Thank you."

The moment she stepped inside, she ran into Margaret Valentine.

Margaret scowled at the sight of her. "Evelyn! Where have you been this past month? I called you endlessly! My back is killing me—get over here and treat me!"

Evelyn shot her a cold glance.

The woman was as domineering as ever.

Without a word, she walked past her toward the stairs.

Margaret stomped her foot. "Evelyn! I'm talking to you!"
###Chapter 34

Evelyn stopped in her tracks, meeting Margaret Valentine's gaze with calm detachment.

"I've divorced your son as you wished, Mrs. Valentine. I'm no longer your daughter-in-law and owe you nothing. You have a new daughter-in-law now—let her perform your acupuncture treatments."

Margaret's eyes flickered. Her spinal stenosis had plagued her for years, and only Evelyn's skilled hands had brought relief.

"I admit I looked down on you," Margaret said stiffly. "The Valentines need a society heiress who can support Adrian. I appreciate you knowing your place."

Such was the pragmatism of wealthy matriarchs.

Evelyn's response was serene. "I hope you get everything you desire."

Margaret frowned. Why did Evelyn seem so unshaken? She'd prepared to humiliate her, yet her barbs met only empty air.

Without another word, Evelyn ascended the stairs.

Beatrice Valentine beckoned warmly. "Evelyn, come here."

"Grandmother." Evelyn approached, her icy demeanor thawing. The elderly woman had been a beauty in her youth, and age had only deepened her kindness.

"How have you been?" Evelyn asked softly.

"Well enough, though I miss you." Beatrice sighed. "That foolish grandson of mine will regret this."

Evelyn smiled. "I'll stay in Vienna. I'll visit when I can."

"Good girl." Beatrice hesitated. "Why did you walk away empty-handed? You contributed to the company too."

Evelyn's smile was faint. Clean breaks required clean slates.

"I'm doing fine." She knew Adrian struggled at Valentine Corp—his father's death remained unsolved, and his uncle circled like a vulture.

Beatrice slid a document across the table. "These are my shares. I'm transferring them to you—"

"I can't accept that." Evelyn recoiled.

"Don't refuse yet." Beatrice lowered her voice. "These shares must go to someone I trust. Adrian's uncle seized control once before—"

"So this is your game, Evelyn!" Margaret burst in, eyes blazing. "You refused alimony to target Beatrice's shares!"

Adrian followed, his gaze darkening as it locked onto Evelyn.

She stood. "I should go. Take care, Grandmother."

"Greed doesn't become you," Margaret sneered.

"Enough!" Beatrice snapped. "I invited Evelyn. Blame me!"

"Mother—"

"The matter is closed." Beatrice cut her off. "Since you've discovered my intentions, know this—I'll only entrust my shares to someone worthy. If Evelyn refuses, they stay with me."

Regret shadowed Beatrice's face. This confrontation would only make Evelyn's life harder.

With a slight nod, Evelyn turned away without glancing at Adrian.

Moonlight bathed her as she exited the Valentine estate, an ache blooming in her chest.

Some wounds never healed.

Just before she reached the gates, a strong hand seized her wrist.
###Chapter 35

The familiar scent lingered around her. Evelyn didn't need to turn around to know it was Adrian.

She forced herself to face the man who walked the line between light and darkness.

Four years had passed in the blink of an eye.

Her heart clenched as if gripped by an invisible hand, the pain stealing her breath.

"Adrian, let go." Her voice was ice-cold.

His lips curled into a mocking smile. "Evelyn, I underestimated you. Even Grandmother's shares aren't safe from your greed."

The words stabbed through her chest like a knife.

So this was how he saw her—utterly despicable.

Betrayed first, then slandered. How blind she'd been.

Her hand instinctively moved to her abdomen, her eyes frosty. "Adrian, you're not worthy of me. I didn't take your money because it's beneath me. If you want those shares, I'll buy them just to throw in your face."

As she turned away, her eyes burned red, her face deathly pale.

Adrian's expression darkened. "Evelyn, we need to talk."

She almost laughed.

What had he said when she'd begged to talk all those years ago?

"Evelyn, there's nothing to discuss. It was just a joke—don't tell me you took it seriously?"

Now the words belonged to him.

She turned back. Only then did Adrian see the pallor of her face. His heart twisted violently.

"Adrian, what's there to talk about? We're divorced. Still clinging to me—could it be regret?"

"You've changed," he said, frowning.

She used to hang on his every word. Now she was all sharp edges.

"Oh?" Evelyn arched a brow, her smile cold. "How should I be, then? Drowning in tears to satisfy you?"

"Even in hell, I'll keep my eyes on the sky."

Those sunless days had drained her of tears long ago.

"Your things are still at the villa. Come get them."

He'd returned home to find she'd taken nothing but her personal belongings.

For four years, she'd been like the wind—here one moment, gone the next.

"You bought them. I have no right to take anything. Burn them or toss them—I don't care."

"Evelyn—"

"Enough!" She shook off his hand. "No touching after divorce."

Pain had taught her life must go on.

Adrian stared into her cold eyes. "Did you ever love me?"

Evelyn laughed, tears glistening. "I did. I wouldn't have married you otherwise. Thank you for pulling me from the abyss those three years. That's why I accepted it when you called our marriage a joke."

"Whether it was real or just a bet to you, it's over now. May your future be bright."

As she turned away, the dam broke.

She'd survived the worst. Time would heal all wounds.

Watching her retreating figure, Adrian felt a hollow ache in his chest.
###Chapter 36

"Adrian, why are you still hesitating? What's so special about that woman? All she's good for is serving tea. It's better this way. Now you can marry Isabella properly."

Margaret Valentine's icy voice came from behind.

A cold glint flashed in Adrian Valentine's eyes.

He turned, lips curling into a mocking smile. "Mother, finding a daughter-in-law who caters to the entire family's every whim is rarer than spotting a unicorn."

"Since you despise her so much, shall I bring Isabella home to wait on you instead?"

Without waiting for a response, he strode away.

Margaret's face turned ashen.

Her dark gaze followed her son's retreating figure.

"Think you've grown wings, don't you?"

The memory of the old woman nearly giving company shares to Evelyn made her blood boil.

"That senile hag wants to hand our fortune to an outsider? Over my dead body!"

She'd make sure the old woman surrendered those shares willingly.

Evelyn sat quietly in the car.

Sophia Blanchet drove in silence.

Not far behind, Adrian watched Evelyn's car disappear into the night from his own vehicle.

Upon arriving home, Evelyn went straight upstairs.

Sophia exchanged a glance with Victoria Laurent, neither daring to disturb her.

Victoria prepared late-night snacks and texted Evelyn that they were in the warmer.

Steam filled the bathroom.

Evelyn gazed tenderly at her slightly rounded abdomen.

"Twins..."

Once, she'd dreamed of having children with Adrian.

Now life grew inside her as their family fell apart.

"Perhaps this is fate."

She changed into loose pajamas and checked Victoria's message.

Just as she finished the snacks, her phone vibrated.

The word "Husband" on the screen stung her eyes.

"Yes?"

"Come get your things now. There's a necklace. If you don't want it, I'm throwing it out."

Evelyn frowned. It was the necklace Scarlett Orlando had given her.

"Can it wait until tomorrow?"

"Sure. You can dig through the dumpster then."

Adrian's voice could freeze hell.

A sharp pain pierced Evelyn's chest.

"I'm on my way."

Thirty minutes later, she stood before what used to be her home.

As she raised her hand to knock, the door swung open abruptly.
###Chapter 37

The door swung open. Adrian Valentine stood at the threshold, his gaze as cold as ice.

Evelyn Roland's heart clenched. She couldn't understand why he suddenly despised her so much.

Swallowing her bitterness, she forced out the words, "Mr. Valentine, could you help me with my things?"

Last time she went to the company, he hadn't even let her through the front gates.

Adrian sneered. "Mr. Valentine? Are we strangers now that we're divorced?" His voice dripped with suppressed fury.

His eyes flickered over her pale face, lingering briefly on her shoulder—where a gunshot wound lay hidden beneath her clothes.

Finally, Evelyn voiced the question burning inside her. "Adrian, you pursued me because of a bet. You betrayed me for Isabella. You called me filthy. Why?"

Today, she would get answers.

His expression darkened instantly. "How dare you bring that up!"

If she hadn't sold out their secrets, Christian Lefèvre would still be alive.

He turned and snatched a stack of photos from the coffee table, flinging them at her face.

"You accuse me of betrayal? You were the one who betrayed me first!"

The photos scattered across the floor. In them, a radiant young man—more handsome than Adrian himself—held her close, both of them laughing.

Alexander Durand.

Evelyn trembled as she knelt to gather the pictures. Tears splashed onto the images as she clutched them to her chest. These were moments she'd never seen before.

"Alex..." She shut her eyes, the memory of the brilliant young man flooding back.

"Eve, wake up! I made you sweet rice dumplings..."

His bright voice still echoed in her ears.

Adrian had never seen her cry like this for anyone else. Rage consumed him. She had always carried another man in her heart.

"Don't dirty my floor with your tears," he hissed through clenched teeth.

Evelyn looked up sharply. "Where did you get these?"

Alexander's identity was classified. How did Adrian—

"Was it you...?" Her voice shook. Had he been the one who killed Alexander?

Adrian seized her throat. "I was your husband! Yet you smiled like that in another man's arms. What was I to you?"

His hands trembled. Seeing those photos had shattered him.

Evelyn closed her eyes, scalding tears rolling onto his fingers. At this moment, she would rather die by his hand.

Four years of agony had finally been laid bare.
###Chapter 38

Evelyn's eyes snapped open, her fingers gripping the edge of the photograph with white-knuckled force. Her voice was glacial. "Adrian, I'll ask you one last time. Who gave you this photo?"

Her eyes were bloodshot, as if they might bleed at any moment.

Adrian's lips curled into a mocking smile. "Does it matter? Your heart has always belonged to this man. Evelyn, don't take it so seriously. I was just playing with you."

Each word cut like a knife, slicing into Evelyn's already battered heart.

Just playing.

And she had been foolish enough to believe him.

Her gaze shattered as she stared at Adrian. "If I find out you had anything to do with Alexander's death..." She spoke each word with deadly precision. "I'll kill you myself."

She turned and walked away without another word.

The matter of the necklace was long forgotten.

A flash of madness crossed Adrian's eyes as he snatched the photo and tore it to pieces. The fragments fluttered to Evelyn's feet like snowflakes.

"No!" Evelyn dropped to her knees, her trembling hands scrambling to collect the pieces. "Alex..."

Adrian stood watching her unravel over a mere photograph. His fists clenched until his knuckles cracked, murderous intent swirling in his eyes.

Four years.

This was the first time he'd seen her in such agony.

And it was for another man.

Evelyn carefully gathered the fragments in her palms and stumbled to her feet. Tears streamed down her face, unstoppable no matter how hard she wiped at them.

She collapsed into her car, forehead pressed against the steering wheel. Muffled sobs echoed in the confined space until her voice gave out. Only then did she start the engine.

Adrian watched from the window as she drove away. His lips pressed into a thin, bloodless line, his eyes burning crimson.

She would kill him for that man.

Fine. Just fine.

A cruel smile twisted his lips. Let her try.

At home, Evelyn painstakingly taped the photo back together. But no matter how carefully she worked, it would never be whole again.

Just like Alexander. Gone forever.

She fell onto her bed and into a fitful sleep.

In her dreams, a young man smiled warmly at her. "Don't cry, Evie. I promised I'd always protect you."

"Alex..." she murmured in her sleep, tears soaking the pillow.

For three days, Evelyn locked herself in her room.

Sophia and Victoria fretted outside her door, but no amount of knocking could rouse her.

On the fourth day, when Victoria brought food, she spotted the framed photograph on the nightstand. Her eyes welled with understanding as she quietly retreated.

"Miss Evelyn is thinking of Master Alexander again," Victoria whispered tearfully. "No wonder she's so heartbroken."

Sophia's expression darkened. "Four years, and she still can't move on."

They stood in heavy silence.

By evening on the fourth day, Evelyn finally emerged. Her face was pale, but her eyes were colder than ever.

"Boss." Sophia hurried forward.

Evelyn mechanically chewed her food before speaking abruptly. "What's the update on Melanie Evans?"
###Chapter 39

Sophia handed her phone to Evelyn. "Boss, Isabella bribed Melanie Evans."

"I threatened Melanie with the kidney donor. She admitted taking Isabella's money. But the donor match is real. I promised to keep it quiet so Isabella wouldn't interfere."

Rare mercy from Sophia.

Uncharacteristic.

Evelyn frowned. "Why is Isabella targeting me?"

She'd already divorced Adrian. Why the obsession?

Unless it was about her origins.

The only logical explanation.

The Langleys still refused to reveal her true parentage.

Sophia scoffed. "That woman's deranged."

Evelyn pondered. The Langleys' secrets had eluded her for years.

"Send me the video. Have Zachary investigate Isabella—full background check from birth. I need everything."

Something didn't add up.

Who gave those photos to Adrian?

Evelyn turned to Victoria. "Dig into the Langleys. Every social connection, business deal—leave no stone unturned."

Days of numbness ended now.

With the map surfacing, the puppeteer would emerge soon.

Victoria's eyes gleamed. "Understood, Miss Roland. I'll uncover everything."

Evelyn cradled her swelling abdomen. "Remember—my identity stays hidden."

She'd expose the truth.

For Alexander's justice.

As for Adrian...

Such men weren't worth keeping.

These two lives inside her were enough.

Victoria and Sophia exchanged glances before departing.

......

Langley Mansion.

Beneath the crystal chandelier, Vincent Langley sat rigid on the leather sofa.

Isabella perched demurely beside him.

Dominic pointed at photos of a disheveled Evelyn. "Chairman, Evelyn Roland did know Alexander Durand."

Vincent narrowed his eyes. "How?"

Dominic shook his head. "Finding these at Durand's residence shocked me too. This intimacy suggests... more."

Isabella examined her manicure. "These photos made Adrian divorce her."

Playing the angel for Adrian had grown tedious.

Vincent smiled approvingly at his daughter. "Your sacrifice won't be forgotten. Once we rule Vienna's elite, you'll have everything."

Malice flashed in Isabella's eyes. "Father, Evelyn's becoming unpredictable. I have an idea."

Vincent raised an eyebrow. "Do tell."
###Chapter 40

A ruthless glint flashed in Isabella Langley's eyes. "Father, Evelyn Roland must be eliminated. Even if she discovers her true origins and connection to Alexander Durand, she'll never uncover that secret. We can use Adrian Valentine's name to deal with her."

Adrian belonged to her alone.

After spending so much time together, she was completely obsessed.

She was about to enter the entertainment industry.

As the Langley heiress, she would become its brightest star.

With Adrian's influence and her beauty, fame was guaranteed.

Vincent Langley frowned. "Isabella, I have my own plans. Alexander was a genius—what if he told Evelyn the secret before he died?"

That was his greatest fear.

After finally finding a lead, he couldn't risk losing it.

Evelyn couldn't be killed.

Isabella narrowed her eyes. "Then we'll bring her back and extract the information."

Vincent nodded. "You and your mother will visit her tomorrow. Apologize for abandoning her in the countryside and invite her home for dinner."

Dominic Lombardi smirked. "The Chairman is right. Offer her the Langley name, and she'll be grateful. A neglected child always craves family."

He needed that map.

The gems and minerals were their ticket to power.

The three exchanged knowing smiles.

Isabella suddenly had a more entertaining idea.

Wouldn't it be more satisfying to make Evelyn watch her and Adrian together?

......

Evelyn had been busy lately.

Work helped numb the pain.

She closed the last file.

Only now did she understand how hard her grandfather had worked all these years.

She'd slaved for an unworthy man while her grandfather carried the burden.

Thinking of him, her lips curved unconsciously.

"Miss, have some water." Victoria Laurent entered with a glass.

Relieved to see her improved mood, Victoria exhaled.

"Are the casual clothes ready?"

"Sophia prepared everything in your preferred styles."

"We need to schedule a meeting with Chairman Lowell this month. Have Nathan arrange it."

Victoria nodded. "You've worked for three hours straight. It's time to rest."

"Call me Evelyn from now on," she said abruptly. "My identity must remain hidden."

Alexander's appearance signaled the truth was near.

But why did it involve Adrian?

Her phone buzzed.

The caller ID made her brow arch.

Eleanor Langley was contacting her?

"What do you want?"

"Evelyn, come home for dinner tonight." Eleanor's voice dripped with false warmth. "Even though you divorced Adrian, you're still our adopted daughter."
###Chapter 41

Evelyn's eyes gleamed faintly. She wouldn't refuse the olive branch the Langleys had extended. This was the perfect opportunity to get closer to the family.

"Since you insist, Mrs. Langley, I'll be there tonight."

She accepted the invitation. It would allow her to investigate the Langleys further.

And perhaps uncover the truth about her own origins.

"Evelyn, I'm glad you're being reasonable. Dinner starts at six. Don't be late." Eleanor Langley's voice dripped with honeyed sweetness.

Anyone unfamiliar with her true nature would mistake her tone for genuine warmth.

"Understood."

After hanging up, Evelyn turned to Victoria. "Prepare a makeup kit. I'm visiting the Langleys tonight."

Victoria frowned, recalling Eleanor's vicious schemes, but nodded. "Of course."

As Evelyn moved to change, Sophia burst into the room.

"Boss, I've got something interesting."

Sophia eagerly handed over her phone. The video showed the Macmillian family's business deal being sabotaged—with Vincent Langley pulling the strings.

"Serena Macmillian clashed with Isabella over a casting decision. Isabella used Adrian's influence to buy her way into the lead role."

This was the explosive intel Sophia had spent days gathering.

Evelyn's lips curved as she watched the damning footage. If Isabella wanted to play dirty, she'd get a taste of her own medicine.

"Send this to the Macmillians. Let them see how the Langleys operate."

"Also, get ready. You're coming with me to their place tonight."

Sophia blinked. "Why?"

That viper's nest wasn't worth visiting.

Evelyn's crimson lips tilted. "For the show."

Eleanor's sudden invitation definitely had ulterior motives.

Sophia grinned and forwarded the video before preparing for the evening.

At six sharp, Evelyn arrived at the Langley estate.

She instructed Sophia to wait outside and entered alone.

The door opened to reveal Dominic Lombardi, Vincent's right-hand man. The middle-aged man's beady eyes gleamed with false warmth.

"Miss Roland. Long time no see."

Suppressing her disgust, Evelyn smiled coolly. "Likewise, Mr. Lombardi."

To Dominic, she remained the same pushover they could manipulate.

"Come in." He stepped aside.

Evelyn surveyed her surroundings—her third time stepping foot here. The maple leaves in the courtyard had turned blood-red.

Walking down the corridor into the main hall, she froze at an unexpected sight.

Adrian stood beneath the crystal chandelier in a white suit, his handsome face alight with amusement.

"Evelyn?" His brow arched. "What are you doing here?"
###Chapter 42

Evelyn's fingertips trembled slightly as she watched the smirk playing on Adrian's lips. The image of that torn photograph remained vivid in her mind—how could he smile so carelessly after what he'd done?

She knew Adrian Valentine too well. This man had no heart. Tormenting her was merely his way of passing idle time.

Adrian's sharp eyes narrowed when she remained silent. Today, she wore a pink dress with a matching shawl draped over her shoulders, the delicate fabric hinting at her curves. Her high ponytail exposed the slender column of her neck, where a diamond necklace sparkled under the light. Her face was still breathtakingly beautiful.

He had always believed her radiance complemented his dark allure perfectly.

Their gazes locked, but Evelyn was the first to look away. If love was gone, she would reclaim the version of herself that once drove him mad with frustration.

"You can come, but I can't?" Her voice was icy, devoid of any lingering affection.

The moment he chose another woman, she understood—he could live perfectly well without her.

If he wasn't worth it, she would let go.

Evelyn, wake up already!

"This is my fiancée's home," Adrian replied, his smirk deepening. "As my ex-wife, your presence here is inappropriate."

What was she doing here?

Begging for humiliation?

Evelyn stepped forward gracefully, her lips curling into a mocking smile. "Adrian, once we divorced, your so-called fiancée became irrelevant. Your world has nothing to do with me, and mine is no place for you. From now on, steer clear of me—unless you enjoy public embarrassment."

"Evelyn!" Adrian's expression darkened instantly. She always knew how to ignite his fury with just a few words.

"You're unworthy!" Disgust flickered in his eyes.

"Oh, but you are, right?" She let out a cold laugh. "Just don't drag me into your filthy affairs. I find them repulsive."

Adrian's brow furrowed as he studied her with an unreadable gaze. Was she determined to stir up trouble in the Langley family?

Evelyn strode past him without hesitation.

On the staircase, Isabella descended gracefully, her white gown accentuating her elegance. Jewelry adorned her, glinting with every movement.

"Evelyn, you're here," she greeted sweetly.

Evelyn responded with a faint nod.

Just then, Vincent and Eleanor Langley entered from outside. Evelyn approached to greet them.

She had to admit—Eleanor had aged remarkably well. Having given birth to Isabella at eighteen and later a son, she still carried herself with effortless grace.

"Evelyn, Adrian, let's have dinner first," Vincent said warmly. "We can talk over the meal."

The dining table was laden with dishes, though few appealed to Evelyn. Now past her morning sickness phase, the smell of fish no longer turned her stomach.

"Evelyn," Eleanor said as she served her a portion, "though you're not my biological daughter, you're still family. Visit more often—this will always be your home."

A flicker of mockery passed through Evelyn's eyes. Eleanor's acting was truly flawless.

"Thank you for your kindness. I'll visit frequently."

Adrian watched her smiling face, his gaze growing more intense. This woman was becoming harder to decipher.

What was she really after?

"I'm glad you feel that way," Eleanor said, turning to her daughter with satisfaction. "Isabella will have company now."

Isabella quickly chimed in, "Evelyn, consider this your home. Dad didn't mean what he said about kicking you out—don't take it to heart."

"Oh, and," she added, linking arms with Adrian affectionately, "Adrian and I are getting engaged soon. You must come and bless us."

Try not to choke on your jealousy.

A sharp pang struck Evelyn's chest, but her smile remained radiant. "Congratulations. May you have children soon."

Adrian spat out his tea.
###Chapter 43

"Adrian, be careful." Isabella quickly grabbed a tissue, reaching to wipe the water from his lips.

Adrian instinctively recoiled, but caught Evelyn's mocking gaze and forced himself to stay still.

A faint smirk played on Evelyn's lips, satisfaction flashing in her eyes.

The tables had turned. Finally, Adrian was the one left speechless.

After wiping his mouth, Isabella turned to Evelyn with a triumphant smile. "Evelyn, thank you for your blessings. Once we're married, we'll have children soon. Mrs. Valentine has been longing for grandchildren."

She emphasized her words, hoping to provoke Evelyn.

After all, Mrs. Valentine treated her like a daughter-in-law, while Evelyn was nothing more than a servant in the Valentine household.

Evelyn responded calmly, "Then you'd better have several. The Valentines are in dire need of heirs. With your fertility, Mrs. Valentine will surely treasure you."

Isabella's face stiffened.

How could this woman show no jealousy? Was she implying she was a breeding sow?

Her teeth clenched in anger, but she maintained her composure.

She needed to uncover that secret—fast.

"Let's eat," Vincent interrupted, his gaze lingering thoughtfully on Evelyn.

This girl was too composed, leaving him no opening to exploit.

Dinner ended hastily, and the group moved to the living room.

Evelyn knew the real drama was just beginning.

Sure enough, Vincent slid a photograph toward her.

It was a picture of her and Alexander.

Her pupils contracted, her fingers trembling slightly.

Across from her, Adrian's eyes darkened with murderous fury.

Isabella seized the moment. "Evelyn, who is this? You two look very close."

Evelyn gently traced the man's face in the photo.

Remembering how Adrian had accused her of betrayal because of these pictures, a vengeful impulse surged within her.

She lifted her gaze, meeting Adrian's furious stare, her voice soft but unwavering. "This is the man I love."

Adrian froze as if struck by lightning.

Hearing her admit it aloud felt like his heart was being torn apart.

"Mr. Langley, where did you get this?" Evelyn fought back tears.

She hadn't expected such an unexpected lead tonight.

"Found it in a locked safe while cleaning the old family estate," Vincent lied smoothly. "You were close with this young man?"

Evelyn's stare turned piercing. "He disappeared four years ago. Have you met him, Mr. Langley?"

So Adrian had gotten the photos from Vincent.

Was Alexander's death connected to them?

Alexander, if they really killed you...

I swear, I'll make them pay in blood.

Vincent shook his head. "No, I just thought he might know you, so I brought it back."

In truth, he had ordered Alexander's assassination. But another group had intervened, and the map had gone missing.

Now that Evelyn had resurfaced, she was the most likely person to have seen it.

Evelyn cradled the photo carefully, the young man's smile still radiant. "May I keep this?"
###Chapter 44

Vincent Langley's sharp gaze lingered on Evelyn. His decision to summon her back had borne fruit.

"Take it if you like."

Evelyn tightened her grip on the photograph and stood. "Thank you, Mr. Langley. I'll take my leave now, but I'll visit again soon."

Vincent didn't stop her. There would be plenty of time—as long as she kept returning, he would eventually get what he wanted.

Evelyn strode briskly toward the exit.

Adrian Valentine seized the first opportunity to excuse himself.

Isabella Langley scowled, but Vincent understood Adrian's intentions all too well. He held his daughter back.

Adrian was furious. If Isabella followed him now, she would only suffer his wrath.

Evelyn had admitted the truth herself. Adrian wouldn't let her off easily.

A man's vengeance was far more terrifying than a woman's—especially a man as proud as Adrian Valentine.

The moment Evelyn stepped out of the Langley estate, Adrian blocked her path.

She frowned at the enraged man before her. His expression was chilling.

"Adrian, shouldn't you be with the mother of your child? Why are you stopping me?"

Before she could finish, his hand closed around her throat.

Her breath cut off instantly. His eyes were icy, his gaze sharp as a blade.

Evelyn cursed his entire bloodline in her mind. This man always went for her throat, reveling in her pain.

"Evelyn, was playing with my feelings fun?"

She choked, her chest burning with fury. This was the man she had once loved—now desperate to destroy her.

"Let... go."

Adrian released her abruptly when he saw her face flush crimson.

He shook his hand as if disgusted.

Evelyn gasped for air, coughing violently.

A single tear slipped free. Even now, he could still hurt her so easily.

Adrian's breath hitched at the sight of her tears. The red marks on her pale neck, the bruises forming near her collarbone—he saw them all.

He averted his gaze, his hands clenched at his sides, knuckles white.

Then her cold voice sliced through the silence.

"Adrian, weren't you just pretending too? Don't be a sore loser. Our marriage is over. I can love whoever I want—it's none of your business."

"And stop bullying me. I'm just the woman you betrayed and abandoned. I feel pain too, Adrian. I'm human. Stay away from me from now on."

Her last words ignited his fury. He wanted to strangle her right then.

He was used to her docile, efficient demeanor. Now, faced with this thorny version of her, all he wanted was to break her wings.

"Evelyn, you're the one who should stay away," Adrian snarled. "I underestimated you. First Sebastian Cortez—how many others have you seduced behind my back?"

Evelyn let out a bitter laugh.

Adrian narrowed his eyes. "What's so funny?"

She lifted her chin, burying the pain inside. Her hollow expression sent a jolt through him.

Her piercing gaze seemed to see straight through him.

"Adrian, haven't you heard of a clean break? Since we're divorced, why keep harassing me? Or did my walking away so easily wound your pride?"
###Chapter 45

Adrian Valentine's face was as cold as frost, his piercing gaze sharp enough to cut through steel.

Evelyn Roland lifted her chin defiantly, her long lashes trembling as a mist gathered in her eyes. "Adrian, don't forget—you were the one who walked away first. A few photos were all it took for you to condemn me. In this marriage, I was nothing but a plaything to you."

She drew a shaky breath, her voice feather-light. "I surrender. This love isn't worth it. Letting go is better for both of us. Why cling to something broken?"

She could never understand his obsession. In love, Adrian was like a petulant child—domineering, unyielding, leaving her no choice but to retreat.

Perhaps divorce was inevitable.

Too many secrets lay between them.

Staying together would only bring mutual torment.

Though there were regrets, at least they had once loved sincerely.

Adrian simply couldn't let go.

Dark currents churned in Adrian's eyes when he suddenly caught movement in the bushes.

His expression hardened, voice dropping to an icy whisper. "Evelyn, don't flatter yourself. You disgust me. Get lost."

The words stabbed like a knife. Evelyn's pupils contracted, the light in her eyes snuffing out instantly.

Without a word, she turned and walked toward the street.

Her high heel caught on something, sending her crashing to the pavement.

"Ah—!" Sharp pain lanced through her knees, the metallic tang of blood filling the air. Gritting her teeth, she pushed herself up, crimson already streaking down her leg.

The pain cleared her mind instantly.

Her hand flew to her abdomen.

The baby couldn't be harmed.

Clenching her jaw, she forced herself forward step by agonizing step.

Adrian remained rooted in place, his knuckles whitening as he stared at the vivid red staining the ground.

The shadowy figure in the distance kept him from rushing to her.

His chest ached, but his face betrayed nothing.

"Boss!" Sophia Blanchet hurried from the car to support her.

Evelyn examined the wound—a thumbtack embedded deep in her knee.

Only then did she notice the dozens of sharp tacks scattered across the pavement.

Her gaze flickered toward Adrian's rigid silhouette before she wordlessly climbed into the car.

Adrian's eyes darkened as they traced the glinting tacks.

"Mr. Valentine." Victor Ashcroft emerged from the shadows.

Adrian yanked the car door open, his voice glacial. "Who did this?"

Victor lowered his voice. "Director Lin's assistant. I saw him lurking earlier, scattering something. Didn't realize it was tacks."

Adrian crossed his long legs, fingers tapping against his knee. "What else have you uncovered?"
###Chapter 46

Adrian Valentine glanced at the villa's silhouette and murmured, "We'll discuss this inside, sir."

His Adam's apple bobbed as he rasped, "Move."

The image of those slender legs marred by blood flashed through his mind. His fist clenched at his side.

Dark currents swirled in his peach-blossom eyes, barely contained fury threatening to break free.

Victor Ashcroft caught his boss's icy profile in the rearview mirror and suppressed a shiver.

Was that... concern?

He cursed himself for failing to see through Dominic Lombardi's scheme.

"Any leads on Evelyn Roland's connection to Sebastian Cortez?"

Victor narrowed his eyes. "Mrs. Roland lived in that town, but few ever saw her. Her only known interaction with Cortez was during the Mercury-Britannia Project negotiations—the deal that elevated the Roland Group."

Information about the lady remained frustratingly scarce.

She was an enigma.

Adrian stared at the ink-black night outside, his gaze darker still. "Dig up everything on Alexander Durand."

Victor hesitated. "Vincent Langley's also investigating Durand. His sudden interest in Mrs. Roland is... peculiar."

Even stranger—her records before eighteen had been scrubbed clean.

Adrian's expression turned glacial.

Vincent Langley sought Durand, prompting Evelyn's return to the Langley family. And Evelyn risked everything for Durand.

The realization sent white-hot rage through his veins.

"Drop everything. Durand takes priority." His voice was sandpaper rough, the suppressed anger dropping the car's temperature.

Victor's spine prickled. "Understood."

——

Dominic Lombardi stood bowed in the Langley living room, recounting the altercation at the gates.

When he described Evelyn's bleeding wound and Adrian's public humiliation, Isabella Langley's red lips curled in satisfaction.

"Father, Adrian despises her now. Once we have the map, we'll dispose of her properly."

Vincent Langley stroked his jade ring approvingly.

This was his true daughter.

"Maintain appearances," he cautioned meaningfully. "As for the rest..."

Eleanor Langley smoothed her daughter's hair, venom leaking from her eyes. "Adrian's foolish sister loathes Evelyn. A proxy killer leaves no traces."

Isabella twirled her crystal glass, smile sinister.

Christian Lefèvre had been silenced forever.

No one would stand in her way.

——

Evelyn slammed the door, her wound throbbing.

After Victoria Laurent finished bandaging her, she marched upstairs.

The balcony tea set steamed as she scrubbed it mechanically.

"Eat something." Victoria brought beef noodles whose aroma made her stomach clench.

She bent over the bowl, steam reddening her eyes.

Adrian's glacial stare flashed through her mind. The noodles turned to ash in her mouth.
###Chapter 47

The nail at the Langley family's gate made Evelyn's heart clench.

She stared at the wound on her knee, her gaze turning icy.

Alexander Durand's death was no accident.

Vincent Langley was testing her.

The secret of that map must have been exposed.

Evelyn stirred the noodles in her bowl, thoughts swirling. Isabella's hostility wasn't just because of Adrian. There had to be more to it.

She set down the empty bowl and walked slowly to the backyard.

As the heir to Sterling Manor, she had undergone rigorous training since age three. She had mastered every skill required.

The basement's iris recognition system activated. The heavy glass door slid open silently.

"Miss Evelyn!" Gabrielle Flores bounded forward eagerly.

Her eyes fixed on Evelyn's belly, brimming with anticipation.

"It's too early," Evelyn chuckled.

"Soon!" Gabrielle counted on her fingers. "I've already prepared all the baby supplies. Let me take care of them when they're born."

Excitement sparkled in her eyes as she fantasized about studying the brains of genius babies.

Evelyn approached Christian Lefèvre's bedside, frowning slightly.

"Still no response?"

"His fingers twitch occasionally," Gabrielle sighed. "But he has no will to live."

Evelyn took out silver needles. No matter how long it took, she would keep her promise to preserve this man's life.

After the acupuncture session, she handed Gabrielle a prescription.

"Asthma formula. Needed in six months."

Gabrielle accepted it like a treasure. "Leave it to me!"

Her eyes gleamed as she leaned closer to Evelyn's belly. "Let me hear the babies' heartbeats."

"Planning to study them again?" Evelyn saw right through her.

Gabrielle stuck out her tongue playfully.

Back in her bedroom, Evelyn surveyed the luxurious yet empty space. A pang of loneliness washed over her.

Hot water rinsed away her fatigue as she carefully dried her hair.

At four months pregnant, her belly showed clearly. The twins made her abdomen swell noticeably.

This winter, she planned to focus on her pregnancy.

Sleep came quickly.

The next morning, a shrill phone ring jolted her awake.

Eyes still closed, Evelyn fumbled for her phone and pressed answer in a daze.
###Chapter 48

"Evelyn, you killed the old madam! Get your ass to the Valentine estate now!" Eleanor Langley's shrill voice pierced through the phone.

Evelyn jolted awake.

Her grip tightened around the phone. "Say that again."

"Stop playing dumb! You poisoned her medicine while scheming for her shares. Now she's in a coma and the transfer documents are missing. Get over here immediately!"

Evelyn's brow furrowed. She had clearly refused Beatrice's offer. How could this happen?

Only four people had been present that day.

Margaret Valentine had always coveted those shares. The missing documents had to be her doing.

"I'll be right there." Evelyn hung up and dialed Zachary.

"Miss Roland."

"Send a team to investigate the Valentine shares. Focus on Margaret and Adrian. Monitor the stock market closely. If 15% shares appear under their names, detain them immediately. Move fast and stay undercover."

"Understood."

Evelyn sent Gabrielle an encrypted message for covert action.

She washed up swiftly, prepared her medical kit, and had Sophia drive her to the Valentine mansion.

Twenty minutes later, Evelyn stepped through the gates.

The familiar villa made her pause. She hadn't expected to return so soon.

And under such humiliating circumstances.

Ice formed in her eyes. This time, she wouldn't hold back.

Adrian and Margaret stood in the grand hall. A trembling maid knelt on the floor.

Margaret's eyes gleamed with malice when she spotted Evelyn.

Evelyn met Adrian's gaze.

Those once-gentle eyes now cut like knives.

Her heart twisted violently.

Even knowing he wouldn't believe her, she'd still clung to hope.

"Evelyn, why would you hurt Grandmother?" Adrian's voice was hoarse, his eyes bloodshot.

Pain lanced through Evelyn's chest. He'd condemned her without even asking?

"I won't take blame for something I didn't do."

"Still lying? Martha confessed you paid her two million to steal the documents and poison Grandmother's medicine. You're despicable."

Adrian clenched his fists. He wished it weren't true.

But the evidence was undeniable.

Remembering her betrayal months ago, he could believe this woman capable of anything.

Crack!

A brutal slap sent Evelyn reeling.

Darkness swam in her vision. Her ears rang.

Tears spilled over, but she lifted her chin defiantly.

This wasn't the first time he'd struck her. The last time had been when he'd returned drunk with Isabella, accusing her of betrayal.

"Boss!" Sophia roared, charging forward.
###Chapter 49

"Sophia, stop." Evelyn grabbed Sophia Blanchet's wrist.

Sophia's fist froze an inch away from Adrian Valentine's nose.

Her jaw clenched, fury blazing in her eyes.

"Boss..."

"Business first." Evelyn shot Adrian a cold glance. "Once the truth comes out, you can hit him all you want."

Sophia reluctantly withdrew her hand, glaring daggers at Adrian.

Adrian stared at Evelyn's swollen cheek, his dark eyes stormy, chest heavy as if weighed down by a boulder.

She could have dodged that.

He'd put his full strength into that slap.

Evelyn pulled out a tissue and spat out blood.

Margaret Valentine's lips curled in satisfaction.

"Evelyn, confess now and spare yourself the pain," Isabella Langley taunted from behind.

Evelyn pressed her lips together, left ear ringing, half her face burning.

"Boss." Sophia's eyes reddened with心疼.

The pampered princess had never suffered such humiliation before.

The Valentines would pay.

"I'm fine." Evelyn suppressed the rising tide of pain.

"Hand over the stock transfer agreement, or you won't leave this house today," Adrian growled.

His grandmother's shares were the Valentine family's lifeline—they couldn't fall into outsider hands.

Evelyn met his gaze calmly. "I told you, I don't have it."

"Evelyn, embezzlement is a felony. No matter how much you hate Adrian, don't throw your future away." Isabella feigned shock, her smile radiant.

That slap had been so satisfying.

"Hate?" Evelyn laughed lightly, eyes glinting with shards of ice. "He's not worth it."

Adrian's breath hitched, heart squeezed by an invisible fist.

Margaret frowned impatiently. "Adrian, take Isabella to see Grandma. As for this thief, I'll let the police handle her."

They needed to end this quickly.

Adrian added coldly, "Throw that maid in jail too. Until they surrender the shares."

He'd make Evelyn beg on her knees.

Evelyn went cold, every limb numb with icy dread.

"Adrian, you claim Martha gave me the agreement. When exactly did that happen?"

Martha Dimucci's eyes darted nervously. "L-last night."

"Oh? Where did we meet?" Evelyn pressed.

Beads of sweat formed on Martha's forehead. She'd never even seen Evelyn.

"The b-back gate... Miss Langley, you can't abandon me now! I already took your two million..."

Isabella gasped dramatically. "My God! Grandma's shares are worth billions, and you fell for this?"

She turned to Evelyn, face a mask of shock. "Evelyn, how could you be so cruel?"
###Chapter 50

Evelyn arched an eyebrow slightly, the icy glint in her eyes making Isabella's heart skip a beat.

That gaze was identical to her.

Isabella clenched her fists, nails digging deep into her palms.

Why did she inherit that woman's bloodline?

"Adrian, she's glaring at me..." Isabella shrank into Adrian's arms with a whimper.

But Adrian's attention remained fixed on Evelyn.

She had changed.

His earlier panic had blinded him to it.

"Ugh—" Sophia suddenly gagged.

Evelyn turned with concern. "What's wrong?"

"Something foul just assaulted my senses." Sophia rolled her eyes dramatically.

Evelyn burst into laughter, the weight in her chest lifting slightly.

"You—!" Isabella trembled with rage.

Adrian's expression darkened. "Apologize."

Evelyn's mocking smile curled as she took in Isabella's tearful face. "She insulted my sister first."

Her voice was light as snow, sharp as ice.

So this was what men preferred.

Adrian's eyes burned with anger.

Isabella's lowered gaze flashed with venom.

Margaret suddenly snapped, "Evelyn Roland! First you stole company shares, now you poisoned Grandmother? After she treated you like her own granddaughter!"

"What?" Sophia grabbed Evelyn's wrist. "You married into the Valentines?"

Her voice shook. "All these years, you were—"

Evelyn gave a humorless smile.

She'd been blind indeed.

The Valentines were vipers—every last one except Beatrice.

Adrian watched her self-deprecating expression, his throat moving.

He remembered every contour of that face beneath his fingertips.

"Ridiculous!" Margaret shrilled. "A country girl like you should be grateful we allowed you into this family! You didn't even finish college—"

"Bullshit!" Sophia exploded. "Who the hell do you Valentines think you are? My sister is ten times the person you'll ever be!"

She jabbed a finger at Margaret. "What makes you so goddamn special? Do you shit gold bricks?"
###Chapter 51

"You... you uncultured wench!" Margaret Valentine trembled with rage, her meticulously maintained face twisting in fury.

As the matriarch of the Valentine family, she had always held herself above others. Never had she been so openly defied.

Evelyn Roland had indeed been obedient since marrying into the Valentine family.

But she didn't want a daughter-in-law who only knew how to serve tea. She wanted a noble heiress who could elevate the Valentines' status.

What did it matter if Evelyn had talent for business negotiations? Anyone could close those deals.

She looked down on this country bumpkin from the bottom of her heart.

Even if the divorce didn't happen this time, she would find a way to make her son marry Isabella Langley.

The Langley family had been thriving these past two years. An alliance with them was the wise choice.

This was the first time Evelyn had seen the elegant Margaret Valentine lose her composure. Sophia Blanchet's sharp tongue truly lived up to its reputation.

"Uncultured? You two-faced old hag are the uncultured one!" Sophia sneered.

Today, she was determined to give Evelyn the justice she deserved.

"Enough!" Adrian Valentine's voice cut through like a blade. "Evelyn, must you air our dirty laundry for all to see?"

As the head of Valentine Corporation, his wife was merely a high school graduate from the countryside. Though he never cared about such things, having his shortcomings exposed publicly ignited his fury.

Evelyn's head snapped up.

So that was it.

No wonder he wanted a secret marriage. He was ashamed of his country bumpkin wife.

Suddenly, she found it all laughable.

Natalie Lowell was right. Women in love lose all their intelligence.

How could she have been naive enough to think Adrian was different?

"Security, take them to the police station." Adrian just wanted this farce to end.

He couldn't stand the sight of Evelyn.

Every time he saw her, he remembered Christian Lefèvre's death, remembered how her heart belonged to Alexander Durand.

A sharp pain pierced Evelyn's chest.

Her lips curled into a cold smile. "Adrian, if you want to send me to the police, show me the evidence."

"Martha has already confessed. What more proof do you need?" Adrian's eyes darkened. "Don't test my patience."

With the elderly Madam Valentine just out of danger, he couldn't let this woman agitate her further.

"Oh?" Evelyn chuckled lightly. "Then I'd love to see how Mr. Valentine plans to deal with me."

She laughed at her younger self's ignorance, for loving the wrong man.

She laughed at her own stupidity, at her wishful thinking.

Those who romanticize their own suffering in love are the most pitiful.

"Evelyn, since you want to experience true torment, I'll oblige." Adrian's lips twisted into a cruel smile. "Not even Sebastian Cortez can save you now."

He raised his hand, signaling two bodyguards to seize Evelyn and Martha.
###Chapter 52

Martha trembled violently but could only stagger forward.

Heavy footsteps echoed outside the door.

A team of law enforcement officers filed in.

The captain scanned the room. "Is Madam Beatrice Valentine present?"

Margaret's pupils contracted sharply—she spotted her youngest son Gregory being escorted in.

Adrian's face darkened instantly. "Captain Song, what's the meaning of this?"

"Mr. Valentine, we received a tip that Gregory Valentine was caught illegally transferring shares belonging to your grandmother."

Adrian whirled toward Evelyn.

One side of her face remained swollen, her lips curled in mockery. "Weren't you just threatening to make my life hell, Adrian? Now you see who the real thief is?"

Isabella dug her nails into her palms.

How did this bitch manage to turn the tables again?

Rage simmered in Adrian's eyes. "Gregory!"

Gregory smirked coldly. "Martha stole them. What does that have to do with me? I thought Grandmother gave them to me."

Martha looked as if she'd been struck by lightning.

"Young Master!" Her voice shook. "But you were the one who—"

"Shut up!" Gregory narrowed his eyes. "Are you trying to get me killed?"

Martha suddenly pointed at Evelyn. "It was her! She bribed me to get back at the young master!"

Adrian's chest heaved violently. "Evelyn, do you hate me this much?"

Isabella seized the moment to fan the flames. "Adrian, a viper like her deserves—"

"Bullshit!"

A furious roar exploded from the staircase.
###Chapter 53

Martha Dimucci's face turned deathly pale. Her fingers twisted the edges of her apron unconsciously. She had personally watched Beatrice Valentine drink that glass of milk laced with sleeping pills. How could she wake up so soon?

Margaret Valentine's pupils constricted. Her nails dug deep into her palms. The sedative should have lasted at least twelve hours. How did this old hag wake up early?

"Grandmother!" The gloom in Adrian Valentine's eyes vanished as he strode forward.

Beatrice's cane struck the marble floor with a resounding crack. "If I hadn't woken up, you ungrateful wolves would have devoured Evelyn alive!"

Adrian froze mid-step. His gaze snapped toward Evelyn Roland, who stood quietly in the corner. Her long lashes cast delicate shadows under her eyes.

The air in the hall turned to ice.

Isabella Langley tugged at Adrian's sleeve with a pout. "Adrian, your grandmother just scolded me..."

Adrian's lips pressed into a thin line. He remained silent.

Beatrice descended the stairs slowly, her piercing gaze sweeping over Isabella. "Oh, playing the victim already? That pitiful act of yours suits Adrian perfectly."

A flash of venom crossed Isabella's eyes. Once she married Adrian, this old woman would be the first to permanently disappear.

"Grandmother!" Isabella's eyes welled with tears. "Adrian and I are getting engaged soon—"

"Silence!" Beatrice cut her off sharply. "Do whatever you want with this scoundrel. Just keep it away from my sight!"

Her cane struck the floor again as she turned to Adrian. "I should thank you for divorcing Evelyn. Her association with a blind, heartless bastard like you is the Valentine family's greatest shame!"

The Valentine family members paled.

Beatrice continued, "Your spiteful mother and those siblings of yours treated Evelyn like a servant. And you—" Her voice dripped with disdain. "You couldn't even bother to investigate before accusing her of theft. How admirable!"

Adrian's throat moved as his gaze involuntarily returned to Evelyn. She stood motionless, only the slight tremble of her fingertips betraying her emotions.

Sophia Blanchet trembled with rage. "Boss, is that your ex-husband?" she whispered.

Evelyn gave a faint nod.

Sophia inhaled sharply. No wonder Evelyn had been so withdrawn during her pregnancy. This man had shattered her heart.

"Grandmother, let's address the current situation first," Adrian said hoarsely. A dreadful realization began creeping into his mind—what if everything had been a misunderstanding?

Beatrice scoffed. "Martha poisoned me and stole the stock transfer documents to frame Evelyn. And you—" She looked at her favorite grandson with disappointment. "Couldn't even be bothered to verify the facts before condemning her."

Margaret's face twisted. "Mother, how can you say—"

"Enough!" Beatrice thundered. "Don't think I don't know you orchestrated this. Starting today, I'm moving out of the estate. I'll transfer all my shares to Adrian—at least he knows how to run the company."

She closed her eyes wearily. "As for the rest of you... you're on your own."
###Chapter 54

"Grandmother, you're playing favorites." Gregory clenched his fists, his eyes dark with resentment.

The Dowager scoffed. "Hearts are always biased. Some have blood on their hands yet remain oblivious—they deserve no fairness."

She knew this family's true nature all too well.

Gregory's face turned ashen.

Was this old hag making veiled accusations?

In the end, the Dowager signed the equity transfer agreement, handing all her shares to Adrian.

Margaret trembled with rage but stayed silent. Her scheme against Evelyn had backfired, benefiting Adrian instead.

A complete and utter loss.

Isabella hid a smirk. The richer Adrian became, the better her life would be.

Gregory stormed out, slamming the door behind him.

Martha was taken away by the police.

Evelyn's name was finally cleared.

The Dowager gazed at Evelyn with sorrow.

Evelyn understood. To protect the Valentines' reputation, the Dowager had chosen to endure humiliation rather than air their dirty laundry.

Sacrificing for the greater good.

"Evelyn, we owe you today. But I'm sorry Adrian struck you." The Dowager's voice cracked.

The woman who had treated her illness had slipped away unnoticed, witnessing everything from the shadows.

The Valentines' world was too treacherous. Evelyn's departure was for the best.

If Isabella wanted to play the fool, let her—she'd pay the price eventually.

The Dowager only wished to protect Evelyn's kind heart.

Her son's mysterious death years ago—the killer was in this very house. Now they'd targeted her too. She was exhausted.

But she couldn't collapse yet. She had to uncover the truth about her son's death.

For now, Evelyn would have to bear the injustice.

"As long as you're safe, Grandmother." Evelyn smiled faintly.

"I'll be fine. Live well, find a man who cherishes you, have beautiful children. Evelyn, you must be happy."

The Dowager's eyes glistened. After this parting, who knew when they'd meet again? The Valentines didn't deserve her.

Seeing the tears in the Dowager's eyes, Evelyn knew her affection was genuine.

"Take care, Grandmother. I'm leaving now." Evelyn walked out of the villa without looking back.

Sophia shot Adrian a glare before following.

Adrian's gaze lingered on that slender retreating figure. This time, he'd wronged her.

"Adrian, take me to the Courtyard Villa. I'll live there from now on." The Dowager rose and instructed Martha to pack.

Margaret watched coldly. Good riddance to this useless old woman.

Adrian personally drove the Dowager to her retirement home—a property she'd prepared long ago.

Stripped of her shares, she was now worthless to the Valentines.

Here, at least, she'd have peace.

She sent Martha to tidy the rooms while she led Adrian to the garden—the safest place to talk.

Besides herself, she trusted only Evelyn.

That girl had a pure heart.

Settling into a wicker chair, she studied her grandson. His handsome face was icy, his eyes terrifyingly hollow.

She'd raised him. She knew him best.

"Adrian, there are countless ways to love. Must you hurt Evelyn like this?"
###Chapter 55

Adrian Valentine lowered his gaze in silence.

The elderly matriarch sighed deeply, her wrinkled face etched with concern.

After all, he was the grandson she had raised with her own hands. She couldn't bring herself to scold him harshly.

His innate arrogance and stubbornness had been there since birth—unyielding and fierce, never tempered by gentleness.

His path in love was destined to be fraught with pain, leaving him battered and bruised.

"Adrian, Evelyn is one of the few who genuinely cares for you. Though I don't know what happened between you, Isabella is not the right one for you."

"Grandmother, I know what I'm doing. Rest well, and I'll visit again soon."

He stood, his posture rigid and unyielding.

The matriarch hesitated, then swallowed her words. The divorce was final—there was no point in arguing.

"Today's incident was orchestrated by your brother and your mother, with Martha's help, to frame Evelyn. For the sake of the Valentine family's reputation, I had no choice but to wrong her. Remember this—trust no one completely, not even your own mother. If you're ever in danger, go to Evelyn. No matter how many times you've wronged her, she will never abandon you."

Adrian's steps faltered for a brief moment before he left without another word.

......

Evelyn Roland leaned against the sofa as Victoria Laurent gently pressed an ice pack to her swollen cheek.

Seeing Evelyn's tear-reddened almond eyes, Victoria clenched her teeth in fury.

Those Langley beasts would pay for this—sooner or later.

"Miss..." Victoria's voice trembled.

Evelyn lifted her gaze, a faint smile touching her lips, though her eyes held shattered light. "This is the last time. From now on, no one will ever hurt me again."

A heart that had died could no longer be pierced by blades or bullets.

Victoria tightened her fists. "Next time, let Sophia beat them black and blue!"

Evelyn patted her hand gently. "Go rest. I'll sleep for a while."

Once the door clicked shut, Evelyn stared blankly at the ceiling.

That slap had shattered every last delusion she held.

From now on, no matter how vast the world, her heart would never waver for him again.

With swift efficiency, she removed her phone's SIM card and replaced it with a new one. The past was smoke—everything tied to the Langleys was now severed.

......

Three days passed before the bruise on her cheek began to fade. Adrian's strike had been so forceful it had even damaged her eardrum, requiring slow recovery through herbal remedies.

Strangely, her appetite had improved—especially for beef. Victoria prepared it in every variation to help her regain strength.

On the fourth day, Evelyn went as usual to administer acupuncture to Christian Lefèvre. The man remained unconscious, but she didn't care. Keeping him alive was already more than he deserved.

Her priority now was finalizing the raw material supply deal with the Lowells.

After inspecting the factory that afternoon and confirming quality control, she had Nathan Aldridge arrange a meeting with Mr. Lowell.

She deliberately brought Sophia Blanchet along. Securing this deal would guarantee this year's profits.

Coincidentally, Adrian had also scheduled a meeting with Mr. Lowell.

As Isabella Langley clung to Adrian's arm and entered the private dining room, Evelyn came face-to-face with the middle-aged man who had once fled a banquet with a woman in his arms.
###Chapter 56

Isabella's fingers trembled slightly as memories from that banquet flashed through her mind.

She had not only ignored the unconscious girl but even kicked her harshly.

Who would have guessed that was Theodore Lowell's precious daughter?

If she had known, she would never have let Evelyn take the credit.

"Mr. Lowell, your presence honors us," Adrian stepped forward to shake hands.

Theodore studied the young man before him.

Adrian's refined features exuded natural nobility, yet carried an undercurrent of sharp intensity.

"You flatter me, Mr. Valentine. Though today I've also arranged to meet with Nathan from Sterling Manor."

His preference leaned toward Sterling Manor, given their substantial resources.

Adrian's eyes darkened—this negotiation wouldn't be straightforward.

"Mr. Lowell, I'm Isabella Langley." She introduced herself with practiced grace.

Theodore gave a polite nod.

Isabella breathed an inward sigh of relief—he didn't seem to recognize her.

"At that banquet, when your daughter fainted, my sister and I provided immediate assistance," she ventured carefully.

"Oh?" Theodore's gaze sharpened. "You were there?"

"Yes, I went to notify your family. Unfortunately, it became too chaotic, and by the time I returned, you'd already left."

She deliberately kept her account vague.

Adrian arched a brow at Isabella, surprised by this unexpected connection.

Theodore's expression softened. "Thanks to your help, my daughter recovered safely."

After a thoughtful pause, he continued, "In that case, I'll award this contract to Valentine Group."

Isabella's pulse quickened—success had come more easily than expected.

Adrian showed a flicker of surprise. "You won't regret this decision, Mr. Lowell."

"Frankly, I favored Sterling Manor," Theodore admitted bluntly. "But to repay Miss Langley's kindness, I'll make an exception this time."

He always settled debts clearly.

"Speaking of which, Miss Langley, I heard your sister possesses some evidence? Could you ask her to share it with me?"

He was gathering proof to sue the man who harmed his daughter.

Isabella's smile froze. "I'll relay your request."

What evidence? How would Evelyn have access to such things?

As she calculated silently, an assistant hurried in.

"Chairman, Mr. Aldridge has arrived."
###Chapter 57

Nathan Aldridge gave a slight nod. "Show them in."

If a deal couldn't be made, it was best to reject it outright.

Isabella Langley's fingertips trembled slightly. If Evelyn showed up now, everything would be ruined.

She bit her lower lip, lowering her gaze to hide her panic.

Footsteps approached, and a tall figure entered the conference room.

Nathan was strikingly handsome, with features like a painting. His every movement exuded effortless elegance, a faint smile playing at his lips.

"Chairman Lowell," he inclined his head slightly. "An honor."

His gaze swept past Adrian Valentine and Isabella, a flicker of coldness in his eyes.

Sophia Blanchet had already told him everything about these two.

Chairman Lowell warmly gestured for him to take a seat.

Adrian looked up, meeting Nathan's eyes, his handsome face darkening.

Evelyn was never short of exceptional men around her.

Nathan returned the look with a knowing smile.

Chairman Lowell offered an apologetic smile. "Mr. Aldridge, I must apologize. I’ve already decided to work with Mr. Valentine."

Nathan remained composed. "Business is war, Chairman. No need for regrets. Though the young mistress will be disappointed when she hears."

He rose gracefully, his smile still perfectly polite. "Then I won’t take up any more of your time."

Chairman Lowell quickly added, "I heard the young mistress has returned to the country. There will be plenty of opportunities for future collaborations. This time, it was purely a personal matter..."

Nathan's eyes gleamed. "The NovaCore project was under her direct supervision. A true shame."

At the mention of the young mistress, pride flashed in his gaze. "She earned five doctoral degrees by eighteen. The President himself granted her special privileges."

His words sent ripples of reaction through the room.

Isabella trembled with envy.

Adrian, however, only cared about why Evelyn hadn’t come.

Chairman Lowell turned to Adrian. "Mr. Valentine, shall we proceed with the signing?"

After confirming the contract, the signing was swiftly completed.

Isabella forced a smile. "Chairman Lowell, you truly are a devoted family man."

Once the chairman left, Isabella hurriedly said, "Adrian, I should go."

She had to find Evelyn before tomorrow.

Adrian responded indifferently. "Mm. Have the driver take you. Thank you for today."
###Chapter 58

Isabella nestled in his arms, her gaze soft as water. "Adrian, we're getting married soon. I'm happy to help you. Don't be so formal with me. I'll go handle some matters first. Let's meet tomorrow and visit Mr. Lowell together."

Adrian frowned slightly. "Who is this sister you mentioned earlier?"

Isabella's eyes flickered. Of course, she couldn't tell him that sister was Evelyn.

"Just someone I know. I need to get some documents from her."

"Go ahead." A cold glint flashed in Adrian's eyes as he watched Isabella leave. The moment she was gone, he turned and strode toward Nathan.

On the other side of the banquet hall.

Evelyn had rushed to the restroom after catching a whiff of something pungent. She retched for a while before finally stepping out, only to bump into a dejected Nathan.

She didn’t need to ask—the deal had fallen through.

"B—"

"Nathan!" Evelyn cut him off sharply, scanning their surroundings with caution.

"E-Evelyn... Mr. Lowell chose to work with Adrian. Said it was for personal reasons." Nathan raked a frustrated hand through his hair.

Personal reasons?

Evelyn pondered this. Business was war—these things happened.

"It's fine. We'll find another supplier. Worst case, we proceed with production directly." Her voice was calm.

Nathan brightened. "I'm relieved you think that way. But I have another client meeting. Are you sure you won’t come?"

Evelyn shook her head. "I'm not feeling well. I'll wait for you in the upstairs lounge. Call me when you're done."

Watching Nathan disappear into the elevator, Evelyn exhaled slowly. She ordered a fresh orange juice and made her way up the stairs to the second-floor lounge.

The juice arrived quickly.

She took small sips, the sweet tang soothing her unsettled stomach. Her hand drifted to her abdomen, still hidden beneath loose fabric.

"Be good, little one. Don’t make Mommy suffer too much," she murmured tenderly.

The door suddenly burst open.

Evelyn looked up—her smile froze.

Adrian leaned against the doorframe, his gaze burning into her. "What? No smile for me?"

Evelyn lounged on the sofa, bare feet tucked beneath her like a regal cat.

"Wrong room, Mr. Valentine. The door’s right there. Feel free to use it."

She fiddled with her straw, not even granting him a glance.

Adrian advanced, his presence radiating danger.

"Just because we’re divorced doesn’t mean we can’t be civil."

He sat beside her. The familiar scent of her perfume teased his senses, sending an unwanted pang through his chest.

Damn this longing.

But the thought of her heart belonging to someone else ignited his fury all over again.

Evelyn scoffed. "Since when did you become so childish? Didn’t you call me filthy? Then keep your distance. And for the record—I think you’re pretty disgusting too."

She shifted pointedly away.
###Chapter 59

Adrian Valentine's eyes darkened as he seized Evelyn Roland's wrist. "Evelyn, I was wrong about the shares. That slap... I apologize."

Her lashes fluttered. She hadn't expected the proud Adrian to lower his head.

The sting of that slap still burned her cheek.

Hugging her knees, she whispered, "Adrian, let the past stay in the past. We were never meant to be. From now on, we're strangers."

This was her final decision.

Aside from hiding her identity, she had no regrets about their marriage.

She had planned to reveal everything on her birthday—but fate had other plans.

A storm brewed in Adrian's gaze as he suddenly yanked her into his arms.

The familiar scent of peach blossoms enveloped her, unraveling his control.

"Let go!" Evelyn struggled fiercely.

He pressed a kiss to her earlobe before releasing her.

"Mr. Valentine, have some dignity." Her eyes blazed. "We're divorced."

Adrian narrowed his eyes. "How do you know Sebastian Cortez?"

"Business." She turned away.

With a cold laugh, he strode off.

Watching his retreating figure, a sharp pain pierced her chest.

Sweet memories turned to knives, reopening old wounds.

Her phone rang—Nathan Aldridge was calling.

Isabella Langley frantically dialed Evelyn's number, but the calls wouldn't connect.

She rushed downstairs. "Mom, Dad, we need to reach Evelyn now! The truth will come out tomorrow!"

After hearing her out, Vincent Langley frowned. "Good timing, but we need certainty."

"Dad! She's not answering!" Isabella stomped in frustration.

Eleanor Langley soothed, "Don't panic. I know how to make her hand over the evidence."

Yet call after call failed.

"Did she block us all?" Isabella's face twisted with fury.

Vincent tried a backup phone—still no response.

Isabella's eyes turned icy. "She's cutting ties with us for good."
###Chapter 60

Vincent Langley patted his daughter's shoulder. "The contract is signed. The evidence can wait. As long as Evelyn doesn't show up, Natalie won't suspect anything."

Isabella nodded.

She planned to make an excuse to cancel tomorrow's meeting and deal with it later.

......

Evelyn had recently become obsessed with Victoria's braised beef.

In the living room, three strikingly different women were occupied with their own activities.

Sophia Blanchet curled up on the couch playing a game.

Victoria brought out freshly braised beef paired with a light vegetable soup.

"Delicious!" Evelyn took a bite and closed her eyes in satisfaction. "Your cooking keeps improving, Vicky."

Victoria's eyes curved into crescents as she smiled. "What would you like tomorrow, sis?"

"Let's switch to fish," Evelyn mused.

"Got it!" Victoria turned toward the kitchen to prepare fruit.

Evelyn glanced at Sophia. "Any updates on Melanie?"

"Her surgery is the day after tomorrow," Sophia set her phone down.

Evelyn tapped the table lightly with her fingertips. "Keep a close eye on things. No slip-ups. We still need Melanie as a pawn."

Sophia smirked knowingly. "Don't worry. Everything's arranged."

"Calling me 'sis' sounds much better than 'boss,'" Evelyn teased. "If you keep saying 'boss' all the time, people might think I'm running a crime syndicate."

Sophia suddenly stared at her intently. "Sis, I like you!"

Clatter—

Evelyn's chopsticks fell to the floor.

Victoria froze in the kitchen doorway, holding a fruit platter.

Sophia belatedly flushed red. "Not that kind of liking! Sisterly affection! What were you two thinking?"

Evelyn exhaled deeply, nearly choking on her beef.

Thinking about having to deal with the Lowells tomorrow, she rubbed her temples.

......

The next morning.

Evelyn took Sophia with her to negotiate a materials partnership.

Just as they reached the club entrance, Isabella suddenly blocked their path.
###Chapter 61

Evelyn Roland had never been known for her patience.

Isabella Langley was like two completely different people—one brazen and domineering in front of Evelyn, the other frail and delicate in Adrian Valentine's presence.

The fact that Isabella had managed to intercept her here meant she'd done her homework—Nathan Aldridge was in town for business negotiations, and his assistant would naturally accompany him.

"Evelyn, why aren't you answering your calls?" Isabella frowned deeply.

Evelyn thought of the SIM card she'd discarded last night and replied coolly, "Lost my phone. What do you want?"

So it wasn't a block. Isabella exhaled silently in relief.

"Give me the evidence on Chairman Lowell's daughter." She held out her hand, her posture dripping with arrogance.

A flicker of wariness crossed Evelyn's eyes. "Why do you need it?"

"To help that poor woman get a divorce, of course." Isabella's smile was saccharine. "You don't want to see her keep suffering, do you?"

Evelyn almost laughed. Where was this sudden saintly concern when she'd stood by and done nothing before?

"Like I said—lost phone, lost video."

"What?" Isabella's pupils constricted, her voice sharpening. "Where did you lose it?"

Evelyn noted the odd reaction. Logically, Chairman Lowell himself should be demanding the evidence. Why go through Isabella?

Nathan's figure appeared at the end of the corridor. Evelyn brushed past Isabella without another word.

Isabella glared at her retreating back, stomping her heel in frustration. How was she supposed to explain this to Chairman Lowell?

Then it hit her—hotel surveillance.

A black sedan sped away. All she needed was to retrieve the footage and delete the part where she'd kicked Natalie. The contract was already signed—Lowell couldn't back out now.

This deal had solidified her standing in Adrian's eyes. Margaret Valentine had even arranged a celebratory dinner in her honor.

Evelyn caught Sophia Blanchet's eye and signaled for her to tail Isabella.

After a brief exchange with Nathan, she settled into a corner of the lobby, reviewing documents from three companies. Samples were laid out on the table, each meticulously inspected.

Lowell Group's materials were superior, but their prices doubled the competition's. At those rates, profit margins vanished.

She ran simulations on her laptop. Each attempt failed. Her fingers tapped the desk, brow furrowing.

Lowell currently monopolized the core technology domestically, and they'd chosen Adrian. Dragging this out was pointless.

Her phone camera focused on a sample. The shutter clicked.

[Sebastian, find me manufacturers for this raw material.]

Sebastian Cortez replied instantly: [Lowell deal fell through?]

Evelyn: [Yes. We'll produce it ourselves. Tech isn't the issue.]

Sebastian: [Should've done this sooner. I'll have answers by tomorrow.]

The screen's glow caught the faint curve of her lips.
###Chapter 62 

Evelyn Roland was massaging her sore back on the sofa when Sebastian Cortez's message popped up.

[The old man told me everything. Don't overwork yourself.]

Her fingers tapped lightly on the screen. [I'll be careful.]

Sebastian replied again: [No tough act. What do you want for your birthday?]

A smile tugged at Evelyn's lips. [I'll love anything from you!]

A head-patting emoji appeared in the chat.

Still smiling, she exited the conversation and texted Nathan Aldridge: [Come back. The deal's off.]

Her hand rested on the slight swell of her abdomen. Independent R&D took longer, but it was safer.

With five top engineers at her disposal, this project would be hers.

She shut her laptop and carefully packed the prototype into her bag.

Standing up, she winced at the sharp ache in her lower back.

Under the hallway lights, two tall figures approached.

Adrian Valentine and Julian Roscente wore matching tailored suits, their presence impossible to ignore.

Evelyn gave them a curt nod and walked past.

True to his word, Adrian hadn't bothered her since the divorce.

"Divorce did wonders for her," Julian whistled. "That figure, that poise—"

Adrian's gaze turned glacial.

"They say divorce is the best cosmetic procedure for women," Julian continued, undeterred. "Wonder who'll get lucky."

He smirked at Sebastian's message still visible on Evelyn's phone.

Adrian watched Evelyn's retreating figure, his knuckles whitening as she laughed with Nathan by the hotel entrance.

"Let's go." His voice could freeze hell.

Julian caught up. "The old man's forcing me to marry some Sterling Manor heiress I've never even—"

One look from Adrian silenced him.

In the lobby, Nathan held the car door open for Evelyn.

Adrian's eyes narrowed.

"Oh, and your mother's throwing a party for Isabella—" Julian began.

"Get lost."

Julian shrugged. Yeah, totally over her.

————

Isabella Langley clicked across the marble lobby in stilettos.

"Manager, I lost an earring in the summit lounge last week." She slid an envelope across the desk. "Could you check the surveillance?"

The manager eyed the elegant young woman, then the thick envelope.

"Sorry. That area isn't covered by cameras." He pushed it back.
###Chapter 63

Isabella's smile froze on her face.

"No surveillance footage?" Her voice rose sharply.

She snatched the cash back from the manager's hand.

"You dare take money without proof?" She sneered.

The manager's expression darkened.

He'd thought her an easy mark, but she was nitpicking over every penny.

With a contemptuous glance, he turned and walked away.

Isabella stomped her foot in frustration.

Her carefully laid plans had crumbled to dust.

She bit her lower lip so hard it nearly bled.

She'd imagined presenting her triumph to Mr. Lowell.

When Mrs. Valentine mentioned a celebration banquet, she'd eagerly agreed.

The prospect of Chairman Lowell attending had thrilled her beyond measure.

But now...

Evelyn's phone was gone!

Fuming, she stormed off, oblivious to Sophia watching from the shadows.

Inside her car, Isabella dialed Adrian's number.

"Yes." His cool voice answered.

That voice alone lifted her spirits instantly.

"Adrian..." She cooed. "The evidence is gone. Evelyn lost her phone."

"I'll handle it." Adrian replied curtly.

The call ended abruptly.

Isabella pouted.

But knowing Adrian would fix everything reassured her.

"Take me to the spa." She ordered the driver.

Evelyn sat waiting at the restaurant for Sophia.

Her laptop screen glowed brightly.

She was clearing her backlog of emails.

Returning to the company meant reviving shelved projects.

But securing raw material supplies was the priority.

She focused intently on equipment simulations.

Once. Twice...

On the fifth attempt, a success notification flashed onscreen.

"I did it!" She slammed the table excitedly.

She quickly saved and encrypted the video file.

With trembling fingers, she called Sebastian.

"Evelyn, I'm in a meeting." Her brother's voice remained gentle.

"Sebastian! I succeeded!" Her voice choked with emotion.

Three years of effort had finally borne fruit.

A brief silence followed.

"I always knew you could." Pride colored Sebastian's words.

"Of course." She laughed through tears.

"If only Alexander..." Her voice caught.

"Evelyn..." Sebastian hesitated.

"I have to go." She ended the call hastily.

Tears blurred her vision.

That tender voice echoed in her memory:

"Evelyn, don't fear the dark."

"Evelyn, I'm here."

She drew a deep breath and wiped her tears.

Vincent would likely make his move soon.

Within three days, he'd surely contact her.
###Chapter 64

Proof that Vincent Langley knew about the mineral atlas would confirm he was Alexander Durand's murderer.

The truth would surface eventually.

Then she could recover Alexander's remains.

"Tears for him again?" A deep voice murmured beside her as a tall figure settled into the opposite seat.

Evelyn frowned. Why did this man keep appearing everywhere?

She swiftly wiped her tears, regaining her usual aloofness. "Adrian, we agreed not to interfere with each other."

Adrian's lips curved slightly as he elegantly offered a tissue.

"Your cheeks are still wet."

She turned away, brushing her eyes with the back of her hand.

His gaze darkened, placing the tissue on the table.

Watching her cry for another man stirred dangerous currents in his eyes.

"I kept the necklace. When will you retrieve it?" His tone was casual.

His handsome face remained impassive, revealing nothing.

Evelyn considered briefly. It was a gift from Scarlett Orlando—she couldn't lose it.

"I'll collect it when you're available." She wasn't in a hurry.

That night, Alexander's photo had made her forget about it.

Adrian studied her, noticing her dry lips. He silently ordered hot water before standing to leave.

Evelyn lowered her eyes, pain flickering in their depths.

He promised not to disturb her, yet kept unsettling her heart.

Her fingers brushed the warm cup, but the heat couldn't reach her chest.

Instinctively, she glanced up at Adrian's retreating figure, recalling his tenderness:

"Evelyn, what would you like for dinner tonight?"

"Evelyn, I made chicken wraps. Sleep in—I'll handle breakfast from now on."

Memories of their love remained vivid. How had they become strangers?

She still couldn't comprehend his sudden change of heart.

Bitter sorrow welled up.

Then she realized—he hadn't specified when to collect the necklace.

Never mind. She'd ask another time.

Composing herself, she spotted Sophia Blanchet returning.

Closing her laptop, she went to meet her.

Adrian's water remained untouched.

Evelyn scoffed inwardly: "We're divorced. Stop bothering me!"

"Evelyn, I'm back." Sophia hurried over, beads of sweat on her temples.

"I see. Let's get a private room—I'm hungry."

Sophia supported her arm. "Still craving beef?"

Evelyn shook her head, tired of it lately. "They have new dishes. Actually, I'm craving tart plums—ask Victoria to buy some."

Pregnancy had altered her tastes. She used to dislike sour flavors—now she craved them.

Sophia chuckled at her longing expression. "Right away."

Evelyn pressed her lips, the imagined tartness making her mouth water.

In the private room after ordering, Sophia recounted Isabella Langley's surveillance request.

"Evelyn, why would she suddenly help Natalie Lowell?"

Evelyn fell into thought. What was Isabella plotting?
###Chapter 65

Evelyn rubbed her sleepy eyes as the afternoon sun slanted through the window. She stretched, her stomach growling in protest.

"Hungry?" Her fingers brushed the slight curve of her abdomen, a soft smile tugging at her lips.

The aroma of sweet and sour ribs wafted from the kitchen. Victoria had left them warming in the insulated container before departing. Evelyn eagerly served herself a portion.

Just as she lifted a piece to her mouth, her phone rang sharply.

"Nathan?" She frowned at the caller ID.

"Sis, the Valentine family is hosting a banquet at the Imperial Palace Hotel. Want to come?" His voice crackled with excitement.

Her chopsticks froze mid-air. "No." The refusal was crisp.

"But—"

"No buts." She cut him off. "I have zero interest in Valentine affairs."

After hanging up, her appetite vanished. She chewed mechanically, her thoughts drifting elsewhere.

When the phone rang again, she nearly choked.

"Evelyn!" Scarlett's voice pierced through the receiver. "Finally decided to show yourself?"

Evelyn sighed. Her childhood best friend always knew how to wear her down.

"I'll be there soon." She abandoned her meal and headed upstairs to change.

The Imperial Palace Hotel glittered under the night sky. As Evelyn parked, her gaze snagged on the striking couple at the entrance.

Adrian stood impeccably dressed in a tailored suit, Isabella clinging to his arm with a saccharine smile. They greeted guests like the perfect matched set they appeared to be.

Her fingers tightened around the steering wheel. A deep breath forced her eyes away.

"Evelyn!" Scarlett materialized outside her window, yanking the door open. "Daydreaming again?"

Evelyn forced a smile. "Nothing important. Let's go."

She deliberately avoided the main entrance, slipping in through a side door. But fate loved its cruel jokes—the elevator doors opened to reveal Adrian.

The air turned to ice.

His gaze skimmed over her for one heartbeat before sliding away, as if she were a stranger.

Evelyn straightened her spine and strode past without a glance. She could feel the heat of his stare between her shoulder blades but refused to turn.

"So here you are." Isabella's voice dripped with triumph behind her. "Long time no see, Ms. Roland."

Evelyn paused mid-step. She didn't turn, merely offering a flat, "Congratulations."

Scarlett shot her a worried look. "Evelyn..."

"I'm fine." She summoned a smile. "Let's get a drink."

The banquet hall buzzed with laughter and clinking glasses, but to Evelyn it was just noise. She downed her wine in one go.

"Easy there." Scarlett caught her wrist. "In your condition..."

Evelyn shook her head. "I know my limits."

Her eyes caught Nathan signaling from across the room. Following his gaze, she spotted Theodore Lowell deep in conversation with Isabella.

"I heard Isabella saved Theodore's daughter?" Evelyn murmured.

Scarlett nodded. "Quite the coincidence. The Lowell girl had a sudden heart attack right when Isabella happened to be nearby."

Evelyn traced the rim of her glass. Too convenient. Suspiciously so.

"Be right back." She stood abruptly.

At the end of the hallway, Evelyn dialed Sophia. "Pull the surveillance footage from the day the Lowell girl collapsed."

Hanging up, she caught her reflection—pale but determined.

This game was just beginning.
###Chapter 66

Isabella Langley clung affectionately to Adrian Valentine's arm, gazing up at his flawlessly chiseled profile. His brows carried an innate arrogance, his entire being radiating an icy aura that warned others to keep their distance—yet it was impossible to look away.

"Adrian, thank you for always being by my side," Isabella cooed, resting her head against his shoulder.

Adrian's dark eyes were unreadable, betraying neither joy nor anger.

Just as he was about to withdraw his arm, a familiar figure caught his peripheral vision.

Evelyn Roland strode through the crowd in a white dress, draped with a pink Maillard shawl. Her tall, graceful figure stood out effortlessly. She moved with purpose, every step confident and poised.

Isabella followed Adrian's gaze, her heart tightening.

"Evelyn! I'm so glad you could make it to tonight's banquet," Isabella chirped, her voice sickly sweet.

Evelyn, who had been heading toward the elevators, paused mid-step. Only then did she notice the pair at the entrance. Her eyes flickered to their intertwined arms, a sharp pang piercing her chest.

Nothing hurt more than seeing the man she once loved now holding another woman with such tenderness.

Her lashes trembled slightly, but her tone remained flat. "I'm here to meet a friend."

The unspoken implication: She hadn’t come for this event.

Isabella feigned surprise. "Oh dear, I must have been too busy to send you an invitation. Since you're already here, why not join us? We're practically sisters, after all."

"Sisters?" Evelyn scoffed. "That’s a title I can’t afford."

She had no desire to engage with them further. But as her gaze swept past Adrian, she found him watching her intently.

Straightening her spine, Evelyn turned to leave.

"Nathan!"

A warm, cultured voice called out. Nathan Aldridge approached, his refined demeanor a stark contrast to Adrian's cold severity.

"Go enjoy yourself. I need to find Scarlett," Evelyn said.

Nathan grinned and sidled closer. "I'll come with you."

"That won’t be necessary." Her refusal was firm.

Nathan's face fell dramatically. "Are you rejecting me?"

"Hmm, at least you're self-aware," Evelyn deadpanned.

Nathan clutched his chest in exaggerated agony. "Is our friendship really this fragile?"

Evelyn sighed, rubbing her temples. "Don’t tilt your head down. Your double chin is showing."

Nathan immediately jerked his chin up, pouting. "Fine, I'll start dieting tomorrow."

A reluctant laugh escaped Evelyn. "Let’s go."

Nathan brightened instantly, his earlier gloom vanishing. As long as Evelyn spared him even a glance, all his worries melted away.

The two walked side by side toward the elevators.

Adrian watched the entire exchange, a storm brewing in his darkened eyes. How could she smile so brightly for another man?

Isabella, seizing the opportunity, raised her voice. "Evelyn, wait!"

###Chapter 67

Evelyn paused mid-step, glancing sideways at Isabella with unreadable eyes. "Is there something else, Miss Langley?"

Isabella's gaze darted between Nathan and Evelyn, feigning innocence. "Evelyn, you seem quite close with Mr. Aldridge. Have you known each other long?"

Adrian's knuckles whitened around his glass, his darkening expression betraying his turmoil. The woman he'd divorced kept becoming more enigmatic.

Nathan's brow furrowed sharply. "And you are?"

Linking arms with Adrian, Isabella beamed. "I'm Adrian's girlfriend, Isabella Langley."

A mocking glint flashed in Nathan's eyes. He'd come tonight expecting entertainment—the whole industry knew how Isabella had snatched the lead role from Scarlett's new project.

No wonder Scarlett had been drowning her sorrows, begging him to accompany her.

Everyone knew Isabella and Adrian's engagement was imminent. Their families' intertwined interests made them the perfect power couple.

"Ah, the rising star of the hour." Nathan's smile didn't reach his eyes. "The Golden Ticket actress who replaced an award-winning lead. Your reputation precedes you."

Isabella's pulse spiked. She'd ridden Adrian's coattails to success—his company financed this very production.

"You're mistaken, Mr. Aldridge. The director made the casting decision." Her voice dripped honey. "The investment simply filled a production need I could assist with."

Maintaining her Innocent Angel persona was crucial. Gentle, talented, kind—these were her weapons for next year's awards campaign.

Adrian was merely a stepping stone to her crown.

Nathan scoffed. "Let's hope your acting justifies the budget. Sterling Manor co-produced this—if ratings tank..."

His unfinished threat drained the color from Isabella's face. This adaptation of the renowned screenwriter's work was her comeback vehicle, featuring an underdog heroine tailor-made for audience love.

Done with her dramatics, Nathan turned to Evelyn. "Shall we?"

Isabella dug her nails into her palms as she watched them leave. How did that woman command such obedience from Nathan Aldridge—Sterling Manor's second-in-command?

"Adrian!" She stamped her foot petulantly. "Are you just going to let them humiliate me?"

Adrian remained silent, his gaze fixed on the empty space where Evelyn had vanished.
###Chapter 68

Adrian Valentine's gaze swept over her with icy detachment. "What's wrong? Losing confidence in your acting skills?"

Isabella Langley froze. Crushing her opponent with sheer talent would be the ultimate satisfaction. She had complete faith in her abilities.

Her father had sent her abroad for years of intensive training. She'd honed her craft to perfection. Acting came as naturally as breathing.

The whole "switched at birth" story was a lie. She'd been sent overseas from infancy for elite training.

Evelyn Roland had been deliberately swapped by her mother.

Her father dumped the girl in some rural village with an old man, hoping she'd perish. Only when investigators started asking questions did they fabricate the switched-at-birth story to bring Isabella back under surveillance.

The entire narrative existed solely to lure Evelyn home.

But Isabella had grown weary of exile. She needed an excuse to return. Thus the long-lost heiress persona was born, complete with the elaborate switched-at-birth deception.

Evelyn would always remain trash.

How could that wretch ever compare to her?

Isabella flashed a radiant smile. "Adrian, I'll deliver an award-worthy performance in this drama."

She would surpass Scarlett Orlando and claim next year's Academy Award.

With her family's backing, she feared nothing.

Adrian gave a curt nod. "Let's go in."

Isabella glanced toward the entrance. "But Chairman Lowell hasn't arrived yet."

She prayed silently that Theodore Lowell wouldn't show. His appearance risked exposing everything. He'd only agreed to this deal out of paternal desperation.

Adrian's brow furrowed. Chairman Lowell always kept his word. They'd wait.

His gaze drifted toward the elevators, eyes darkening like storm clouds.

"Adrian! Chairman Lowell's here!" Isabella's voice held equal parts excitement and apprehension.

Adrian watched the approaching figure. Isabella quickly composed herself. "Chairman Lowell, what an honor."

Theodore Lowell hurried over flanked by two bodyguards, beads of sweat on his forehead. "Mr. Valentine, my apologies. My daughter's asthma attack won't wait six months. Miss Langley's sister isn't answering her phone. You must contact her—she has the medication that can save my child."

Isabella's heart lurched. Evidence wasn't enough—now there was some miracle drug?

How would a backwater peasant like Evelyn possess specialized medication?

Adrian's piercing stare locked onto Isabella. "Isabella, call your sister immediately. A life hangs in the balance."

She pressed her lips into a practiced smile. "Chairman Lowell, I'm afraid I can't reach her either. She lost her phone. The evidence is gone too."

Theodore studied her with sudden intensity.

The image of his gasping daughter softened his tone. "Miss Langley, my child is suffering. Just tell me where she lives—I'll go myself. She promised the medication in six months, but now her phone's dead. Show some mercy."

Isabella faltered.

How could she possibly salvage this lie?

"I... don't actually know her address." This much was true—she'd never bothered to learn Evelyn's whereabouts.

Theodore's expression hardened. Decades of corporate dominance radiated from him like an aura. "Miss Langley, you claimed you and your sister saved my daughter together. That's why I trusted you and partnered with your fiancé. Now I simply want to find your sister, and you stonewall me. Tell me the truth—were you ever really my daughter's savior?"
###Chapter 69

Theodore Lowell frowned, his sharp gaze fixed on Isabella Langley.

A suspicion arose in his mind—how could biological sisters be so estranged that one wouldn't even know the other's address?

These past few days, he'd been preoccupied with caring for his sick daughter, feeling grateful to everyone who'd helped her.

Isabella claimed to have saved Natalie too, and he'd chosen to believe her.

Isabella's eyes darted nervously, her fingers twisting together unconsciously.

She took a deep breath, forcing composure as she met Theodore's stare. "Mr. Lowell, why would I lie about this? My sister left in a hurry after the banquet..."

"Then you must at least have her family's contact information?" Theodore pressed urgently. "Natalie's condition is critical. She needs your sister's specialized medication."

Isabella faltered.

She truly didn't know where Evelyn lived.

Suddenly, inspiration struck—Evelyn was right here in this hotel!

Turning to Adrian Valentine, she flashed a sweet smile. "Adrian, please entertain the guests. I'll take Mr. Lowell to find my sister."

If Theodore located Evelyn himself, she could still salvage this deception.

Adrian's penetrating gaze seemed to see straight through her.

Isabella held his stare with effort.

"Go ahead," Adrian said mildly. "Saving lives takes priority."

Relieved, Isabella guided Theodore toward the elevators.

Adrian watched their retreating figures thoughtfully before following.

Inside the elevator, Isabella explained, "Mr. Lowell, my sister works as Nathan Aldridge's assistant. Finding him will lead us to her."

Theodore was about to call Nathan when his phone rang.

Evelyn's number flashed on the screen.

Having noticed the missed call earlier, Evelyn had returned it upon remembering Natalie's condition.

"Mr. Lowell, Natalie's asthma shouldn't flare up if she took her medication on schedule," Evelyn's voice carried puzzlement.

"Natalie had a sudden attack during dinner," Theodore said shakily. "It's very serious now."

"Send me the hospital address. I'll come immediately."

"Thank God! I'm at the Imperial Palace Hotel right now."

"What a coincidence—so am I. Meet me downstairs."

Theodore exhaled in relief.

Isabella's tension also eased.

The elevator descended to the lobby.

Meanwhile, Adrian emerged from a neighboring elevator.

Frowning at the closed doors, he wondered if he'd followed them to the wrong floor.

As he turned, he spotted Evelyn stepping out of a private dining room.
###Chapter 70

"Nathan, I can take you there. I don't feel comfortable with you going alone." Adrian's gaze lingered on her rounded belly.

This was the future heir of the Valentine family.

Evelyn paused, shaking her head with a gentle smile. "Scarlett's emotional state is unstable. Stay with her. Someone's waiting for me downstairs, and Sophia will pick me up later."

She suddenly remembered something, fishing car keys from her bag and handing them to him. "My car's parked below. Don't forget to drive it back."

Adrian insisted on escorting her to the elevator, only turning away after the doors closed.

Watching the display confirm Evelyn's descent to the lobby, Adrian immediately summoned another elevator.

Isabella had already excused herself to return to the gala. As tonight's honored guest, her absence couldn't be prolonged.

Emerging from the hotel entrance, Evelyn spotted Theodore Lowell waiting by the curb.

"Excuse me, are you Natalie's father?" Her tone remained measured and polite.

Theodore recognized her instantly. "Ms. Roland, we've met before. Natalie's having an asthma attack—she's in terrible pain. Could you please come to the hospital?"

Evelyn nodded. "Let's assess the situation first."

Theodore personally opened the car door for her. Soon, two luxury vehicles vanished into the night.

When Adrian rushed outside, only endless streams of traffic greeted him.

Standing on the sidewalk, a shadow of loneliness flickered through his deep-set eyes.

As for Theodore seeking Isabella's sister? It hardly concerned him. The contract was signed, and Theodore's mercantile nature wouldn't risk breaching it lightly.

In the hospital room, Natalie writhed beneath an oxygen mask, her small frame curled in agony.

A team of doctors stood helplessly nearby.

Evelyn frowned at Theodore. "Natalie's been compliant with her medication. This sudden attack makes no sense."

Bewilderment creased Theodore's face. "I supervise her doses daily, yet she collapsed during dinner."

Approaching the bed, Evelyn carefully took Natalie's pulse. Her expression darkened moments later. "She hasn't been taking her medicine?"

"Impossible!" Theodore produced a pill bottle from his coat. "I watch her swallow them every time."

Accepting the container, Evelyn examined a tablet and paled. "These aren't her prescribed medication. Someone swapped them."

Theodore's eyes widened in shock. "How?"

He suddenly recalled leaving the bottle on the living room table for two days, merely reminding Natalie verbally.

Studying the suffering girl, Evelyn wondered: Who could be this cruel?

Retrieving a different vial from her purse, she administered one pill. "This is less potent but will provide temporary relief."

Theodore's eyes reddened, voice thick with emotion. "Thank you, Ms. Roland."

Evelyn pointed to the original bottle. "Never take these again—they trigger asthma attacks."

A dangerous glint entered Theodore's gaze. Someone had dared target his daughter.

Evelyn's next words chilled him further: "Natalie's asthma likely stems from poisoning. She didn't have this condition as a child, did she?"
###Chapter 71

Theodore Lowell's gaze burned into Evelyn Roland.

The young woman before him had skin like fresh snow and almond-shaped eyes clear as spring water.

What shocked him most was discovering his daughter's illness was actually drug-induced asthma.

He'd long been wary of the undercurrents within the Lowell family, but never imagined someone would poison their food.

This Ms. Roland was truly the Lowells' guardian angel.

"You're absolutely right, Ms. Roland. Natalie never had asthma attacks before her senior year. Then she started dating that man. We objected at first, but she insisted."

"That bastard disappeared after learning Natalie's identity. Now he refuses to divorce her. I hope you can provide evidence so I can file for divorce."

These past few days since Natalie returned home, color had finally returned to her cheeks.

She'd even cooked meals for them herself.

Watching his once pampered princess bustling about the kitchen twisted Theodore's heart.

Evelyn suddenly remembered Isabella Langley demanding evidence.

Could the "Mr. Lowell" she mentioned be standing right before her?

Pregnancy brain, she chided herself silently.

She forwarded the video to Theodore.

"Natalie will sleep deeply tonight. I'll prepare the medication now. Please excuse me."

Theodore smiled warmly. "Meeting you was Natalie's good fortune. Once she recovers, I'll repay you properly."

Evelyn met his fatherly gaze impassively. "We'll discuss that later."

"Let my driver take you."

Remembering Scarlett was waiting at the Imperial Palace Hotel, Evelyn nodded. "To the Imperial Palace, please."

Theodore personally escorted her to the elevator.

Back in the hospital room, he opened the video.

Daniel Sherwood's cold indifference as he abandoned Natalie pierced Theodore's heart.

But what horrified him more was recognizing Isabella as the woman who kicked his daughter aside.

Now he understood why Isabella had been so evasive.

She was the fraud who stole credit for saving Natalie.

Watching his sleeping daughter, Theodore's blood boiled.

After arranging security, he stormed out with his men.

Evelyn had just reached the hotel lobby when rapid footsteps echoed behind her.

Protecting her belly, she retreated toward the staircase.

Theodore and his bodyguards burst in—just as Adrian Valentine and Isabella Langley stood laughing by the entrance.
###Chapter 72

Adrian Valentine narrowed his eyes as Theodore Lowell stormed toward them.

Isabella Langley froze under Theodore's piercing gaze, cold sweat trickling down her back.

Had the truth been exposed?

Her body turned rigid, her breath catching in her throat.

Slap!

A sharp crack echoed through the banquet hall.

Isabella staggered back, her cheek burning with pain.

"What is the meaning of this, Mr. Lowell?" Adrian stepped in front of her, his voice icy.

Theodore scoffed. "You have excellent taste, Mr. Valentine. A viper in disguise."

Adrian's expression darkened.

"Effective immediately, our contract is terminated." Theodore pulled a check from his suit pocket. "I'll compensate double the penalty."

Isabella's vision blurred as her nails dug into her palms.

"Mr. Lowell, there must be some misunderstanding," she forced a smile.

Theodore's gaze sharpened like a blade. "You impersonated my daughter's savior and dare call it a misunderstanding?"

Her legs trembled, nearly buckling beneath her.

"Business and personal matters should remain separate," Adrian warned. "The contract is legally binding. Breaching it benefits no one."

The murmurs of surrounding guests pricked at Isabella like needles.

She bit her lip hard, cursing Evelyn Roland a thousand times in her mind.

"Who struck my daughter?!" Vincent Langley shoved through the crowd, face flushed with rage.

Theodore gave him a cold once-over. "Consider it a lesson in parenting, Mr. Langley."

Adrian weighed his options before speaking. "Name your terms, Mr. Lowell."

"Simple." Theodore's eyes burned with intensity. "I never want to see this woman again."

He turned to leave, then paused. "Oh, and Mr. Valentine... would you like to know who truly saved my daughter?"

Adrian's brow furrowed. "Who?"

Theodore smiled meaningfully. "The songbird your family caged."
###Chapter 73

Isabella's heart leaped into her throat. Her eyes locked onto Mr. Lowell's lips.

His voice cut through the air like a blade. "It was Evelyn. The one who left my daughter to die was Isabella. Not only did she turn a blind eye, she delivered the final blow."

Isabella's legs turned to jelly. Her nails dug deep into her palms.

She never expected the surveillance footage to capture her actions.

Adrian's icy gaze pierced through her.

All color drained from Isabella's face. She couldn't bring herself to meet his eyes.

That bitch Evelyn must die, she seethed inwardly.

Around the corner of the staircase, Evelyn stood with a cold smirk.

When she sent the video to Mr. Lowell, she'd forgotten it contained footage of Isabella.

So this was the woman Adrian chose over her.

Vincent Langley watched the video in stunned silence.

He forced an apologetic smile. "Mr. Lowell, Isabella acted in the heat of the moment... After all, Evelyn is also my daughter—"

"You call yourself her father?" Mr. Lowell scoffed. "The man who discarded her the moment he discovered she wasn't his blood?"

Vincent's face darkened.

Mr. Lowell gave Adrian a meaningful look before turning on his heel.

Isabella exhaled in relief.

She clutched Adrian's sleeve with trembling fingers. "Adrian, I was just so scared..."

He pulled his arm away. "No good deed goes unpunished."

The words struck her like a slap.

No matter how hard she tried these past weeks, Adrian remained indifferent.

Adrian gave Vincent a curt nod. "I'll handle the Lowell matter first."

As he strode away, his peripheral vision caught Evelyn standing by the staircase.

Their eyes met. Evelyn's heart clenched painfully.

Before the banquet ended, news of Isabella's scandal had already spread.

Cassandra Valentine swirled her wine glass, a knowing smile playing on her lips.
###Chapter 74

Cassandra Valentine strode into the banquet hall in her stilettos, fingertips dancing across her phone screen.

"Isabella, did you really think Adrian saw you as some innocent angel?" Her crimson lips curled. "Turns out you're a venomous snake with fangs."

The crisp chime of a successful upload echoed through the air.

Isabella Langley's face drained of color. Her fingers clenched the fabric of her gown, nails digging into her palms.

"Refusing to help someone in need, causing secondary harm, then accusing the patient of drunkenness." Cassandra waved her phone. "Adrian's taste in women keeps getting more... interesting."

The chandelier's glare made Isabella dizzy.

Her new drama was set to begin filming next week. Millions of followers awaited her updates. A scandal now would be disastrous—

"Father!" She frantically grabbed Vincent Langley's arm.

Vincent narrowed his eyes. "Miss Valentine, family matters shouldn't be aired in public."

Cassandra flicked her curled hair, the diamond clip glinting coldly.

"Family?" She laughed. "Miss Langley hasn't even stepped through the Valentine family gates yet."

Margaret Valentine suddenly rushed forward and delivered a stinging slap.

The sharp crack silenced the entire hall.

"Delete that video!" Margaret demanded.

Cassandra licked her lips, smiling brighter. "Auntie, instead of protecting her, perhaps you should think about how to explain this to the press?"

As she turned, a shadow at the staircase caught her eye. She froze mid-step.

Evelyn Roland leaned against the banister, twirling a champagne flute between her fingers.
###Chapter 75

Cassandra Valentine's red lips curved slightly as she spoke in a crisp tone, "Evelyn Roland, have you had your fill of the show?"

She hadn't expected to run into Evelyn here.

The woman before her was unrecognizable from the one in her memories.

The old Evelyn always wore stiff business suits.

Even her dresses were the most conservative styles.

"A change in wardrobe has done wonders for you," Cassandra appraised her with a sweeping glance. "Those old clothes were a crime against your face."

With Evelyn and Adrian Valentine now divorced, there was no need for hostility.

Evelyn glanced down at her outfit.

The difference wasn’t that drastic.

Those dull clothes had been Adrian’s choices.

She never liked them but wore them anyway—because he preferred them.

Adrian always insisted on modesty in public.

Yet at home, he’d demand she change into something far more revealing.

He loved holding her while watching TV.

His long fingers would wander over her skin, leaving marks as if claiming territory.

"You’re so soft," he’d murmur hoarsely, like a boy who never grew up.

She never told him she was trained in medicine.

In summer, she liked wearing short skirts.

Her slender legs would dangle over the couch.

Adrian would pounce instantly.

"Stop moving," he’d warn, beads of sweat forming on his brow. "Or we won’t leave this house today."

She’d retreat to the bedroom.

But he’d always follow, drawing the heavy curtains shut.

Evelyn snapped back to reality.

How could she reminisce about those moments now?

The banquet hall was empty except for the Langley and Valentine families.

Cassandra watched her with an amused smirk.

"You haven’t lost your charm, Miss Valentine," Evelyn said sincerely.

Cassandra was a force in the business world—ruthless but undeniably capable.

When she married Adrian, Evelyn knew she had to be sharp.

The Langleys were full of vipers.

Without Adrian’s protection, Isabella would struggle even more.

"Likewise," Cassandra replied, glancing behind her before walking away with a flourish.

If she was miserable, no one else would be happy either.

Isabella Langley’s eyes burned red. "Evelyn, why did you sabotage me?"

Evelyn almost laughed.

"I didn’t release that video. I haven’t even seen it," she said calmly. "You took credit for someone else’s work and kicked them out. Now you blame me?"

Isabella bit her lip hard, speechless.

Margaret Valentine’s voice cut through the air like ice. "Evelyn, you’re not welcome here."
###Chapter 76

Evelyn glanced at her coldly. "I haven't even stepped foot into the Valentine estate. You could beg on your knees, and I still wouldn't grace you with my presence."

"Isn't it funny how you've latched onto Sebastian Cortez? No wonder you're so full of yourself. That face of yours was made to seduce men—"

Evelyn cut her off sharply.

"Margaret, don't project your own filth onto others. I don't exist to please you."

"Who I choose to be with is none of your concern. You think you're superior, but to me, you're nothing but a joke."

Margaret Valentine was ruthless, treating both her sons as pawns.

But she favored Gregory.

Adrian was merely a tool—forced to fund the family, never shown an ounce of maternal love.

When the family matriarch fell ill, Margaret was the mastermind behind it.

Yet all the shares went to Gregory.

She schemed relentlessly to control both sons, ensuring Adrian never gained the upper hand.

But in the end, her machinations failed.

"You—" Margaret's face darkened with fury.

Vincent Langley wasn't ready to sever ties yet. Evelyn might still hold the key to the map's location.

"Enough. Let's consider this a misunderstanding and move on."

Isabella Langley clenched her teeth, swallowing her rage. The online scandal had to be dealt with first.

Margaret seethed with jealousy. The once-submissive Evelyn had now climbed into Sebastian Cortez's orbit.

But she knew Vincent's plans. For now, she had to retreat.

Vincent forced a paternal smile. "Evelyn, come home for dinner tomorrow night. There's something we need to discuss."

The matter with Alexander Durand had dragged on long enough. It was time to settle it.

A flicker of cold calculation passed through Evelyn's eyes. Finally.

"Alright," she murmured, lowering her head in feigned obedience.

As the group walked away, a faint smirk curled her lips.

Her phone buzzed. Scarlett Orlando and Nathan Aldridge were already downstairs. She headed to the lobby to wait.

The biting wind made her pull her coat tighter. Memories of Adrian surfaced, leaving a bitter ache in her chest.

After so many ups and downs, she barely recognized the person she used to be.

Now, seeing through people's true natures, love and hate had both faded. She'd made her choices—no regrets, even if they came with pain.

"Evelyn!" Scarlett staggered toward her, a baseball cap askew, reeking of alcohol.

Evelyn steadied her. "You lost one role. Was this really necessary?"

Scarlett giggled drunkenly, staring at her best friend's face. Suddenly, nothing seemed so bad.

"That little snake means nothing. I'm just..." She suddenly hugged Evelyn. "I missed you so much."

Evelyn's heart softened. She had a feeling she knew why.
###Chapter 77

Evelyn gently stroked Scarlett's back and whispered in her ear, "I'm back. I'll spend tomorrow with you. Who needs men? Let's focus on our careers."

Scarlett loosened her embrace, her eyes glazed with intoxication. "I'm just glad you're home. Business is all that matters. Men only drain our energy."

Nathan stood nearby, his lips twitching. He was right there, yet completely invisible.

He considered himself a good man, one who would cherish the woman he loved.

Evelyn thought the same. Love was overrated. Family and friendship were enough.

"See you tomorrow. Get some rest," Evelyn said softly.

Scarlett buried herself in her arms again, voice trembling. "You kept me waiting four years, you brat. Losing that lead role was a blessing—now I can finally relax."

"Four years changes people," Evelyn handed her a sobriety pill.

Scarlett swallowed it, the bitterness sharpening her senses. "Promise you'll come tomorrow, darling."

Evelyn watched Nathan escort her away before turning to Vienna's nightscape.

The distant glow of the night market stirred memories. After four years, she'd nearly forgotten what she even liked.

The pedestrian street buzzed with life. A cotton candy vendor approached. "Try some, miss? It'll brighten your mood."

Evelyn chose pink. The sugary melt on her tongue lifted her spirits slightly.

She texted Gabrielle about Natalie's medication.

Gabrielle replied instantly. "The medicine will be ready by tomorrow afternoon. Made you supper—when are you coming back?"

Evelyn eyed the food stalls. She'd planned dinner with Scarlett, but her friend had only wanted to drink.

"Eating out tonight. You go ahead," she typed back.

Pocketing her phone, she spotted a hawthorn vendor. The tart aroma suddenly made her hungry.
###Chapter 78

Evelyn stood outside the bubble tea shop, staring at the menu for a long time.

"One lemonade, extra sour, please." That was her final choice.

When the clerk handed her the drink, she immediately took a big sip. The sharp tang exploded on her tongue, yet it strangely brought her relief.

These little ones had such picky tastes.

Lately, her cravings had become unusual—she kept wanting things so sour they bordered on bitter.

In the past, she wouldn’t have touched anything this acidic.

But today, even this lemonade wasn’t enough.

She needed something even more sour to satisfy this sudden urge.

Evelyn walked slowly along the pedestrian street, her eyes scanning the roadside stalls.

Most of the crowd consisted of couples or families with children. Groups of students laughed as they passed her by.

The lively, everyday scene warmed her heart.

Having grown up under strict training, she cherished these ordinary moments of warmth more than anything.

Before she turned eighteen, it was Alexander who had accompanied her through those lonely years.

And then there were Gabrielle and the other four—sisters in all but blood.

The world knew the heiress of Sterling Manor had five formidable aides, but few had ever seen their faces.

Her grandfather’s teachings had given her the most precious gifts in life.

Evelyn’s lips curved into a faint smile. She had been fortunate—she had her grandfather, Sebastian, Alexander, and Gabrielle’s group.

Only that marriage...

What was one failed marriage? Life was full of setbacks.

She just hadn’t expected to be the one who got divorced.

And she hadn’t expected it to hurt this much.

A fruit stand at the corner caught her attention.

"Excuse me, do you have any especially sour oranges?"

The vendor eagerly pointed to a basket of green-skinned oranges. "These are perfectly balanced—sweet with just a hint of tartness. Would you like to try one?"

Evelyn broke off a segment and popped it into her mouth. The juice burst forth, tangy yet sweet—just right.

Under the streetlights, her satisfied smile momentarily dazzled the vendor.

She bought a pound of oranges and turned into the noodle shop next door.

The second-floor window seat offered an excellent view of the entire pedestrian street.

Red lanterns swayed gently in the night breeze, casting a warm glow over the bustling crowd below.

Evelyn peeled an orange as she watched the lively scene.

"Pfft—"

A sudden spitting sound came from behind her.

Only then did she notice someone had taken the neighboring table. When she turned, her pupils contracted slightly.

Adrian was wiping his mouth with a napkin, his brow furrowed. "How can you eat something so sour?"

In his memory, Evelyn had always avoided even mildly tart oranges.

Her heart skipped a beat. He could never find out about the pregnancy—she hadn’t even been to the hospital for confirmation.

"What are you doing here?" she countered coldly.
###Chapter 79

Adrian Valentine's gaze lingered on Evelyn Roland's slightly trembling legs, his brow furrowing.

"Running around with your injury still unhealed?"

Evelyn tightened her grip on the paper bag of oranges, the plastic crinkling softly.

"Just here for noodles."

Adrian glanced at the bowl before her, its steam long dissipated.

This old noodle shop was where they'd had their first date.

The memory of the boy who'd run three blocks to buy her bubble tea now stood before her in a tailored suit, his eyes glacial.

"Excuse me." Evelyn pushed herself up from the table.

Adrian didn't budge. Instead, he pulled out the chair opposite her and sat.

"I'm staying."

Evelyn's breath hitched.

That was the same stubborn tone he'd used years ago, insisting they share one drink.

"Not worried about paparazzi, Mr. Valentine?" Her laugh was brittle. "Ms. Langley might misunderstand."

Adrian suddenly seized her wrist.

"Why expose Isabella?"

Evelyn's pupils constricted.

So this was a retaliation mission for his precious Isabella.

She yanked her hand back, her wrist burning.

"She stole credit. She deserved it."

Adrian's expression darkened.

"Leave Vienna." His voice was dangerously soft. "Stay away from Isabella."

Evelyn's nails dug into her palms.

"Or what?"

"I'll make sure you never work in this industry again." Adrian rose, looming over her. "I want your resignation within three days."

The glass door slammed shut with enough force to rattle the windows.

Evelyn stared at the congealed noodles, laughter bubbling up her throat.

How pathetic.

In this very shop, he'd once blushed while promising to cherish her forever.

Now he'd destroy her career for another woman.

A waiter approached cautiously. "Ma'am, are you alright?"

Evelyn shook her head, pulling out her phone.

"Attorney Lowell? I'm filing a commercial fraud lawsuit against Isabella Langley."

Hanging up, she wiped away tears she hadn't realized had fallen.

If he wanted to protect Isabella so badly, they'd settle this in court.
###Chapter 80

She remained silent, deeming any explanation futile.

The pregnancy respite suited her perfectly, allowing her to avoid the scandal.

She complied with Adrian's demand flawlessly, leaving no room for suspicion.

Evelyn lowered her lashes, veiling the desolation and anguish in her eyes.

Every inch of her body ached. Her jaw clenched, the corners of her eyes reddened, as if her heart had been torn open.

An invisible hand seemed to choke her throat, making even breathing difficult.

She inhaled deeply. When she lifted her gaze again, her expression was calm. "Fine, I'll leave."

Clutching the oranges, she drifted out like a ghost.

"Miss, your noodles," a server called, carrying a bowl of clear broth noodles.

Evelyn ignored him, hurrying away with her head down.

Adrian watched her faltering figure, his lips pressed into a thin line. His fists whitened with tension, dark emotions churning in his eyes.

As the server moved to clear the bowl, Adrian spoke abruptly, "Leave it. My wife ordered it."

The server set the bowl down nervously before scurrying off.

Mechanically, Adrian finished every strand of the noodles, including the braised egg, even draining the broth.

...

The Langleys spent a fortune suppressing the scandal. Within an hour, the internet was scrubbed clean.

Eleanor frowned. "We deliberately left her in the countryside to rot. How did she learn medicine?"

Vincent was equally baffled.

Isabella scoffed. "Pure luck. She didn't even finish high school."

She refused to believe a country bumpkin could practice medicine. That woman had nothing but her pretty face.

The thought of Evelyn inheriting her mother's beauty while she resembled their father sparked jealousy in Isabella's eyes.

Vincent warned gravely, "No matter her background, she's insignificant. Isabella, don't antagonize her. She has ties to Alexander Durand."

"I'll arrange a meeting tomorrow to probe her. We must locate that map soon."

Though the Durands were wiped out, Alexander's siblings survived.

Those spared years ago had now become liabilities.

With the map in hand, all of Northam would be within their grasp.

This year's election was non-negotiable.

Their first move was securing Adrian's allegiance.

Among Vienna's elite, Sterling Manor's shady dealings made them negligible.

Isabella suddenly asked, "Father, who exactly was Alexander Durand?"
###Chapter 81

Vincent Langley narrowed his eyes, a cold smirk playing on his lips.

"In the Nine-City Alliance, our Langley family holds power in Vienna. Alexander Durand came from the Durand family of Lyon, where he was the third son."

"The entire Durand family was wiped out four years ago. The killers were never caught. Alexander was supposed to inherit the family legacy."

His fingers tapped rhythmically against the desk, producing dull thuds.

"What surprises me most is that Evelyn Roland knew him."

Vincent couldn't fathom the connection.

After thorough investigation, he discovered Alexander had met Isabella during his training years. They'd lived together briefly in the countryside.

Few knew about this chapter of their lives. Even his informants found scant details.

"That girl has uncanny luck."

First Alexander Durand, now Sebastian Cortez.

Such connections made Vincent's palms itch with envy.

Sebastian Cortez had rejected his partnership offers multiple times. Yet Evelyn effortlessly gained his favor.

"We can't afford to antagonize her yet."

A calculating gleam flashed in Vincent's eyes.

"She'll be a valuable chess piece in due time."

Turning to his wife and daughter, his voice turned stern.

"Be civil to Evelyn from now on. Sebastian entrusted her with the auction house. That speaks volumes."

Isabella curled her lip in disdain.

"She's just trading on her looks. Men fawn over her without her lifting a finger."

Her nails dug crescent moons into her palms.

Evelyn's beauty and talent alike fueled her bitter jealousy.

"Isabella!" Vincent's expression darkened. "I'm campaigning for office this year. No missteps."

Isabella instantly donned an obedient mask.

"Father, you'll win for sure. Then our family will finally get the respect we deserve."

Ambition glittered in her eyes.

"Once you're elected, that old hag Beatrice Valentine won't dare look down on me!"

The thought of the matriarch exiled to the Courtyard Villa filled her with vicious satisfaction.

Vincent studied his daughter with mingled pride and concern.

"Don't waste energy on the nearly departed. Focus on your acting. Become a star, and the world is yours."

Isabella lifted her chin with confidence.

"Don't worry, Father. Didn't I snatch Scarlett Orlando's role?"

Her laugh held cruel amusement.

"Even an award-winning actress has to step aside without connections."
###Chapter 82

Netizens overwhelmingly favored Isabella's delicate "Innocent Angel" persona.

Margaret Valentine watched her daughter's confident gaze with satisfaction. "Isabella, your efforts will pay off. With your career success and the support of your father and Adrian, no one in the Valentine family will dare look down on you."

A shadow flickered in Vincent Langley's eyes. Even without these advantages, no one could bully his daughter in the Valentine household.

"Rest early. Evelyn is returning tomorrow—prepare properly." Vincent paused. "I have important matters to discuss with Evelyn tomorrow. Don't bring Adrian."

His wariness toward Adrian Valentine remained.

Beneath that gentle exterior lurked unfathomable depths.

Isabella understood perfectly. "Of course." She bit her lip. "But Adrian's attitude tonight hurt me. He didn't even defend me."

Vincent's expression darkened. "You have the audacity to complain? You nearly cost him that contract! This deal is crucial for his company!"

"Use your brain next time! I sent you abroad for education, not to return as some clueless damsel!"

Eleanor Langley quickly intervened. "She only lied to help Adrian. The outcome was fine, wasn't it?"

With a cold snort, Vincent stormed upstairs.

——

Evelyn Roland stumbled home in a daze.

She collapsed onto her bed, staring blankly at the ornate ceiling carvings. None of it felt real.

Silent, icy tears traced her cheeks.

A bone-deep chill settled over her. The man she'd loved so deeply had pushed her to the brink.

She fought to suppress the resentment, but tonight, hatred surged like a tidal wave.

"Adrian Valentine, you're ruthless."

Evelyn scrubbed away her tears violently.

She'd never been a crier. When her grandfather forced her to learn swimming, the bamboo cane striking her back had drawn no tears.

Yet this wretched man had made her weep repeatedly.

Exhausted, Evelyn succumbed to sleep—pregnancy brought relentless fatigue.

——

The following evening, after resting all day, Evelyn drove to the Langley residence with Sophia Blanchet.

"Any theories about Vincent's agenda this time?" Sophia asked, gripping the steering wheel.

Evelyn leaned against the window, gaze distant. "Most likely the map. We'll know tonight."

Sophia frowned. "But why would this highly sought-after Mineral Atlas suddenly appear at an auction? And conveniently where you'd find it?"
###Chapter 83

Evelyn tapped her fingers lightly against the car window. The glass reflected her slightly furrowed brows.

Sophia's question pricked at her heart like a thorn.

"Two possibilities," she murmured. "Either no one has seen the real painting, or..." She paused. "The current holder can't decipher its secrets."

The Renaissance Masterpiece weighed heavily in her bag.

Those blood-red markings concealed something powerful enough to overturn certain fates.

In this world, only two people could unravel its mystery—Alexander Durand and her.

Even the Durand siblings remained oblivious to its hidden meaning.

This was a secret she would take to her grave—at least for now.

The Durand massacre was an unsolved enigma. Four years of investigation had yielded nothing.

Until that group photo surfaced in Vincent Langley's possession.

Returning to Vienna was a calculated risk.

After four years infiltrating the Valentine Group, she had rubbed shoulders with countless elites, yet the killer's trail remained cold.

The serpent at the center of the storm only emerged when the winds died down.

"We're here," Sophia said, braking smoothly.

Evelyn shook her head. "Stay with the car." She glanced at the Langley estate gates. "Thirty minutes."

Vincent Langley was a cunning fox, but far easier to handle than Adrian Valentine.

Just thinking of Adrian sent a sharp pang through her chest.

The phantom pain of nails piercing her knees resurfaced from her last visit.

"Keep an eye on Dominic," she said coldly.

Sophia gritted her teeth. "I'll cripple him one day."

The doorbell chimed three times before Isabella's smiling face appeared.

"Evelyn!"

The living room lights made Evelyn squint.

Then she saw the man on the sofa—and her breath caught.

Adrian's slender fingers rested on his knees, his black turtleneck accentuating his pale complexion. When he lifted his gaze, the storm brewing in his eyes reminded her of turbulent seas before a tempest.

"Adrian came specifically to wait for you," Isabella chirped, snuggling close to him.

Evelyn chose the farthest armchair.

Light refracted through crystal glasses, casting dancing reflections on her hand.

Isabella practically draped herself over Adrian's arm. "We were supposed to go to a French restaurant."

Watching their intertwined figures, Evelyn tasted iron in her throat.
###Chapter 84

"No need for formalities. I'll leave after meeting with Chairman Langley." Evelyn kept her gaze lowered, her tone unreadable.

Isabella clenched her teeth in frustration. She had hoped to see Evelyn lose composure, but the woman's calm demeanor made her efforts feel futile.

Evelyn's attention remained fixed on her phone. She had noted the surveillance camera by the entrance earlier and was now memorizing its serial number for later investigation.

Isabella stared at Evelyn's serene profile, jealousy gnawing at her like a venomous snake. Some people naturally commanded attention, even in silence.

Adrian's dark eyes bore into Evelyn. Four years of marriage, yet he had never truly understood this woman who now sat absorbed in her phone.

"Evelyn, you're here." Vincent Langley strode in, impeccably dressed in a tailored suit, exuding charm.

Evelyn gave a slight nod.

When Vincent noticed Adrian, his brow furrowed almost imperceptibly.

"Speak directly, Chairman Langley. I'm pressed for time." Evelyn stood.

"Surely you can spare a moment for dinner." Vincent smiled warmly.

"No, thank you." Evelyn sat back down. Dining with her ex-husband and his mistress? She wasn't that forgiving.

Vincent glanced at Adrian. "Let's talk in the study."

Once the study door closed, Adrian's expression turned icy. He turned to Isabella, his voice dripping with honeyed sweetness. "Isabella, I'd love some of your hand-brewed coffee."

Isabella's cheeks flushed with delight. Confidently, she headed to the kitchen, oblivious to the coldness in Adrian's eyes.

Adrian slipped into a secluded corner of the garden and swiftly put on an earpiece.

"When did you meet Alexander Durand?" Vincent cut straight to the point.

Downstairs, Adrian's muscles tensed instantly.

Evelyn feigned confusion. "We met by chance in the countryside. Do you know him, Chairman Langley?"

"An old friend." Vincent narrowed his eyes. "There's an unusual painting in his possession. Have you seen it?"
###Chapter 85

Evelyn's gaze was like an ice blade piercing through the middle-aged man before her.

Vincent Langley felt a chill crawl down his spine under her stare.

"Mr. Langley seems quite interested in that map?" Evelyn tapped her fingers lightly on the table.

Her lips curved slightly, but her eyes remained cold.

Vincent forced a smile. "His father and I were old friends. Naturally, I recognized that painting."

"It appeared at the Roscente Auction House." Evelyn spoke casually. "Though I don't recall who bought it."

Vincent's expression darkened instantly.

He suddenly remembered the auction where Evelyn had bid on the Violette Diamond for Sebastian Cortez.

"That same auction?"

"Yes." Evelyn lowered her lashes. "Later, I realized that painting resembled one from Alexander's collection."

Her voice softened. "He said it held secrets...but I was too young to understand back then..."

Vincent clenched his fists.

That damned painting—the one they'd torn the Durand estate apart searching for—had been right there at an auction?

"Do you know the secret it holds, Evelyn?" Vincent studied her intently.

She lifted her eyes, tears glistening. "Alexander only told me part of it."

"He must have trusted you deeply." Vincent's gaze flickered meaningfully toward a photograph nearby.

"You're mistaken." Evelyn stood abruptly. "We were like siblings, nothing more."

She turned to leave.

Vincent blocked her path. "If I find that painting, will you help me decipher it?"

"I'm afraid there's no time." A bitter smile touched her lips. "Adrian is forcing me to leave Vienna tomorrow—for Isabella's sake."

Vincent froze.

Evelyn seized the moment to stride toward the staircase.

A glacial glint flashed in her eyes.

Take your time searching, Vincent Langley.

Adrian Valentine, Vincent Langley...if either of you had a hand in Alexander's death...

Her nails dug deep into her palms.

At the landing, Evelyn collided unexpectedly with a solid figure.

She looked up—straight into Adrian's fathomless dark eyes.
###Chapter 86

Evelyn's emotions hit rock bottom.

Then she collided with Adrian Valentine at the corner. Her gaze frosted over instantly.

She sidestepped to avoid him, but he seized her wrist. Dark currents swirled in his eyes.

"What exactly is your relationship with Alexander Durand?"

Evelyn wrenched free with force. "Adrian, don't touch me!" Flames of fury burned in her eyes. "I'm leaving tomorrow. My affairs are none of your concern."

His knuckles turned white. Emotions churned in his gaze. If Alexander wasn't her lover, then...

"Evelyn—"

"Stop hounding me like a rabid dog." Her glare could poison. "Don't test me right now."

She shook off his hand, enunciating each word. "If I find even the slightest connection between you and Alexander's death, I'll personally send you to hell."

Adrian's pupils constricted. "You'd kill me for Alexander Durand?"

His jaw clenched. His chest heaved violently.

The hatred in her eyes made his heart tremble.

The way she shook him off was as if discarding something filthy. No love could outweigh blood debt—especially when he might be complicit in Alexander's murder.

"Vincent Langley is searching for Alexander's paintings. As the Langley family's son-in-law, how could you not know?" Her laugh was icy. "Just wait. The day I return will be the end of your precious Valentine family."

Adrian watched her retreating figure and roared, "Evelyn!"

The light in his eyes shattered into fragments.

She'd choose another man's vengeance over his life. Fine. Just perfect.

Tears streamed down Evelyn's face as she stormed out.

She wiped them away harshly.

If Vincent knew about the painting's location, he'd mobilize all his forces. With Adrian as his lapdog, she could eliminate them all in one sweep.

By the time she reached the car, her composure had returned. "Book a flight to Eastalia. You'll board the plane disguised as me." She paused. "There's something else I need you to do."

Sophia handed her a tissue. "Your eyes are red."

Evelyn smirked self-deprecatingly. "Pregnancy hormones." She gazed out the window. "Don't let Scarlett know about Adrian and me."

"But Miss Orlando will eventually—"

"That firecracker would go straight to Adrian for revenge." Evelyn rested a hand on her stomach. "We'll tell her after the baby's born."

Sophia nodded in understanding and turned the car toward Scarlett's apartment.

The next noon.

Valentine Group CEO office.

Files piled high on the desk, but Adrian stood motionless before the floor-to-ceiling window. The entire city sprawled beneath him, yet he felt like a caged beast.

Knock knock—

He didn't turn. "Enter."
###Chapter 87

Adrian Valentine pushed open his office door and saw Evelyn Roland standing by the floor-to-ceiling window, her silhouette radiating icy detachment.

"Sir, your wife has boarded the flight to Eastalia."

Adrian's fingers tightened imperceptibly. The glass reflected his suddenly pale face.

This city was empty now.

When he turned, his eyes burned with barely restrained fury. "What have you found about Alexander Durand?"

Victor Ashcroft shook his head. "The Durand family was wiped out four years ago. The killer was never found. Alexander's siblings are still alive, but he himself remains missing. Judging by Evelyn's reaction, it's likely he's already..."

Adrian's jaw clenched.

Those photos of Evelyn smiling at Alexander—so bright it hurt to look at.

A radiance she'd never shown him.

"Good riddance," he sneered. "Saves me the trouble."

She was complicit in Christian Lefèvre's death.

If she could kill for Alexander, she could damn well face his retribution.

Victor hesitated.

He knew the divorce was meant to protect her. Yet Adrian had to play the heartless villain.

"We've confirmed it was Martha who poisoned the Dowager. But we still haven't identified who reported Gregory Valentine."

Adrian's gaze darkened. "Keep digging. Vincent Langley has been making moves lately."

"And..." Victor paused. "About Isabella Langley replacing Scarlett Orlando for the film role. The director—"

"Set up a meeting tonight," Adrian cut him off. "No one dictates what my woman does."

Once the door closed, Adrian collapsed onto the sofa.

His phone screen lit up—the lock screen showed him holding Evelyn. Her smile was so sweet, as if the whole world shone in her eyes.

A sudden knock shattered the moment.

He snapped the screen dark, the last trace of warmth vanishing from his expression.
###Chapter 88

Adrian Valentine's face was cold as he spoke. "Come in."

Isabella Langley walked in on stiletto heels, her pink dress accentuating her porcelain skin. She carried a thermal lunchbox with a sweet smile. "Adrian, I brought you lunch."

Privately, she reveled in her triumph. Adrian had driven Evelyn away for her sake—this favor made her giddy. She had woken early to prepare this meal herself.

Her father had already tracked Evelyn to Eastalia. Though the painting had surfaced, Evelyn remained a threat that needed elimination. She had already dispatched men to ensure Evelyn vanished forever.

Adrian glanced at the lunchbox, his tone indifferent. "Leave it on the table. I'll eat later. I have a meeting in ten minutes—you should go."

Isabella's smile faltered. Unwilling to leave, she perched on his lap instead, leaning close to whisper in his ear. "Adrian, let's have dinner tonight. You've done so much for me... I want to make you happy."

Expressionless, he pushed her away, his eyes dark. "I'm meeting your director tonight to discuss your new project. Focus on preparing—filming starts soon."

She sensed his distance immediately. Today, Adrian was unusually cold. It had to be because of that nuisance, Scarlett.

"I'll go then. Don't work too hard." She planted a quick kiss on his cheek before swaying out.

The moment the office door closed, Adrian bolted to the restroom.

Regal Heights.

Evelyn Roland slept until noon. Last night, she had stayed up late with Scarlett, leaving her back sore. The toll of pregnancy made her truly understand a mother's hardship.

"Awake, sister?" Victoria Laurent entered with folded clothes. "I prepared these for you."

Evelyn stretched. "Victoria, I won't be going out. Have company documents sent to the study next door."

"Understood. Lunch is ready. Sophia has already boarded her flight." Victoria's gaze lingered on Evelyn's sleep-flushed cheeks.

Unnoticed, Evelyn headed to the shower. The warm water eased her fatigue as she applied her homemade Botanica skincare. The soon-to-launch formula worked wonders—her flawless skin was proof.

The thought of originally intending to gift this formula to Adrian stung. She shook it off, dressed in Victoria's chosen outfit, and went downstairs.

"Evelyn!" Scarlett's voice called from outside.
###Chapter 89

Scarlett Orlando threw on an oversized T-shirt and jeans that hugged her long legs. Even in such casual attire, her striking beauty shone through.

Evelyn Roland wore a pink tracksuit that made her skin glow like snow.

"Scarlett, how did you sleep last night?" Evelyn linked arms with her as they headed to the dining room.

The aroma of breakfast filled the air. Scarlett's stomach growled the moment she caught the scent.

Victoria Laurent set out an extra place setting. The two women chatted over their meal.

"Evelyn, I can't just sit back and take this. Isabella Langley stole my role because she has Adrian Valentine backing her. She thinks I'm an easy target."

Scarlett's gaze hardened. Now that she was sober, she was ready to fight back.

Evelyn had expected this. She'd been waiting for Scarlett to say the words.

She knew her best friend too well.

If Adrian could suppress Scarlett,

then Evelyn could crush Isabella.

Evelyn took a slow sip of her porridge. "Direct retaliation would be too obvious. She's filming a TV series—so should you. When a newcomer flops in a major director's project, the mockery will be relentless."

"I'll find you a better script and a stronger cast. Scarlett, are you ready for this?"

This was exactly why Scarlett had come today.

In Vienna, nothing was beyond the reach of Sterling Manor's heiress.

Her eyes instantly welled up.

Scarlett rushed over and hugged Evelyn from behind, burying her face in her shoulder. "Evelyn, you're my lucky star! You always have the answers. No wonder you're my best friend!"

Evelyn had her own plans. She couldn't tell Scarlett about the pregnancy yet—her friend couldn't keep secrets.

Adrian must never find out before the baby was born.

Scarlett's filming would take at least six months. That gave Evelyn enough time to set the stage.

Adrian wanted to elevate Isabella?

She'd make sure that woman fell harder.

And Scarlett would rise higher.

Scarlett released her grip and returned to her seat.

She picked up a piece of beef, her eyes sparkling. "Evelyn, this beef is amazing! Tell Victoria to make more for me."

Evelyn smiled and nodded. "Just let Victoria know whenever you want it. Don't worry, it won't make you gain weight."

Scarlett happily agreed.

After breakfast, Evelyn made a few calls.

Soon, Zachary Deross was arranged to take Scarlett to meet the director and screenwriter.

Sterling Manor's team would outshine Adrian's. Isabella didn't stand a chance.

But Adrian was a formidable opponent.

With everything in place, Evelyn waited for the show to begin.

......

The next day, news broke.

Scarlett Orlando would star in Aurora Klein's highly anticipated series Imperial Consort,

directed by the renowned Derek Anderson.
###Chapter 90

Isabella Langley's fingers trembled slightly around her phone.

It was the third day of filming for Phoenix Feather, and she had been thriving on set. The director praised her natural talent, even veteran actors couldn't stop complimenting her performance.

Yet Adrian Valentine's calls kept going unanswered.

Something felt off since yesterday. The man who had always doted on her suddenly became distant.

"Miss Langley, time for touch-ups." The assistant director's voice snapped her out of her thoughts.

She forced a smile, only to freeze when she turned around.

Scarlett Orlando descended from her luxury van in a designer gown, trailed by three assistants. The movie star's crimson lips curved as she carried herself with the effortless grace of an Academy Award winner.

"Well, if it isn't Miss Langley." Scarlett paused, her gaze sweeping over Isabella's costume. "I heard Mr. Valentine invested five million? Quite the generous patron."

Isabella clenched her skirt. "The casting was the director's decision, Miss Orlando."

"Was it?" Scarlett's laugh was light. "Then I wish you record-breaking box office success."

Watching Scarlett's retreating figure, Isabella dug her nails into her palms. She'd make everyone see who the real winner was.

Meanwhile, thick cigar smoke filled the private club on the city outskirts.

Vincent Langley slid a cigar toward Julian Roscente. "Mr. Roscente, I've heard so much about you."

Julian arched an eyebrow. "You flatter me, Mr. Langley."

"Rumor has it you've been searching for a certain painting." Vincent lowered his voice. "What a coincidence—I happen to have leads."

Julian's expression shifted instantly.

"All I ask is an introduction to your father..." Vincent traced the rim of his teacup meaningfully.

Outside, thunder cracked as torrential rain began pounding against the windows.
###Chapter 91

Vincent Langley narrowed his eyes as he studied Julian Roscente. The young man seemed like easy prey.

Compared to the troublesome Adrian Valentine, Julian was soft as putty.

Ever since Adrian had gotten close to his daughter, Vincent had been watching him carefully.

That man wore a gentle facade, but his sharp gaze betrayed his true nature. Though attentive to Isabella, he always kept her at arm's length.

Julian was different—well-connected and naive. Pity Isabella showed no interest in him.

His daughter was determined to marry Adrian.

Vincent knew Adrian would be difficult to control. He sighed inwardly. But Isabella loved him.

After all, Adrian was...

Vincent's expression darkened suddenly. He turned to Julian. "I heard your auction house sold a painting last month. Do you know who bought it?"

Julian blinked. That particular painting had fetched an astronomical price—he still remembered nearly fainting from excitement.

"You mean the Renaissance Masterpiece?"

Vincent nodded eagerly. "Yes! That one. Who bought it?"

After four years of searching, he finally had a lead.

That painting was his ticket to unimaginable wealth.

Julian frowned at Vincent's intensity. It was just an ordinary painting, wasn't it?

The artwork had been strange—neither landscape nor map—so he'd decided to auction it off.

"Honestly, I don't know. It's been two months—the surveillance footage auto-deleted. All we know is a woman purchased it."

Vincent's face turned stormy.

"There must be auction records. Can I see them?"

Seeing his persistence, Julian led him to Grandelle Auction House.

When the manager pulled up the records, they discovered the day's data had been manually wiped.

"Mr. Roscente, our system was hacked. All transaction records from that day are gone," the manager stammered.

Vincent swayed, nearly collapsing.

His only lead—gone.

This proved the buyer knew the painting's secret.

He loosened his tie, chest heaving.

Julian was startled by his reaction. It was just a painting!

Vincent looked like he'd lost an empire.

"Wait—was Evelyn bidding that day?" Vincent asked suddenly.

If she'd bought it, the painting might be in her possession.

Given her connection to Alexander Durand, she always wept over related artifacts.

Julian shook his head. "No, she wasn't interested. She came for the Violette Diamond."

Vincent sneered and stormed out. He'd find another way.

After seeing Vincent off, Julian went to find Adrian.
###Chapter 92

Adrian Valentine sat behind his expansive desk, his long fingers absently tracing the fountain pen.

His eyes were hollow and stormy, the whites streaked with red veins. A suffocating gloom radiated from his entire being.

When Julian Roscente pushed open the door, the icy aura nearly forced him back.

"Good lord!" Julian took an exaggerated step backward. "Who sucked the soul out of the mighty CEO?"

Adrian's condition was worse than he'd imagined.

Exhaustion carved deep lines into his handsome face. His suit was disheveled, his tie crooked—as if he'd just survived a brutal battle.

Julian swallowed hard and cautiously approached.

"Adrian, what happened?"

Adrian slowly lifted his gaze, eyes sharp as blades. "Why are you here?"

Julian steeled himself and sat down, choosing his words carefully. "Your father-in-law, Vincent Langley, came to see me."

Adrian's fingers stilled.

"He's asking about the whereabouts of that painting, Renaissance Masterpiece, at the auction house." Julian lowered his voice. "Is there something special about it?"

Adrian narrowed his eyes.

He had indeed seen that painting, but the details escaped him. Why was Vincent so fixated on it?

"Just some worthless canvas." Adrian's laugh was cold. "Worth your personal visit?"

Julian rubbed his arms. "Mr. Langley seemed desperate..."

"Then help him find it." Adrian's tone was flat. "After all, he's my father-in-law."

He bit down hard on the last word.

Julian exhaled in relief but couldn't resist prying. "I heard you sent Evelyn abroad?"

Adrian's grip on the pen tightened.

"That girl has no education—" Julian's words died as a glacial stare pinned him in place.

"Get out."

Julian forced a laugh and stood. At the door, he turned back. "Evelyn's actually quite pitiful—"

CRASH!

A crystal ashtray whizzed past his ear, shattering against the doorframe into a thousand pieces.

Julian fled.

Silence reclaimed the office.

Adrian stared at the wall clock, the ticking second hand grating against his nerves.

Suddenly, he remembered the look in Evelyn's eyes before she left.

A calm so unsettling it made his chest tighten.
###Chapter 93

Julian Roscente scoffed. Adrian Valentine's mood swings were more unpredictable than the weather.

He hadn't even finished speaking before being kicked out, leaving him fuming.

Adrian's indifference cut deeper than he'd anticipated.

"Don't you want to know what secret that painting holds?" Julian pressed, unwilling to back down.

He'd scored the artwork from an antique market flip, making a hefty profit. But Vincent Langley's reaction unsettled him.

Adrian didn't look up. "Ask Isabella if you're so curious."

The retort left Julian speechless.

He studied Adrian through narrowed eyes. "She didn't tell you either?"

Adrian's slender fingers tapped the desk. "If Vincent's desperate enough to hunt it down, do you really think it's ordinary?"

Julian's pulse jumped.

"Stranger still—the transaction records were wiped clean." He lowered his voice. "The buyer covered their tracks."

A glint flashed in Adrian's eyes.

Vincent's obsession confirmed his suspicions.

Julian bolted up, grabbing his jacket.

Adrian hit the intercom. "Victor."

Victor Ashcroft entered promptly. "Sir."

"Investigate the connection between the Renaissance Masterpiece and the Durand family." Adrian's tone turned glacial. "Vincent's after it."

His sudden reclamation of Evelyn Roland couldn't be coincidental.

Adrian stared at his phone wallpaper, lost in thought.

Victor produced a dossier. "Breaking news—the painting's actually a map to Eastalia's diamond mines."

"Alexander Durand's geologist background just leaked too."

Adrian's gaze sharpened.

The timing was too convenient.

"The Durand massacre was likely about this." His voice darkened.

Victor nodded. "Alexander's body was never recovered."

The memory of Evelyn's tear-streaked face sent a pang through Adrian's chest.

"Dig deeper."

As Victor opened the door, he nearly collided with Margaret Valentine.
###Chapter 94

"Mother?" Adrian Valentine looked up, his brow slightly furrowed.

Margaret Valentine entered, her face pale as she clutched her waist.

Beads of sweat dotted her temples, her lips trembling faintly.

"Adrian." Her voice was strained.

He set down the documents in his hand. "Why did you come here yourself?"

"Where's Evelyn?" She winced, sucking in a sharp breath. "Have her perform acupuncture for me. My back is killing me."

His expression darkened. "She's gone."

"What?" Margaret's head snapped up.

"Didn't you say she posed a threat to Isabella?" His tone remained even. "I sent her abroad today."

Her face turned ashen.

She hadn't expected her son to act so swiftly.

The searing pain in her back made her legs wobble.

"My spine..." Her voice shook. "Only she can treat it..."

Adrian regarded her impassively. "The hospital has an acupuncture department."

"Useless!" She gritted her teeth. "The same pressure points, but no one else's treatment works."

A sudden realization made her eyes turn venomous.

"That girl hid her skills well." A cold smirk twisted her lips. "She could even cure Natalie Lowell's asthma, yet kept it from us."

Adrian turned toward the window.

Sunlight streamed through the glass, casting sharp shadows across his chiseled profile.

"You should go to the hospital for a check-up." His voice was detached.

Margaret's forehead glistened with sweat.

She recalled Evelyn's focused expression during each acupuncture session.

The girl's technique was indeed unique.

"Adrian..." She softened her tone. "I only want what's best for you."

His back remained rigid, his shoulders tense.

"Isabella is the most suitable match for you." She pressed on. "The Langley family now—"

"Enough." He cut her off.

Margaret's face flushed with indignation.

Leaning heavily on the sofa, she began shuffling toward the exit.

Then her phone rang.

"Isabella?" Her voice instantly turned sweet.

Sobs crackled through the receiver.

"Aunt Margaret, Cassandra Valentine, she—" Isabella gasped between tears.

Margaret's expression darkened. "Did she bully you again?"

"I only accidentally—"

"That wretched girl!" Margaret exploded. "I'll go deal with her right now!"

She hung up, her back pain intensifying.

Adrian never turned from the window.
###Chapter 95

"Don't be afraid, Isabella. I'm in Adrian's office right now. He's busy, but I'll make sure he comes to help you."

Margaret Valentine's face darkened. Cassandra Valentine had grown increasingly brazen lately.

She wouldn't have dared lay a finger on Evelyn before.

Now she targeted Isabella at every turn—simply because she knew the girl was favored.

"Thank you, Aunt Margaret. Please let Adrian know." Isabella's voice trembled before she hung up.

Gritting her teeth against the pain in her legs, Margaret returned to the office. Seeing Adrian still engrossed in paperwork, her temper flared. "Adrian, is your phone on silent? Isabella called you a dozen times. She's in trouble."

"That bitch Cassandra hit her. Go now."

She always spoke to her son in this commanding tone.

A cold glint flashed in Adrian's eyes as he stood abruptly. "I'll leave immediately. But the Lindstrom deal might fall through. Mr. Lindstrom is already waiting in the conference room."

Margaret's expression changed instantly.

The Lindstroms were crucial business partners. This deal was vital for the company.

"Forget it. Stay and handle the negotiations. I'll check on her." Margaret hurriedly called for her driver.

Watching his mother leave, Adrian's lips curled into a mocking smile.

He sat back down, gaze drifting to the window.

Alexander Durand had died four years ago. So when he first met Evelyn, had that sorrow in her eyes been for him?

Evelyn Roland returned from her walk and went straight to the study to work.

A news alert about the "painting's secret" and the Durand family suddenly popped up on her screen.

Her pupils constricted.

Who was digging up the past?

The Durand case had been silent for four years.

First the painting resurfaced, and now its secret was exposed two months later. Who was pulling the strings?

A surviving Durand?

The perpetrator of that massacre still walked free.

Evelyn stared at the screen, unease coiling in her chest. Was this a trap set by someone who knew the truth?

She immediately dialed Zachary.

"Boss, calling about the Durand situation?" His voice remained smooth as jade.

Evelyn spoke urgently. "Any leads on the source?"

Clearly, Zachary had already begun investigating.

"I traced it immediately but hit a dead end. It's definitely not Vincent Langley—he wouldn't expose his own secrets."

"I discovered he went to Julian Roscente asking about the painting's whereabouts. Back then, apart from you, even the Durands didn't know the painting's secret."

"Someone's deliberately leaking this now, likely baiting Vincent."

Evelyn's chest tightened.

Who was behind this?

"Monitor this closely. Find out everything, but stay under the radar."

"Understood. I'll update you immediately."

Evelyn added, "Remember to eat on time."

A soft chuckle came through the line. "Thanks for the concern, Boss. I'll work on gaining weight—next time we meet, I'll be two kilos heavier just for you."

Shaking her head with a faint smile, Evelyn hung up.

She set the phone aside and returned to her emails.

Whoever was orchestrating this would surface soon enough.

After two hours of work, Evelyn stood to stretch.
###Chapter 96

Evelyn's phone screen lit up with a message from Scarlett.

Scarlett: [Look at this! Cassandra just slapped Isabella in public. The video's gone viral!]

Evelyn tapped play.

The footage showed Cassandra raising her hand and delivering a stinging blow. Isabella staggered back, clutching her cheek.

The comment section overflowed with accusations labeling Cassandra as cruel.

Evelyn knew Cassandra always followed her own rules.

For years, Cassandra had clashed with Margaret at every encounter.

Only the late uncle had earned her respect.

The family feud remained a mystery to Evelyn.

As she set her phone down, another message arrived.

[They're fighting again!]

A new video followed.

Margaret stormed forward and struck Cassandra across the face.

"Take your anger out on me, Cassandra!"

"Your precious Isabella?" Cassandra sneered. "Her joining the Valentines would be a joke."

Margaret swayed, nearly collapsing.

Isabella rushed to support her, eyes brimming with manufactured tears.

Evelyn realized three months had passed since Margaret's last acupuncture session.

The spinal stenosis must have flared up again.

All this suffering over Isabella?

Evelyn narrowed her eyes.

Isabella played dangerous games, but Cassandra proved even more formidable.

This feud was far from over.

Evelyn recalled the stock transfer incident where Margaret had targeted even Beatrice.

Yet Beatrice chose to sweep it under the rug.

She texted Scarlett: [Enough drama. Did they finalize the lead actress?]

Scarlett replied instantly: [Done! Julian's busy cursing Cassandra like the lovesick fool he is. Hilarious.]

Evelyn chuckled.

She pocketed her phone and strolled downstairs.

Autumn winds swirled fallen leaves around her feet.

Maple branches burned crimson against the sky.

While Evelyn enjoyed the peaceful moment, Vincent Langley faced mounting troubles.

No sooner had he uncovered clues about the Renaissance Masterpiece than someone leaked the information.

His expression darkened as he considered the only person who knew - Evelyn.

Could it be her?
###Chapter 97

Vincent Langley slammed his fist on the desk, his face dark with fury. "Dominic! Find out who leaked the Evans family's information. Was it that damned Evelyn?"

His bloodshot eyes burned like a raging lion's.

Dominic Lombardi entered the study quietly. "It wasn't Evelyn. Our men saw her board the plane with their own eyes."

Vincent's temples throbbed, veins bulging. "Then who? That useless Adrian Valentine! Only Evelyn knew the secret of the Renaissance Masterpiece, and he drove her away—just like his spineless father!"

"Sir!" Dominic paled, glancing around nervously. "You mustn't say such things!"

The study fell deathly silent.

Vincent sneered. "What's there to fear? That matter was buried long ago."

He paced restlessly before stopping abruptly. "We must find that painting immediately. I suspect Evelyn never left. She deliberately had it photographed and erased the transaction records. Adrian forcing her out was the perfect cover."

Dominic hesitated. "Sir, she grew up in the countryside, never even finished college. How could she pull off something like this?"

He'd visited Evelyn often over the years. She'd lived with an old man until his death, only then returning to the Langley family.

Vincent narrowed his eyes. Something didn't add up.

"Sir!" Dominic suddenly remembered. "Miss Isabella is in trouble! She clashed with Cassandra Valentine. When Mrs. Valentine intervened, things escalated."

"Julian Roscente was there too. They sent Cassandra to the hospital. The Valentine family's second uncle dotes on his niece—he won't let this slide."

Vincent trembled with rage, knuckles cracking.

"Handle it now!" he hissed. "Pin everything on Cassandra. Say she abused her power. Buy trending hashtags and milk this scandal dry!"

"Isabella's career is on the rise. This free publicity is too good to waste!"

Dominic nodded and hurried out.

——

Valentine Group CEO Office.

Adrian Valentine listened to the recording, murderous intent swirling in his eyes.

Vincent knew about his father's death?

Deliberately stunted Evelyn's growth?

BANG! His fist smashed into the desk.

Knock knock knock—

"Enter." His voice was glacial.

Victor Ashcroft shivered outside the door. Was the CEO this furious over Isabella's incident?
###Chapter 98

Victor's heart clenched when he pushed open the door.

Adrian's silhouette stood solitary by the floor-to-ceiling window, as if abandoned by the entire world. His usually upright posture now radiated indescribable desolation.

Victor tightened his fists.

It should be Evelyn who was in pain.

After what Adrian had done, how devastated must she be?

Yet why did the air itself seem saturated with his sorrow?

"Mr. Valentine, there's trouble with Isabella Langley." Victor forced himself to report. "Julian Roscente and Mrs. Valentine teamed up to attack Cassandra."

A cold smirk curled Adrian's lips.

Isabella certainly had her ways.

In silence, he picked up his phone and played the video.

His eyes turned glacial when it ended. "Suppress the news."

Victor blinked. "That's it?"

Normally, Adrian would personally handle anything involving Isabella.

Adrian slowly turned, his gaze piercingly cold. "What else would you suggest?"

A chill ran down Victor's spine as he hastily retreated from the office.

The moment the door clicked shut, Adrian viciously kicked the sofa.

Once.

Twice.

Thrice.

Blood stained his leather shoes, but he didn't notice.

His right hand throbbed with excruciating pain—the injury from when he'd struck Evelyn.

......

That night, public opinion completely reversed.

Footage of Cassandra verbally assaulting Isabella went viral, causing Lunaris Group's stocks to plummet.

Meanwhile, videos of Isabella defending her co-stars spread like wildfire.

Her fanbase exploded tenfold overnight.

Viewership for her drama skyrocketed.

In her hospital room, Cassandra stared at her wrist—broken by Julian—and smirked. "Isabella Langley, Julian Roscente... see you in hell."

The next morning, Evelyn listened to Victoria's account while calmly slicing her omelet.

"That Isabella and her disgusting, fake act!" Victoria fumed. "She started the whole thing!"

Evelyn glanced up. "Can't you see through such an obvious setup?"
###Chapter 99

Evelyn set down her fork with a slight frown. "Victoria, Isabella's sudden rise to fame feels suspicious."

Sophia took a sip of water, her eyes glinting coldly. "It's a PR stunt orchestrated by Adrian and Vincent. They're whitewashing Isabella's image with paid trending topics and hired trolls."

The higher they climb, the harder they fall.

Isabella's current glory would become her future nightmare.

That woman's ambitions were transparent—best actress awards, luxury endorsements, she wanted it all.

But Cassandra's retaliation would destroy her.

The Valentine heiress had always eliminated threats with surgical precision.

Unless Isabella could prove herself flawless.

Too bad Evelyn still possessed the damning video of her refusing to help someone in distress.

Blinded by the hype, the public would turn on her once the truth surfaced.

"Cassandra outmaneuvers Isabella by miles, but don't underestimate her." Evelyn tapped the table lightly. "Remember the stolen documents case? She covered her tracks through eighteen shell companies."

Even Adrian hadn't immediately traced it back to her.

Cross-border operations, layered proxies—Isabella was undeniably clever.

And the Natalie incident? Without that video evidence, she would've walked away unscathed.

Evelyn never underestimated opponents.

The most harmless-looking ones often dealt the deadliest blows.

That's why she'd sent Sophia abroad disguised as her—to uncover Isabella's secrets.

Sophia's mastery of disguise made investigations easier in Eastalia.

Vincent would never suspect an "uneducated country girl."

Too busy hunting for Alexander's map to pay attention.

This game was already decided.

Evelyn checked her phone—Valentine and Langley stocks were soaring.

She stayed hands-off, letting Adrian capitalize on the momentum.

Closing the finance app, she focused on her pregnancy.

Her belly grew daily. Despite difficulty walking now, she maintained her routine for a month straight.

Valentine Group secured several major contracts.

Business headlines overflowed with their triumphs—no surprise after the Horizon Tech partnership cemented their dominance.

Stocks skyrocketed at opening bell, Valentine's supremacy unchallenged.

Evelyn's mobility worsened lately, even short walks exhausted her.

Victoria shadowed her constantly.

Gabrielle strictly monitored her diet.

Evelyn ate small, frequent meals—nourishing yet figure-conscious.

Isabella wasn't faring as comfortably.

A month into filming, she still hadn't seen Adrian once.
###Chapter 100

Adrian Valentine had become elusive lately, frequently traveling between major cities.

Since the incident with Cassandra Valentine, no one on set dared to bully Isabella Langley openly.

But the whispers behind her back never stopped. Everyone claimed she'd risen through the ranks only because of Adrian's influence.

As today's filming wrapped up, Isabella dialed Adrian's number once more.

The same cold automated voice answered.

This marked the seventh unanswered call.

Sitting in her chauffeured car, Isabella's fingers turned icy. Ever since Evelyn Roland left, Adrian's attitude toward her had noticeably cooled.

She switched to calling Margaret Valentine instead.

"Isabella, finished with work?" Margaret's gentle voice came through.

Isabella forced a smile. "Auntie, where's Adrian? I haven't seen him in a month."

"The company just signed several major projects. He flew overseas three days ago," Margaret explained. "But don't worry—no matter how busy he gets, he never forgets you. Flowers arrive every week."

"A man must focus on his career. The more he earns now, the more comfortable your future will be."

Isabella murmured agreement, but emptiness gnawed at her.

Since Adrian remained unreachable, she had no choice but to keep currying favor with Margaret.

The old matriarch's dislike didn't matter—as long as Margaret stood by her side.

"Auntie, I'm free tonight. Shall we have dinner together?"

Margaret declined immediately. "I'm at the hospital for physical therapy—my back pain is unbearable. Don't come; hospitals are full of germs."

Isabella secretly sighed in relief. Exhausted from daily filming, she had no energy for hospital visits.

The thought of Scarlett Orlando's effortless performance on set soured her mood further.

"I'll visit after you're discharged."

"Good girl. Filming is tiring—make sure to rest," Margaret reminded her.

After hanging up, Isabella leaned back in her seat, lost in thought.

Margaret's inexplicable favoritism remained puzzling, but it worked in her favor.

Their engagement, originally scheduled for this month, had been postponed due to everyone's packed schedules.

The biggest surprise was Cassandra's reaction.

Since the hospital incident, Cassandra had quietly returned to work without seeking revenge.

"Where's Cassandra today?" Isabella suddenly asked.

The driver checked his phone. "Miss, Cassandra is attending a business gala tonight. The chairman will also be there."

A calculating glint flashed in Isabella's eyes. "Let's go too."

"But the chairman instructed—"

"Julian Roscente will be there. Nothing will go wrong," she interrupted. "I need to expand my connections."

Smoothing the wrinkles on her dress, she curled her lips into a determined smile.
###Chapter 101

Vincent Langley had personally selected Isabella Langley's chauffeur.

The man in his early thirties was more than just a driver—he was an exceptionally skilled bodyguard.

His chiseled features exuded quiet confidence.

The outline of his muscular frame was faintly visible beneath his tailored suit.

Seeing Isabella's determination to attend the banquet, he had no choice but to start the luxury car.

......

Evelyn Roland was organizing documents when Nathan Aldridge called.

An invitation to the international exchange banquet lay untouched on her desk.

The NovaCore project was finalized, awaiting only the final step before production.

Sterling Manor had been making waves recently.

She had just approved the Botanica cosmetics development plan.

Nathan was tasked with finding suitable partners.

After hanging up, Evelyn picked up her silver needles and headed to Christian Lefèvre's room.

The man on the bed remained unconscious, his shallow breaths the only sign of life.

The burn scars had faded, yet he refused to wake.

The agony on his face during the rescue still haunted Evelyn's memories.

The events before the fire remained a mystery.

That day, she had merely been passing by when she stumbled upon Christian and Adrian Valentine......

Finishing the acupuncture session, Evelyn walked back along the garden path.

The early winter wind scattered fallen leaves.

Rumors about Alexander Durand had been circulating for a month.

Various factions were searching for that elusive map.

Tonight, Evelyn deliberately leaked information—Vincent Langley held its secrets.

The banquet hall glittered with opulence, its nine-meter vaulted ceiling imposing.

Crystal chandeliers bathed the space in dazzling light.

A massive screen cycled through corporate promotional videos.

As Isabella entered, she crossed paths with Nathan and his assistant.

Nathan pretended not to see her.

Isabella blocked his way.

Tonight, she had abandoned her usual innocent persona.

A crimson gown hugged her curves.

Scarlet lips accentuated her allure.

"In such a hurry, Mr. Aldridge?" Isabella's red lips curved.

Nathan eyed her coldly. "Do you need something, Miss Langley?"

"Just a friendly reminder—don't be fooled by certain people." Her tone dripped implication. "That country bumpkin Evelyn—"

"Miss Langley." Nathan cut her off. "Did your etiquette tutor neglect to teach you manners?"

Isabella's face drained of color.
###Chapter 102

"Nathan, you—"

"What about me? Can't even form a proper sentence yet you're gossiping like a fishwife? Is your brain only wired for scheming? Who made you the judge of other people's morals?"

"Miss Langley, mind your manners."

Isabella's pupils contracted. How dare a mere guard dog from Sterling Manor speak to her like this?

Nathan found her stunned silence utterly boring.

If Sophia were here, she'd have verbally eviscerated this woman until she booked a one-way ticket off the planet.

The driver leaned in with a venomous whisper, "Patience, Miss. We'll deal with him later."

Isabella finally regained her composure.

Nathan immediately texted Evelyn upon entering the venue, reporting Isabella's presence.

Evelyn replied instantly: [Ignore her. The Langleys are dangerous. Watch your back.]

Nathan's guard went up.

But something felt off about tonight's gathering.

Why was everyone fawning over Vincent Langley?

He edged closer with his assistant, catching snippets of conversation:

"Mr. Langley, we heard only you know the secret of that painting. Let's share the wealth, shall we?"

"Our company specializes in mineral exploration. Just give us the lead..."

Vincent's forehead glistened with sweat. What secret? He couldn't decipher a treasure map if it bit him.

"A misunderstanding," he feigned helplessness. "My adopted daughter Evelyn holds the answers. She's... unavailable at the moment. This old man is past his prime."

Nathan nearly snorted.

The greed in that fox's eyes was practically oozing through his dignified facade.

"Is this true?" Chairman Lin grabbed Vincent's arm eagerly.

"Absolutely. She and Alexander Durand were lovers. He entrusted everything to her."

Nathan: "..." Since when was Evelyn dating Alexander?

This was blatant deflection.

True, Evelyn knew about the map—she and Alexander grew up together. But siblings-at-arms, not lovers.
###Chapter 103

Nathan Aldridge glared coldly at Vincent Langley. The old fox was playing his games well.

Nathan stood his ground and quickly sent a message to Evelyn Roland.

Evelyn's eyes turned sharp as she read it.

So it was Vincent Langley after all.

The older ginger was indeed spicier.

By diverting all attention to her, he could both let others investigate him and clear his own name.

Vincent portrayed himself as a philanthropist and entrepreneur.

But the shady dealings behind the scenes—she would uncover them sooner or later.

He was the first one searching for the painting. The tragedy that befell the Durand family was undoubtedly linked to him.

Evelyn: [Rumors die with the wise. You know what to do?]

Nathan instantly understood. His gaze toward Vincent turned razor-sharp. "Mr. Langley, that's quite an accusation. Evelyn used to be my assistant. How is it that I never knew she was Alexander Durand's girlfriend? You were close with the Durand patriarch. If anyone knows the family's secrets, it's you. Unless... you're trying to hoard the truth for yourself by pinning it on some country girl?"

Vincent had just relaxed when Nathan's words startled him again.

He whipped his head toward Nathan. Why was this brat suddenly speaking up?

He knew about the painting's secret but couldn't decipher the map's riddle. Just one location—that was all he needed to strike gold.

The other executives' expressions darkened.

Vincent suppressed his fury. "Mr. Aldridge, you seem quite familiar with Evelyn. How can you be so sure she wasn't involved with Alexander?"

His own daughter had used this very tactic to make Adrian Valentine misunderstand Evelyn.

If Adrian ever learned the truth...

"We are familiar. But you were far closer to the Durands. Any secrets would reach you first. If you want to keep everything for yourself, just say so. No need to drag an innocent girl into this."

Nathan deliberately redirected the fire toward Vincent.

"Besides, if Evelyn knew the secret, wouldn't she have gone after the diamonds herself? Would she just stand by and watch others profit?"

Vincent: "..."

If he had nothing useful to say, he should've kept his mouth shut.

"Mr. Aldridge—"

Nathan's phone suddenly rang.

He flashed Vincent a smile. "Mr. Langley, wealth is best shared. Contribute your efforts, pay your dues. Stop pretending—with your ties to the Durands, everyone believes you know more. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have an important call to take."

With that, he walked off, leaving chaos in his wake.

Vincent's face turned livid.

That bastard did this on purpose!

Who else knew about the secret besides him?

Who leaked the information?

The crowd immediately swarmed Vincent, voices overlapping in a frenzy.

Not far away, Adrian Valentine observed everything with cold detachment.

His expression unreadable, he turned and left without a word.

Even Nathan knew about Evelyn's connection to Alexander.

Yet her own husband had been kept in the dark?

Evelyn... just how many more secrets are you hiding from me?

Adrian got into his car and instructed Victor Ashcroft to drive him home.

In the crowd, Isabella Langley caught sight of Adrian.

She chased after him but found no trace. Stomping her foot in frustration, she seethed.

"Miss, the chairman is surrounded," her driver reminded her.

Isabella thought of the storm surrounding the Durand family's secrets, rage boiling inside her.

Who the hell leaked it?
###Chapter 104

Adrian Valentine returned to the villa he once shared with Evelyn Roland.

The interior remained exactly as she had left it.

Exhausted, he collapsed onto the sofa without even removing his shoes.

Closing his eyes brought no rest.

Her scent had long faded from the air.

Adrian stared blankly out the window.

That familiar number would never connect again.

......

Evelyn received a message from Nathan Aldridge before bed.

Vincent Langley's excuses had convinced no one.

She had expected this outcome but wanted to know his next move.

Unfortunately, alerting him meant he would lie low.

Irritation prickled her. Who had leaked the information?

Quietly, she posted a message on the dark web.

[Only Vincent Langley knows the secret of the map.]

Those few words sent shockwaves through elite circles.

Jewelry tycoons flocked to Isabella Langley under various pretenses.

Vincent spent a harrowing month fending them off.

Nathan reported daily updates—precisely the chaos Evelyn intended.

She wanted Vincent perpetually under scrutiny.

Winter's second day marked Evelyn's birthday.

Pregnant and low-key, she skipped formal celebrations.

Her grandfather Frederick Roland sent a violet diamond set.

[Happy birthday, my precious granddaughter!]

His message drew a rare smile.

Sebastian Cortez gifted her a diamond necklace.

[Happy birthday, Evelyn. Wishing you endless joy.]

[Thanks, brother.]

Jewelry usually left her indifferent, but wearing it stunned her.

The mirror reflected effortless elegance.

Victoria Laurent prepared longevity noodles. Nathan, Zachary Deross, and Gabrielle Flores joined her.

A simple cake sufficed.

In four years of marriage, Adrian had never remembered.

Only her grandfather and brother remained constant.

Her birthday was quiet yet warm.

Meanwhile, Isabella's lavish party dominated headlines.

Adrian booked Vienna's Imperial Palace Hotel, live-streaming the spectacle.

Watching the broadcast, Victoria muttered, "He's sparing no expense for Isabella's birthday."
###Chapter 105

The parenting book slipped from Evelyn's hands onto her lap with a soft thud.

A sharp pain pierced her chest.

Adrian had never celebrated her birthday.

Her lips curled into a self-deprecating smile. Why humiliate herself knowing he never loved her?

Every comparison was another stab to the heart.

Yet she couldn't bring herself to hate Adrian.

She had willingly swallowed his lies like honey.

The only mistake was her own foolishness.

Victoria stared at the live broadcast, missing Evelyn's fleeting bitter smile.

Closing the book, Evelyn rose and walked into the courtyard.

These past months were the most leisurely of her life.

Before eighteen, she'd spun like a top—rising at dawn, studying medical texts even in the bathroom, collapsing into bed at midnight.

Now she worked three hours daily, free to spend the rest as she pleased.

The villa complex stood eerily silent. A cold wind swept through as the solitary moon hung overhead.

With her heart emptied, the world felt hollow too.

From now on, only her career and children would occupy that space.

"Eternal Devotion" trended for three days. Adrian had designed the necklace for Isabella, clasping it around her neck himself.

When the news notification popped up, Evelyn felt nothing.

Isabella's social capital skyrocketed after that birthday gala.

Spring returned to Vienna in a riot of blossoms.

Four months later, after two grueling days in labor, Evelyn delivered twins.

At her most excruciating moment, her phone buzzed with an alert: Adrian vacationing in Maldives with his fiancée.

She bit her lip bloody, nails digging into her palms. She had to survive for these babies.

Frederick rushed back before the birth. Cradling his great-grandchildren, tears streamed down the old man's face.

Their bloodline mattered not—these were the Roland legacy.

The boy was named Tristan. "Serene heart, enlightened soul," Frederick declared.

Evelyn frowned. "Are you sending my son to a monastery?"

He flicked her forehead. "Nonsense! My heir will conquer the world."

The girl was named Felicia. "Much prettier than my name," Evelyn muttered.

Her own name came from the fortune teller who found her.

"Lacking wood elements, so we called her Chu Chu." Frederick beamed at the infants, grinning ear to ear.

By late summer, Gabrielle finally permitted outings.

"Four months of postpartum confinement is absurd!" Evelyn glared indignantly.
###Chapter 106

Gabrielle cradled the baby gently. "Stop complaining, Evelyn. For four months I've been taking care of you and these two little angels. Look at your figure—it's even better than before pregnancy. And see how plump and healthy Tristan and Felicia are? Only I could achieve such perfection."

Evelyn sighed helplessly.

The mirror reflected her slender waist and glowing skin. In the crib, her twins looked like porcelain dolls—rosy-cheeked and full of life.

Parenting was exhausting!

She couldn't comprehend how Gabrielle made it seem effortless.

Gabrielle was meticulously recording the infants' growth metrics.

Evelyn suddenly felt like a lab rat in an experiment.

But she trusted Gabrielle completely with her children.

"Gabby, is Christian still unconscious?" Evelyn frowned. The expensive herbs sustaining his life were draining her resources.

Gabrielle paused her writing, tilting her head. "He doesn't want to wake up. But his fingers twitch occasionally. Give him another year or two."

Neither anticipated it would take three years.

The aroma of cooking drifted upstairs.

Victoria bustled in the kitchen. Summer garden scents wafted through open windows.

"Miss Evelyn, Mr. Cortez called. The company's hosting a celebration banquet tonight for Ms. Orlando's new drama premiere tomorrow. He'll pick you up this afternoon."

Evelyn nodded. "Understood."

Time to return.

Adrian Valentine—when we meet again, we'll be strangers.

She took a deep breath.

Over the past year, Isabella Langley had skyrocketed to fame with Phoenix Feather, becoming entertainment's newest darling.

Scarlett Orlando's Imperial Consort faced delays after its male lead's injury, finally premiering tomorrow.

Isabella already secured multiple endorsements and new projects.

Vincent Langley continued searching for the missing Renaissance masterpiece, receiving endless visitors at the Langley estate.

"Miss Evelyn, come try these fresh cherries!" Victoria beckoned conspiratorially. "Quick, before Gabrielle notices."

Breastfeeding meant strict dietary restrictions under Gabrielle's supervision.

Evelyn hurried over, sampling one. Tart sweetness burst on her tongue, but she dared not indulge further.

Between Frederick Roland, Gabrielle, and Victoria, childcare responsibilities were covered.

Since gaining heirs, her grandfather had delegated all corporate duties to her.

The weight of responsibility pressed heavily, but Evelyn shouldered it without complaint.

That afternoon, she donned a black evening gown with a simple diamond necklace—elegant yet understated.

Returning to Vienna, she'd resume her identity as Nathan Aldridge's assistant, Evelyn Roland.

Everything was prepared.

She opened the door to find Sebastian Cortez's tall silhouette waiting.
###Chapter 107

Sebastian Cortez had refined features like polished jade, his gentle demeanor radiating warmth. Every movement carried effortless grace, his presence as soothing as a spring breeze that could calm any restlessness.

"Brother..."

Evelyn Roland lifted her dress slightly as she hurried toward him, her eyes crinkling with joy.

Sebastian steadied her with a light touch. "Slow down. I'm not going anywhere."

She looped her arm through his and looked up. "Did you bring me anything good?"

"Braised chicken legs and grilled squid. Saved them for your late-night snack." His voice was indulgent, his eyes crinkling with amusement.

Evelyn pouted.

Why couldn't she have them now?

"The smell is too strong. Wait until we get back." Sebastian saw right through her, his smile deepening.

She relented. Gabrielle Flores had a sharp nose—if she caught a whiff, there'd be an endless lecture.

Nathan Aldridge stood waiting by the car and opened the door as they approached.

The vehicle glided toward the Imperial Palace Hotel.

Though Evelyn had kept a low profile for the past year, she remained acutely aware of every development outside her walls.

"Boss, when is Sophia coming back?" Nathan asked, hands on the wheel.

"Next month," Evelyn replied evenly.

She had sent Sophia Blanchet to investigate the Langley and Evans matters. Results were due soon.

"Perfect!" Nathan's eyes brightened. "Things just don't feel complete without her around."

Sebastian glanced at him through the rearview mirror. "You've matured quite a bit in a year."

Nathan suppressed a grimace. After being drilled daily by Evelyn, how could he not improve?

But in her eyes, he still had miles to go.

"Brother, Nathan still has a long way ahead," Evelyn said, gazing out the window.

Nathan straightened. "Don't worry, Boss. I can handle it."

Sebastian gently ruffled Evelyn's hair. "Don't push yourself too hard. Grandfather only wants you safe and happy. Once Ethan grows up, things will get easier."

Evelyn nodded with a faint smile.

The Imperial Palace Hotel blazed with light.

As the trio entered the banquet hall, crystal chandeliers scattered dazzling reflections across the room.

Sebastian instantly became the center of attention.

"Mr. Cortez!" Theodore Lowell strode forward, then froze at the sight of Evelyn. "Miss Roland? You're back?"

He would never forget the medicine she had sent six months ago—the cure that saved his daughter's asthma.
###Chapter 108

The past six months had seen Evelyn's daughter steadily recovering.

Yet the mastermind behind it all remained at large.

Evelyn gave a slight nod. "Mr. Lowell, it's been a while."

"Wonderful! Natalie talks about you every day. She's returning next month. Miss Roland, that child has few friends—would you be willing to meet her then?" Theodore Lowell's eyes brimmed with paternal warmth.

Sebastian Cortez interjected smoothly, "Mr. Lowell, the business world operates on interests. A year ago, you chose to partner with Adrian Valentine while rejecting Evelyn, the very person who saved your daughter."

It wasn't resentment—just a matter of principle.

For the past year, he'd strictly limited collaborations with Adrian.

Those who harmed his sister would pay.

Theodore looked chastened. "A lapse in judgment. They claimed to be sisters, so I didn't question it."

Evelyn tugged Sebastian's sleeve lightly. "Let it go, Sebastian."

A cold glint flashed in Sebastian's eyes. "Though we should thank you, Mr. Lowell. Your rejection inspired Sterling Manor's heiress. Our proprietary raw materials launch next month."

Theodore nodded admiringly. "Sterling Manor breeds exceptional talent. Its heirs are truly extraordinary."

Sebastian's lips curved. "Too kind. Excuse us."

He guided Evelyn away, unaware of the scorching gaze from the shadows.

Sebastian settled Evelyn in the lounge. "Wait here, Evie. Scarlett's tied up at the moment."

She nodded obediently. "I'll play some games."

Who would've guessed the elusive Sterling Manor heiress was a gaming enthusiast?

Once alone, Evelyn immersed herself in a dance rhythm game.

The door burst open.

"Forget something?" she asked without looking up.

Silence.

When she lifted her gaze, she met bottomless dark eyes.

Her expression frosted over. "What are you doing here?"

A year was enough to still any lingering emotions.

Adrian Valentine remained strikingly handsome, though maturity now edged his features.

His corporation had broken into Vienna's top ten this year.

The media constantly featured him jet-setting with Isabella on private getaways.

Their delayed engagement meant nothing to her.

Adrian studied her luminous face.

She'd grown even more beautiful, her every glance radiating allure.

He advanced step by deliberate step.
###Chapter 109

Evelyn Roland reclined lazily on the leather sofa, her fingers tapping lightly on the armrest.

She lifted her gaze to the man approaching her, a slight frown creasing her brow.

Her heartbeat quickened uncontrollably. A year had passed, yet this man could still make her pulse race.

"Mr. Valentine, please leave," she said coldly, turning her face away.

The reunion had come too soon. She had deliberately avoided the main hall to prevent running into him.

Yet fate had other plans—she had crossed paths with him on her very first day back.

Adrian Valentine took a seat across from her. Time had lent him an air of maturity, but it couldn't mask the arrogance in his bones.

His lips curved slightly. "I seem to recall telling you not to let me see you again."

A full year of silence. And now she had returned—with Sebastian Cortez by her side, that gentle pianist.

Evelyn let out a cold laugh, her fingers trembling. "You drove me into a corner, Mr. Valentine. Impressive. But you'll be disappointed—this time, I'm staying. Do your worst."

Every word cut like a blade. She had spent a year swearing to forget him, vowing never to shed another tear for him.

Yet in the dead of night, the memory of his icy gaze still left her breathless with pain.

Adrian studied her. Had Sebastian given her this newfound confidence?

"Evelyn, I'll admit—landing Sebastian is quite the feat. But does he know you're the woman I discarded?" His tone was mocking, but his heart bled.

"Just because you threw me away, I don't deserve happiness?" Evelyn arched a brow, stunningly beautiful.

"As long as Isabella stays out of my way, we can coexist peacefully. But if either of you crosses me—" She stood abruptly. "I'll make sure you regret it for the rest of your lives."

A year's worth of suppressed anguish surged forth. The torment of her pregnancy, the agony of two days in labor.

Back then, the only thing keeping her going was the child in her womb—yet her thoughts had been filled with him.

The cruelest blow? On the day she gave birth, the news had shown Adrian taking Isabella on a luxury yacht getaway.

That pain had seared itself into her soul.
###Chapter 110

Adrian Valentine suddenly stood up and strode toward Evelyn Roland, roughly capturing her trembling lips.

Evelyn's pupils constricted as she pushed against him with all her strength. How dare he touch her with lips that had kissed Isabella Langley?

"Mmph—"

She struggled desperately, but Adrian's iron grip held her immobile. The kiss was brutal, as if he wanted to devour her whole.

The familiar sweetness of her made him shudder. Three hundred days of longing crashed over him like a tidal wave.

Evelyn bit down hard on his tongue.

"Ah—"

The metallic tang of blood spread between them. But Adrian didn't flinch, as if determined to reclaim every kiss they'd missed in the past year.

Only when they were both gasping for air did he finally pull away.

Slap!

Her palm struck his cheek with a sharp crack.

"Adrian Valentine, how dare you humiliate me like this?" Tears streamed down her face, her nails digging into her own palms.

Adrian licked the blood from the corner of his mouth, his thumb brushing over her swollen lips. "You've gotten worse at this, Evelyn. Didn't Sebastian Cortez teach you how to kiss?"

"Get out!" Her voice was raw as she pointed at the door.

Adrian adjusted his cuffs with deliberate calm. "Remember—if you lay a single finger on Isabella, I'll make sure you regret being alive."

Evelyn suddenly laughed, tears clinging to her lashes. "You forced my hand. A year ago, it wasn't Melanie Evans who leaked the new product formula. It was Isabella—she bribed Melanie's brother with a kidney to take the fall."

"Proof?" His pupils contracted sharply.

"Melanie's brother is missing a kidney, and Isabella just happens to have an extra one. Isn't that proof enough?" She lifted her chin. "You two are perfect for each other—one a hypocrite, the other blind."

Adrian's expression darkened like storm clouds.

"May you two live happily ever after—a bitch and her lapdog." She grabbed her coat and turned to leave.

The door slammed shut with a deafening crash.

Adrian drove his fist into the coffee table. Amid the shattering glass, Christian Lefèvre's deathly pale face flashed through his mind.

That snowy night, it had been Evelyn's car that sent his best friend flying.

How dare she still walk around with such arrogance?

"Mr. Valentine?" His secretary stepped in, flinching at the murderous glint in his eyes. "Miss Langley is waiting for you downstairs."

###Chapter 111

Adrian Valentine's lips curled into a provocative smirk as his piercing gaze locked onto Sebastian Cortez. "Mr. Cortez seems particularly interested in Evelyn. Pity she used to be mine."

Sebastian's jade-like eyes frosted over instantly. He strode to the seat Evelyn had occupied moments ago, his stare lingering on the bloodstains on Adrian's lips. The glacial chill in his gaze deepened.

As men, they both knew exactly what Adrian had done to Evelyn.

"If you know it's in the past," Sebastian said with measured calm, "you should understand divorced men don't belong in her life. She's better off without you."

He adjusted his cufflinks. "And let's not forget your official girlfriend is Isabella Langley. Unless you want her exposed as the other woman, stay away from Evelyn."

Adrian's knuckles whitened. His heart twisted as if being shredded by a blade.

She told Sebastian about that too?

"How generous of you to take in castoffs," Adrian sneered.

Sebastian rose gracefully, surveying the arrogant man before him with undisguised contempt. This was the man Evelyn had loved to the point of self-destruction.

The man who'd made her waste four years of her youth. The man whose actions had driven her to despair after Alexander's death. He'd sent her abroad to recover, only for her to fall into Adrian's trap.

"Adrian," Sebastian said with icy finality, "Evelyn deserves better. You're unworthy of her."

He turned on his heel and left, his posture as unyielding as an ancient pine.

Adrian remained rooted, his darkening gaze fixed on the empty chair. Rage simmered in his eyes.

So Sebastian had already recognized her worth.

Remembering Evelyn's resolute expression and cutting words, a low chuckle escaped his throat...

Evelyn stepped out of the private room, noticing Scarlett Orlando hadn't returned. She decided to get some air in the courtyard.

She knew this place well—the secluded garden behind the main building.

The moment she exited, a vision in pink blocked her path. Isabella Langley's strapless gown accentuated her porcelain skin and delicate collarbones. Now an A-list actress, she carried herself with the effortless grace of stardom.

"Who gave you permission to come back?" Isabella's eyes glinted with malice. She'd seen Evelyn enter the private room with Sebastian, then Adrian following.

Detained by socialites, she'd only just escaped in time to witness Evelyn's red-rimmed eyes upon exiting.

"Since when does Vienna belong to you?" Evelyn's laugh was razor-sharp. "I come and go as I please. Your opinion means nothing."

Her mood already foul, this woman had chosen the worst possible moment to provoke her.

"What were you doing with Adrian in there?" Isabella hissed, abandoning all pretense of sisterhood in the empty corridor.

"That's your man. Ask him yourself." Evelyn's voice could freeze hell.

Isabella hated her composed demeanor most. "Tomorrow's headlines will feature you seducing my fiancé. Believe that."

For a year, she'd hunted Evelyn across continents, yet found no trace—not even in Eastalia's immigration records.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Threatening me?"
###Chapter 112

Evelyn's lips curled slightly. "Go ahead. Expose me. Let the whole internet judge who's the real homewrecker here."

"Isabella, I've tolerated your mistress status all these years simply because I couldn't be bothered with you. But since you keep pushing me, don't blame me for tearing off the mask."

As Evelyn turned to leave, she caught the calculating glint in Isabella's eyes from her peripheral vision.

Slap!

A sharp sound echoed through the air.

Isabella had struck herself hard across the face, her nails leaving bloody scratches on her neck.

Evelyn narrowed her eyes.

"Sister, I'm sorry..." Isabella suddenly collapsed to her knees, voice trembling. "I know you hate me for taking your place, but the baby swap wasn't my fault... Please stop hitting me..."

Evelyn scoffed. "What's this? Switching to fraud now?"

"Evelyn!" Adrian's furious roar erupted behind them.

Now Evelyn understood Isabella's sudden theatrics.

An Oscar-worthy performance indeed.

Adrian rushed to help Isabella up. Seeing the marks on her neck, his gaze turned icy. "Her new film starts shooting tomorrow. Are you trying to ruin her career?"

The night wind swirled with fallen leaves, chilling Evelyn's heart.

"Isabella, you've got skin fragments from scratching yourself still lodged under your nails." Evelyn smirked. "Did your acting frenzy make you forget basic forensic science?"

Isabella instantly hid her hands behind her back.

Evelyn seized her wrist, forcing her nails into Adrian's view. "Shall we call the police for a DNA test right now?"

Adrian's expression faltered.

"It happened when I struggled while she was hitting me..." Isabella tearfully burrowed into Adrian's arms.

Evelyn applauded. "Such brilliant improvisation. The Golden Globes owe you a trophy."

"Look! Ms. Langley's being attacked!"

Hurried footsteps approached from down the corridor.
###Chapter 113

Isabella's pupils constricted. Who was this idiot?

She only wanted Adrian to despise Evelyn, not to make this a public spectacle.

Hearing the chaotic footsteps behind her, Evelyn's lips curled into a faint smirk. "Isabella, so this was your plan all along?"

Her light tone sent chills down Isabella's spine. Every time Evelyn smiled like that, an inexplicable dread gripped her heart.

Adrian frowned at the swarm of approaching reporters. "Must you destroy Isabella?"

She shouldn't have returned. The mystery surrounding Alexander's death remained unsolved, and those people had never stopped searching for the map. The Langley family had been receiving endless visitors this past year—Vincent had been hunting for her relentlessly.

Evelyn's reappearance was destined to stir a storm.

Adrian's dark gaze fixed on her. She still wore her short hair sharply, her piercing eyes and fiery red lips radiating an overwhelming aura. The delicate lines of her profile were breathtaking.

Evelyn turned to Isabella. "I warned you—stay out of my way, and we coexist peacefully. But if you play with fire, I won't hesitate to burn you down. Trying to paint me as the other woman? First, ask yourself if you can handle the consequences."

Her voice dropped to an icy whisper. "The lead actor's car accident in Imperial Consort—wasn't that your doing, Ms. Langley? If this scandal breaks, Adrian, protecting her will cost you everything."

Isabella paled. She had orchestrated the accident to sabotage Scarlett's new drama. But how did Evelyn know?

Before she could process it, Evelyn faced the reporters. Just then, she spotted Scarlett's agent, Celeste Rubinstein.

Evelyn: "..."

Celeste stormed over dramatically. "I just saw you hit Ms. Langley with my own eyes!"

Evelyn arched a brow.

Celeste frantically blinked at her.

Evelyn's temple twitched. Was this woman having a seizure?

Celeste stamped her foot in frustration. Why wasn't this woman catching on? She was practically blinking Morse code!

"And?" Evelyn countered coldly.

Celeste stumbled back from the sheer intensity of her gaze. This was why Evelyn was legendary—one look could make knees buckle.

"How dare you act so arrogant after assaulting someone?" Celeste forced herself to shout.

Isabella stiffened upon recognizing her. Scarlett's agent might seem sweet and harmless, but her tactics were ruthless. Isabella had fallen victim to her schemes before—nearly losing everything.
###Chapter 114

Camera flashes erupted as a reporter pressed aggressively, "Miss, why did you assault Ms. Langley? She's a top celebrity."

Isabella Langley had risen to fame with the backing of the Valentine and Langley families.

Her sweet, innocent image was deeply ingrained in public perception. Her recent drama series and commercials had garnered widespread acclaim.

The gentle, kind-hearted character she portrayed left a lasting impression on audiences.

"Oh? So she's a star." Evelyn Roland's lips curled, her sugary voice laced with venom. "No wonder the acting is so convincing—even the wardrobe is part of the performance. As for why I hit her, perhaps she should explain?"

The reporter fell silent.

This beauty's words cut deep.

Isabella quickly stepped forward to defuse the situation. "Friends from the press, this is just a small misunderstanding. It's getting late—why don't you all go get some dinner?" Her voice was soft as spring water, her pitiable demeanor stirring sympathy.

The reporters didn't dare press further.

Not with Adrian Valentine standing nearby and the powerful Langley family backing her.

Vincent Langley was a renowned philanthropist, having recently donated a substantial sum to the Bright Future Fund.

This only boosted Isabella's popularity.

Adrian remained in the shadows, his entire being radiating intimidating energy.

Celeste Rubinstein, however, refused to let it go. "Ms. Langley, why defend someone like her? I clearly saw her hit you—"

"You must be mistaken, Ms. Rubinstein," Isabella interrupted with a smile.

Celeste's sudden appearance couldn't mean anything good.

"If you say so." Celeste feigned regret. "What a shame. I was prepared to testify for you."

Tomorrow's trending topics were already set.

Celeste shot Evelyn a meaningful glance.

Evelyn smirked coldly.

This girl dared scheme against her?

Even Scarlett Orlando hadn't escaped her grasp all these years.

And now this amateurish tactic?

As Evelyn turned to leave, she nearly collided with Cassandra Valentine.

Cassandra stood in a fiery red dress, her bold crimson lips curling into a dazzling smile. "Evelyn, you're back."

Her gentle tone concealed sharp edges.

Cassandra had always been patient.

Ever since being disciplined by Margaret Valentine and Julian Roscente, she'd maintained an uneasy truce with Isabella.

Perhaps Adrian's rise over the past year had given her pause.

Evelyn gave a slight nod.

Cassandra glided closer, her gaze sweeping over Isabella.

Isabella tensed under her scrutiny.

Cassandra had long wanted revenge but held back—which only heightened Isabella's unease.

After all, Cassandra cared little for the Valentine family's reputation.

Cassandra glanced at Adrian in the shadows and scoffed.

Turning back to Evelyn, admiration flickered in her eyes. "Evelyn, I truly can't understand how you lost to trash like Isabella."
###Chapter 115

Evelyn couldn't help but laugh. Cassandra Valentine didn't seem so detestable after all.

From the shadows, Adrian Valentine stared daggers at her retreating figure.

"Humans and dogs are fundamentally different," Evelyn said with deliberate nonchalance. "I didn't lose. I simply didn't want it. Don't flatter the Valentine name."

She turned to leave. "Since you delivered yourself to my doorstep, I'll gladly take this scandalous material. Fight amongst yourselves all you want—just leave me out of it. We're long since settled."

Cassandra made no move to stop her.

She approached Adrian, his expression unreadable in the darkness, but the icy aura around him was unmistakable.

"Adrian, I recorded tonight's little show," Cassandra sneered. "It's time to settle the score from a year ago."

Her gaze flicked to the bruises on Isabella's neck and the swelling on her cheek. "Self-directed melodrama is amusing, isn't it? Pity you didn't go all the way. Next time, tell Adrian to just stab Evelyn to death. He obeys your every word, after all."

"Enough!" Adrian roared.

Cassandra ignored him. "Evelyn was wise to leave. A scoundrel and a schemer—a match made in hell."

Isabella clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms. She'd underestimated this woman and now found herself cornered.

"What do you want?" she hissed through gritted teeth.

This footage could never go public. The persona she'd painstakingly crafted couldn't afford to crumble.

"You think you're in any position to negotiate?" Cassandra adjusted her cuffs with elegant precision. "I've had proof since last year. I just couldn't be bothered to expose you. But you seem addicted to playing the victim."

She leaned close, whispering in Isabella's ear, "Know why I've let you climb so high? The higher you rise, the harder you fall. I can wait for the show."

Straightening, Cassandra cast a disdainful glance at her. "A homewrecker who tramples on others' happiness—how blindingly bright you shine."

Her heels clicked sharply against the floor as she walked away.

"Adrian!" Isabella's eyes welled with tears. "Why didn't you help me?"

The air around him turned glacial. "You staged this farce and got caught red-handed. And you dare ask me that?"

"I just—" Her voice cracked. "Seeing you go after her, I couldn't bear it—"

"Enough," he cut her off. "Intervening would only humiliate you further."

Watching him leave, Isabella bit her lip until it bled. Adrian treated her well, but his heart was never in it.

If it had been Christian Lefèvre, he would have fought for her without hesitation.
###Chapter 116

Isabella Langley gazed at the night outside the window, her fingertips absently tracing the rim of her wine glass.

Christian Lefèvre's perpetually gentle eyes flashed through her mind, sending a pang of bitterness through her chest.

That man was too content with the status quo—he hadn't even flinched when her fiancé was stolen from her.

Her phone screen lit up, displaying a photo of Adrian Valentine. The man in the picture had sharp brows and piercing eyes, his tailored suit exuding the commanding presence of a man at the top of the world.

She downed the remaining red wine in one gulp and strode toward the center of the banquet hall in her stilettos.

Under the crystal chandelier, Scarlett Orlando was surrounded by admirers like the moon among stars. Isabella's lips curled into a cold smirk as she spotted the towering three-tiered cake at the center of the stage.

Imperial Consort would premiere tomorrow. She'd see how long Scarlett could keep gloating.

Adrian stood not far away, seemingly waiting for her. Isabella quickened her pace, linking her arm with his affectionately while her eyes scanned the crowd.

By the floor-to-ceiling windows, Adrian was deep in conversation with Evelyn Roland. Across from them sat the heads of Lowell Group and Macmillan Holdings.

Sebastian Cortez held a piece of cake to Evelyn's lips. Engrossed in her phone, she accepted the bite without hesitation.

"Mr. Macmillan, these are the detailed plans for our NovaCore project," Evelyn said, sliding her phone across the table. "Full production can begin within two weeks. If you're interested, I'd be happy to personally visit your facilities."

She paused, then added, "We've already secured partnerships with 360 companies across the Nine-City Alliance, and negotiations are underway with Eastalia and Northam. Both you and Mr. Lowell are Sterling Manor's most trusted partners."

The chairman of Macmillan Holdings took the phone, a pleased smile warming his expression. Being trusted so deeply by a business partner touched him.

Evelyn's gaze chilled the moment she noticed Adrian and Isabella approaching.

Those two persistent nuisances.

Mr. Lowell had already risen to greet them. "Perfect timing, Mr. Valentine. We were just discussing Sterling Manor's NovaCore project. That young lady is remarkable—she solved all the technical challenges in just one year."

Adrian gave a slight nod and guided Isabella to sit beside Evelyn. Despite empty seats elsewhere, he deliberately chose the spot next to her.

Sebastian shot them a frosty look before turning back to Mr. Lowell. "Our lady prefers research over socializing. After NovaCore, we'll be launching our Botanica line of natural cosmetics."

He placed another pastry on Evelyn's plate. "Eat properly. No working on an empty stomach tonight."

His tone brooked no argument, laced with unmistakable protectiveness.

Adrian's fingers whitened around his wine glass, the air around him turning icy. Evelyn didn't need to look up to feel the sudden drop in temperature.
###Chapter 117

Evelyn nodded obediently, her eyes crinkling with warmth. "Alright, I'll listen to you. No midnight snacks tonight."

The gnawing emptiness in her stomach was unbearable. Only those who had experienced lactation hunger would understand this overwhelming sensation.

Sebastian pushed a steaming plate of shrimp balls toward her, his gaze tender. "Eat while it's hot. Your favorite."

"Mmm." Evelyn lowered her head, strands of hair falling to conceal her slightly flushed ears.

Natalie watched their interaction, nostalgia flickering in her eyes. Youth was truly beautiful.

Adrian sat rigidly, his aura growing colder by the minute.

Isabella stared at Evelyn, her nails digging into her palms. How? After leaving Adrian, Evelyn had somehow found a man like Sebastian—refined, elegant, every woman's dream.

She glanced resentfully at Adrian. His handsome face was icy as he stared at his phone, seemingly detached from the world.

For the past year, he had been too busy to even share a meal with her. Their promised island getaway had been replaced by endless work.

He insisted on saving their first night for marriage. But she had already...

Isabella suddenly laughed lightly. "Sebastian and Evelyn seem so close. Are you two dating?"

Sebastian arched a brow, his gaze meaningful. "Adrian has been quite generous with you too, Isabella. Rumor has it that 'Eternal Devotion' necklace cost a billion."

Isabella immediately clung to Adrian's arm, her smile saccharine. "Adrian treats me the best. For his birthday next month, I have a surprise planned."

Adrian stiffened.

Evelyn's chopsticks paused mid-air.

"Unnecessary." Adrian's voice was glacial. "I don't celebrate birthdays."

Isabella pouted. "Why not?"

Evelyn lowered her head and continued eating, her lashes trembling slightly. She knew the reason.

Adrian's eyes flickered toward Evelyn before he replied indifferently, "No reason."

Isabella fell silent, not daring to provoke him further.

Stanley set down his phone, his eyes gleaming. "Evelyn's proposal is remarkable. Collaborating with Sterling Manor is an honor. I'll personally visit Nathan in three days."

The name of Sterling Manor's young heiress had become legendary in the business world this past year. Yet no one had ever seen her face.
###Chapter 118

Sterling Manor was a renowned name in the business world. Sebastian Cortez oversaw international operations, managing the Asia-Pacific division of the transnational corporation.

The young mistress of Sterling Manor held command domestically. Though they shared the same origins, they operated independently.

Rumors said the young mistress had vanished for four years, during which Sebastian managed domestic affairs in her stead. Since her return, he had focused solely on expanding overseas markets.

"Mr. Macmillan, thank you for your trust. We'll discuss the details in three days." Evelyn Roland admired pragmatic entrepreneurs like him.

Working with such partners meant no tedious social drinking or concerns about product quality.

Mr. Macmillan rose to leave. "I won't intrude on you youngsters. Mr. Duan and I are off to support Director Lin's new film."

Sebastian gave a slight nod as he watched them depart.

Isabella Langley clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms. She couldn't stand seeing Evelyn's proposal win Mr. Macmillan's approval.

How could this country bumpkin deserve it? How could she stay by Nathan's side? How could she earn Sebastian's favor?

What infuriated her more was her father spending fortunes to find Evelyn, only for her to reappear suddenly.

"Miss Roland is impressive. To create a proposal that satisfies Mr. Macmillan right after high school." Isabella smiled sweetly, venom hidden beneath her gentle tone.

Evelyn glanced sideways at the insincere grin.

Emphasizing her education?

Such a transparent attempt at backhanded flattery was laughable.

"I pale in comparison to you, Ms. Langley." Evelyn's voice was cool. "Rising from obscurity to Best Actress in a year while thriving in love and career—now that's real skill."

Isabella's expression faltered.

Evelyn enjoyed watching her discomfort.

This game had only just begun.

"Does Mr. Cortez know you're divorced?" Isabella feigned concern. "You're exceptional, but your background..."

A calculated strike.

Evelyn's gaze turned icy.

Clearly, last time's lesson hadn't sunk in.

Adrian Valentine observed Evelyn's reaction with interest.

Sebastian sipped his wine elegantly, as if enjoying a fine performance.

"Isn't your public persona the 'Innocent Angel'?" Evelyn's lips curved. "Praising me while mocking my education. Expressing concern while hinting at my past. Trying to make me reveal everything to Sebastian?"

Isabella's eyes lit up.

So Sebastian didn't know Evelyn's history.

"You misunderstand." Isabella's voice trembled, delicate shoulders shaking. "I only worried misunderstandings might arise between you..."
###Chapter 119

Evelyn set down her fork, a cold smile playing on her lips.

"Professor Langley, your sisterly affection act is making me nauseous."

She dabbed her mouth delicately, casting a disdainful glance at Isabella.

Adrian sat nearby, catching the faint scent of gardenia and milk from Evelyn.

The familiar fragrance made his mind wander.

Sebastian finally spoke. "Professor Langley, do you have nothing better to do?"

Isabella bit her lower lip, refusing to meet his gaze.

Her slender fingers twisted together as her fragile frame trembled like a wilting flower.

The picture of vulnerability was a masterclass in playing the innocent angel.

"Mr. Cortez, you misunderstand..." Her voice was barely audible.

Sebastian scoffed. "My relationship with Evelyn is none of your concern."

He turned to Evelyn, his gaze softening. "She may only have a high school diploma, but her talent is undeniable. As for her background..."

"I admire her resilience in building herself up from nothing."

Isabella's face turned ashen.

Sebastian continued, "So what if she's divorced? I should thank that blind ex-husband of hers."

"May the cheaters rot together. They deserve each other."

Isabella's nails dug into her palms.

She never expected Evelyn to openly admit her divorce.

Adrian's eyes darkened as he leaned back into the sofa.

Isabella forced herself to stand. "Adrian, let's go."

She swayed unsteadily, as if on the verge of collapse.

Adrian remained motionless.

"Evelyn!" Vincent approached with several jewelry merchants in tow.

His face lit up with a practiced smile. "You've finally returned."

Evelyn gave a curt nod.

Spotting Sebastian, Vincent's eyes gleamed. "Mr. Cortez! What an honor!"

He rubbed his hands together, wisely avoiding any mention of his adopted daughter.
###Chapter 120

Sebastian Cortez gave a slight nod, a faint smile playing on his lips. "I've heard Chairman Langley possesses a treasure map. I'd like to discuss it with you in detail another time."

Vincent Langley cast a meaningful glance at Evelyn. "Mr. Cortez, what you may not know is that Evelyn shares a close bond with Alexander Durand, the third son of the Durand family. If anyone understands his secrets, it would be her."

"Oh?" Sebastian studied Evelyn with interest. "You know Alexander Durand?"

Evelyn's eyes shimmered with unshed tears, her voice slightly hoarse. "Yes. The map Chairman Langley mentioned is actually a treasure map. Alex had a rare gift—he could effortlessly locate diamond deposits and gold mines..."

"Miss Roland, could you pass me the red wine?" Adrian Valentine suddenly interjected.

His arm brushed against hers, the heat of his skin searing through the thin fabric of her sleeve.

Evelyn subtly shifted away, shooting him a warning glare.

Adrian's gaze darkened, silently commanding her to stop.

But Evelyn had planned this moment for too long. It was time to set the bait for Vincent.

Vincent personally handed Adrian the wine glass, scrutinizing him. "Adrian, shall I pour for you?" His displeasure at the interruption was evident.

Adrian accepted the glass gracefully but didn't drink.

Vincent pressed on eagerly. "Evelyn, do you know how to piece the map together?"

Evelyn gave a bitter smile. "Alex taught me some, but my memory is hazy now."

Adrian's pupils constricted sharply.

He suddenly remembered seeing that painting—Renaissance Masterpiece—on Evelyn's phone.

It wasn’t just a landscape. It was a map in disguise.

Alexander’s treasure map had been in her possession all along.

Her words from a year ago, when she’d wept over the photo, echoed in his mind: "Adrian, if you had anything to do with Alex’s death, I will make you pay in blood."

She had been plotting her revenge from the start.

A storm raged in Adrian’s eyes.

Vincent sensed her evasion and coaxed gently. "Evelyn, you’re the only one left who can decipher that painting. Before his passing, Mr. Durand wanted to fulfill Alex’s last wish. As his lover, you understood him best."

"You're right," Evelyn murmured, pain flashing in her eyes. "Alex returned with the completed map, hoping his father would assist in the excavation. But within three months, the Durand family..."

Her gaze locked onto Adrian, hatred blazing. "The manuscript was split in two. One half is with Chairman Langley. The other..." Her voice turned icy. "Is in Adrian Valentine’s hands."
###Chapter 121

Adrian Valentine's brow furrowed slightly as he calmly observed the hatred burning in Evelyn Roland's eyes.

The corner of his lips lifted. "Where is this coming from, Miss Roland? Trying to drive a wedge between me and Mr. Langley?"

Evelyn shook her head gently. "You're his future son-in-law. If I wanted to cause trouble, I wouldn't be so blatant about it."

She retrieved a faded photograph from her bag and turned to Vincent Langley.

"Chairman Langley, do you remember this photo? You showed it to me years ago, and I took it with me. Did you never notice the special material it's made of?"

Vincent's pupils contracted violently, his heart lurching.

"Could it be—"

"Exactly. Alexander Durand's first manuscript was hidden behind this photo." Evelyn laid the picture flat on the table and slowly poured wine over it.

As the liquid soaked through the back of the photo, intricate mineral vein maps gradually appeared under the stunned gazes of the onlookers.

"This—" Vincent staggered back, his face turning ashen.

He had been too fixated on the shocking image on the photo's surface to notice its hidden secret.

Evelyn traced the lines with her fingertips, tears welling in her eyes.

"Alex promised to give me the most beautiful violet diamond in the world." Her voice was barely above a whisper. "But in the end, someone else delivered it to me."

A single tear fell onto the blueprint, leaving a faint watermark.

Vincent snatched up the photo with trembling hands, greedily studying the coordinates. Harrison Macmillan suddenly lunged forward and grabbed it.

"Chairman Langley, you must grant me the mining rights! Your people can oversee everything—we'll split the profits fifty-fifty!"

The banquet hall erupted into chaos.

Evelyn watched the spectacle coldly. This was exactly what she wanted—to make Vincent Langley public enemy number one.

"Father!" Isabella Langley tugged urgently at her father's sleeve.

Harrison turned to Sebastian Cortez with a meaningful look. "I heard the priceless violet diamond you acquired at auction last year was the very one Alexander Durand intended for his beloved. What a shame—the man died, yet the diamond mysteriously appeared at the Roscente auction house..."

A deathly silence fell over the room.
###Chapter 122

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly. The words "violet diamond" pierced her heart like a blade. Only Alexander Durand had known about her love for purple diamonds.

Sebastian Cortez smiled faintly. "It was meant as a birthday gift for the young miss. The violet diamond has been set into a necklace." His gaze flickered toward Evelyn, concern flashing in his eyes.

She stood abruptly and rushed out the door.

Sebastian didn't stop her. He knew this girl needed moments alone. Alexander had always treated her with unparalleled kindness. With a subtle gesture, he signaled four bodyguards to follow discreetly.

The night wind struck her face as tears streamed down her cheeks.

Before the accident, Alexander had mentioned going somewhere, promising a surprise in a month. But he broke that promise, never returning. The sunny boy who grew up with her vanished forever one morning five years ago.

"Alex, you didn't break your word..." She choked out the words, collapsing to her knees on the roadside. Even without remains, she stubbornly believed he was still alive.

"Where are you?" She looked up at the sky, her tears glinting coldly under the moonlight.

Adrian Valentine watched from the shadows, his eyes fixed on that solitary figure. She was breathtakingly beautiful—and utterly shattered.

"Evelyn." Margaret Valentine's heels clicked sharply as she appeared without warning.

Evelyn wiped her tears, her expression turning icy. "What do you want?"

Margaret stood regal in a crimson cheongsam, jewels glittering. She maintained her usual condescending air. "You've hidden Alexander's secret well."

The secret of Eastalia's diamond mines could propel any jeweler to unimaginable heights. And the only person who knew the location of those veins was the woman before her.

Evelyn scoffed. "When have you ever shown me kindness? Weren't you the one reminding me daily—except during acupuncture sessions—that I'd be thrown out eventually?" Her nails dug into her palms. "I was greedy, foolishly thinking I could hold onto Adrian."

A man who abandoned her over a single photograph wasn't worth her tears.
###Chapter 123

"You know Isabella Langley better than anyone," Evelyn Roland sneered, her nails digging into her palms. "Every time you humiliate me, you compare me to her. If money means so much to you, why not go straight to Vincent Langley? He's the one holding the secrets. His ties to the Durand family run deeper than mine."

Margaret Valentine's eyes gleamed with greed. She and Vincent had been scheming together for years, their thirst for power equally insatiable.

Zachary Deross's investigation had uncovered their close alliance.

"Evelyn, just tell me the secret, and I'll let you back into the Valentine family," Margaret whispered. "Or you could marry my other son."

Evelyn suddenly laughed, her eyes icy. "You'd sell out your own son for money?"

"The Valentines are at the height of their power. Marrying into this family would be a privilege."

"Save that privilege for someone else." Evelyn turned away. "The secret is with Vincent. You two have always been... close."

Margaret's face twisted. "What did you say?"

Evelyn didn't look back as she walked out. She needed release, needed gunfire to drown the pain in her heart.

At the shooting range, staff members stared in surprise at the long-absent guest.

"Miss Roland, it's been two years."

Evelyn took the pistol, her eyes glistening behind the protective goggles. She remembered the first time she'd held a gun—Alexander Durand guiding her hands.

Bang.

The bullet struck dead center.

Shot after shot echoed through the range, each one unnervingly precise.

Adrian Valentine watched from the shadows, his pupils contracting. He'd never seen this version of Evelyn—sharp, decisive, unfamiliar.

When had she learned to shoot like this?

The Evelyn who'd left him was reborn.
###Chapter 124

Immigration records showed she had left the country but never returned.

"Bang! Bang! Bang!"

Beside her, the instructor swiftly reloaded, admiration flashing in his eyes. This female trainee's marksmanship was astonishingly precise.

She was cold as ice, yet steady and composed—like a bottomless lake.

"Bang! Bang! Bang..."

After firing hundreds of rounds, beads of sweat formed on Evelyn Roland's palms.

She removed her tactical gloves and nodded to the instructor. "That was exhilarating. I'll be back."

The instructor smiled warmly. "We'll be waiting."

Evelyn turned and left the shooting range, eager to return home.

Her two little ones were waiting for her.

Just as she stepped out of the facility, Scarlett Orlando's call came through.

"Evelyn Roland!" The voice on the other end was practically screeching. "You finally answer your phone? Three whole months without a word, and you even sent Victoria to visit the set for you. And now you sneak out of tonight's celebration early? Are we done being friends?"

Evelyn rubbed her temples. In her earlier melancholy, she had completely forgotten about her best friend.

"Sorry, something came up. How about coming over tonight? I'll make it up to you."

"How?" Scarlett's ears perked up instantly.

"I'll cook you a midnight snack."

"That's murder!" Scarlett shrieked. "I've been dieting for my new role—no food after noon, got it?"

A faint smile tugged at Evelyn's lips, dispelling the gloom. "I've developed a new probiotic drink. Zero additives, promotes beauty and weight loss. I'll have Zachary deliver it to you tomorrow."

The formula for this drink had originally been a project she and Adrian Valentine planned together a year ago. But before they could bring it to life, their marriage had ended.

"Really?" Scarlett's tone shifted immediately. "Fine, you're forgiven. But next month is my break—you're cooking for me every day!"

"Deal. Move in with me tomorrow."

Hanging up, Evelyn headed toward the elevators. Around the corner, Adrian stood silently.

At the mention of "probiotic drink," his pupils constricted. It was the late-night business plan they had once discussed.

Back then, she'd often brought home experimental samples, eagerly making him taste them. He'd thought it was just a passing interest—yet she had actually made it happen.

Just as the elevator doors were about to close, a long-fingered hand suddenly blocked them. Evelyn stepped aside and looked up—her breath caught.
###Chapter 125

Evelyn Roland never expected to encounter Adrian Valentine here.

She instinctively took a step back, putting distance between them.

Adrian strode into the elevator, his gaze fixed on her.

The image of her focused expression while shooting still lingered in his mind.

"Impressive marksmanship," his voice was low.

Evelyn's head snapped up. "You followed me?"

A cold smirk tugged at Adrian's lips. "Don't flatter yourself, Ms. Roland. I'm here to meet a client."

His eyes flickered to her slightly flushed lips, remembering how they'd tasted beneath his.

Back then, she used to pout and say, "Adrian Valentine, are you part wolf?"

He'd only tease her more mercilessly until her eyes glistened with unshed tears.

"I frequent this shooting range," he said flatly.

Evelyn fell silent, leaning against the elevator wall with closed eyes.

Adrian studied her calm profile, his chest tightening.

Was she thinking about that man again?

"Is Alexander Durand truly so unforgettable?" The bitter words escaped before he could stop them.

Evelyn's eyes flew open, shooting him an icy glare.

The elevator dinged at the first floor. She walked out without a backward glance.

Adrian moved to follow but halted when Sebastian Cortez approached.

Sebastian draped a coat over Evelyn's shoulders with gentle hands. "Blowing off steam again?"

The first genuine smile of the evening touched Evelyn's lips. "Sebastian, what are you doing here?"

"I had a feeling you'd come." He ruffled her hair. "Feeling better?"

Adrian remained in the shadows, watching their intimate exchange.

Sebastian sighed. "Evelyn, if Alexander were still alive—"

"Don't." Evelyn cut him off. "I've accepted reality."

Pain flashed in Sebastian's eyes. "I'll always regret failing to save your parents that night."

Evelyn shook her head and linked arms with him. "Let's go. Scarlett's waiting."

Their figures gradually disappeared into the night.

Adrian stood rooted in place, his fists clenched until his knuckles turned white.
###Chapter 126

Alexander Durand's genius was a fatal curse.

Years ago, they could only save his siblings.

The title of Sterling Manor heir forced Evelyn to remain hidden.

Overseas, he became the new master of Sterling Manor with assassins at his heels.

Everyone fought desperately to protect Evelyn.

This family bound by choice surpassed blood relations.

They would die for each other.

A bond even biological siblings might lack.

The Langley adopted daughter title offered only temporary safety.

Her future path required her own strength.

Evelyn understood this better than anyone.

He stayed in the country solely to guard her final steps.

Gazing at neon lights outside the window, Alexander's roguish smile surfaced in Evelyn's mind.

An invisible hand squeezed her heart.

"Sebastian," her voice feathered, "all these years... I've felt he's truly gone. Maybe he'll never return."

Sebastian Cortez gripped her slender shoulders.

Her sorrow constricted his chest.

"Let go," he murmured. "You've suffered enough."

Evelyn lowered her gaze with a faint nod. "Alright. Let's go home."

Sebastian opened the car door, shielding her as she entered.

The black sedan pulled away slowly.

Adrian Valentine stood in the shadows, watching taillights vanish around the corner.

She had long left his world.

The Evelyn who once adored him now carried someone else in her eyes.

He remained in the cold wind for hours.

Until Victor Ashcroft arrived.

"Mr. Valentine, Ms. Roland left with her father," Victor reported cautiously.

Adrian leaned back silently.

The rearview mirror reflected his clenched jaw.

The Roland family's secrets ran too deep.

That map was bait—yet he couldn't bear to risk her.

...

Aromatic warmth greeted Evelyn at home.

Scarlett Orlando devoured food with abandon.

The actress's elegance had evaporated.

Spotting Evelyn, her eyes brightened.

"Evelyn!" She swallowed hastily. "Can I move in with you?"

Victoria Laurent's shrimp and beef were irresistible.

Endless networking at the gala had left her starving until now.
###Chapter 127

Evelyn watched Scarlett devour her meal with gusto—a shrimp clutched in her left hand, a whole slice of beef in her right, sauce smeared at the corner of her lips. The messy, unrestrained way she ate suited her bold personality perfectly.

A memory surfaced—those quiet nights when Adrian wouldn't come home. She'd buy a cut of beef, braise it, slice it thin, and pair it with red wine while working late in the study.

"Full?" Evelyn pushed the thought aside and smiled.

Scarlett let out a satisfied burp. "Victoria's cooking is divine! If it weren't for her, I wouldn't keep coming over."

Victoria shook her head in amusement. Clearly, this woman only visited for the food.

"As you like." Evelyn set her bag on the sofa, her gaze warm.

She studied Scarlett discreetly. Four months had passed, and the woman still hadn't noticed the children. The thought of the two little ones upstairs—now sitting and giggling—made her heart melt.

"Just kidding!" Scarlett wiped her mouth. "It takes forty minutes to drive here from downtown, worse during rush hour. I can't afford to exhaust myself daily."

Dreams were plump, but reality was bony. Her career was on the rise, and she couldn't slack off.

"What about your promise to cook for me?" Scarlett stood. "Rain check. I need to go monitor the ratings."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Leaving so soon?"

Scarlett suddenly bent down and hugged her. "Evelyn, tomorrow's important. I'm borrowing your fame for some publicity—time to teach that fake angel Isabella a lesson."

A cold glint flashed in Evelyn's eyes. "You're using me?"

"Heh, isn't that what best friends are for?" Scarlett nuzzled her shoulder. "I'll come by tomorrow night."

Watching Scarlett rush off, Evelyn sighed. Even while leaving, she'd swiped another slice of braised beef—some things never changed.

"Are the children upstairs?" She turned to Victoria.

Victoria brightened. "Gabrielle's with them. They refused to sleep, waiting for you."

Evelyn hurried upstairs. Pushing the door open, she found two little bundles sitting on the rug, playing with toys. At the sound of her entrance, they waved their tiny hands and beamed.

Gabrielle closed her medical book and nodded at her.

All exhaustion vanished in that instant. From their first month to now, she'd guarded these two lives without leaving their side.

Now, it was time to let them see the sun.
###Chapter 128

"Evelyn, you're finally back." Gabrielle stood up from the carpet, smoothing the wrinkles from her clothes. Since Evelyn had moved in, they'd all naturally started calling her "sister."

"Mmm." Evelyn hung her coat on the rack. "Gabrielle, I'll need you to handle Christian's acupuncture tonight. I'm going to shower first."

Gabrielle gathered the scattered toys into a storage box. These days, she cared for the twins more attentively than their own mother.

"You seem happy today?" Gabrielle noticed the smile in Evelyn's eyes.

Evelyn rubbed her swollen chest. "I need to shower. It's time to feed them."

The bathroom door had barely closed when Felicia pouted toward it. Tristan kicked his legs impatiently, tiny hands reaching toward where his mother had gone.

"Missing Mommy?" Gabrielle picked up Felicia, expertly changing her diaper. "She'll be right back."

She'd delivered these two with her own hands. Every time she saw their delicate little faces, it still amazed her.

"How did you both turn out so beautiful?" She pinched Tristan's chubby cheek. "Auntie misses you after just one day apart."

After diapering both babies, Gabrielle laid them side by side on the large bed.

"Wait nicely for Mommy." She gently patted their backs.

Evelyn emerged drying her hair to find two pairs of eyes fixed on the bathroom door.

"I'll take them." She gathered the children. "You should rest."

Felicia immediately tugged at Evelyn's collar. Tristan didn't move, but his lips made tiny sucking motions.

"Starving, aren't you?" Evelyn leaned against the headboard, cradling one child in each arm.

They nursed contentedly. Felicia occasionally raised a hand to examine her fingers curiously. Tristan focused on feeding, occasionally glancing up to smile at his mother.

Evelyn's heart melted—until she saw Tristan's eyes, identical to Adrian's. A sharp pain pierced her chest.

Adrian would never know two children carried his blood.

It wasn't fair to them.

Or to him.

Evelyn took a deep breath, pushing down the rising ache. From now on, she just needed to focus on raising them well.

Once fed, both babies quickly fell asleep in her arms. Evelyn carefully settled them in bed and tucked them in.

She softly stroked their faces until their breathing steadied, then turned off the light and lay down.

The next morning, Evelyn's first action upon waking was reaching for her phone beside the pillow.
###Chapter 129

Evelyn stared at her phone screen, fingertips trembling slightly.

Celeste Rubinstein, that crazy woman, had actually leaked last night's incident online.

She let out a cold laugh and tossed the phone onto the bedside table.

"Go ahead. Let's see what you can stir up."

Turning to the crib, she saw her two little ones sleeping soundly.

Felicia lay on her back, tiny pink fists raised above her head like a surrendering angel.

Ethan curled into a ball, only his fuzzy little head visible.

Evelyn's heart softened. She quietly snapped a picture of her daughter's adorable sleeping face.

After freshening up, she returned to find Felicia already awake.

"Ma-ma~" The toddler stretched out her arms the moment she saw her mother.

"Shh—" Evelyn pressed a finger to her lips. "Your brother's still sleeping."

She scooped up the little girl, who immediately clung to her neck, nuzzling against her.

"Starving, aren't you?" Evelyn pinched her daughter's chubby cheeks.

Felicia responded with a sloppy kiss.

After changing the diaper, Evelyn carried her downstairs.

As she entered the living room, Gabrielle's energetic voice greeted her. "Morning, sis!"

Evelyn marveled at the girl's stamina.

Between babysitting, studying, and practicing acupuncture at night, she still managed to wake up early every single day.

"Come to Aunt Gabby, Felicia!" Gabrielle opened her arms wide.

The little girl buried her face in her mother's shoulder instead.

"Ungrateful little thing." Gabrielle clutched her chest dramatically. "After all the time I spend playing with you."

She made a silly face, finally drawing giggles from Felicia.

Victoria emerged from the kitchen with breakfast. "Don't let those online rumors get to you."

Evelyn fed her daughter absentmindedly. "If I'd really hit her, she wouldn't be standing to talk about it."

Gabrielle focused on entertaining Felicia, completely ignoring the gossip.

After feeding time, Evelyn ate a quick breakfast.

She needed to go to the office today.

Some things could only be uncovered if she showed up in person.

......

The Langley Mansion.

Isabella glared at her phone, nails digging into her palms.

"Cassandra Valentine, just you wait!"
###Chapter 130

The sound of shattering porcelain exploded through the dining room.

"Those damn reporters!" Isabella Langley stared at her phone screen, fingers trembling.

Cassandra Valentine's arrogant face flashed through her mind, followed by Celeste Rubinstein's mocking smirk.

Vincent Langley set down his chopsticks with a frown. "Isabella, what's this about? Why did Evelyn hit you?"

He'd been preoccupied with the mineral atlas last night and missed his daughter's latest scandal.

Isabella bit her lip and recounted the previous night's events.

Eleanor Langley's face darkened. "How could you be so reckless? If you're going to play games, make sure they can't recover—like that male celebrity last time. Now you've left evidence!"

"Mom!" Isabella's eyes reddened. "The worst part is Cassandra might have proof. Once the internet finishes attacking Evelyn, she'll reveal the truth..."

Vincent slammed his teacdown. "How many times must I tell you? True power requires patience! Evelyn is already finished. Why waste energy on her?"

Isabella clenched her fists.

This past year in the entertainment industry had gone smoothly—she'd finally shed the "rich heiress" label.

But Adrian Valentine's name still haunted her like a shadow.

"Father, this isn't the time for lectures! We must stop Cassandra from leaking anything!" Her voice shook. "The higher the internet lifts me now, the harder I'll fall later!"

Eleanor stood abruptly. "I'll handle the company. Stay home today." She turned to her husband. "Hurry with the atlas. Adrian still has some photos we need recovered."

Vincent nodded. "I'm meeting him today about the Sterling Manor collaboration. If we secure this project—"

"Sterling Manor?" Isabella looked up sharply. "Why has their heiress remained out of the public eye since returning?"

Vincent's gaze darkened. "That's not your concern."
###Chapter 131

Vincent Langley's lips curled into a chilling smirk. "Isabella, don't you understand? The wealth of Sterling Manor is unfathomable. If the heir's identity is exposed prematurely, it becomes a death sentence."

"Sebastian Cortez has been suppressing the other branches for years. The undercurrents within the family have been turbulent."

"I kept you away from Sebastian because none of the women around him live long. The assassination attempts he's faced abroad are far more frequent than you can imagine."

"Adrian Valentine is the true rising star. In just one year, the Valentine family has advanced by leaps and bounds under his leadership. Surpassing Sterling Manor is only a matter of time."

A calculating gleam flashed in Vincent's eyes.

Eleanor Langley sat with her head bowed, sulking, oblivious to her husband's expression.

Isabella, lost in her own joy, also failed to notice the odd look on her father's face.

Eleanor suddenly stood and grabbed her phone, storming out of the room.

"Dad, what's wrong with Mom lately?" Isabella watched her mother's retreating figure. "She's barely spoken these past few days."

Vincent frowned. The year-long power struggles had left him little time to tend to his wife.

"I'll come home early tonight and bring her a gift."

Nothing could quell his thirst for power.

The memory of Evelyn's threat a year ago ignited a ruthless fire in his eyes. Once he obtained all the manuscripts, he would make that wretched girl beg for death.

Isabella shivered at her father's vicious expression, her fingers involuntarily curling in fear.

Evelyn Roland sat in Zachary Deross's car, gazing at the scenery rushing past the window.

The kind face of Beatrice Valentine surfaced in her mind.

A year without contact—she wondered how the old woman was doing. With her number changed, Beatrice wouldn't have been able to reach her.

Evelyn straightened, hesitating for a moment before dialing the familiar number.

"Hello?"

A frail voice answered.

Evelyn's breath hitched. "Grandma."

"Evelyn! You're back?" Beatrice's voice trembled with emotion.

"It's me. How have you been?" Her throat tightened. That year in the Valentine household, Beatrice had been the only one who truly cared for her.

In the courtyard villa, the elderly woman glanced at Adrian standing nearby. "Evelyn, is this your new number?"

"Yes. You can reach me here from now on."

"Silly girl, still thinking of this old woman." Beatrice sighed. "Have you met anyone suitable? You're my greatest worry."

"I will." Evelyn's voice softened. "I... I'm doing well."

"Can you visit me today? It's been over a year."

Evelyn checked the rearview mirror at the trailing vehicles. "Not today. I'll come see you once I've settled my affairs."

After hanging up, Beatrice slammed the phone onto the stone table and glared at her eavesdropping grandson. "Weren't you leaving? Why are you still standing there?"
###Chapter 132

Adrian Valentine stood at the hospital room door, his fingers lightly tracing the handle.

"Grandmother, I should go now." His voice was low.

Beatrice Valentine leaned against the hospital bed, watching him with complex emotions in her eyes.

Outside the window, dark clouds gathered like an omen of the coming storm.

Vincent Langley had turned the entire jewelry world upside down for that mineral atlas. The Tang family had been wiped out, and this bloodbath was only the beginning.

"Old Tang," Beatrice murmured to herself, "your descendants died unjustly. You must be raging in your grave."

A bitter smile touched her lips as tears glistened in the corners of her eyes.

Hadn't her own son also died with grievances unresolved? All these years, the murderer still walked free.

Watching her grandson's retreating figure, Beatrice felt as if a knife twisted in her heart.

This past year had been harder on him than anyone.

Only after the divorce did he learn to cherish what he'd lost—but it was too late.

That Evelyn Roland was no ordinary woman. Missing her meant losing her forever.

Remembering the carefully orchestrated scheme from a year ago, Beatrice's lips curved slightly. The shares had been smoothly transferred to Adrian, and the boy hadn't disappointed her. In just one year, he'd taken the Valentine Group to new heights.

"That Langley bastard..." A cold glint flashed in Beatrice's eyes. "Once I uncover the truth, you'll pay in blood."

Her gaze fixed on the distant green mountain where her son rested.

Her breathing grew ragged as years of suppressed grief finally overflowed.

......

Top floor of Sterling Manor.

Evelyn pushed open the glass office door, sunlight streaming through the floor-to-ceiling windows.

Nathan had everything prepared for her.

"Boss, should we proceed with the product launch as scheduled?" Nathan handed her a cup of hot tea.

Evelyn flipped open the proposal, her fingers tapping lightly on the pages.

"Move it up by three days," she said abruptly.

Nathan and Zachary froze.

"Why?" Zachary couldn't help asking.

Evelyn's lips curved. "Too many eyes are watching us in the shadows. Let's give them a surprise."

She looked out the window at the city spread below.

"Sales must break records before the year-end chamber meeting."

Nathan smiled in understanding. After a year of witnessing deceit and treachery, he was no longer the naive assistant he'd once been.

A soft knock sounded at the door.

"Mr. Aldridge, Chairman Langley and Mr. Valentine are here. They specifically asked to see Assistant Roland."

Evelyn nodded her acknowledgment.

Zachary rose to prepare tea.

Footsteps approached.

The moment Adrian stepped into the office, his gaze locked onto the figure by the window.

Evelyn turned slowly.

Their eyes met.

The air seemed to solidify.
###Chapter 133

Evelyn Roland's eyes glinted with cold amusement as she regarded the two uninvited guests.

They couldn't even wait a full day before showing up at her doorstep.

The internet was flooded with rumors of her slapping Isabella Langley.

Yet instead of comforting their precious princess, this father-daughter pair had come running to her.

Money truly trumped blood ties.

The corner of Evelyn's lips curled into a mocking smile. "To what do I owe this unexpected visit?"

Adrian Valentine watched her in silence, his gaze unreadable.

Since returning to Vienna, every movement she made exuded quiet confidence.

Vincent Langley rubbed his hands together with an ingratiating smile. "Evelyn, Adrian mentioned you took those torn photo fragments. Could you return them? I need to restore the manuscript and expedite the diamond mine excavation."

Evelyn nearly laughed aloud.

The old fox was desperate for money.

Even with the manuscript, he'd never locate the vein.

She flicked a glance toward Zachary Deross by the doorway. "Fetch the cloth bag from my car trunk."

Zachary nodded and left, his posture military-straight.

Adrian's brows furrowed as he studied the man beside her.

Vincent continued placating, "Don't take the online rumors to heart. Isabella's still young and impulsive."

Evelyn's eyes turned glacial. "Watching your fiancée stage this pathetic drama was highly entertaining. An audience never complains about bad acting."

Vincent's face darkened, but he swallowed his anger.

His worthless daughter had squandered millions on overseas education only to return with cheap tricks.

Adrian spoke suddenly, "Must you be so harsh, Ms. Roland?"

"Harsh?" Evelyn's laugh was icy. "Isn't slapping people's faces your specialty, Mr. Valentine? Shall we ask your sister to release last night's surveillance footage? Let's see who embarrassed themselves more."

A sharp pain stabbed her chest.

Her fists clenched until her nails bit into her palms.

Adrian's gaze dropped to her whitening knuckles, his expression deepening.

Vincent hastily intercepted Adrian before he could respond.

The manuscript was their priority now.

Julian Roscente had been investigating for over a year. Any delay risked complications.

"Adrian, Isabella was clearly in the wrong. Evelyn's the victim here."

Evelyn let out a derisive snort.

What a victim indeed.
###Chapter 134

Zachary Deross pushed open the door, holding Evelyn Roland's cloth bag.

"I've brought your things." He handed it to her.

Evelyn took the bag with a slight nod. "Thank you."

Zachary's gaze lingered on Adrian Valentine for a moment before he turned and left the office.

Evelyn retrieved the restored photographs from the bag. Her fingertips traced the striking features of Alexander Durand's face.

Alexander, your secret won't stay hidden any longer.

I still haven't uncovered who betrayed you a year ago.

But I hope it was you.

As long as you're alive, nothing else matters.

Adrian watched the raw emotion in her eyes, his heart twisting painfully.

The love in her gaze was unmistakable.

Vincent Langley stared hungrily at the photographs, greed flickering in his eyes.

With these blueprints, the first diamond extraction could proceed smoothly.

"Evelyn, we all grieve for Alexander, but the dead cannot return," Vincent feigned sympathy.

Evelyn's head snapped up, her piercing glare striking him like a blade.

Vincent stiffened under her icy stare, his chest tightening.

Since when did this girl have such a terrifying presence?

She regarded him with detached indifference, as if he were nothing more than an insignificant insect.

"Alexander might still be alive. I never saw his body."

Vincent suppressed a cold laugh. He had watched Alexander being thrown into the sea with his own eyes—no chance of survival.

"You two were so close. It pains me to see you like this every time you look at his photos. His father and I were good friends. Such a tragic loss of talent."

He forced a sorrowful expression.

Evelyn's heart clenched. Though she lacked proof, she knew Vincent was the murderer.

"Whoever killed Alexander will wish they were dead."

Her voice, laced with lethal intent, sent a chill down his spine.

Despite his years in the underworld, Vincent felt genuine fear for the first time.

This Evelyn Roland was far more dangerous than he'd realized.

Noticing his scrutiny, she quickly masked her sharp edges.

Adrian remained silent, jealousy burning in his eyes.

"Mr. Langley, I'll give you all the photos—but only if you tell me where Alexander's siblings are." Her tone was distant.

"Why would I know their whereabouts?" Vincent narrowed his eyes.

"No matter. Someone will talk. These photos are valuable to many."

A faint, knowing smile curved her lips.

Vincent inwardly cursed. If he'd known she held so many secrets, he would have kept her alive.

A marriage alliance could have been profitable. What a miscalculation.

"Why do you need to find them?" Vincent pretended confusion.
###Chapter 135

A fleeting softness flashed in Evelyn Roland's eyes before vanishing.

She had never met Alexander Durand's siblings. Her search for them was solely to confirm their safety.

"I don't know them personally. I just want to ensure they're unharmed."

Vincent Langley's instincts screamed danger. She was testing him.

"Evelyn, I truly don't know their whereabouts. If I did, I would tell you. Old Durand was my dear friend—of course I want his children safe."

The truth was, the Durand siblings remained firmly under his control.

Only by keeping them in his grasp could he rest easy.

Evelyn's gaze remained calm as still water. Vincent knew something but refused to reveal it.

She had once planted surveillance bugs in his home, overhearing fragments of his conversations with the butler.

Unfortunately, the intel proved useless.

Vincent and Dominic Lombardi always held their private discussions in the study, never in the open.

At the time, heavily pregnant, she couldn't risk climbing to the second floor—only catching trivial exchanges.

Isabella Langley's two-faced hypocrisy.

Tch. Why worry about others when she could barely protect herself?

Evelyn checked the time, her eyes glinting.

Right on cue, chaotic footsteps echoed outside.

Her lips curved. Vincent Langley, this past year of suffering was merely the beginning. You'd better watch your back from now on.

Adrian Valentine studied her smile, brows furrowing. What game was she playing?

The Evelyn who returned was increasingly unrecognizable—as if he'd never truly known her.

She picked up the photographs and handed them to Vincent. "Since you're so invested in Alexander's work, Mr. Langley, consider these blueprints my gift. Should you succeed in mining them, at least his risks won't have been in vain."

"Hahaha—" A raucous laugh erupted from the doorway. "Vincent Langley! Did you really think you could keep this treasure to yourself?"

Vincent whipped his head toward Evelyn.

She sat composed, unruffled. Murderous intent flared in his eyes—this bitch had planned this.

Harrison Macmillan strode in with several jewelers in tow.

Evelyn swept them with an icy stare. "To what do we owe this... unexpected visit?"

Her tone dripped skepticism.

Vincent frowned. Had he misjudged her involvement?

Harrison greedily eyed the photographs in Vincent's hands, grinning at Evelyn. "Miss Roland, my people have been monitoring you. The moment you made your move, I knew. Since these are now public knowledge, surely finders should be sharers?"

Vincent seethed. This bastard had stolen the photos yesterday.

Now he dared return for more? A fatal oversight. He'd known Evelyn was being tailed but underestimated their speed.

Harrison asked Evelyn, "Did Mr. Langley promise you a cut of the profits?"

She shook her head. "No."

"How naïve. Handing over a fortune without securing your share. Do you know what these photos are worth? I'll give you a billion for them."

Each diamond vein mapped in those photographs was worth incalculable fortunes.

Vincent's face darkened. The situation had spiraled beyond control.
###Chapter 136

Harrison Macmillan, that madman, refused to take the manuscripts for free. He insisted on paying a billion dollars for them.

Evelyn Roland's brows furrowed slightly. She hadn't expected Chairman Li to pull such a stunt.

She blinked innocently. "Chairman Li, I don't quite understand these matters. Alexander and Chairman Langley were old acquaintances. I just didn't want his life's work to go to waste."

"Consider these manuscripts a gift to Chairman Langley. I can't profit from Alexander's creations."

Harrison waved a hand dismissively. "You're too naive, child. Here's what I'll do—I'll give you three hundred million. Those photos from last night... I had my people analyze them overnight. They do hold value."

"Chairman Li..."

"Don't refuse. If you won't take the money, give it to the Tang family if you ever cross paths with them. Consider it helping them rebuild."

Harrison wore an expression of righteous conviction.

Evelyn gave him a meaningful look.

Vincent Langley let out a cold laugh, clutching the photos as he turned to leave.

Harrison and his entourage followed closely behind.

A faint smirk curled Evelyn's lips. Vincent Langley, your days of comfort are over.

When she turned, she found Adrian Valentine still seated on the sofa.

That icy smile of hers hadn't escaped his notice.

Sunlight streamed through the gaps in the curtains, casting a hazy glow around Evelyn.

Her voice was cold. "Why are you still here, Mr. Valentine?"

Adrian's Adam's apple bobbed as he tugged irritably at his loosened tie.

"Evelyn, you're playing with fire."

Her red lips curved upward. "Adrian Valentine, we're done. Don't act like you have any right to control me. The sight of you disgusts me."

Her smile was bright, but her eyes were frigid.

Adrian surged to his feet, gripping her chin.

Before she could react, he crushed his lips against hers.

Evelyn stiffened.

She shoved him away, wiping her mouth in revulsion.

"Adrian, enough!" Her voice trembled. "I loved you once, endured your cruelty. But not anymore. Have some self-respect."

"Touch me again, and I'll make sure you never speak another word."

"Love?" Adrian's gaze darkened. "The one you love is Alexander Durand. Lie to me again, and you'll regret it."
###Chapter 137

Adrian Valentine's gaze was glacial.

He looked down at Evelyn Roland's pained expression.

The cruelty in his eyes cut deeper than any blade. Evelyn gave a bitter smile. Adrian had never trusted her.

How could he believe she'd once loved him?

A year after their divorce, these thoughts still haunted her.

Evelyn hated herself for loving too deeply, for still being trapped in this torment.

"Please leave, Mr. Valentine. That was... inappropriate of me." She leaned against the sofa, her face pale.

Her short black hair framed porcelain skin.

The pink blazer softened her sharp edges, but the ice in her eyes kept everyone at bay.

Adrian froze. This was the real Evelyn—ruthless and decisive.

The murderous look she'd given Vincent Langley moments ago proved it.

"Inappropriate?" Adrian sneered. "Evelyn, how can you claim to love Alexander Durand while saying you loved me?"

His burning stare demanded the truth. Had she ever truly cared?

Seeing the pain in his eyes, Evelyn frowned. "Adrian, you were the one who called this a game. Let me go. I feel pain too. Must we destroy each other?" Danger flickered in her gaze.

Adrian suddenly gripped her throat.

Evelyn recoiled from his brutality. The physical pain was nothing compared to the agony in her chest.

Silence stretched between them.

Her eyes turned arctic. His remained unreadable.

"What if I decide to play until you break?" Adrian whispered cruelly.

Evelyn's heart shattered. So this was how much he wanted her dead.

The pain spread through her body, making her tremble.

"Sorry, my life comes at a high price." Her laugh was cold.

Adrian smirked darkly. "I despise betrayal, and you—you betrayed me worst of all."

He pressed a fruit knife to her throat. "Leave Vienna. Or I'll kill you. And stay away from Isabella."

Numb, Evelyn pushed his hand aside. She stared at the blade. "Then do it now."

Without warning, she seized Adrian's wrist.

His eyes widened at her speed and strength.

"For Isabella," Evelyn said with a broken smile, "if you don't kill me today, I'll ruin both the Valentines and the Langleys."

She yanked his hand forward.

The blade plunged into her chest.

Adrian's pupils contracted. His blood turned to ice.

Evelyn gasped sharply.

The office door burst open.

Zachary Deross and a reporter stood frozen in the doorway.

Zachary paled at the knife in Evelyn's chest.

Camera flashes erupted as the reporter snapped photos frantically.

Adrian heard nothing but the roar of his own heartbeat.
###Chapter 138

Adrian's pupils contracted violently as he stared at the fruit knife buried deep in Evelyn's chest.

His hands jerked away as if electrocuted.

"You're insane!" His voice came out hoarse and broken.

His entire body trembled in disbelief.

How could she?

He had only meant to scare her into leaving this dangerous place.

Evelyn's lips curved into a tragic smile, blood trickling from the corner of her mouth.

"How touching," she whispered. "Mr. Valentine would go this far to avenge his fiancée. Adrian's love for Isabella is truly moving."

Adrian's heart twisted painfully.

That wasn't it at all.

He had been trying to protect her.

Vincent would have her killed the moment the first batch of ore was extracted. She had escaped safely—why had she come back?

Zachary stood guard outside the door, blocking the swarm of reporters. He trusted his boss knew her limits—she would never walk into certain death.

Adrian caught Evelyn as she swayed, pulling her against his chest. Agony tore through him.

Her vision blurred from pain, but she still saw the panic in his eyes. A victorious smile touched her lips.

Adrian Valentine, I hate you.

Her eyes fluttered shut as she collapsed in his arms.

"No! Evelyn—" Adrian's voice cracked. "I never meant to hurt you. Please...open your eyes."

He held her tighter, drowning in regret.

He couldn't protect her.

The enemies were too many, the dangers too pervasive. No amount of bodyguards could stop an attack from the shadows.

The office door burst open with a crash.

Nathan stormed in, eyes blazing. "Adrian! How dare you lay a hand on her!"

His fist connected with Adrian's face.

Adrian took the blow without flinching, refusing to loosen his grip on Evelyn. After over four hundred days apart, he couldn't bear to let go.

"Adrian!" Nathan seized his collar. "She'll die if you don't release her! Is that what you want?"

The words snapped Adrian out of his daze.

Seeing Evelyn's blood-soaked clothes, he gathered her in his arms and bolted for the door.

Zachary blocked the exit, gaze icy. "Put her down."

"Move!" Adrian snarled, eyes bloodshot.

When Zachary reached for Evelyn, Adrian twisted away.

"Get a car ready if you want her to live!" Adrian barked.

Zachary sneered. "You stabbed her. Don't play the hero now."

Pain lanced through Adrian's chest, but he only held Evelyn closer. No other man would touch her.

Nathan rushed forward, paling at Evelyn's ashen face. "Zachary! We need to save her first!"
###Chapter 139

Zachary Deross grabbed Adrian Valentine by the collar and dragged him toward the underground parking lot.

A black sedan sped out from a hidden exit.

The waiting reporters missed their target.

Twitter exploded instantly:
#AdrianValentineStabsEvelynForIsabella

The accompanying photo showed Adrian plunging a fruit knife into Evelyn's chest.

Evelyn's pale face was streaked with tears, her shattered gaze heartbreaking.

The hashtag hit 100 million views in minutes.

[Is he insane? Stabbing someone over a slap? Is Adrian above the law?]

[What spell did Isabella cast on him? What's so special about her?]

[Living under a rock? Last year, Valentine Group spent $300 million on a movie for her, with fresh French roses flown in daily.]

[Funny how Julian Roscente's new drama lead got into a sudden car accident, and investors pulled out overnight. Read between the lines.]

[Evelyn got the short end of the stick—raised as Isabella's stand-in, now hunted by the real deal.]

[This drama beats any soap opera!]

[Adrian just turned a CEO romance novel into reality.]

Isabella stared at her phone, fingers trembling.

Clatter.

The device hit the marble floor.

"How could this happen..." She staggered back. "He knew the truth!"

Sunlight through the floor-to-ceiling windows burned her eyes.

After seven unanswered calls, Isabella suddenly laughed.

Adrian's blade was sharper than she'd anticipated.

If she couldn't shake him off, she might as well wield him.

Smoothing her skirt, she lifted her teacup with practiced grace.

At least she wasn't the one bleeding.

......

The ER light glared crimson.

Zachary punched the wall. "I failed her."

Nathan Aldridge glanced at Adrian's hollow expression and raised his voice deliberately: "Better she sees the trash for what he is. Evelyn deserves better."

Adrian stood statue-still in the corridor.

His eyes locked on the operating room door, as if he could see blood seeping through the crack.

The taste of iron filled his throat.

Her final look had carved into his heart like a razor.
###Chapter 140

"Adrian Valentine, leave." Nathan Aldridge blocked Adrian's path, his gaze sharp. "Evelyn doesn't need you right now."

Adrian's eyes still burned with fury, his voice icy. "She's my ex-wife."

Nathan scoffed. "Where was that thought when you stabbed her in the back? Stop pretending to care. Get out!"

Adrian remained motionless, like a statue rooted to the spot.

Nathan clenched his fists, frustration boiling over.

"What happened to my sister?" Gabrielle Flores rushed in, breathless, carrying Felicia Roland.

Zachary Deross and Nathan exchanged uneasy glances, their eyes darting to Adrian.

Gabrielle never left the house. She had no idea who Adrian was.

Buried in her medical studies, she was oblivious to the outside world.

The moment she saw the news alert about her sister's stabbing, she grabbed Felicia and bolted to Sterling Manor's private hospital.

She shoved the child into Zachary's arms.

Zachary fumbled awkwardly. "I don't know how to handle kids!"

Gabrielle glared. "Just keep her safe. I need to operate—the knife might have punctured her lung."

She tossed the diaper bag at Nathan before sprinting into the OR.

Nathan stared blankly. "I can't even make formula!"

Felicia blinked up at the operating room doors, her tiny face crumpling.

Zachary panicked. "Don't cry, sweetheart."

Nathan crouched beside them. "How about some candy?"

Felicia pointed at the OR, tears welling in her eyes.

"Mommy will be out soon," Zachary murmured.

A loud wail erupted.

Zachary rocked her desperately. "Shh, shh..."

Nathan rummaged through the bag and pulled out a bottle. "Milk!"

But Felicia spat it out immediately—it didn't smell like her mother.

Adrian's chest tightened at Gabrielle's mention of a lung injury.

Then his gaze snagged on the child in Zachary's arms. Something about her felt familiar.

As Zachary passed by, Felicia suddenly grabbed Adrian's sleeve.
###Chapter 141

Adrian Valentine froze.

He looked down at the little girl in his arms, his heart inexplicably aching.

Those large, watery eyes reminded him of someone.

"Uncle, hold me," Sophia Roland stretched out her chubby little hands, tears falling like scattered pearls.

As if compelled by some unseen force, Adrian opened his arms.

Sophia immediately stopped crying and smiled.

Nathan Aldridge and Zachary Deross exchanged glances.

This child was usually so shy around strangers—why was she so attached to Adrian?

Zachary gritted his teeth in frustration. Did this ungrateful little thing not realize this man was the reason her mother was lying in the emergency room?

Nathan felt a pang of bitterness. Had all this time raising her still not been enough to break the pull of blood ties?

He shook his head sharply.

Sophia was the little princess of Sterling Manor. She had nothing to do with the Valentines!

Sophia yawned, snuggling into a comfortable position in Adrian's arms before drifting off to sleep.

Adrian gazed at her peaceful face, warmth flooding his chest.

The more he looked at her delicate features, the more she resembled...

He smirked self-deprecatingly.

He was never meant to have children of his own.

"Give her back to me!" Zachary growled in a hushed voice.

Adrian turned away. "She just fell asleep. Do you want to wake her?"

Nathan grabbed Zachary's arm before he could lunge forward. "Let him hold her."

It wasn’t like he’d get another chance.

Once Sophia turned three, she would begin specialized training. Even they would hardly get to see her then.

Zachary reluctantly retreated to the elevator, keeping a wary eye on Adrian.

The hallway was so quiet their breathing was audible.

The emergency room light was still on.

Adrian stared at the door, each second an agony.

Forty minutes later, it finally opened.

Gabrielle Flores strode out, scanning the area. "Where’s Sophia?"

Nathan shrank slightly and pointed at Adrian.

"Who are you?" Gabrielle snatched the child away.

Adrian stepped forward urgently. "How’s Evelyn?"

"None of your business," Gabrielle snapped, glaring at him.

Nathan quickly intervened. "Gabrielle, how’s the boss?"

"Lung injury. She’s stable now." Gabrielle shot Zachary a scathing look. "Can’t even protect one person properly!"

She grabbed the diaper bag, cradled the sleeping Sophia, and stormed off.
###Chapter 142

Adrian Valentine stared at his empty arms, feeling as if a piece of his heart had been carved out.

The little girl's departure left him with an inexplicable sense of loss.

He composed himself and followed Nathan Aldridge and Zachary Deross toward the hospital room.

Evelyn Roland lay motionless on the bed, an oxygen mask covering half her face. The heart monitor beeped sharply.

As Adrian approached, her deathly pale complexion stole his breath.

How much pain had she endured when she hurt herself?

He smiled bitterly. She had always been ruthless—especially toward herself.

On their last mission before the divorce, she had taken a bullet for him without hesitation.

Nathan watched Adrian's pained expression with cold disdain. "Who are you performing for, Mr. Valentine?"

"She's out of danger. You can leave now. If the press catches you here, Evelyn will suffer more from you and Isabella."

"When Isabella framed her for corporate espionage, I considered stepping in. But since you were so eager to play the fool, I let it happen. As for the car accident involving the actor from Imperial Consort—we've found evidence linking it to you and Isabella."

Adrian's patience snapped. "Shut up!"

"You—"

"Get out!" He shoved them both into the hallway.

Nathan and Zachary exchanged glances.

"You just let him throw us out?" Nathan demanded.

Zachary scowled. "And you just let him throw me out?"

Nathan scoffed. "What's the point of arguing now?"

Zachary sighed. "She'd rather bleed than see him hurt. Let the great Mr. Valentine wallow in guilt. The media's already spinning the tale—how romantic, stabbing Evelyn for Isabella's sake."

"Those two deserve each other. It'd be a shame to separate them."

Nathan fell silent.

A man who betrays love has no integrity.

Zachary continued mockingly, "Let the proud Mr. Valentine suffer. Useless bastard."

Adrian, still standing behind the door: "..."

Did they think he was deaf?

He returned to Evelyn's bedside and clasped her icy hand.

In this moment, all grudges seemed insignificant.

Christian Lefèvre's vendetta, Alexander Durand's debt—what did they matter in the face of life and death?

"You'll be alright, sweetheart," he whispered, tucking the blanket around her before settling into the chair.

Outside, Nathan and Zachary paced restlessly.

"That bastard hurt her and now he's hogging the room?" Zachary growled.

Nathan rubbed his sore legs. "Should we drag him out? We've waited all day."

The door suddenly swung open. "No need. I'm leaving."

Zachary lunged, but Nathan held him back. "Don't waste energy on a dog."

"Nathan, you—"

"Get lost," Nathan cut in coldly. "I don't want to see you again."

As Adrian turned to leave, the door burst open.

Evelyn staggered out—and sprinted down the corridor.
###Chapter 143

Adrian Valentine instantly recognized Evelyn Roland's silhouette and sprinted after her.

Zachary Deross and Nathan Aldridge barely caught a glimpse before Adrian vanished down the corridor.

Zachary scoffed. "In such a hurry. Must be rushing to meet Isabella."

Nathan's voice dripped with disdain. "That bastard deserves a beating every time I see him. Hope I never run into him again."

Adrian reached the stairwell just as Evelyn missed a step.

Her body tumbled down the concrete stairs.

She struggled to rise, but pain immobilized her. Tears blurred her vision, yet her gaze remained fixed on the empty space below.

This accident was her carefully orchestrated trap.

He came—but refused to show himself.

That retreating figure wasn't the one she longed to see.

Agony lanced through Evelyn's chest with each ragged breath.

"Don't go... please..." Her whisper barely carried.

Adrian reached her side as the plea escaped her lips.

Who was she waiting for?

Who was worth this self-destruction?

His heart constricted violently. He gathered her into his arms. Blood soaked through her hospital gown from reopened wounds.

"Evelyn! Have you lost your mind?" His roar echoed off the walls.

Her eyelids fluttered open. Recognition flashed—then revulsion. "Get away! Don't touch me!"

"You'd rather die?" He'd never seen her like this.

Fragile. Broken. Sobbing as if her soul had shattered.

So she could weep like this—for someone else.

Adrian's gaze darkened as he studied her.

She remained an enigma.

Evelyn forced herself upright. One glance confirmed it—Alexander Durand's assistant, not the man himself.

He was truly gone.

Her scheme to provoke Adrian into wounding her had served two purposes: revenge against Isabella, and luring Alexander from hiding.

Her childhood protector would never ignore her suffering.

Yet he hadn't come.

A sharp inhale. The truth cut deeper than any blade.

She staggered to her feet, eyes hollow. Years of waiting—for nothing.

Ignoring Adrian, she gripped the railing. Each step upward tore at her injuries.

The pain in her heart eclipsed all physical wounds.

Adrian watched her stubborn retreat, fury igniting in his chest.

In three strides, he swept her off her feet.

The agony twisting her features silenced his reproach.
###Chapter 144

Nathan and Zachary pushed open the hospital room door. The bed was empty.

They exchanged a glance, pupils contracting sharply.

"Where's the boss?" Nathan's voice was tight.

Zachary immediately pulled out his phone. "I'll check the surveillance footage."

Hurried footsteps echoed from the end of the corridor.

Adrian rushed into the ER carrying an unconscious Evelyn, his white coat stained with vivid blood.

"What happened?" Nathan blocked Adrian's path.

Adrian's eyes darkened. "You promised to take care of her."

Zachary scoffed. "You dare question us? You stabbed Evelyn for your fiancée, and now you're playing the devoted lover?"

Adrian's knuckles cracked under the pressure of his clenched fist.

"Want to fight?" Zachary loosened his tie. "Go marry Isabella and worship her. Stop tormenting Evelyn."

The ER lights flickered on.

Nathan lowered his voice. "Get the car ready. The lobby's swarming with reporters and Isabella's fans."

Zachary nodded. "I'll have Gabrielle arrange a private hospital."

Adrian stood in the corridor shadows, his fingers bone-white.

Thirty minutes later, Evelyn was wheeled out.

Her face was paper-pale, fragile lashes casting delicate shadows under the harsh lights.

"Where are you taking her?" Adrian blocked the gurney.

Nathan shoved him aside. "Should we wait for your fiancée's mob to attack her?"

As the convoy drove away, Adrian remained motionless.

Victor hurried over. "Sir, Miss Langley—"

Adrian watched the taillights disappear, his chest hollow.

Meanwhile, Isabella strode into Starlight Media in stilettos.

"Miss Langley!" The receptionist fawned. "Scarlett's new drama premiered today, but the ratings won't touch yours."

Vanessa linked arms with her. "That video of Mr. Valentine taking a knife for you is trending. Netizens are calling it fairy-tale romance."

Isabella traced her manicured nails, lips curving in triumph.
###Chapter 145

Vanessa Kalmien's eyes sparkled as she gazed at Isabella Langley with admiration. "Isabella, you're absolutely amazing."

Isabella offered a sweet smile. "Vanessa, you're exaggerating. The ratings haven't been released yet. We shouldn't gossip about Mr. Lin."

Her voice was soft as water, her smile tender and charming.

Vanessa burst into laughter and grabbed Isabella's hand. "Isabella, you're always so modest. No wonder Mr. Valentine would risk his life for you. What does Evelyn Roland even amount to? How dare she bully you?"

Isabella's expression faltered.

She hadn't expected Adrian Valentine to go to such lengths for her.

His devotion moved her deeply, filling her with happiness.

She lowered her head, biting her lip, her eyes reddening at the corners. "Adrian went too far. He hasn't come to the office yet—I'm worried."

Vanessa suddenly pointed excitedly toward the entrance. "Isabella, look! Mr. Valentine is here!"

Isabella turned.

Adrian's tall, imposing figure strode into the lobby, the light outlining his striking features.

She hurried toward him. "Adrian, are you alright?"

Adrian responded coldly, "I'm fine."

Isabella clung to his arm, her face pale. "Adrian, is Evelyn okay?"

Adrian paused mid-step, his handsome face turning icy. "Isabella, drop the act. Haven’t you seen the news online? There’s going to be an even bigger exposé tonight. What are you doing here?"

His tone startled her.

"Adrian, you're scolding me?" she asked tearfully.

The usually gentle Adrian had snapped at her today.

Her lips trembled as she bit down on them. "I know you're doing this for my sake. I'll leave now."

Adrian turned to Victor Ashcroft. "Take her home. There will be major news this afternoon."

Isabella's heart clenched.

She had felt uneasy when she saw the news this morning.

So there really was more to come.

Just as she was about to leave, Scarlett Orlando stormed in with Celeste Rubinstein in tow.

Scarlett marched straight up to Adrian and shoved him hard.

Adrian stumbled back a few steps, frowning at her.

"Adrian Valentine!" Scarlett glared at him furiously. "For stabbing Evelyn over Isabella, I’ll make sure the Valentine Group goes bankrupt by tonight!"

Adrian's brow furrowed.

Where did this woman get such confidence?

What was her relationship with Evelyn?

Isabella sneered. "Such bold words, Ms. Orlando. Do you really think the Valentine Group is so easily toppled?"

SLAP!

A sharp crack echoed as Scarlett's palm struck Isabella's face.

Everyone froze.

Isabella clutched her cheek in disbelief. "Scarlett Orlando, have you lost your mind?"

Scarlett's red lips curled into a cold smile. "Isabella Langley, trying to climb over others to get ahead? I won’t let you have your way. What makes you think the Langley family can scheme against me in the entertainment industry?"
###Chapter 146

Scarlett Orlando's crimson lips curved into a cold smile, her eyes glinting with icy fury. "Adrian Valentine, if Evelyn doesn't wake up, I'll end you myself."

Adrian's pupils constricted, his voice strained. "You know where she is?"

"That stab wound punctured her lung. It nearly killed her." Scarlett's fingers brushed against her temple. "Since you want justice for this bitch, I'll bury the entire Langley family with her."

She turned on her stiletto heels, her scarlet dress swirling like flames. Celeste Rubinstein followed close behind, their retreating figures a glaring spectacle.

Isabella Langley clutched her swollen cheek, tears streaming down her face. "Adrian, you're just letting them leave?"

Adrian remained silent, his mind filled with Evelyn's pale, lifeless face.

Victor Ashcroft held out his phone to Isabella. "Miss Langley, you might want to check the trending topics."

The hashtag #IsabellaLangleyFramedEvelynRoland exploded across social media. Surveillance footage clearly showed her slapping her own face while Evelyn stood motionless.

The comments section erupted:
[Isabella Langley wins Best Green Tea Award of the Year]
[Adrian's white-knighting backfired spectacularly]
[Evelyn was a Langley adoptee? Rich family drama incoming]

Meanwhile, #ImperialConsortRatingsSurge topped the charts. Scarlett's breathtaking stills from the drama drew waves of admiration.

Isabella's fingers trembled as her carefully crafted persona crumbled. The stares from colleagues cut like knives.

"Adrian!" She grabbed his sleeve, nails digging into his flesh. "You're the only one who can help me now!"

The company's display screen suddenly switched to breaking news—Langley Group's stocks had plummeted by 10%.
###Chapter 147

Adrian Valentine rubbed his temples in frustration, his voice low and tense. "Go home and stay there. The stock prices of the Langley Group and Valentine Corporation are about to plummet."

"Isabella, I always thought you were smart enough." His lips curled into a cold smirk. "Digging your own grave once was bad enough. Why make the same mistake twice?"

Isabella Langley bit her lip, not daring to meet his gaze. Her mother had been desperately trying to suppress the scandal at the company, but it was futile. Her father was too preoccupied with the mineral atlas project to spare her any attention. Now, her only hope was Adrian.

Her fists clenched, nails digging deep into her palms. That bitch Evelyn Roland should just drop dead already!

"Adrian, I know I was wrong," she whispered, her voice trembling. What terrified her more was the possibility of Scarlett Orlando uncovering the truth about the car accident.

"Darling!" Margaret Valentine hurried over, taking Isabella's hands in hers with motherly concern. The three of them stepped into the office.

Margaret spoke soothingly, "Don't worry, Adrian will handle the online mess. Go home and rest. I'll make sure your name is cleared."

Isabella looked at her future mother-in-law with gratitude. Margaret treated her better than her own daughter, always putting her first.

Leaning in, she murmured into Margaret's ear, "Auntie, I only acted out because I saw Adrian visiting Evelyn that day... I never thought things would spiral this badly."

Margaret patted her hand reassuringly. "Relax. I'll force that orphan to apologize. Who does she think she is, daring to compete with you?"

Turning to the door, she instructed, "The driver is waiting downstairs. Go home now."

Isabella cast a hesitant glance at Adrian. His expression was stormy, dark with anger.

"Adrian, I'll... I'll go now," she said, her voice thick with unshed tears.

He didn’t even look at her.

The moment Isabella left, Margaret's face hardened. "Find Evelyn immediately and arrange a press conference! Isabella's reputation must be restored!"

Adrian's lips twisted into a mocking smile. "Are you blind to the crashing stock prices? Do you want to push a dying woman to her grave, or watch the company go bankrupt?"

"Bankrupt?" Margaret shrieked. "Don't be ridiculous!"

Her voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper. "There's something else. We need to get our hands on Alexander Durand's mineral atlas. We'll mine it ourselves!"

The thought infuriated her. "That bitch refused to talk before. If you hadn't shown her those photos—"

She winced, pressing a hand to her aching lower back. For the past year, she hadn’t slept properly. The irony was, only Evelyn could ease her pain.

Knock knock.

The sharp rapping interrupted her thoughts. Adrian's voice was icy. "Enter."
###Chapter 148

Victor Ashcroft pushed the door open with urgency, beads of sweat forming at his temples. "Mr. Valentine, the stock price has plummeted. Multiple partners are demanding contract terminations with Isabella Langley. The negative press is spiraling out of control."

Margaret Valentine rose immediately, not wanting to delay her son's business matters.

Only Adrian Valentine could handle this crisis.

"Adrian, I'll take my leave now. But you must resolve Isabella's situation quickly. Acting is her passion—you should support her dreams." She pressed a hand to her lower back as she shuffled out.

Victor suppressed an eye roll.

Had Isabella Langley bewitched Margaret?

The woman doted on her more than her own daughter.

Once the door clicked shut, Victor lowered his voice. "Sir, there's something odd. The news about you stabbing Madam has suddenly vanished."

He sighed inwardly. Despite everything, Madam still cared for the CEO.

Adrian stared out the window, his voice hoarse. "Victor, I wish it were my wife who betrayed me. But in the end, I was the one who broke my promise."

A heavy silence settled between them.

"Sir, it's too late for regrets. For a year, your public displays of affection for Isabella Langley made headlines. Given Madam's temperament, even the deepest love would have withered."

As someone who owed Evelyn Roland a debt, Victor couldn't bear to see them miss their chance.

"Even if you meet again, everything has changed."

Adrian's heart plunged into an icy abyss.

This charade—Evelyn performed for that man, while he played his part for the world.

At least this way, she'd suffer less harassment from the Valentines.

"Leave the stock price for now. Handle Isabella's mess. We can't afford to provoke Vincent Langley yet—not without the evidence."

Victor nodded. "Understood."

Adrian collapsed into his swivel chair, exhaustion etching his handsome features.

When he closed his eyes, the image of Evelyn tumbling down the stairs—chasing after that man—flashed relentlessly.

Who was worth such recklessness?

Only now did he realize how little he knew the woman he'd lived with for four years.

She carried secrets, masking her pain behind forced smiles.

Outside, the sunset bathed the city in amber. A sudden, crushing dread seized Adrian.

The person he'd fought so hard to protect—he was losing her.

What he thought was love had only brought her harm.

Isabella Langley's scandal dominated headlines for three days before gradually fading.

But within the industry, she'd become a laughingstock.

The Langley Group's stocks crashed. Partners withdrew. Vincent Langley was hospitalized with rage.

At his bedside, he glared at his haggard wife, torn between concern and fury. "Have you uncovered who's behind this?"
###Chapter 149

Eleanor Langley sat rigidly on the hospital sofa, her impeccable makeup failing to mask the storm brewing beneath.

"Do we even need to investigate who's responsible?" Her laugh was cold. "With Isabella's scandals exposed, it's only natural our partners would withdraw to avoid the fallout."

She crossed her legs gracefully, disappointment flashing in her eyes. Her daughter's stupidity was truly breathtaking—repeating the same mistake twice.

She'd taught Isabella since childhood: either commit fully or don't bother. Clearly, the lesson hadn't stuck.

"That cursed Evelyn is to blame." Vincent Langley's gaze turned glacial. "Should've smothered her at birth."

Eleanor closed her eyes wearily. Time had been kind to her oval face, still strikingly beautiful with meticulous care.

"Go rest," Vincent said gently. "I'll manage here."

Her eyes snapped open. Rising slowly, she commanded, "Make Evelyn issue a public statement. If that car accident gets investigated, Isabella's finished."

"Relax. I've already taken care of it." His tone brimmed with confidence.

She studied him for several seconds before nodding.

"Come home with me." Her voice brooked no argument. "I won't make another hospital trip today."

Vincent smiled. "I have a meeting with Harrison Macmillan. He gave Evelyn three hundred million. We have no choice but to partner with him now."

At this, Eleanor sat back down. "Alexander Durand and Evelyn were close. I suspect she sabotaged your election campaign."

"That backwater brat?" Vincent scoffed. "She's not capable."

A calculating glint entered his eyes. Evelyn's face bore an uncanny resemblance to... someone.

Perhaps she'd prove useful later.

"Find that painting," Eleanor said icily as she stood. "Six months of searching, and all you've accomplished is landing yourself in a hospital bed. Evelyn's digging into the Durand family affairs. She needs to disappear."

Vincent watched his wife leave, his expression darkening.

This past year had been nothing but endless headaches.
###Chapter 150

If Harrison Macmillan dared to bother him again, he'd make sure the bastard regretted it.

Evelyn Roland was closing in, determined to uncover the truth behind that night.

The girl had grown a spine, standing up to him now.

What could a nobody like her possibly achieve?

All her efforts would be in vain.

A dark glint flashed in Vincent Langley's eyes as he dialed Dominic Lombardi's number.

Dominic entered, frowning. "Sir, I just ran into Mrs. Langley. She looked terrible."

Vincent massaged his temples irritably. "Who wouldn't? After everything that's happened?"

He wiped his face wearily before ordering, "Dig into Isabella Langley and Nathan Aldridge's connection. I want to know everything."

Dominic's pupils contracted. "I already checked. Evelyn worked with Nathan at Horizon Tech. Sebastian Cortez recruited her for her skills."

Vincent narrowed his eyes. "That girl's hiding something. Investigate again. If nothing turns up, I'll personally ensure Nathan fires her. She'll have nowhere to run but to me."

Dominic stiffened.

Was the old man insane? Trying to manipulate Evelyn?

This wasn't an opportunity—it was suicide.

"No." Dominic's refusal was absolute.

Vincent raised a brow. "Why not? She should be honored."

Dominic's frown deepened. "Honored? More like cursed."

"Sir, think clearly. Remember who she is. This isn't recruitment—it's planting a live grenade in your lap."

"Don't throw away your reputation now."

He had to spell it out.

Evelyn was a poisoned blade.

"She may lack power, but look what she's done with just words. First the hospital, next it'll be the morgue."

Vincent's hands trembled with rage. "You—Dominic, how dare—"

His face flushed crimson, speech failing him.

Dominic sighed. "Sir, we worked hard to go legitimate. If they trace this back to you, everything I've built is ruined."

He wouldn't let it collapse now. Not when he was so close to redemption.

Vincent waved impatiently. "Enough. Just find out about Nathan and Evelyn. I want that girl begging at my feet. No more playing defense."
###Chapter 151

"Chairman Langley, I've exhausted every lead this past year. There's truly nothing unusual to report." Dominic stood by the hospital bed, hands tucked in his tailored trousers. "The core issue lies in Evelyn's special connection with Sebastian Cortez. Sever that tie, and she loses her greatest advantage."

He paused, gaze drifting to the plane trees outside the window.

"That Renaissance masterpiece remains missing. Only Evelyn knows its whereabouts. Perhaps we should keep her alive for now—"

Vincent Langley slammed the bedside table. The IV bottle rattled violently.

"I won't swallow this insult!"

Dominic's lips twisted into a bitter smile. "Empty threats won't solve anything, Chairman. Focus on strategy, not tantrums."

"Get out!" Vincent hurled a pillow. "You'll be the death of me!"

Dominic caught it effortlessly, placing it back with deliberate calm.

His white coat billowed as he turned away.

The corridor vibrated with his buzzing phone.

Stock alerts from his assistant deepened the furrow between his brows.

Langley Group shares were in freefall.

At this rate, not even circuit breakers could stop the plunge.

A shattering glass echoed from the room behind him.

Dominic quickened his pace, unwilling to face another outburst.

......

Top floor of Valentine Corporation.

Adrian Valentine drummed polished fingers against his mahogany desk.

The fluctuations in his own stock were expected.

But Langley's collapse? That was unforeseen.

He rose, striding to the floor-to-ceiling windows.

The city glittered beneath him like scattered diamonds.

Fingers tugged at his loosened collar, revealing a pale scar along his collarbone.

Knock-knock-knock—

The door burst open.

Margaret Valentine stormed in, her Chanel No. 5 preceding her.

"Find Evelyn Roland immediately!" Her manicured finger stabbed at the stock ticker. "Look at these numbers! The Valentine legacy won't crumble under your watch!"

Adrian turned. Ice glinted in his eyes.

"Your operatives failed. If you can't locate her, how could I—"

His phone lit up.

An unknown number flashed across the screen:

[Looking for Evelyn?]
###Chapter 152

Adrian Valentine rose slowly, his slender fingers brushing the cuffs of his tailored suit. A faint smirk played at the corners of his lips.

"If even you can't find her, Sebastian Cortez certainly won't." Margaret Valentine stormed out, slamming the door behind her as she headed straight for Horizon Tech.

Adrian stood motionless by the window, his deep eyes reflecting the dappled shadows of the trees outside.

Margaret collapsed onto the sofa with a thud, wincing as a sharp pain shot through her lower back.

"This agony has plagued me for a full year. Not even specialists abroad could cure it. That wretched Evelyn must have done something to me!"

Adrian turned, his gaze sharp as a blade.

"Your back never hurt when she was treating you."

Margaret's hand, braced against her waist, froze mid-motion.

"Adrian, it's been a year since your divorce. Are you still hung up on that orphan girl? Isabella Langley is the right match for you!"

"The right match?" Adrian's laugh was cold. "I'd love to know why you despise her as much as the Langley family does."

Margaret's eyes darted away, her voice trembling. "She... she's just some nobody, too ashamed to even have a public wedding. You were clearly just toying with her—"

Adrian's knuckles whitened, dark currents swirling in his eyes.

He stepped closer, watching impassively as Margaret's face contorted in pain.

"Sebastian's Sterling Manor..." Margaret suddenly narrowed her eyes. "Could that girl be hiding there?"

Adrian's expression darkened instantly.

Sterling Manor's impenetrable security was something even he couldn't breach.

No wonder Evelyn had vanished without a trace this past year.

"Unless she chooses to come out herself," Adrian said, his voice icy. Sebastian had protected her far too well.

Margaret clenched the armrest in frustration but didn't dare demand entry to Sterling Manor.

"Adrian," she suddenly cooed, her tone syrupy sweet. "I heard the young mistress of Sterling Manor has returned. Could you help your brother—"

Before she could finish, Julian Roscente's lazy drawl drifted from the doorway.

"Aunt Margaret, this young lady isn't an easy catch."

Leaning against the doorframe, his peach-blossom eyes brimming with mockery, he added, "My father tried arranging a marriage alliance. I was turned away over a dozen times."

Margaret's face paled. "You want to marry the Sterling Manor heiress too?"
###Chapter 153

Julian Roscente lounged lazily on the leather sofa, his long fingers tapping the armrest. His gaze held a mocking glint as he studied Adrian Valentine's stormy expression across from him.

"I want to marry Evelyn." His tone was light, but the seriousness in his eyes betrayed him.

Adrian's head snapped up. His knuckles whitened around the crystal glass, the amber liquid trembling slightly.

Julian crossed his legs with deliberate nonchalance. "If you hadn't made your move first back then, I would've pursued her myself."

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting half of Adrian's face in shadow.

"Are you saying I can't have a woman you've slept with?" Julian scoffed. "Since when did the great Adrian Valentine become so old-fashioned?"

Adrian rose slowly, his tailored suit pants accentuating his long legs. A dangerous aura radiated from him.

Margaret Valentine cut in sharply, her face livid. "Julian! Your father would break your legs if he heard this!"

Julian flicked his lighter open and closed, the flame dancing in his dark eyes. "Aunt Margaret, all of Vienna is laughing at the Valentines right now."

His mind flashed to Evelyn at the banquet—her cold, arresting gaze even more mesmerizing than a year ago.

"Attempted murder for Isabella's sake? How impressive, Adrian." Julian's voice dripped with sarcasm. "If Evelyn hadn't shown mercy, you'd be rotting in prison."

Adrian suddenly smirked, his eyes swirling with violence. "You think she'd ever look at a wastrel like you now?"

Julian stiffened. Over the past six months, the Roscente auction house had been sabotaged, nearly bankrupting his family. Forced to take over the business, he realized how foolish he'd been following Adrian's reckless lead.

"At least I wasn't stupid enough to kill for a stand-in." He straightened his suit jacket, noting Adrian's abrupt pallor.

Margaret shrieked, "Enough! That bitch Evelyn—"

"Aunt Margaret." Julian's voice turned icy. "Your daughter is still locked in a psychiatric hospital. Worry about your own family first."

As he turned to leave, the memory of Evelyn humiliated by their joint cruelty flashed through his mind. His chest tightened with sudden pain. That absurd bet—he still owed her an apology.
###Chapter 154

Margaret Valentine rubbed her aching back, unable to sit still any longer.

She stood abruptly and walked out without a backward glance.

Her daughter would have to clean up this mess.

Evelyn Roland would never set foot in the Valentine mansion again.

Adrian Valentine settled back into his chair, fingertips tapping the desk. "Julian Roscente, are you serious?"

"Yes." Julian's expression was resolute. "I'm done playing games."

"Christian Lefèvre is dead. Vincent Ashcroft is gone. Only then did I realize how foolish I've been."

The upheaval a year ago had forced him to face reality.

He'd never forget how his father's hair turned white overnight.

Adrian scoffed. "She'd actually want you? You and Vincent tormented her relentlessly."

"People change." Julian gave a bitter smile. "Looking back, we were complete bastards."

"Every time I remember the sorrow in her eyes, I feel sick with shame."

"We thought she was mediocre, but she outsmarted us all."

"We mocked her lack of education, yet she closed deals even Nathan Aldridge couldn't secure."

Adrian's knuckles turned white.

No one understood Evelyn's enigma better than he did.

Julian suddenly chuckled. "How many projects did she land for your company that year?"

"Funny thing—I think about her every night now."

"Without the veil of prejudice, I finally see how extraordinary she is."

Adrian's gaze darkened, his silence heavy.

Julian rose. "Which hospital is she at? I'll visit."

"I don't know." Adrian's voice was glacial.

"I'll find out myself." Julian arched a brow. "Your family's stocks are plummeting, by the way."

"The internet is tearing you and Isabella Langley to shreds."

"Her innocent act is Oscar-worthy. You two deserve each other."

"Julian!" Adrian snarled through clenched teeth.

Julian laughed as he headed for the door. "Some wounds never heal."

"I don't know why you had a change of heart, but Evelyn deserves better."

After the office door clicked shut, Adrian slowly pulled out his phone.

He dialed Nathan Aldridge's number.
###Chapter 155

Adrian Valentine slammed his phone onto the couch with force.

Victor Ashcroft strode into the office. "President Valentine, all of Isabella Langley's endorsement contracts have been terminated."

Adrian didn't even lift his eyelids. "Vincent Langley will handle it. Issue a statement through PR saying Evelyn and Isabella's video was just sisterly banter."

Victor's eyes widened.

Banter?

This was clearly Isabella setting up a trap for Evelyn.

He couldn't comprehend why Adrian kept favoring Isabella.

Was he truly blinded by love?

Victor sighed inwardly.

Seeing Adrian's stony silence, he had no choice but to comply.

He could only hope Nathan Aldridge would teach that scheming woman a lesson.

Before leaving, Victor couldn't resist asking, "What if Sterling Manor refuses to acknowledge it as banter?"

Adrian shot him an icy glare. "Do as I say. Evelyn will cooperate."

Victor left with lingering doubts.

Adrian walked to the floor-to-ceiling window.

Vienna glittered under the night sky.

He knew better than anyone that Evelyn was investigating Alexander Durand's death.

Until she found evidence, she wouldn't burn bridges with the Langleys.

This statement would confirm her safety.

His tense reflection stared back from the glass.

Worry darkened his eyes.

Two hours later, Victor returned in haste.

Adrian remained standing in the same spot.

Only when he heard footsteps did he shift his numb legs.

Victor looked stunned.

Nathan hadn't made a move.

Evelyn had actually responded on the official website.

["A sisterly prank caused misunderstandings. Our deepest apologies."]

The brief statement sent netizens into an uproar.

Evelyn had forgiven Isabella.

Victor felt conflicted.

He understood Evelyn's predicament.

Going against Adrian and Vincent alone was nearly impossible.

Even with Sebastian Cortez's help, true loyalty was rare when interests were at stake.

Public opinion overwhelmingly sided with Evelyn.

Netizens voiced their indignation for her.

"President, Evelyn has responded," Victor reported quietly.

The tension finally left Adrian's shoulders.

She was awake.

"Understood. You're dismissed." His voice came out hoarse.

Victor noticed the subtle change in him.

This man was becoming increasingly inscrutable.

But what did it matter to him?
###Chapter 156

Isabella Langley stared at her phone screen, fingers trembling.

The Valentine Group's dismissive statement burned her eyes: ["A minor misunderstanding between sisters."]

Public opinion shifted instantly.

Evelyn Roland's response had masterfully garnered all the sympathy.

Isabella's nails dug deep into her palms.

She hurled the phone against the wall. The screen shattered with a sharp crack that echoed through the empty living room.

"Stop playing the victim!" She glared at the stormy sky outside. "Evelyn, you think this means you've won?"

......

The bedroom in Regal Heights smelled of antiseptic.

Sebastian Cortez frowned at Evelyn's pale face on the hospital bed.

"Do you have any idea what you're doing?" His voice was tight.

Evelyn gave a weak smile as the IV drip fell steadily beside her.

"Just a little more time, brother."

Sebastian took a deep breath. He knew his sister too well—once she set her mind to something, nothing could change it.

"Explain this wound." He pointed to the bandage on her abdomen. "Guiding someone's hand to stab yourself? This isn't some soap opera."

If Gabrielle Flores hadn't arrived in time, the consequences would have been unthinkable.

"If it were a soap opera, I'd cast you as the lead," Evelyn joked, trying to lighten the mood.

Sebastian shook his head helplessly. "Grandfather smashed his teacup. He said you've never bowed to money in your life, yet for a man—"

"Apologize to Grandfather for me." Evelyn cut him off. "It was worth it."

Her gaze fell on the soaring stock curve displayed on her tablet, resolve flashing in her eyes.

Sebastian stood. "Last time. If they dare touch you again, I'll handle it myself."

The door clicked shut softly.

Evelyn stared at the ceiling, finally severing that absurd obsession completely.

Ten days later, Sterling Manor's new product launch stunned the industry.

The NovaCore project swept through the market like lightning, sending stocks skyrocketing.

Evelyn stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, morning light outlining her slender frame.

"Grandfather, we did it."

Frederick Roland cradled Ethan in his arms, smile smoothing the wrinkles at his eyes. "Evelyn, the overseas market is secured. We launch in three days."

Sebastian approached with coffee, ruffling his sister's hair. "Well done."

The old man beamed. "Name your reward. You two have earned it."
###Chapter 157

Brother and sister exchanged a knowing smile, their eyes filled with silent understanding.

Evelyn's gaze shimmered as the corners of her lips lifted.

Sebastian watched her with tender affection.

Frederick cradled little Ethan in his arms, beaming with joy.

"Grandfather, we lack nothing," Evelyn said brightly. "Your health is what matters most."

Sebastian smoothly added, "Indeed. I've already arranged all overseas affairs. We'll be ready to depart in a month."

Frederick's hearty laughter filled the hospital room.

Ethan giggled in his arms, tiny hands mischievously tugging at the old man's ears.

Evelyn and Sebastian exchanged glances.

Grandfather seemed unusually cheerful today.

"Oh, you little rascal!" Frederick wiped tears of mirth from his eyes. "Why are you so delighted just because Great-grandfather is happy?"

He pinched Ethan's cheek gently. "You must grow up to be as remarkable as your parents."

Evelyn was the heir he had personally groomed.

Sebastian was the successor he had carefully chosen.

Both made him immensely proud.

Uncomprehending, Ethan continued his playful assault on Great-grandfather's ears.

"Goo-goo-ga-ga..." The baby babbled with glee.

Frederick feigned sternness. "Your sister behaves much better—always bringing me joy."

Warmth permeated the hospital room.

Evelyn watched the scene, her heart swelling with emotion.

"Evelyn," Frederick suddenly grew serious. "The new vehicle sales have surpassed one hundred thousand units."

Her eyes sparkled with triumph.

Four years of effort had borne fruit.

Sebastian added, "The intelligent system played a crucial role. Market response has been exceptional."

"Brother," Evelyn shook her head. "This is our shared achievement."

Frederick regarded them with satisfaction. "Seeing you two united puts my mind at ease."

His tone turned solemn. "Sebastian, it's time we discussed your marriage plans."

Sebastian nodded gravely. "Rest assured, Grandfather. I understand."

He stood and ruffled Evelyn's hair. "Focus on recovering. No unnecessary worries."

Evelyn stuck out her tongue playfully. "All I want is to heal quickly."

Sebastian gave a soft hum. "See that you do."
###Chapter 158

Sebastian Cortez gently stroked his sister's long hair, his gaze tender yet firm. "Evelyn, loving yourself is life's most important lesson. Only when you become your own sun can you truly shine."

Evelyn Roland lowered her lashes, shadows dancing beneath them in the lamplight.

Her journey had been unbearably difficult.

Alexander Durand's death had shattered her.

Now Adrian Valentine had left her utterly broken.

Sebastian's heart ached at the sight of her gaunt face.

Her current radiance had been earned through countless sleepless nights.

Four years of trials had transformed her into a stronger version of herself.

"I understand, brother," Evelyn murmured.

How could she not?

Sebastian remained troubled.

Evelyn's life had been filled with suffering, yet she'd known so little love. Adrian was her first true love—how could such feelings simply vanish?

Perhaps this would remain her lifelong regret.

But Evelyn had fought so hard. Surely fate would smile upon her now.

With an affectionate smile, Sebastian left with their grandfather.

One month later, Sterling Manor's new product sales stunned the Nine-City Alliance, securing the industry's top position.

Competitors burned with envy.

Meanwhile, Scarlett Orlando's new drama became a sensation, propelling her career to new heights.

Isabella Langley seethed in frustration.

Thankfully she'd sabotaged things behind the scenes—otherwise the humiliation would have been unbearable.

...

At Nightfall Bar, Adrian Valentine and Julian Roscente drank in a private booth.

Sterling Manor's sales figures elicited complex expressions from both men.

Julian lounged against the sofa, swirling his wine glass. "Adrian, time reveals truth better than eyes ever could. Sterling Manor's young mistress continues to surprise us."

Adrian shot him a cold glance. "Weren't you planning to marry her?"

"My father's idea." Julian shrugged. "She's too exceptional for me. I prefer someone like Evelyn."

At Evelyn's name, Adrian's expression darkened.

She hadn't appeared in over a month.

Agitated, he stood abruptly and strode toward the door.

As it swung open, he froze.

She'd recovered...

Nathan Aldridge stood beside her, both laughing easily. Nathan held Evelyn's favorite chicken wrap, occasionally feeding her bites.

Evelyn carried a laptop and a bouquet of roses, her smile radiant.

"One more bite," Nathan urged gently.

"I'm really full," Evelyn protested.

She'd come tonight for business negotiations, skipping dinner entirely.

"Not negotiable. Finish it." Nathan was adamant.

Evelyn widened her eyes. "Why?"

She'd gained two kilograms during her month of bedrest. Now she'd need two months of strict dieting.
###Chapter 159

Nathan sighed helplessly. The chicken wrap was specially prepared by Gabrielle with rare medicinal herbs.

Gabrielle never cut corners, even with the simplest dishes.

"Victoria sent this. Gabrielle made it specifically for your recovery." Nathan pushed the thermal container forward. "She said your wounds haven't fully healed. Finish it all, or no office tomorrow."

Evelyn stared at the wrap, her frown deep enough to crush flies.

This was her fourth chicken wrap today.

"Look at my waist." She pinched her slender frame. "I'll balloon up if I keep eating. You finish it—just throw away the part I bit."

Nathan's gaze swept over her flawless figure.

"Where's the fat?" He scratched his head. "You're as stunning as ever."

Women's obsession with weight baffled him.

"Fine, I'll eat it." Resigned, Nathan picked up the wrap. "Can't waste Gabrielle's cooking." Those herbs were priceless.

Relieved, Evelyn inhaled the scent of her roses.

"Beautiful flowers?"

"Gorgeous." Nathan admired them sincerely. "Sebastian still sends you roses before business trips. He spoils you rotten."

Even as a man, he couldn't help appreciating the vibrant blooms.

"Hope his trip goes well." Evelyn stood. "Let's go meet Chairman Harrison."

Turning, she locked eyes with Adrian's icy glare.

Her expression blank, Evelyn walked past without acknowledgment.

Nathan instantly shielded her, his sharp gaze warning Adrian to back off.

As they brushed past, a cold hand suddenly clamped around Evelyn's wrist with bruising force.

"Let go." Her voice was frost.

Running into this jinx every outing was exhausting.

The irony—he was the heartbreaker, yet played the victim.

"Adrian, release her!" Nathan barked.

Why wouldn't this man disappear?

Adrian studied Evelyn's flushed cheeks. "We need to talk."

"About what?" Her lips curled mockingly. "What's left to say?"

After over a month apart, he looked haggard yet unbearably handsome.

"Over there." Adrian tried dragging Evelyn away.

Nathan blocked them, chin lifted in challenge. "Last warning—let her go!"

Adrian smirked down at him. "Why so tense, Nathan? Just catching up with my ex-wife."
###Chapter 160

"Trouble? Every time I run into scum like you, nothing good happens!"

Nathan Aldridge glared at Adrian Valentine through gritted teeth. He'd always known this man was no good, but he never imagined he'd stoop this low, shamelessly inserting himself into Evelyn's presence again and again.

Evelyn Roland understood Adrian's nature all too well. If she didn't make things crystal clear tonight, she'd never shake him off.

"Mr. Aldridge, please go ahead and discuss the partnership with Mr. Harrison. I'll join you shortly."

She shoved the bouquet of roses and her laptop into Nathan's arms without ceremony.

Nathan: "..." Why bother with this bastard?

But Evelyn didn't even spare him a glance.

Adrian led Evelyn into a different private room. The previous one had belonged to Julian Roscente—this was his territory.

The door clicked shut, and Adrian flipped the lock.

"Sit." He gestured to the sofa.

The moment Evelyn sat down, his towering frame loomed over her. His familiar scent washed over her, making her lashes tremble as a sharp pang shot through her chest.

Damn it. She'd promised herself she wouldn't care.

Adrian suddenly reached for her collar.

"Have you lost your mind?" Evelyn shielded her chest, fury igniting in her eyes.

He forcibly pried her hand away, his gaze locking onto the scars marring her skin. A gunshot wound overlapped with a knife scar—barely inches apart, yet they burned his vision like searing brands.

Evelyn scoffed and shoved him back hard. "We're nothing to each other now. Touch me again, and I'll sue you for harassment."

Adrian ignored her threat, his fingertips tracing the raised scar with unsteady fingers. "Did it hurt?"

Her entire body stiffened. His touch sent shivers skittering across her skin.

"Just a scratch. Nothing fatal."

Even if it had hurt, it was none of his concern.

Some people and things were better left untouched from the start. Better to live with regret than endure the pain.

"Evelyn!" Adrian suddenly snarled before flashing a dangerous smirk. "Can't you ever show weakness in front of a man?"

Only now did he realize—after four years of marriage—he'd never truly known her. Like how she loved roses but had never mentioned it.

Evelyn let out a hollow laugh, as if she'd heard the most ridiculous joke. "Why should I pretend to be fragile? If a woman needs to play weak to earn a man's approval, that's a pathetic way to live."

"My path has always been lined with thorns. Even if flowers never bloom along the way, I'll keep moving forward—bloodied but unbowed. I won't look back."

Every word struck like hammer blows.

Adrian's pupils contracted. She said... she wouldn't look back.

"You love Alexander Durand. I know you won't turn back." He slowly released her collar. "Evelyn, leave this place. That's my final warning."

Her head snapped up, eyes glinting with frost. "I told you—I'm not going anywhere. Bring it on if you dare. I'll meet you head-on."

She rose to her feet, looking down at him with icy disdain. "This is your last warning—for you and Isabella Langley. Provoke me again, and I won't hesitate to expose her contract killing evidence. Did you really think you hid it well enough?"

Without another word, she turned to leave. She couldn't stand another second in that room.

Adrian suddenly seized her wrist.

"Ah—!" Evelyn gasped as she tumbled straight into his arms.
###Chapter 161

Evelyn trembled with rage, her cheeks flushed crimson.

Adrian adored this fiery side of her.
Her usual icy composure always made him feel shut out of her world.

"Adrian, what's your game? You think I'm filthy yet still touch me?"
Evelyn couldn't fathom his actions. Did this man still harbor feelings for her?

Impossible!

"Of course I do." Adrian smirked. "But you're my wife. Holding my own wife is perfectly natural."

His burning gaze traced her vivid expressions.
She'd clearly recovered.

"Evelyn, now that you're better, I can torment you again." His voice dropped to a husky, teasing murmur.

His hand instinctively found her waist.
Softer than he remembered.
Strange—her abdomen used to curve gently, now it felt impossibly supple.

"Darling—"

"Don't call me that!" Evelyn shoved him away. "Isabella is your darling. Adrian, have you no shame? Divorced means dead to each other!"

She sprang up to leave.

"Boyfriend?" Adrian's eyes turned glacial. "Repeat that."

"I said I'm getting a boyfriend!" Evelyn met his glare defiantly. "Been single too long—time to consider marriage. Stay away from me."

She pushed him hard.
His motives baffled her.

Once he couldn't wait to be rid of her. Now he kept grabbing and kissing her.
Was the man deranged?

Or was Isabella failing to satisfy him?

The thought of him touching her after embracing Isabella made her stomach churn.

"Disgusting—taking turns with ex-wives and current ones. Play your games, Adrian, but keep me out of them."

"Disgusting?" Adrian's eyes narrowed dangerously. "Evelyn, I'll show you real disgust."

He yanked her back, slamming her onto the sofa.

His hands pinned her mercilessly as his mouth claimed hers.

Evelyn fought wildly.

Adrian gave no quarter.
One hand shackled both her wrists while the other gripped her nape.

However she twisted, his lips pursued relentlessly.

Evelyn wished she could kick him into orbit.

Adrian reveled in tormenting her like this.
Their past intimacy always began with him trapping her on the sofa, kissing her breathless.

"Ad—"

His mouth devoured hers, the kiss deep and intoxicating.
He knew exactly how to unravel her.

Minutes later, Evelyn's struggles weakened.

Amusement flickered in Adrian's eyes before he finally released her gasping lips.

His thumb brushed her flushed cheek as he rasped, "Evelyn, leave Vienna. Please."

Her ragged breaths echoed between them.
###Chapter 162

She appeared icy on the surface, yet always turned shy in intimate moments, never daring to meet his piercing gaze.

Evelyn jolted awake, realizing her hands had been freed. Without hesitation, she delivered a stinging slap.

The sharp sound echoed through the private room.

She shoved the man before her with all her strength.

No more weakness.

One betrayal was enough. She wouldn’t let Adrian hurt her again.

A faint red mark bloomed on Adrian’s cheek, yet his lips curled into that same infuriating smirk. Dressed in light gray casual wear, he looked less like the ruthless business tycoon and more like someone lazily enjoying his day off.

"I’m not leaving this city," Evelyn said coolly. "And I won’t interfere with you and Isabella. If my presence bothers you, I’ll marry someone—anyone—to put your mind at ease."

Adrian’s eyes darkened. "Marry anyone?"

"What?" She scoffed. "Isn’t this what you want? To ensure I won’t disrupt Isabella’s life? You’d sleep better knowing I’m someone else’s problem, wouldn’t you?"

Rising to her feet, her gaze turned glacial. "I’ve never sought you out since the divorce. Every time, it’s been you chasing after me."

"From now on, I’ll avoid these places. We’ll see less of each other. But I’m staying—to avenge Alexander. Remember what I said? Pray his death has nothing to do with you. Otherwise..."

She turned to leave before finishing.

Adrian’s lips twisted into a mocking smile.

Of course. It was always about Alexander.

In her heart, there had never been room for him.

"If he were alive, would you have married him?" His voice was ice. He didn’t miss the slight tremor in her retreating figure.

The answer was obvious.

Evelyn didn’t respond.

If Alexander were still here... If she had understood love back then...

But there were no "ifs."

Adrian had been her first love—and the one who shattered her completely.

At the door, she nearly collided with Isabella, who was dressed head-to-toe in disguise.

"Where’s Adrian?" Isabella demanded shrilly.

Evelyn glanced behind her. "Your man. Why ask me?"

Inside the room, Adrian’s chest clenched with sudden pain. He approached slowly, offering Isabella a tender smile. "Bella, you’re here?"
###Chapter 163

Evelyn's heart clenched at the sound of his gentle voice.

The difference between love and indifference was painfully clear.

Those who didn't love could hurt without hesitation.

While those who loved poured out tenderness without reserve.

A self-deprecating smile curved her lips.

Pining for this man wasn't worth it.

The night wind brushed past, carrying a bone-chilling cold.

She quickened her steps and walked away.

Adrian watched her retreating figure until his world seemed drained of color.

Isabella trembled with rage.

"Adrian, why did you see her again?"

"It won't happen again," he replied flatly.

"I missed you." She reached for his arm.

Adrian sidestepped her touch.

"They're in the next room." He turned to close the door.

Isabella's gaze landed on his swollen cheek.

"What happened to your face?"

He pressed his tongue against the cut inside his mouth.

"Nothing."

The darkness in his eyes sent a chill down her spine.

Her fists tightened.

It must have been Evelyn.

She couldn't lose Adrian.

"Let's get engaged," she blurted out.

Adrian paused mid-step.

"Your acting career just started."

"But I want to marry you." Her voice turned stubborn.

He chuckled lightly. "We'll talk when you've achieved your dreams."

Isabella clung to his arm, unsatisfied.

"Don't see Evelyn again."

Adrian remained silent.

On her way to meet Nathan, Evelyn was intercepted.

"Evelyn!" Julian blocked her path with a delighted grin.

She took a step back.

"What a coincidence." His smile was annoyingly smug.

Evelyn regarded him coldly.

Birds of a feather flock together.

Adrian's friends were all cut from the same cloth.
###Chapter 164

Julian Roscente studied Evelyn Roland's guarded expression, his gaze flickering. "Evelyn, I sincerely apologize for speaking ill of you in the past."

He bowed deeply.

Evelyn sidestepped the gesture.

Her eyes swept over the transformed man before her.

"Mr. Roscente, isn't this a bit excessive? You don't even bow this low to your own father. Why the grand gesture for me?"

"I'm still alive, no need for funeral rites just yet."

Julian choked back a laugh.

Leaning against the wall with one knee bent, he flashed a roguish smile.

"Evelyn, you've grown sharper in the past year. You're far more vibrant now. Leaving toxic people really does wonders for self-improvement."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow.

"Julian, there's a top-tier hospital down the street. I suggest you get a neurological exam. Your behavior is... concerning."

Bewilderment crossed his face.

He'd offered a genuine apology—how had it been mistaken for insanity?

"Evelyn, I'm perfectly lucid. Can't you see how much I've matured? Even my father acknowledges it."

Her lips curved without warmth. "Of course he'd say that. But what does your growth have to do with me?"

Julian faltered.

"Have dinner with me tonight? As an apology." His gaze held sincerity.

Evelyn tilted her head. "Mr. Roscente, unsolicited kindness usually masks ulterior motives."

He stiffened.

In Evelyn's memory, Adrian Valentine's inner circle had always scorned her.

Julian had been particularly vocal with his disdain.

Though she'd never retaliated, the slights had registered.

Some relationships demanded equal footing.

That's why Adrian had kept their marriage hidden.

"Evelyn, I was an idiot back then. I've changed. Can we start over? I swear I'll treat you better than Adrian ever—"

"Stop." Evelyn raised a hand. "Julian, your old self was fine. Don't envy maturity—it's born from scars."

"You've lived in privilege. Why chase world-weariness?"

"And let's be clear—there are no slips of the tongue, only truths revealed. Your contempt was real."

Julian fell silent.

Words, once spoken, couldn't be unspoken.

Evelyn knew better than anyone—some fractures never mend.

Forced reconciliations remain hollow.

Those who walk different paths shouldn't force company.

As she turned to leave, movement caught her eye—Isabella Langley and Adrian Valentine approaching.

Julian followed her gaze, then hurried after her without greeting the newcomers.
###Chapter 165

Adrian Valentine's eyes darkened as he watched Julian Roscente chase after the retreating figure, his knuckles turning white.

After a year of silence, Julian now dared to openly covet his woman?

Isabella Langley clenched her skirt, forcing a smile. "Adrian, surely Julian isn't actually falling for Evelyn?" Her nails nearly pierced her palms.

How could that woman thrive after leaving?

She was just an assistant.

That face... A vicious glint flashed in Isabella's eyes.

"Let's go see." Adrian's voice was icy, his gaze locked on the direction Evelyn had disappeared—Sterling Manor.

Isabella hurried after him. "The Roscente family would never accept her. We need to make Julian see reason." She refused to let Evelyn climb above her station.

That wretch belonged in the gutter.

"Evelyn!" Julian panted as he caught up, his burning gaze fixed on her sharp jawline.

Free from prejudice, even her hair seemed to glow.

"Need a ride?"

Evelyn sidestepped him. "Shouldn't you be back appraising treasures, Mr. Roscente?" Her tone was cool. "I heard your father is live-streaming an excavation of Ming Dynasty porcelain."

Julian's eyes brightened. "You follow my family's updates?"

"Considering the last auction's Tang Dynasty tri-color..." Evelyn paused meaningfully. "The lawsuit cost three million in legal fees."

Nathan Aldridge suddenly rounded the corner. "What secrets are you two sharing?" He eyed them suspiciously.

The air froze instantly.
###Chapter 166

"Nathan, are these antiques also fakes?"

Nathan Aldridge instantly regretted his words, slapping his own mouth in frustration.

Evelyn Roland glanced up. "Did you sign the contract?"

Nathan shook his head. "Old Harrison is stubborn. He's hoarding the medicinal herbs we need but refuses to sell at market price."

Evelyn's brow furrowed slightly.

This was unexpected.

Julian Roscente interjected nervously, "Evelyn, are these really counterfeit too?"

She gave him a cool look. "I suggest you investigate the forgery case from a year ago. Consider this a friendly reminder."

Without another word, she turned to leave.

Nathan hurried after her, thrusting a bouquet of crimson roses into her hands. "A grown man carrying flowers looks ridiculous."

Evelyn lowered her head to inhale their fragrance.

The scent softened her expression.

Nathan stared, mesmerized. "No flower could ever compare to you."

A faint smile touched her lips.

She did adore the bold beauty of crimson roses.

Nathan sighed. "Old Harrison doubled his price. I couldn't talk him down."

Evelyn remained composed. "He'll agree eventually. If not, we'll find another supplier."

A thought struck her. "Doesn't Harrison love tea? He visits that teahouse on Central Avenue every noon."

Nathan nodded. "Exactly. He even served me Da Hong Pao earlier. Pity I can't appreciate fine tea—I just pretended to."

A sly glint flashed in Evelyn's eyes. "Grandfather Frederick has a collection of premium Da Hong Pao. We'll host a tea exhibition and invite Harrison."

Nathan's face lit up with realization. "Appeal to his interests!"

Evelyn scoffed. "Took you long enough."

He chuckled awkwardly. "Spending a year at Sterling Manor spoiled me. I almost forgot how to negotiate."

Her gaze turned knowing. "Reputation and wealth aren't everything. You must target their weakness."

She paused. "Though Grandfather's tea collection..."

Nathan hesitated. "Will the old man really part with it?"
###Chapter 167

Evelyn's lips curved slightly. Her grandfather had always been obsessed with tea.

Since his youth, he had collected numerous rare tea varieties.

Those teas were either purchased at auctions for exorbitant prices or gifted by friends.

"Grandfather's tea collection is impressive, but I don't want to go out of my way. Securing Old Li's deal is a must. Giving him a fine cake of tea is nothing. Bestowing favors to win loyalty—that's the principle Grandfather taught me."

Nathan's eyes lit up with understanding. "Don't worry, boss. I'll keep him in suspense for a few more days. A week from now, I'll arrange a tea exhibition for him."

Evelyn nodded in approval.

Once outside and alone, Nathan suddenly handed her his phone. "Boss, look. Vincent Langley and Harrison Macmillan have reached an agreement. They've pieced together the map on the back of the photo and even drafted a mining proposal."

"Vincent Langley... finally took the bait."

A cold glint flashed in Nathan's eyes.

They had spent a full year setting this trap for the old fox.

Evelyn's gaze turned icy as she recalled the figure fleeing in panic at the hospital. She wasn't in a hurry to chase them down. She would wait for them to walk right into her net.

"Vincent Langley is already in play, but why would Harrison offer me three billion? Dig deeper. A month has passed—he should have let his guard down by now."

Every move had been meticulously planned.

Even the map on the back of the photo was her own design.

Vincent had coveted this map for years. Only by letting him "stumble upon it" would he believe it was genuine.

The old fox was cunning. This was the only way to tear off his mask and expose his true nature.

Soon, a new force would rise to challenge him for these resources.

Alexander Durand, you protected me as I grew up. I won't let your death go unavenged.

......

Julian Roscente watched from afar as Evelyn left with Nathan in the car.

He stood rooted in place, his emotions in turmoil. Had she seen through him again?

"Julian, Evelyn is just a country girl. What does she know about antiques? Don't take her too seriously. Last time was probably just a fluke."

"Your father poured his heart into this antique collection. How could someone as young as her know more than him? Don't let her careless words ruin all his hard work."

Julian's father was obsessed with antique collecting, having built his fortune on it. His businesses often intersected with Adrian Valentine's dealings.

Julian took a deep breath and gave Isabella a meaningful look. "You're right, Isabella. Evelyn might just be spouting nonsense. How could she compare to a refined lady like you? Among the socialites, you stand out the most. No wonder you and Adrian make such a perfect match."

His gaze swept over her, laced with hidden meaning.

Isabella frowned at him.

Julian chuckled. "Look at you—such a skilled actress, so cultured, with impeccable taste. When's the wedding? I've already prepared the gift money."

Isabella sensed the sarcasm in his words, yet each sentence sounded flattering, leaving her no room to argue.

Adrian Valentine understood Julian's intentions perfectly—he was fishing for information from Isabella.
###Chapter 168

Adrian Valentine saw right through Julian Roscente's intentions the moment he spoke.

"Since when do you meddle in other people's affairs?" Adrian shot him a dangerous sidelong glance.

Julian shrugged and tactfully changed the subject. "Vincent Ashcroft is returning tomorrow. How about a reunion?"

At the mention of Vincent's name, Adrian's expression shifted slightly. This was the brother-in-arms who had gone abroad to handle a corporate crisis.

"Tomorrow night," Adrian replied curtly.

As Julian walked away, Isabella Langley studied his retreating figure with narrowed eyes.

"Adrian, do you think Julian is really interested in Evelyn?" she asked with feigned innocence. "He's changed so much this past year."

Adrian watched Julian disappear into the distance, his gaze turning icy. He couldn't shake the feeling that his old friend was drifting further away.

Isabella's heart twisted at his silence. Adrian's eyes never held the same fiery intensity for her as they did for Evelyn.

The thought of Julian pursuing Evelyn ignited a dark spark in her eyes.

What's life without a little competition?

Evelyn, I'll destroy everything you desire.

Everything you possess will be mine.

She would make Evelyn experience the most excruciating betrayal imaginable.

After ending the call with Adrian, Isabella dialed Cassandra Valentine's number.

"Isabella!" Cassandra's cheerful voice rang out. "What goodies did you bring me this time?"

"A limited edition white handbag. When are you coming back?" Isabella's tone was affectionate.

Over the past year, she had showered Cassandra and her mother with gifts, securing their unwavering loyalty.

"Tomorrow!" Cassandra exclaimed excitedly.

"Oh," Isabella added casually, "I ran into Evelyn at the club tonight. Julian mentioned wanting to pursue her."

"That bitch doesn't deserve him!" Cassandra exploded. "I'll teach her a lesson!"

Isabella smiled in satisfaction. "Vincent's welcome banquet is at the Imperial Palace Hotel tomorrow night. A rare opportunity."

Cassandra immediately caught her meaning. "Don't worry, Isabella. I know exactly what to do. I've worked so hard all these years to be worthy of Julian."

Isabella pretended to dissuade her. "Don't do anything reckless. I'd hate to see you get hurt."

As she hung up, a triumphant smirk curved her lips. The lovesick fool had taken the bait perfectly.
###Chapter 169

Cassandra Valentine held her phone with a sweet smile curling her lips. "Isabella, thanks for the heads-up. That Evelyn Roland is such a shameless woman. First, my brother dumps her, and now she's throwing herself at Julian Roscente. How desperate can she be to climb the social ladder?"

"Don't worry, I won't do anything reckless. Thanks for the bag you sent me. See you tomorrow!"

"See you!" Isabella Langley hung up, her face twisting into a sneer.

Evelyn was a complete failure—everyone despised her except the old lady.

Ever since Adrian Valentine got together with Isabella, the entire Valentine family had welcomed her with open arms.

Margaret Valentine, in particular, treated her like a daughter. Not only did she give her a black card with unlimited spending, but she also sent her limited-edition designer clothes every season.

According to the servants at the Valentine estate, Margaret had never bought Evelyn a single thing.

How pathetic Evelyn's life was.

At the same time...

Inside a private lounge at a bar, Margaret Valentine sipped red wine alone after seeing off a client.

Her assistant, Jonathan Savigny, entered and locked the door behind him. His gaze burned as it landed on Eleanor Langley, who sat elegantly with her wineglass.

"You're breathtaking, Eleanor." Jonathan slid onto the couch beside her, his arm snaking around her waist.

Eleanor leaned into him, her red lips curving. "Bold of you. Aren't you afraid someone might see?"

She adored this man, several years her junior. He knew how to please her far better than Vincent Langley ever had.

Jonathan's hands wandered. Despite nearing fifty, Eleanor's skin remained as taut as a woman in her thirties.

"Eleanor..." He captured her lips in a heated kiss.

Fueled by alcohol, Eleanor responded with equal passion.

Soon, the lounge was filled with the sounds of their entanglement.

Afterward, Jonathan tenderly adjusted her clothes.

Eleanor lounged against him lazily, her voice laced with warning. "Behave in public. If Vincent finds out, your entire family will pay the price."

Jonathan brushed his lips against hers. "I'd die for you. I became your assistant all those years ago because I was already obsessed with you."

He pulled out his phone and played a video.

"Look. Adrian still cares about his ex-wife. Evelyn stormed out of that private room—any man can guess what happened."

Eleanor's eyes locked onto Evelyn's striking face, jealousy twisting inside her.

"Leak this to the press. Say Evelyn seduced Isabella's fiancé. That way, Isabella's past schemes against her will seem justified."

Jonathan hesitated. "But this would expose Isabella as the other woman..."

"Are you threatening Adrian?" Eleanor cut him off with a cold laugh. "He fell for Isabella at first sight. He tossed Evelyn aside like trash. Your idea is idiotic."
###Chapter 170

Jonathan Savigny couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

But Adrian Valentine had been separated from Isabella for over a year now. Maybe he was overthinking it.

"I heard Adrian recently secured a multi-billion-dollar eco-resort project," Jonathan remarked casually.

Eleanor Langley rose gracefully. "It's too early to discuss partnerships. I should head back. You handle the press release—I might lose my composure in the car."

She forced herself to stay composed.

Jonathan smirked knowingly.

Eleanor shot him a glare.

"The site borders Sterling Manor. They'll be co-developing," he added.

"This could be a lucrative opportunity for our company."

He wrapped his arms around her from behind, resting his chin on her shoulder. "Stay tonight. Vincent will be up all night studying those maps."

"Still not satisfied?" His voice dropped to a husky murmur.

Eleanor's cheeks flushed. "The villa, then. But I must return before dawn. Release the statement first."

Jonathan's grin widened. "Agreed."

——

Evelyn Roland arrived home to find her twins playing on the playmat.

Her grandfather had dropped them off early after visiting friends.

"Mommy!"

Felicia scrambled toward her, giggling. Tristan waved quietly.

"Gabrielle's here," Evelyn noted, spotting the open medical journal.

She dropped her bag and swept both children into a fierce embrace, covering them with kisses.

"What are you researching now?" She nodded at the notebook.

Gabrielle Flores held it up. "I'm documenting cognitive differences between gifted infants and neurotypical children."

These two surpassed even Evelyn's IQ levels.

The elder twin exhibited startling analytical precision.

Felicia, though brilliant, had boundless energy—even in sleep.

Her intense focus and rapid reactions could shake the roof during playtime.

"How so?" Evelyn asked, equal parts hopeful and apprehensive.
###Chapter 171

Gabrielle's eyes sparkled as she spoke of this.

She flipped open her notebook with practiced ease, words tumbling out in excitement. "Evelyn, their memory is just like yours—photographic. When I taught them colors, they remembered instantly. Next time they saw black and red, both Ethan and Sophia pointed correctly without hesitation."

"Their observation skills are exceptional too. Ethan fixates on black toys, while Sophia waves her arms wildly at anything red."

"But their reasoning ability?" Gabrielle raised a finger triumphantly. "I showed them a puzzle twice. The third time? They turned away—already mastered it."

Evelyn paused while wiping Sophia's drool. "That impressive?"

"Wait, there's more." Gabrielle leaned in. "Their focus is terrifyingly strong—exactly like you as a child. Oh, and the curiosity! Remember how you grilled everyone about roosters and hens—"

Evelyn's ears burned. "Must you bring up ancient history?"

Gabrielle muffled a laugh. "Because the whole family was in stitches while you deadpanned those questions."

"Focus." Evelyn squeezed her daughter's plump hand. "Are you saying they'll surpass me?"

"Beyond that." Gabrielle shook her head. "Natural talent needs nurturing. Their genes are superior, plus my months of conditioning—their physical development outpaces peers."

A premonition of dethronement prickled Evelyn.

Right on cue, Gabrielle declared: "The smartest Roland is about to be dethroned!"

Sophia chose that moment to smack Evelyn's cheek with a soft "Mwah!"

"Darling?" Evelyn looked down.

Her daughter puckered up, planting a sloppy kiss.

"Adorable!" Evelyn melted, showering the baby with kisses.

Not to be outdone, Ethan yanked her shoulder demanding equal attention.

"Alright, alright." Evelyn alternated kisses, heart swelling.

Gabrielle watched sourly. "You should marvel at their genius, not just cuteness."

"Speaking of," she added seriously, "your birth parents must have remarkable genes. You always outpaced everyone effortlessly—our idol growing up."

Evelyn wiped Ethan's saliva off her face. "Nonsense. Your medical skills long surpassed mine."

"Never you." Gabrielle reached for the twins. "Go shower. I'll play with them."

Both babies squirmed toward Evelyn, faces scrunching in protest.

Gabrielle pouted. "After all my care..."

Laughing, Evelyn headed to the bathroom. These two kept her too busy for thoughts of Adrian Valentine.

Men? She had far greater priorities now.
###Chapter 172

Time could heal all wounds—except for Adrian Valentine. He remained the unhealed scar etched deep in her heart.

The sound of running water in the bathroom ceased.

Evelyn stepped out, drying her damp hair.

At half past nine, the clock chimed, signaling bedtime for the children.

After seeing Gabrielle off, she had tucked them in alone.

The little ones drifted into sleep effortlessly, but rest eluded her.

Tonight's unexpected encounter with Adrian was a thorn lodged in her chest.

Moonlight streamed through the window, casting a pale glow across the ceiling. She stared blankly at it.

The memory of his domineering kiss resurfaced, twisting her stomach with disgust and hatred.

His betrayal had been a blunt knife, carving into her heart inch by excruciating inch.

"Haah..." She forced herself to stop dwelling on it.

Her phone buzzed abruptly.

A message from Nathan: [Sis, check the news.]

Frowning, she tapped open the trending headlines.

[Evelyn Roland, Aldridge Group Assistant, Caught Seducing Adrian Valentine, CEO of Valentine Corp]

Accompanying the article was a crystal-clear photo of Adrian dragging her into the private room.

The comments section had exploded.

[So Isabella was framed. This woman has no shame.]

[Homewrecker! How dare she compete with my goddess?]

[Trash like her should get out of Vienna!]

Her fingers turned icy. Without hesitation, she dialed Adrian's number.

Adrian lay in their former marital home.

Since Evelyn left, sleep had abandoned him.

He had just closed his eyes on the couch when the jarring ringtone shattered the silence.

An unknown number flashed on the screen. Compelled by some unseen force, he answered.

"Adrian Valentine." Evelyn's voice was laced with frost. "Was tonight's spectacle just to whitewash Isabella's reputation?"

He bolted upright.

Her call was unexpected—but her accusation even more so.

"Believe what you want," he replied, his tone dangerously languid.

Her chest tightened.

What sin had she committed in a past life to deserve this?

"Do you really need to drive me into a corner?" Her nails dug into her palms.

Adrian chuckled darkly. "My demand is simple—disappear forever." His knuckles whitened. "Evelyn, if you dare lay a finger on Isabella, I won't hesitate to eliminate you myself."

That cryptic "I'm very good at killing" left her bewildered.

But the divorce was final. She should have let go long ago.

Drawing a shaky breath, she asked the question she already knew the answer to—knowing it would only wound her further.

"Adrian," her voice trembled, "even if it was all just a game to you... must you be so merciless?"
###Chapter 173

Adrian Valentine had just stepped off the plane when Evelyn Roland's call came through. His finger hovered over the screen for a fraction too long.

"Evelyn, what's left between us besides hatred?" His voice was gravelly with exhaustion.

On the other end, Evelyn stood by the crib, tracing her daughter's soft cheek. His accusation tightened around her chest like a vise.

"Tomorrow I'll release evidence of Isabella's contract killing." Her tone was eerily calm.

A tiny coo broke the silence.

Adrian's breath hitched. That infant sound shattered his carefully constructed walls like a blade.

"Is there a child with you?"

"Just the TV." She ended the call abruptly, tossing the phone onto the sofa.

Staring at the darkened screen, Adrian remembered the tiny bundle curled in the hospital corridor. Mechanically, he opened trending news—every tabloid showed paparazzi shots of him dragging Evelyn into a private room.

Victor Ashcroft's call interrupted. "Sir, shall we suppress the headlines?"

"Find who's behind this."

"The Langley media conglomerate broke the story."

Adrian dialed Isabella directly. Her chirpy greeting made his jaw clench.

"Adrian!"

"Lost your damn mind?" His laugh was icy. "Evelyn has proof you ordered a hit, yet you provoke her?"

Her voice trembled. "It wasn't me—"

"Victor traced the leak to your family." He hurled his phone across the room.

The floor lamp cast amber light over the unchanged living room. This time last year, Evelyn had curled on this very couch reading scripts, her hair spilling across his palm.

Memories flooded him—the flutter of her lashes when she stood on tiptoe to kiss him, the blush creeping up her ears as she whispered endearments, the faint teeth marks she left on his shoulder when angry.

Adrian downed a burning gulp of whiskey. The alcohol scorched his throat but couldn't extinguish the fire in his chest.

Evelyn had loved Alexander Durand. That truth burned fiercer than any liquor, charring him from the inside out.
###Chapter 174

Isabella Langley slammed her phone onto the couch.

She stared at the darkened screen, her chest heaving.

Adrian Valentine had hung up on her again.

Ever since Evelyn Roland reappeared, Adrian had grown increasingly distant.

Their marriage, a picture of perfection to outsiders, was crumbling from within.

"Adrian Valentine, don't push me," she hissed through clenched teeth as she stood.

The photos circulating online fueled her rage.

Adrian had publicly held Evelyn's hand.

She strode to the wine cabinet and pulled out a bottle of vintage Bordeaux.

The cork refused to budge. She dialed her driver.

Warren Garten entered still damp from his shower.

His gray robe hung loosely around his waist, revealing a toned chest.

At thirty-five, the man exuded mature magnetism.

Isabella's gaze lingered on him for a beat too long.

"Open this," she ordered, gesturing to the wine.

Warren picked up the corkscrew, his slender fingers working deftly.

"Because of the trending scandal?" His voice was husky.

A shiver ran down her spine.

She hadn't considered the danger of being alone with him this late.

He poured two glasses and handed her one.

"Isabella," he murmured.

She downed the wine in one gulp.

"My father's collection never disappoints." She narrowed her eyes. "Evelyn knows about that incident."

Warren's hands stilled.

He drained his glass, his gaze burning into her.

"Don't worry." He stepped closer, his arm snaking around her waist. "She won't get the chance to talk."

Isabella melted into his embrace.

"Warren," she whispered, venom dripping from her words, "I want Evelyn Roland dead."
###Chapter 175

Warren's lips curled into a cold smirk as his gaze lingered on Isabella's flushed face. A single glass of red wine had painted her cheeks pink, her eyes glazed with intoxication.

"Isabella, opportunities always come." His slender fingers lifted her chin, his voice a low murmur. "Do you really love Adrian that much?"

Without hesitation, she nodded. "He's the most captivating man I've ever met. I want no one else."

She remembered the first time she saw Adrian—standing bathed in sunlight, one glance was all it took to fall for him. Later, with some behind-the-scenes help, she finally got close to him.

A shadow flickered in Warren's eyes. That enigmatic man didn't deserve Isabella.

He leaned in, his breath hot against her ear.

Isabella shivered, her voice trembling. "Warren, what are you doing?"

Her eyes held conflicted emotions—fear and anticipation intertwined.

Warren traced his thumb along her soft cheek, smiling meaningfully. "I know you're lonely. Let me keep you company."

She clenched her fists, biting her lip. "No..."

"Every time we're in the car together, your scent drives me wild." He pulled her into his arms, burying his face in the curve of her neck.

Her body went weak, melting against him.

Warren smiled in satisfaction. Her resistance was paper-thin.

"I'm Adrian's woman. How dare you touch me?" she protested coyly.

His eyes darkened as his fingers wandered. "Little temptress."

He captured her lips in a kiss, and she half-heartedly reciprocated.

The desire of a mature man ignited instantly.

Thinking of Adrian's cold indifference over the past year, resentment surged in Isabella's heart. Finally, she wrapped her arms around Warren's firm waist.

He was ecstatic. After a year of waiting, he finally had her.

Seeing her pliant submission, his last shred of restraint vanished.

The sound of tearing fabric pierced the silent room...

The next morning, Evelyn was preparing breakfast for her two children when Nathan called, asking about the online PR strategy.

Only then did she remember her interrupted call with Adrian the night before. She picked up a dumpling and replied calmly, "Release the footage of Isabella hiring a hitman."

It was the plan she and Adrian had agreed on.

"Understood." Nathan was about to hang up when Isabella's call flashed on Evelyn's screen.

"Wait." Evelyn stopped him. "Isabella's calling. Let's hear what she has to say."

Nathan warned immediately, "Boss, don't go soft this time."

Evelyn chuckled. "When have I ever gone soft?"

"Every time it involves Adrian, you—" Nathan hung up mid-sentence.

Shaking her head, Evelyn fed her daughter a spoonful of rice porridge and answered the other call.

"Hello."

"Evelyn! I'll clarify the online rumors myself." Isabella's voice was frantic. "As for what you're accusing me of, it's pure slander! If you dare spread lies, we'll go down together!"

"Adrian will clear my name!" she shrieked hysterically.
###Chapter 176

Evelyn knew this wasn't the right moment to sever ties.

"Fine. As long as you clear this up, I'll hold off on releasing the video of you hiring a hitman."

Her response was crisp and decisive.

The line went dead—Isabella had already hung up.

Valentine Group CEO's Office.

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, gilding the entire space.

Isabella stared at the devastatingly handsome man behind the desk, her nails digging into her palms as she recalled last night's betrayal.

"Adrian, just make up any excuse. Evelyn will believe you."

She was certain he'd help her.

The lingering soreness made it hard to sit still.

Yet after over a year of emptiness, last night had finally sated her.

Adrian lounged in his leather chair, long fingers tapping the desk.

"Isabella, if you want my help, tell me who leaked those photos."

His deep voice carried a hypnotic edge.

Her pupils constricted. After a year together, she recognized that dangerous look.

"My mother. Her assistant saw you pulling Evelyn into that private room. She lost her temper."

She'd called her mother an idiot at breakfast when she found out.

Adrian's captivating peach-blossom eyes narrowed, frost flashing in their depths.

So it was Eleanor.

This family was truly revolting.

Suppressing his disgust, he said coldly, "Leave. I'll handle it."

Isabella bit her lip, the pain forcing her to retreat.

"Adrian, I'm attending Vincent's welcome banquet tonight. Gabrielle's returning today—we made plans."

She had to witness the spectacle.

At the mention of Vincent's sharp tongue, Adrian's gaze darkened. "Victor will pick you up."

Her face lit up. "I knew you'd take care of me."

Pausing, she added, "Get that video from Evelyn. Teach her a lesson."

Silence.

Her heart sank. Her mother had said true love meant unconditional protection.

"If you deny the affair, Evelyn can't fight alone. I won't be labeled a homewrecker."

With tearful eyes, she left.

The moment the door closed, murderous intent flooded Adrian's expression.

He pressed the intercom. "Victor. Now."

His assistant entered, smiling brightly. "You called, sir?"
###Chapter 177

Adrian Valentine's voice was icy. "Issue a statement. Evelyn wasn't feeling well. I merely escorted her back to her room."

Victor Ashcroft frowned. "Sir, the entire internet is accusing Mrs. Roland of seducing you. The hashtag is trending. Who would believe such an explanation?"

Adrian whirled around. "Where were you last night?"

Victor squared his shoulders. "You ordered me to monitor the Langleys, remember?" He produced an encrypted drive. "Congratulations. Your fiancée Isabella was caught with her chauffeur. Consider this my gift to you."

Adrian recoiled in disgust. "Get that out of my sight! Keep it for later. Handle the situation now."

At the door, Victor turned back. "Sure you don't want to watch? Miss Langley was walking funny today."

"Get out!" Adrian roared.

Victor chuckled as he left.

Finally, some payback.

He'd endured enough this past year.

Poor Mrs. Roland, discarded just like that.

Adrian stood before the floor-to-ceiling windows, his silhouette rigid and solitary.

......

Thirty minutes later.

The official Valentine Group account posted:
[Miss Roland required medical assistance. I simply ensured her safe return. Speculation is unwarranted.]

The terse statement ignited debate.

Some believed it. Others didn't.

Evelyn remained indifferent.

She studied her phone screen, long lashes veiling her emotions.

Nathan Aldridge sat across from her, teeth clenched. "Sis, that bastard Adrian! Weren't we supposed to teach them a lesson? Let me take care of him."

Evelyn lifted her gaze. "Murder is illegal."

"So we just let it go?" Nathan's knuckles cracked.

"The NovaCore project is resolved. Next is the raw materials issue for Botanica." Evelyn changed the subject.

Nathan rolled his eyes.

Boss still couldn't bring herself to act.

Her phone vibrated.

A message from Scarlett Orlando: [Sweetheart, come see me?]

Evelyn smiled faintly. [Sick or injured?]

Scarlett: [Brat! Four years apart and you can't visit first? Our friendship's hanging by a thread!]

Evelyn: [Fine. On my way.]

She pocketed her phone, anticipating a possible encounter with Isabella and Adrian.
###Chapter 178

Evelyn took a deep breath and stood up, patting Nathan's shoulder.

"Nathan, you've worked hard these past four years. I'm taking a vacation. The company is in your hands now."

She smiled. "I'll gift you a villa by year-end as a reward."

Money held no appeal for Nathan.

He thrived on impossible challenges.

What truly grated on him was having to weigh every word as CEO.

This stifling existence was driving him mad.

"Boss, send me on a mission instead. Sophia and I make a great team. I can't stand staring at financial reports all day."

Evelyn suddenly gripped his shoulder tightly.

"Foolish boy. Since when does anyone get to do only what they love?" Her voice softened. "I detest office work too, yet here I am."

She coaxed him like a child, her smile disarming.

Nathan exhaled in resignation.

Her gentle persuasion always broke his resolve.

Thirty days a month, he loathed coming to work.

But next month might bring deliverance.

The thought of Sophia's thrilling missions abroad made the mountain of files before him unbearable.

With a defeated sigh, he trudged toward his desk.

Evelyn arrived at C.Y Media headquarters.

Her entrance caused an immediate stir in the lobby.

The receptionist recognized her instantly, eyes flashing with hostility.

"Ms. Roland, you're not welcome here."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Excuse me?"

Being barred from her own company was unexpected.

The receptionist was Isabella Langley's devoted fan.

"How dare you show your face after seducing someone's fiancé? Ms. Langley would be disgusted by your shamelessness!"

Evelyn's gaze turned glacial. "Is this how you treat guests?"

"Women like you deserve no courtesy!"

The receptionist lifted her chin, already imagining Isabella's approval.

A crowd gathered, whispers rippling through the lobby.

"That's the Langley family's adopted daughter who went after her sister's man..."

"Mr. Valentine denied it, but who believes that..."

Evelyn's piercing stare silenced the speaker.

The woman recoiled involuntarily.

A cold smile played on Evelyn's lips.

There was history indeed—just not the kind they imagined.

Then, amidst the crowd, she spotted a familiar figure.
###Chapter 179

Evelyn's gaze turned icy.

She immediately spotted Isabella hiding in the corner.

Isabella flashed her a smug smile.

Most employees in this building had been bribed by her.

Adrian had purchased this office tower a year ago, with his workspace just next door.

Recently plagued by negative press, last night's scandal had conveniently helped clear her name.

Advertisers who had planned to terminate contracts were now crawling back with apologies.

She had returned mid-journey to sign a new deal.

She never expected to hear such a response.

Adrian's statement had made his stance clear.

But public opinion had already shifted.

Her goal was achieved.

Not only had these people humiliated Evelyn, but she had also kept her promise not to expose that incident.

Warren would find a way to retrieve the encrypted drive.

When the time came, she would make Evelyn pay.

"Get out! You don't belong here."

The receptionist, emboldened by the crowd's hostility, grew even more arrogant.

"Miss Roland, did you seduce Mr. Valentine out of jealousy for Isabella?"

A reporter suddenly shoved forward with the question.

Evelyn's lips curved slightly. "What does the Langley family have to do with me?"

Her eyes sharpened. "They never raised me for a single day. My name isn't even on their family register."

The reporter was left speechless.

"Mr. Valentine has already clarified the rumors. Are you still spreading lies?"

The reporter had no retort.

Evelyn lowered her head and sent Nathan a message.

She demanded this receptionist be fired immediately.

"Still not leaving?" The receptionist sneered.

Evelyn scoffed. "Who do you think you are?"

"I'm the receptionist here! Trash like you shouldn't even step inside!"

"Exactly." Evelyn's gaze turned razor-sharp. "Someone as unprofessional as you should be thrown out."

"How dare you insult me?"

Slap!

A sharp crack echoed through the lobby.

The receptionist clutched her cheek, eyes wide with disbelief.

"You hit me?"
###Chapter 180

The manager rushed over with security guards in tow.

"Ms. Roland, this reflects poorly on my management." Beads of sweat formed on his forehead. "I'll handle this immediately."

The receptionist turned pale. "Manager, I only—"

"Silence!" The manager cut her off sharply. "Pack your things and leave now."

Her legs trembled. She'd schemed relentlessly to land this job—all to snag a wealthy husband.

"Why fire me?" She pointed accusingly at Evelyn. "A woman like her doesn't even deserve—"

The manager's expression darkened.

Mr. Aldridge had made it clear: anyone who harassed his assistant would be blacklisted across Vienna.

"Keep talking, and I'll ensure you never work in this industry again."

The receptionist finally grasped the gravity of her mistake. Sobbing, she fled.

"Who were you here to see, Ms. Roland?" The manager forced a smile.

Evelyn replied coldly, "It's unnecessary now."

She turned toward the elevators, catching Adrian Valentine's silhouette in her periphery.

A sharp pang struck her chest.

Then—nothing.

Don't be foolish, Evelyn, she chided herself silently.

The elevator doors parted. She stepped inside without glancing back, never meeting Adrian's gaze.

Adrian remained rooted in place, his knuckles whitening.

"Adrian!" Isabella Langley's saccharine voice rang out.

She latched onto his arm, her cloying perfume enveloping them.

Adrian's brow twitched imperceptibly. "Why are you here?"

"Contract signing." She preened. "All those companies that canceled are begging to rehire me now."

He extracted his arm. "Victor will take you home."

"Perfect." Isabella giggled. "Don't be late picking me up for tonight's gala."

As the elevator doors closed, she pondered Evelyn's unexpected appearance.

Adrian watched her leave. Nearby employees scattered, avoiding his stormy expression.

"Fetch Vincent first," he suddenly told Victor. "Then retrieve Isabella."

Victor arched a brow. "And you?"

Adrian ignored the question, lowering his voice. "Did you locate Evelyn's address?"
###Chapter 181

Victor's expression was grave as he reported, "Mr. Valentine, I've searched Vienna for anyone named Evelyn Roland. There's no trace of your wife."

"The only possibility is that she's living in employee housing under Sterling Manor. Those residences don't require personal registration."

"Moreover, she's always transported by private chauffeurs. Last year it was a female driver. Now it's this man."

Victor handed over his phone, displaying Zachary Deross—the same man they'd seen at the hospital.

Adrian's gaze turned icy. Why were there always handsome men around her?

"Keep digging. I need her exact address."

Adrian turned away, his rigid shoulders radiating suppressed fury.

Victor sighed inwardly. Wasn't he the one who'd insisted on driving her away? Now he's desperate to find her.

The man simply couldn't swallow his pride.

Served him right.

Humming a tune, Victor headed to his meeting.

Then he froze mid-step.

Today's agenda? The real estate collaboration with Sterling Manor.

He grabbed his hair in frustration.

Mocking the boss felt great—until you remembered who signed your paychecks.

......

Evelyn circled Scarlett's studio twice before locating the entrance.

She didn't notice Adrian trailing behind her.

Finding the door ajar, she pushed inside.

"Evelyn!" Scarlett launched herself at her friend, arms wide. Snacks covered the worktable.

Evelyn gasped for air in the crushing hug. "Trying to kill your best friend?"

"Try these lemon chicken feet! I saved them just for you." Scarlett thrust forward chopsticks like presenting treasure.

Evelyn wrinkled her nose. "Do you know how many miles I'd have to run to burn one of these off?"

"I've gained two kilos!"

Scarlett waved a dismissive hand. "Food first, diets later."

Surveying the calorie-laden spread, Evelyn's scalp prickled.

"Scarlett, you'll lose me this way."

"Nonsense!" Scarlett shoved a cake slice into her hands. "We get fat together, we get pretty together."

Evelyn took a reluctant bite. "You're dragging me down with you."

"Naturally!" Scarlett's eyes sparkled. "You'll be my maid of honor, and I'll be yours!"

Evelyn suddenly set down her fork. "Did Sebastian mention when he's returning from abroad?"

Scarlett's smile vanished instantly.
###Chapter 182

Evelyn raised an eyebrow at Scarlett, noticing her red-rimmed eyes. The memory of that drunken night flashed through her mind, tightening her chest.

"Scarlett, he won't be coming back this year."

She studied Scarlett's reaction carefully.

"Oh." Scarlett lowered her head, her voice muffled.

That bastard. He actually isn't coming back.

"Evelyn, I want to sing. Acting for so long... I can't tell reality from fiction anymore. I need a change."

Evelyn watched her intently. It was natural for feelings to develop between her brother and Scarlett after frequent contact.

Five years away. Four years was enough to change everything.

Matters of the heart weren't something outsiders could interfere with.

"Scarlett, do whatever you want. If singing is what you desire, Nathan will arrange it. The company will fully support you."

Scarlett was brilliant—her talent alone had secured her place in the entertainment industry.

"Mhm. Evelyn, no work talk today. Have dinner with me tonight."

She gnawed on a chicken claw, completely disregarding her A-list actress image.

She'd nearly developed an eating disorder from extreme dieting for a role. After a grueling year of filming, she'd been craving this for ages.

Evelyn blinked. "You're eating so much now. Will you even have room for dinner?"

"Of course. Come shopping with me later. What have you been up to? You never have time for me anymore."

Scarlett finished the chicken claw and reached for a slice of cake.

She was already wealthy beyond measure, yet she still pushed herself so hard.

"Working on the cosmetics line. The moisturizer I sent you last year was my own formula. I'm planning mass production and patent applications."

"Evelyn, that stuff is amazing! Look how soft and smooth my skin is." Scarlett stroked her cheek with a silly, self-satisfied grin.

Evelyn laughed. "You..."

"By the way, about last night's scandal... Don't you have anything to say? Why did Adrian hold your hand?"

That was the real reason she'd asked to meet today. Evelyn had changed so much in these years apart.

"Evelyn, I know about Alexander's death—"

"Scarlett!" Evelyn cut her off sharply, pain flashing in her eyes.

Scarlett's expression softened with sympathy.

"Okay, okay, I won't bring it up. Then tell me—what's going on between you and Adrian? Why did he pull you like that?"

Evelyn stayed silent.

"Is it that hard to answer?" Scarlett tilted her head.

Something was off. The moment Adrian was mentioned, Evelyn's entire demeanor shifted.

"Don't tell me he's fallen for our Evelyn?"

Evelyn scoffed. "Why would he ever fall for me? There was a misunderstanding between us. It's been resolved."

"Then it must be Isabella stirring trouble. Adrian's business has thrived these past two years—how could he possibly be interested in that scheming hypocrite?"

"Even I can't stand Isabella's antics in the industry."

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly. She lowered her gaze to hide her emotions. "Love blinds people. Even the worst person becomes perfect in their lover's eyes."

Scarlett set down the cake, finally full.

"What do you mean?" she asked bluntly.

Evelyn sighed. "Love sees no faults."

Scarlett burst out laughing. "Alright, fine. But I didn't invite you to dinner just for fun."

Evelyn perked up. "What's the real reason?"
###Chapter 183

Scarlett Orlando elegantly pulled out a tissue, meticulously wiping her fingertips.

She pursed her crimson lips, revealing an enigmatic smile.

"Blind date!"

Evelyn Roland's eyes widened. "..."

"Blind date?!" She stared at her friend in disbelief. "Scarlett, you're a singer, not a matchmaker."

"Who says singers can't play Cupid?" Scarlett blinked. "My brother's back from abroad. He insisted on seeing you."

She counted on her fingers. "Handsome, wealthy, gentle, and most importantly—loyal."

Resting her chin in her palm, Scarlett sighed dreamily. "Marrying him would be like winning the cosmic lottery."

Evelyn chuckled at her theatrics. Sebastian Orlando was exceptional, but—

"Pass on Sebastian."

"Come on!" Scarlett grabbed her hand. "He won't take no for an answer. Humor me. Sparks might fly."

Her expression turned serious. "Alexander's been gone five years. It's time to move on."

Evelyn shook her head. "My single status has nothing to do with him. He fell in love at seventeen and never wavered—not even till death."

Scarlett's eyes widened, words dying on her lips.

This foolish girl—didn't she realize Alexander had loved her all along?

"Forget it. Shopping trip." Scarlett abruptly changed the subject.

"Wait in the car. I need touch-ups." She wrinkled her nose. "No paparazzi shots of me barefaced."

Evelyn nodded. "Zachary's driving us."

She turned away, missing Adrian Valentine at the corridor's end.

The man's expression darkened as he strode forward.

Just as the elevator doors closed, a long-fingered hand shot through the gap.

Evelyn looked up into fathomless eyes.

"Adrian?"

Without a word, he yanked her into the emergency stairwell.

"Let go!" She struggled.

Adrian pinned her against the wall, gaze burning. "Evelyn? Or should I say, Tru?"

His laugh was icy. "Even your name was a lie. What else is fake?"

The last words were ground out between clenched teeth.
###Chapter 184

Evelyn frowned slightly, studying Adrian's agitated expression. He must have overheard their conversation.

A bitter taste rose in her throat.

Adrian, my love for you was real.

But it meant nothing to you.

"Adrian, whoever I am, our marriage is over," she said calmly. "Evelyn Roland was the name the Langley family gave me."

"I've been using it all these years to investigate Alexander's case."

She chose honesty.

Adrian's Adam's apple bobbed as he rasped, "What's your real name?"

"Evelyn Roland," she whispered.

A cold laugh escaped him, danger flashing in his eyes. "Even your name was a lie. How many more secrets are you hiding?"

"Did you only marry me to investigate Alexander Durand?"

His voice dropped to subzero temperatures.

Evelyn shook her head, gaze steady. "No. These four years, I just wanted to live peacefully. If I'd wanted to use you, you'd have noticed."

"Let the past stay buried."

She turned to leave, pain threatening to spill from her eyes.

Unrequited love hurt too much.

Adrian narrowed his piercing gaze.

Sunlight outlined his perfect profile but couldn't penetrate the shadows in his eyes.

"Evelyn, you lied about everything. How could you say you loved me without blinking?"

He'd heard every word—Alexander was her brother.

That raw grief in her eyes whenever she mentioned him... she probably didn't even recognize it herself.

Evelyn paused mid-step but said nothing, striding toward the elevator.

......

After shopping with Scarlett, Evelyn returned to Sterling Manor to nurse her baby before heading to the Imperial Palace Hotel.

This was where Adrian used to bring her.

She knew his private dining room. With no one cooking at the Valentine estate now, he likely dined here often.

To avoid him, she took the side entrance.

The deserted lobby should have been safe—until she collided with Julian Roscente.

Evelyn suppressed a sigh. Why did she keep running into people she wanted to avoid?

"Evelyn, here for dinner?" Julian approached eagerly.

She retreated half a step. "Meeting friends. Excuse me."

His eyes trailed over her stylish outfit. Since leaving Adrian, her fashion sense had become impeccable.

"Vincent Ashcroft is back tonight. Join us? You know him."

Her expression frosted over at the name. "No need. I wouldn't want to lower the tone of Mr. Ashcroft's welcome party."

Those cruel words from years ago still stung.

A mocking voice cut in from behind: "Well, well. Evelyn Roland learns humility after all these years?"
###Chapter 185

Evelyn Roland cast an icy glance at Vincent Ashcroft's excessively handsome face.

This man excelled at putting on pretenses.

Outwardly charming and suave.

But beneath that facade lurked a cunning, treacherous nature—like a dagger hidden behind a smile, as the old saying went.

She knew Adrian Valentine's inner circle well.

Each had their own agenda. Christian Lefèvre was Adrian's most loyal friend, their bond forged through life-and-death trials.

Not once had they clashed in all these years.

During the divorce, she'd assumed Adrian was grieving Christian's death.

Only later did she realize he'd met his true love—Isabella Langley.

Before slipping into a coma, Christian had sworn her to secrecy about his survival. There was clearly more to the story. She'd been preoccupied with childbirth this past year, unable to investigate.

Now it seemed she needed to look into Christian's affairs.

Isabella and Adrian had arrived with Vincent.

Evelyn's gaze collided with Adrian's. She looked away indifferently.

A glacial glint flashed in Adrian's eyes, sharp as a blade.

Julian Roscente glared at Vincent, brows furrowed. "Vincent, that was uncalled for. I invited Evelyn here. If you disapprove, say so directly—no need for such venom."

Vincent gaped at Julian. "Julian Roscente, I've been gone a year, and you've changed. Weren't you the one who used to sneer at Evelyn, that country girl who only knew how to seduce men? What's this sudden closeness? Has she ensnared you too?"

"Julian, this isn't how brothers treat each other. That woman is Adrian's castoff. Someone gentle and virtuous like Isabella is far more suited to him."

As for Evelyn...

An unattainable alpine rose, born to lowly origins, forever wearing that frigid expression.

The sight of her disgusted him.

Julian's voice turned thunderous. "Vincent, you—"

Didn't he realize how cruel those words were?

These spoiled heirs loved gossiping about others. He suddenly felt sick of himself.

Evelyn gave Vincent a cool once-over. "Vincent, there's a difference between having a foul mouth and lacking basic decency."

"Also, my origins are none of your concern. My life isn't yours to dictate. The Ashcrofts are mere second-tier aristocrats—wealthy but morally bankrupt. You've looked down on me from the start, treating me as your plaything. I won't forget this... hospitality."

With that icy retort, she turned on her heel just as the elevator arrived.

Julian hurried after her.

Evelyn's eyes turned arctic. "Get lost."

Julian froze. Her gaze held a murderous edge he'd never seen before. She blocked the elevator doors. "Evelyn, I—"

Isabella watched Julian chase after Evelyn, jealousy twisting her insides.

Julian used to orbit around her.

She'd never allow Evelyn to steal what was rightfully hers.

She stepped forward. "Julian, you can't possibly fancy Evelyn? You're Adrian's friend. If you pursue his ex—"

"Isabella, watch your tongue. I'm pursuing Evelyn of my own volition. Adrian divorced her—what ties remain between them?"

"Besides, what gives you the right to meddle in my affairs?"

After delivering this scathing rebuke, Julian entered the elevator.

Isabella burned with humiliation. Never had Julian treated her this way.

"Adrian..."

Adrian shot her a frosty glance. She immediately fell silent.
###Chapter 186

Evelyn's eyes widened as she stared at Julian. "You want to pursue me?"

Julian scratched his head, his ears turning slightly pink. "Evelyn, could you give me a chance?"

A sudden chill crept up his back before he finished speaking.

Adrian had appeared behind him without warning.

Isabella and Vincent followed them into the elevator.

Evelyn's voice was icy. "Sorry, I have a blind date to attend."

"A blind date?" Julian's expression froze. "Then... can I schedule one with you tomorrow?"

"Not necessary. I wouldn't dare presume." Her tone remained frosty.

Everyone connected to Adrian had once looked down on her.

Her gaze swept past Isabella, recalling what she'd witnessed downstairs that morning.

That receptionist turned out to be Isabella's pawn.

Isabella feigned concern. "Evelyn, who are you meeting? Do your parents know?"

Evelyn smirked. "What do they have to do with me?"

"But—"

"But what?" Evelyn cut her off. "He took me in for one day before sending me away. I repaid him with a diamond map worth hundreds of millions. Isn't that enough?"

"If not for the mix-up, I would've been their cherished princess too. How dare you find joy in my suffering?"

The elevator doors opened. Evelyn strode out without looking back.

Silence filled the elevator.

Julian laughed bitterly. "So our careless words were just rubbing salt in her wounds."

Shaking his head, he exited the elevator with long strides.

His family's business had been struggling lately. Potential partners refused meetings upon hearing his playboy reputation.

Now he finally understood how Evelyn felt.

Vincent scoffed. "Julian's changed."

Adrian remained expressionless. "Let's go."

Isabella discreetly texted Cassandra.

By coincidence, Adrian's private room was next to Evelyn's.

As Evelyn approached her door, Sebastian stepped out to greet her.

Dressed in white, he exuded warmth and refinement.

His delicate features softened with a spring-like smile.

"Sebastian!" Evelyn's eyes curved with joy.

He studied her carefully. "Evelyn, you've grown even more beautiful in five years."

"How have you been abroad?" Her tone brightened.

"Quite well. Come in—I ordered your favorite dishes."

Sebastian naturally took her hand, oblivious to Adrian's group nearby.

Julian stood frozen, his face stricken. "She really came for a blind date!"
###Chapter 187

Adrian Valentine's gaze locked onto Evelyn Roland's direction.

He suddenly realized how long it had been since he last saw her cunning smile.

To outsiders, she was ice-cold.

Only in front of him did she reveal her childlike innocence.

Yet she had never shared the pain in her heart.

Throughout their relationship, she had always worn a mask.

Even when she was responsible for Christian Lefèvre's death.

He had never spoken of it to anyone.

All he wanted was for her to live well.

But watching her prepare to marry another man.

Jealousy was driving him mad.

Isabella Langley noticed Adrian's tension immediately.

"Adrian, Evelyn seems quite taken with that gentleman," she said with feigned innocence.

Inside, she was seething with envy.

Evelyn always attracted such exceptional men.

Vincent Ashcroft scoffed. "She relies on beauty and manipulation, nothing more."

He turned to Isabella.

"I heard you and Adrian have been together over a year. When's the wedding?"

He preferred Adrian marry someone of equal standing.

It would elevate the company further.

Surpassing Sterling Manor within a decade was within reach.

Then even Sebastian Cortez would have to step aside.

If only Christian were still here.

Vincent's hostility toward Evelyn stemmed from her alliance with Sebastian.

His sworn rival.

Isabella lowered her eyes demurely.

"That depends on Adrian's wishes."

Vincent thumped his chest.

"Leave the wedding plans to me. My family specializes in events."

Adrian cut him off coldly.

"Since when did you become so talkative?"

With that, he strode away.

Julian Roscente walked ahead, shoulders slumped.

He regretted how he had treated Evelyn.

His father had authenticated those antiques on his advice.

Every piece was a forgery.

They suspected sabotage.

But the mastermind remained hidden.

Adrian suddenly recalled Evelyn's warning.

"What were the results on those antiques?"

Julian's eyes turned icy.

"All fakes. We lost millions."

Adrian concealed his shock.

Evelyn had been right.

He needed to reassess his ex-wife.

Isabella's heart skipped a beat.

Evelyn truly had that ability.

Identifying counterfeits through a screen.

This woman was more dangerous than she'd imagined.

But Julian would never uncover the truth.

A shadow crossed her eyes.

Passing Evelyn's private room, Adrian hesitated.

Then continued walking.

Isabella was already plotting tonight's scheme.

She would make Julian believe Evelyn had deceived him.

That way Cassandra Valentine could secure the Roscente heir.

Controlling the Roscentes was easier than controlling Adrian.

She quickly messaged Cassandra with the plan.

The reply came instantly.

Agreed.
###Chapter 188

The crystal chandelier cast dazzling reflections across the luxurious private dining room.

Waiters brought in exquisite dishes one after another.

Cassandra Valentine entered gracefully in her high heels.

She had deliberately chosen a champagne-colored dress that made her skin glow like snow.

"Big brother, Julian, Vincent, it's been a while." She greeted them with a radiant smile.

Adrian Valentine frowned slightly. "Not busy with the company anymore?"

"Even busy people need to come home sometimes." Cassandra took a seat beside him. "Do you really dislike seeing me this much?"

"Your comings and goings mean nothing to me." Adrian's voice was icy.

Cassandra's smile froze.

"You've always treated me this way since we were kids." She bit her lip. "What did I ever do wrong?"

"Does hatred need a reason?" Adrian picked up his wine glass.

Vincent Ashcroft smoothly intervened. "Don't take it to heart, Cass. That's just how your brother is."

Isabella Langley gently tugged Adrian's sleeve. "Adrian, she's so lovely."

Adrian abruptly shook her off.

Isabella stumbled back half a step in shock.

"I'm sorry..." Her voice trembled.

Vincent's expression darkened. "Adrian, this dinner is for me."

Adrian swept a cold gaze across the table. "With her here, this meal is ruined."

He stood up, knocking over his wine glass.

Red wine spread like a bloodstain across the white tablecloth.

Cassandra clenched her fists, nails digging deep into her palms.

Julian Roscente silently observed everything without comment.

"I'll treat you alone tomorrow." Adrian said to Vincent before striding out without a backward glance.

The door slammed shut behind him.

Isabella forced a smile to comfort Cassandra. "He's just harsh with his words but soft in his—"

"Don't bother, Isabella." Cassandra gave a bitter laugh. "Only Gregory ever treated me well."

She turned to Vincent. "I'm sorry for ruining your welcome dinner."

Vincent spoke gently. "Don't say that. I'll talk to Adrian."

"Please don't." Cassandra shook her head. "Your interference will only make things worse."

She raised her glass toward Julian. "Let's enjoy this rare gathering. Dinner first."

Crystal glasses clinked with a clear, bright sound.

Everyone wore strained smiles.
###Chapter 189

Julian Roscente gave a slight nod, finding the gathering utterly dull.

"Fine." He had no particular issue with Cassandra Valentine and couldn't be bothered to engage.

But Adrian Valentine was different—his disdain for the Valentine siblings ran deep.

No one knew the exact reason.

His low voice carried a husky edge, unsettlingly alluring.

Cassandra's face brightened with a radiant smile.

She turned to Vincent Ashcroft. "Vincent, I'm sorry about last time. I brought you a gift."

She handed him a limited-edition wristwatch.

Vincent accepted it eagerly, eyes gleaming. "Cass, you're too thoughtful."

After the exchange, the servers began bringing out the dishes. Julian always drank soup before meals.

Cassandra stood to ladle him a bowl of chicken broth.

As she placed the spoon, a transparent pill slipped into the liquid, dissolving instantly.

"Julian, try the soup first. It's very nourishing," she murmured, her voice soft as silk.

Unaware, Julian lowered his head and drank.

Vincent frowned at the sight, but before he could speak, Cassandra had already passed him another bowl. "This one's for you, Vincent."

His expression immediately brightened. "You always know what I like."

Isabella Langley caught the affection in Vincent's gaze and began calculating how to exploit this love triangle.

Glasses clinked throughout the meal, the atmosphere deceptively warm.

Midway through, Julian suddenly winced, beads of sweat forming on his forehead. "Vincent, I don't feel well. I need to get some medicine."

Vincent set down his chopsticks irritably. "Why is everyone leaving? Are we not close anymore?"

Adrian's early departure had already put him in a foul mood.

Julian's face had gone pale. His health had always been impeccable—this sudden, splitting headache was unbearable.

Vincent noticed his distress and frowned.

"You look terrible. I'll take you to the hospital." He stood.

Julian swayed slightly, waving him off. "We'll reschedule."

His vision darkened, his body burning with feverish discomfort.

Seeing her chance, Isabella nudged Cassandra discreetly.

Cassandra immediately followed. "Julian, let me take you."

Julian was already too disoriented to hear.

Vincent moved to chase after them, but Isabella quickly blocked his path.

Just then, a server entered. "Excuse me, this ginseng chicken soup was specially ordered by the lady at the next table for your party."

With that, the server left.

Isabella's face paled. "Vincent, Julian only got sick after drinking the soup. What if she's targeting Adrian next?"

Her voice trembled, eyes glistening with unshed tears.

Vincent stared at Julian's half-finished bowl, suddenly recalling he'd only taken a few sips himself.

"That bitch," he hissed through gritted teeth. "How dare she pull this stunt!"
###Chapter 190

Vincent Ashcroft glared at the soup bowl on the table, his eyes dark with malice. "Isabella, bring this soup. We're confronting Evelyn Roland."

Isabella Langley lowered her lashes, a faint smirk playing on her lips.

Human nature was predictable. Once suspicion took root, it would flourish.

She discreetly dropped a pill into the soup.

This tainted broth would become irrefutable evidence against Evelyn.

Cassandra Valentine would walk away unscathed, while Evelyn bore the brunt of the scandal.

She wanted Evelyn erased from existence.

Vincent's underworld connections could make someone disappear without a trace.

They stormed into the adjacent private dining room.

It was empty.

Isabella froze. "Where is she? Did she flee after Adrian left?"

Vincent frowned and summoned a waiter. "Where are the guests from this room?"

The waiter bowed. "They left abruptly after receiving a phone call without ordering."

Isabella's expression tightened. "Are you certain?"

"Yes, sir. The gentleman departed with his female companion immediately."

Her fists clenched.

Her meticulously laid trap had failed.

Vincent sneered. "She can run, but she can't hide. I'll make her regret crossing Julian Roscente."

He turned to mobilize his men.

Watching his retreating figure, Isabella allowed herself a victorious smile.

The evidence was prepared. Vincent's fury had been successfully redirected.

She carried the soup bowl, following at a leisurely pace.

Vincent suddenly halted. "Isabella, return home. I need to find Julian."

Concern for Cassandra's safety drove him.

She nodded obediently, watching him leave.

Though the plan had deviated, the outcome remained unchanged.

Once Cassandra got what she wanted, she'd be even more indebted to Isabella.

...

Evelyn had just entered the private room when Sebastian Orlando received an urgent call from work.

Scarlett Orlando had deliberately stood them up.

Evelyn urged Sebastian to attend to business first.

Alone in the underground parking garage, she reached for her phone to call a ride.

Strong arms suddenly encircled her from behind.

Hot breath scorched her neck.

She whirled around to meet bloodshot eyes.

"Julian?"

Her fingers flew to his wrist, checking his pulse. Her face paled.

He'd been drugged with a potent aphrodisiac.
###Chapter 191

Evelyn's fingers pressed precisely against Julian's nape. Her other hand swiftly retrieved a black pill from her bag.

"Open your mouth," she commanded.

Julian's Adam's apple bobbed as the pill slid down his throat. His blurred vision finally sharpened.

"Evelyn?" His voice was hoarse, cheeks flushed with unnatural heat.

She ignored his question, gripping his wrist to check his pulse.

Erratic heartbeat. Burning skin.

Her diagnosis was immediate—a potent aphrodisiac.

Julian's ragged breaths filled the space between them. The faint floral scent clinging to Evelyn's skin made his muscles tense.

"Don't move," she warned coldly.

The sharp click of heels echoed in the darkness.

"Useless! Can't even guard one man properly?"

Cassandra's shrill voice exploded from the corridor's end.

Both held their breath.

When the footsteps faded, Evelyn dragged Julian toward the emergency exit.

"To the hospital."

Julian chuckled darkly. "A hotel would be better."

Evelyn froze.

"Fine. I'll deliver you straight to Cassandra then."

Julian's gaze turned predatory. "Evelyn, I only want you."

Zachary's black sedan glided soundlessly to the curb.

As the door shut, Cassandra burst outside just in time to witness it.

"Evelyn!" Her nails dug bloody crescents into her palms.

Vincent emerged from the shadows, draping an arm around her shoulders with false gentleness.

"Patience. I have a plan."

His fingers flew across his phone screen. A cruel smile twisted his lips.

Cassandra leaned into his embrace, venom flashing in her eyes.

Under the hospital's sterile lights, Evelyn watched the nurse insert Julian's IV.

Transparent droplets fell methodically from the infusion bag.

She turned away and dialed a number. "Pull all surveillance footage from tonight's gala."
###Chapter 192

Julian Roscente's consciousness blurred under the drug's influence. Clinging to his last shred of awareness, he dialed his assistant.

"Come... now..." His voice sounded unrecognizably hoarse.

The assistant detected the abnormality and responded immediately.

The phone slipped from Julian's fingers as he succumbed to unconsciousness.

Evelyn Roland picked up the fallen phone from beneath the car seat. Adrian Valentine's name flashed on the screen.

Her finger hovered over the answer button—

Boom!

A deafening crash shattered the night.

A black SUV rammed into their rear bumper.

Evelyn's forehead slammed against the headrest. Darkness clouded her vision.

"Miss Roland!" Zachary Deross twisted around, blood trickling from his temple.

Evelyn shook her head, clearing her sight. "I'm fine. You?"

Zachary wiped the blood away, eyes sharp as daggers. "They're targeting us."

Outside, seven thugs armed with steel pipes advanced.

"Go first, Miss Roland." Zachary unbuckled his seatbelt.

Evelyn retrieved nunchaku from beneath the seat. "Looks like blood will spill tonight."

She tossed Zachary a hemostatic pill. "Take this. No point bleeding out."

Zachary grinned. "An honor to fight alongside you."

Evelyn pushed the door open. The night wind carried danger.

Under the dim streetlight, the lead thug sneered. "Come quietly, sweetheart."

Evelyn flicked her wrist. The nunchaku sliced through air with lethal precision.

"Who sent you?" Her voice turned glacial.

The thugs exchanged glances before attacking simultaneously.

A pipe whistled toward Evelyn's face.

She sidestepped, striking the attacker's wrist with pinpoint accuracy.

"Ahh!" The pipe clattered to the pavement.

Zachary had already incapacitated two opponents with clean moves.

The remaining four thugs grew vicious.

"Looking to die?" One drew a switchblade.

Evelyn's eyes narrowed. Her nunchaku coiled around his wrist like a striking viper.

Crack! The thug collapsed, clutching his broken wrist.

Sirens wailed in the distance.

The remaining attackers paled, turning to flee.

"Leaving so soon?" Evelyn lunged, delivering a flying kick that sent one sprawling.

By the time police lights illuminated the scene, groaning thugs littered the ground.

Evelyn sheathed her nunchaku. "Find out who's behind this," she told Zachary.

Her gaze fell on the still-vibrating phone nearby.

Adrian Valentine's name pulsed insistently on the screen.
###Chapter 193

The alley was blocked by a bald thug with a face full of scars. His massive frame nearly filled the narrow passage, his greasy skin glistening under the streetlight.

"Pretty thing," he sneered, licking his lips as his eyes roamed over Evelyn. "Someone paid good money for us to have some fun with you. Either cooperate for the photos, or..." He dragged out the pause. "You won't be going home tonight."

Evelyn's gaze sharpened. "Who sent you?"

"Tsk, can't say." The man smirked, his beady eyes narrowing. "But you pissed off the wrong people. Walk away from Adrian Valentine, and you might save yourself some pain."

Her heart clenched at the name. Suppressing the surge of emotions, she kept her voice icy. "Was it Vincent Ashcroft?"

The man's expression flickered before twisting back into that revolting grin. "Guess all you want. Either way, you won't leave here in one piece."

Meanwhile, Adrian was speeding toward the GPS location. His knuckles whitened around the steering wheel as call after call went unanswered.

"Boss, five minutes enough?" Zachary appeared beside Evelyn, his nunchaku glinting ominously in the dark.

A cold light flashed in her eyes. "Make it hurt."

Before the words fully left her lips, Zachary lunged like an arrow released from a bow. His nunchaku carved deadly arcs through the air. The thugs barely had time to react before screams tore from their throats.

Evelyn moved like lightning, striking straight for the bald man. Her nunchaku cracked against his shoulder with brutal precision. The two-hundred-pound brute collapsed like a felled tree.

The night wind lifted her hair as she stared down at the writhing man. Her gaze was colder than the darkest winter.
###Chapter 194

The man's pupils contracted violently, his entire body trembling like a leaf. Never in his wildest dreams had he imagined this seemingly fragile orphan possessed such formidable skills.

Evelyn pressed her foot down on his arm, her brow arching slightly before abruptly increasing the pressure. The crisp sound of snapping bones cut through the night air.

"Ah—!" The man let out a pig-like squeal.

"Want more?" Evelyn's voice was colder than a winter night.

Sweat poured down the man's face from the agony, yet he still managed a sneer. "Evelyn Roland, even if you kill me, it won't change the fact that Adrian Valentine rejected you! Tonight, you drugged his food trying to seduce him, but instead, you ended up with Julian Roscente. You filthy—"

"Drugged?" Her gaze turned glacial.

Suddenly, she recalled Julian's strange behavior earlier. So Victor Ashcroft had assumed she was the one who spiked the drink, sending these men to ruin her.

Adrian, who had just stepped out of his car, overheard the accusation, his brow furrowing.

Zachary Deross finished dealing with the other four men and quickly returned to Evelyn's side, whispering, "Boss, Adrian is over there."

Evelyn whirled around, her eyes blazing with fury.

The silver nunchaku in her hand became a streak of lightning, slicing through the air before crashing onto Adrian's shoulder with a resounding thud.

"Ugh!" Adrian grunted, staring at her in disbelief.

She picked up the nunchaku and advanced toward him, her red lips curling into a mocking smile. "You'll stop at nothing to drive me away, won't you?"

"Accusing me of drugging you?" Her voice rose sharply. "You're not even worthy of eating food I ordered. If I want to deal with someone, I do it openly!"

"I tolerated you before out of respect for Beatrice." Her words were measured and icy. "From now on, forget it."

Adrian urgently explained, "I had nothing to do with tonight."

Evelyn paused mid-step, turning back with scorn. "Adrian Valentine, since when did you become such a coward? Even a dog knows you're the one behind this smear campaign!"

"Trying to push me to my death?" A dangerous glint flashed in her eyes. "Even if I die, it won't be for a man like you!"

"Remember this—you're only fit to watch from the sidelines in my world. Dare to cross me again—" The nunchaku spun in her hand with lethal grace. "—and you'll face the consequences."

Adrian's chest ached with realization as he spotted Lin Pang. It was Victor's doing. That idiot actually dared to touch what was his!

Sirens wailed in the distance.

Lin Pang scrambled toward Adrian in panic. "Mr. Valentine! We were just teaching that bitch a lesson for you! You have to help us!"
###Chapter 195

Slap! Zachary Deross lunged forward and struck the man hard across the face.

His eyes filled with disdain. "How dare you insult Evelyn?"

"Using such despicable methods makes you the real disgrace." Zachary sneered. "Enjoy rotting in prison."

He watched with satisfaction as the police car drove away, then turned to Evelyn Roland with a bright smile.

Evelyn got into her car without a backward glance.

Zachary immediately dialed Sebastian Cortez. The CEO had given strict orders—any incident involving Evelyn must be reported immediately.

Adrian Valentine leaned against his car, lifting his bloodstained shirt. The gruesome wound confirmed Evelyn had shown him mercy.

"Evelyn..." He winced in pain.

Where was Julian Roscente? He called his assistant.

"Mr. Valentine, Mr. Roscente was drugged. Ms. Roland took him to the hospital."

Adrian hung up just as Evelyn's car made a U-turn. He followed discreetly, trailing her to the police station.

Evelyn glared at Zachary, who had curled into himself.

This idiot had already tattled to her brother.

"Boss, Mr. Cortez said—" Zachary's voice shrank.

"Wait in the car." Evelyn stepped out.

Adrian, Cassandra Valentine, and Vincent Ashcroft arrived simultaneously.

Vincent's face darkened. Cassandra charged forward. "Where are you hiding Julian?"

Evelyn smirked. "If I hadn't taken him, he'd be in your bed by now."

"That's a lie!" Cassandra shrieked.

"The hotel has surveillance. Let's see who really drugged him." Evelyn's words drained the color from Cassandra's face.

Vincent pulled Cassandra close, glaring. "Evelyn, feeling proud after cozying up to Sebastian Cortez?"

"Enough!" Adrian snapped.

Vincent fell silent, his expression stormy.
###Chapter 196

Evelyn Roland swept a cold gaze over Vincent Ashcroft's contorted face. "So you privileged young masters can't stand seeing me with a man better than you? You'd only be satisfied if I knelt begging for your scraps?"

Vincent's face turned ashen, his lips trembling wordlessly.

Evelyn strode past him into the police station lobby without a backward glance.

Just then, a recording exploded across the internet.

Vincent's voice came through crystal clear: "Use any means necessary to bring Evelyn back. Then drive her out of this city."

Those few sentences ignited a firestorm online.

Ashcroft Group's stock plummeted instantly—while Vincent still swaggered around the police station.

"Officer, this is just a joke. Release my friend now," Vincent demanded, slamming his palm on the desk.

The detective gave him an icy look. "We'll determine if it's a joke. Get out."

Vincent stormed out of the interrogation room, furiously dialing his phone.

As Evelyn finished giving her statement, she spotted Vincent pacing the lobby like a caged animal.

"Father! Evelyn's perfectly fine! Call the commissioner and get my friend released!" he shrieked into the phone.

His father's enraged voice crackled through: "Idiot! Don't you know the Youngs leaked the video? The company's being audited, and our stock hit the limit down!"

Vincent froze.

"Sebastian Cortez already withdrew his investment. We'll have to declare bankruptcy by dawn," his father's voice shook. "Congratulations—you're no longer the Ashcroft heir."

The phone clattered to the floor.

Vincent's legs buckled. He never imagined one impulsive act would destroy his entire family.

Adrian Valentine watched the spectacle silently from around the corner.

His gaze lifted to Evelyn nearby. "Evelyn..."

She didn't even glance his way, walking straight past.

Vincent suddenly lunged, grabbing her wrist. "Evelyn, I was wrong! Please tell Sebastian not to pull his funding!"

Evelyn wrenched free, her eyes glacial. "You tried to ruin me, and now you want my help? Tell me, Mr. Ashcroft—how could someone you trampled into the dirt possibly save you?"
###Chapter 197

Vincent's Adam's apple bobbed as sweat beaded at his temples.

Adrian's eyes burned with fury, his knuckles turning white from the force of his grip.

Slap!

The sharp sound of the blow echoed through the police station.

Vincent staggered back against the wall, his cheek stinging.

"Adrian, you—" He clutched his swollen face, voice trembling.

Adrian yanked him forward by the tie. "Who gave you the right?"

Vincent's gaze darted away. "I did it for you and Isabella—"

Evelyn approached, her heels clicking sharply against the floor.

"How noble of you, Vincent." Her red lips curved. "Pity you aimed it in the wrong direction."

Cassandra lurked in the corner, nails digging into her palms.

Sebastian burst through the door, his suit jacket damp with night dew.

"Evelyn!" He rushed to her side in three quick strides.

Adrian's eyes narrowed at the sight of this persistent man.

"Perfect timing, Sebastian." Evelyn smiled sweetly. "Be my witness."

He tenderly tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear. "Anything for you."

They walked out side by side, their silhouettes painfully harmonious.

Adrian's chest tightened. Suddenly, he remembered the name on her ID.

Evelyn Roland.

Even her name had been a lie.

The glass doors of the station slid shut, reflecting his stormy expression.
###Chapter 198

Adrian Valentine's lips curled into a self-deprecating smile. His heart felt like it was being torn apart.

So it had all been lies.

Vincent Ashcroft stood before him, pale as a ghost. "Adrian, save my family. I can't go bankrupt."

Adrian's gaze slid past him, landing on Cassandra Valentine in the distance. Rage surged through him.

"Vincent, Evelyn and I are divorced. What does she have to do with you? Why did you send people to hurt her?"

His voice was ice. "Do you know what it means to destroy a woman? How could you be so cruel?"

Vincent frowned. "I... I did it for you—"

"Don't say it was for me!" Adrian cut him off sharply. "I never asked for this. My affairs are none of your concern."

He took a step closer. "And are you even sure Evelyn was behind it?"

Vincent lowered his head. "No. Isabella said Evelyn drugged you to win you back, but Julian Roscente was the one who got poisoned. Then she latched onto Sebastian Cortez... I just wanted to teach her a lesson."

"A lesson?" Adrian laughed coldly. "You call that a lesson? She was once my woman!"

His voice turned deadly quiet. "We're done here. If you truly believe you did nothing wrong, go ask Julian. He'll give you your answers."

Right now, he had no time for anyone.

Adrian turned and walked away without looking back. So it was Isabella's doing. What a fool, being used without even realizing it.

Vincent stared at his retreating figure, his expression darkening. "Adrian, you're turning your back on me too?"

He shouted into the empty hallway, "Evelyn, you bitch! Because of you, brothers are turning against each other! Because of you, my family is ruined! Don't let me see you again!"

His chest ached even more after the outburst.

Then he thought of Cassandra.

She approached him gracefully. "Vincent, go home and handle your affairs first. We'll meet again once everything is settled."

Vincent gazed at her adoringly. He had loved her for so long. "Cassandra, you'll stand by me through this, won't you?"

Her eyes flickered. Why would she waste time on a fallen rich kid? She was meant for men like Julian Roscente, with real power and wealth. The Ashcrofts were just a failing wedding planning company.

Still, she smiled sweetly. "Vincent, I'll be here for you. Come to me if you need anything."

Vincent was enchanted by her gentle words. "Cassandra, you're all I have left."

She hid a smirk. Vincent was too impulsive—this downfall was his own fault. Men like him were only good as backups.

She seized the moment to stir the pot. "It's all Evelyn's fault. If not for her, the Ashcrofts wouldn't be in this mess."

Vincent's eyes darkened. It was because of Evelyn... and his own selfishness. "Let me take you home."

"No need." Cassandra declined softly. "Your family's situation is urgent. You should go."

Then she added slyly, "If all else fails, ask my brother to beg Evelyn to persuade Sebastian. As long as Sebastian doesn't pull his investment, the Ashcrofts can be saved."

She knew Adrian would never help Vincent. This way, Adrian would lose another true friend. And her own brother would benefit.

Everything Adrian had would eventually belong to her and her brother. He was just a tool for making money.

Vincent had always blamed his father's poor negotiation skills for their failed deal with Sebastian. That was why he resented him.

He never knew they had actually worked together.

Why hadn't his father told him?
###Chapter 199

"I'll walk you to the car," Vincent Ashcroft said softly.

Evelyn Roland nodded.

Vincent hailed a taxi and watched it drive away before turning back.

Inside the car, Evelyn's worried face reflected on her phone screen. The internet was flooded with vicious insults targeting Vincent.

She knew too well how ruthless the Ashcroft family's rivals could be. Tomorrow would only get worse.

~The Ashcroft heir is truly despicable. Ruining someone's reputation ruins their entire life.

~Rich heirs don't care about ordinary people. They step on others' suffering for fun.

~Serves him right for going bankrupt! Let's see who tramples whom when he's left with nothing!

Vincent unlocked his phone. The barrage of hateful comments stabbed at his eyes.

The last one made his fingers tremble.

Evelyn's words suddenly echoed in his ears. She said they always took pleasure in her pain.

He had simply disliked her aloof demeanor.

Only now did he understand the depth of his regret.

How could he have been so reckless?

Was it worth destroying the entire Ashcroft family over a moment of pride?

Evelyn was cunning. He had only meant to teach her a lesson.

But had he truly been wrong?

......

The moment Evelyn entered her apartment, she dialed Isabella Langley's number.

"Did you see the news, Isabella? The Ashcrofts are finished."

Isabella already knew but wondered why Evelyn was calling now.

"Aren't you supposed to be with Julian Roscente at the hotel?"

"It failed," Evelyn gritted her teeth. "Evelyn took him away."

"What?" Isabella's voice rose sharply. "Weren't you following them?"

To lose track like this—what an idiot.

"The elevator doors closed too fast..." Evelyn's voice wavered. "Now I'm afraid Vincent will realize we used him."

Isabella laughed lightly. "He acted on impulse. Who can he blame but himself?"

Too bad this fool didn't go all the way.

Evelyn caught her meaning. "I understand."

Vincent wouldn’t dare accuse her.

"Don’t worry," Isabella said, as if reading her thoughts. "He won’t."

"But I have an idea," Isabella added suddenly. "We can let someone else tell Vincent."

Evelyn's eyes lit up. "Tell me!"

After hearing Isabella's plan, Evelyn stood frozen, phone in hand.

If executed well, this could destroy Evelyn completely.

If not... Adrian Valentine would kill her.

Remembering the way Adrian looked at Evelyn, she bit her lower lip.

They were all just women he'd discarded anyway.

Evelyn walked to the study and retrieved a spare phone.

At the very least, she’d see what Vincent would choose.
###Chapter 200

Vincent Ashcroft stood before the villa's entrance when his phone screen suddenly lit up.

He glanced down, brows furrowing slightly.

This anonymous message was suspiciously timed.

Could the proposed solution in the text actually save the Ashcroft family?

His gaze lingered on the tightly shut door before he finally turned away.

Sacrificing some country girl meant nothing for the sake of his family.

Adrian Valentine had already discarded her anyway.

Vincent didn't realize this decision would condemn him to eternal ruin.

......

Sebastian Orlando escorted Evelyn Roland home, taking the opportunity to visit the children.

The moment he saw them, a flicker of pain crossed his eyes.

Thankfully, they resembled their mother more.

"Tristan, Felicia, this is Uncle Sebastian," Evelyn introduced gently.

Sebastian suddenly spoke up. "Call me Dad instead. Evelyn, let me be their father."

"What?" She froze.

His eyes crinkled with amusement. "As their godfather, I mean."

Evelyn nodded in agreement. The children did need paternal affection.

Yet something about his smile felt eerily familiar.

Sebastian bent down to scoop up Felicia.

"Come to Daddy, sweetheart."

Felicia immediately grabbed his ear.

"Little troublemaker. Don't you like Daddy?"

He gently squeezed her tiny hand, heart melting.

These were Evelyn's children.

Evelyn laughed while holding her son. "She's copying her brother. He always tugs on Great-grandfather's ears too."

Sebastian affectionately pinched Felicia's cheek. "Daddy loves his mischievous girl."

Felicia suddenly leaned in, planting a sloppy kiss on his face.

Evelyn chuckled. "Look how much your goddaughter adores you."

Shaking his head in mock exasperation, Sebastian said, "Let's go. I'll join you for dinner."

At the dining table, Victoria Laurent had prepared grilled meat and chicken porridge.

After the children were taken away, Sebastian asked softly, "Have your wounds healed completely?"

"Long ago." Evelyn kept her eyes on her porridge.

His gaze turned tender. "Don't take such risks again."

She'd been too reckless with herself these past years.

"I know. Now eat." Her voice was barely audible.

Sebastian placed a piece of grilled meat on her plate. "Come shopping with me tomorrow? We'll get things for the children."
###Chapter 201

Evelyn felt Sebastian's smile was strangely familiar, yet she couldn't place it.

She'd known him for years, but this reunion felt different somehow.

"Tristan and Felicia will love their godfather's gifts," Evelyn said with a smile.

Oddly, the hollow feeling in her chest vanished whenever he sat beside her.

This inexplicable sense of comfort puzzled her.

As night deepened, Sebastian walked with her through the neighborhood.

His stories from abroad kept her laughing.

It was nearly midnight when he finally rose to leave.

"I live right across the street. Call me anytime." His shadow stretched long under the streetlamp.

Evelyn's eyes widened. "When did you move here?"

"While you were recovering." His voice softened. "I didn't want to disturb you."

Warmth bloomed in her chest at having an old friend so close.

"Don't tell Scarlett about the children yet," she reminded him.

Sebastian's gaze flickered before he nodded.

He hesitated, then asked quietly, "Is it really over with Adrian?"

Evelyn's lashes fluttered as she looked away.

"That divorce was final long ago." She changed the subject. "It's late—you should rest."

The pain in Sebastian's chest sharpened at her evasiveness.

She clearly hadn't moved on.

"Goodnight," he murmured.

Too preoccupied with thoughts of the wrong man, Evelyn missed the tenderness in his voice.

Only when her silhouette disappeared into the building did Sebastian turn away.

Upstairs, Gabrielle had just finished bathing the twins.

"Ethan was so tired today he started sucking his toes," Gabrielle chuckled.

Evelyn blinked. "Sucking his toes?"

"It's a normal developmental phase," Gabrielle explained. "Felicia's obsessed with her feet now."

Amused, Evelyn watched her daughter.

After Gabrielle left, she took out her phone to document their milestones.

Felicia babbled while clutching Evelyn's hair, showing no signs of sleepiness.

"Time for bed, sweetheart." Evelyn stroked the tiny fingers. "Mommy will come home early tomorrow."

Beside them, Tristan had already drifted into peaceful slumber.
###Chapter 202

Felicia lay down obediently, her tiny hands resting neatly by her sides.

Then she suddenly sat up and planted a loud kiss on Evelyn's cheek before settling back with a satisfied grin.

Just as Evelyn reached for the lamp, the little girl kicked off her blanket.

Her tiny foot landed squarely on her brother's waist as she pretended to sleep, eyes tightly shut.

Evelyn sighed in exasperation. "Felicia Roland, if your brother could talk, he'd scold you for sure."

She tucked the blanket back around her daughter.

"One more kick and you're getting a spanking."

Felicia blinked her big eyes and suddenly reached for the hem of Evelyn's shirt.

"You little schemer," Evelyn chuckled, pinching her nose.

First the blanket kick. Then the foot on her brother.

All leading to her real goal.

"Mm..." The baby finally got what she wanted, nursing contentedly with half-lidded eyes.

Within ten minutes, she was sound asleep.

Evelyn kissed her forehead and was about to sleep when her phone vibrated.

"Adrian Valentine" flashed on the screen.

She answered with a frown. "Yes?"

"Madam—"

"It's Evelyn," she cut in coldly. "Adrian and I are divorced."

Victor's voice was urgent. "Ms. Roland, the CEO is badly injured. He's been in the bath for an hour refusing to come out—"

"Is he dead?" Evelyn scoffed. "If not, call an ambulance. If yes, contact the morgue."

Her finger hovered over the end call button.

"Take your problems to Isabella. Don't bother me." She paused. "Did he expect mercy after sending thugs to ruin me tonight?"

The call disconnected with finality.

At the Valentine estate, Adrian leaned back on the sofa, listening to the dial tone through the speaker.

Victor swallowed hard. "Sir, she's truly furious this time..."

Before, she'd drop everything to rush home if he was hurt.

Now she wouldn't even spare a word of concern.

Adrian's jaw tightened. "Does she... really not care at all anymore?"

Victor sighed. "You pushed her away yet still hope she'll come back..."

The world didn't work that way.
###Chapter 203

"Ha! Need you ask? From the very beginning, you drove her away in the cruelest way possible. Even the deepest love would wither under such treatment."

"You forced her to sign that dangerous contract. She took a bullet and dug it out with her own hands."

"The second time, you pushed her to leave, and she walked away to spare you. Now she's back, and you're tormenting her worse than ever. Tonight wasn't just a misunderstanding—you tried to destroy her!"

Victor Ashcroft stepped back abruptly, regret flashing across his face.

Damn his loose tongue.

He swallowed hard, meeting Adrian Valentine's icy gaze. "Sir...you told me to speak freely..."

"Get out."

Victor nearly sagged with relief.

The devil seemed remorseful.

At least he'd sleep well tonight.

His boss, however, wouldn't.

Victor turned to leave.

"Wait." Adrian's voice froze him mid-step. "Investigate tonight's incident. Check on Julian Roscente at the hospital."

Victor's legs nearly gave out.

Too soon to celebrate.

Sleep? He wouldn't even see his bed tonight.

He trudged away, shoulders slumped.

Adrian stormed upstairs.

The master bedroom remained untouched since Evelyn Roland's departure—the lavender embroidered duvet, her skincare products on the vanity.

For over a year, he'd avoided this room.

Now he pulled out his phone and dialed.

Evelyn jolted upright at the ringing.

Had something happened to Adrian?

Seeing his name, she exhaled.

If he could call, he was fine.

Her finger slipped, accidentally answering.

"Hello," she forced out.

"Wife..."

Evelyn blinked.

Wife?

Drunk or delirious?

"Adrian Valentine, who's your wife? Careful, that tongue might fall off."

Bastard.

Hearing her sharp tone, Adrian's lips twitched upward.

"I didn't orchestrate tonight. Believe it or not, I'm not that vile."

"Now you deny it? I endured your false vows, your pretend love, but I won't tolerate you ruining me!"

Her voice shook with fury.

"Waaah—" Little Sophia woke crying.

An infant's wail pierced the line.

Adrian froze.

"Wife—"

Evelyn hung up and powered off her phone.

He stared at the screen, that cry echoing in his ears.

Had he heard it during their last call too?

A staggering suspicion took shape.

He redialed.

The number you have reached—

"Evelyn!" He gritted his teeth.

Then remembered the unusually calm child in his arms outside the hospital.
###Chapter 204

Adrian Valentine's grip tightened around his phone.

He immediately dialed Victor Ashcroft's number.

"Sir, I just arrived at the hotel to check the surveillance footage," Victor's voice was cautious.

"Get to the point." Adrian's tone was icy.

Victor swallowed hard on the other end. "Sir, Ms. Roland used a fake identity. I've checked every person named Evelyn in Vienna—none of them match her. The vehicles picking her up change daily, and the driver is suspiciously elusive. There's no record of her employment in our system either."

"Keep digging." Adrian's voice dropped lower. "Recall Lucien from abroad to assist with the Vincent Langley investigation."

Victor exhaled in relief. "Thank goodness, sir. I've been working nonstop lately—I'm better suited for collecting paychecks than actual work."

"Enough." Adrian ended the call abruptly.

Victor made a face at his phone. He patted his wallet and muttered encouragement to himself: "For the future wife—keep grinding, working man!"

Evelyn Roland woke naturally to sunlight filtering through the sheer curtains.

Her two children still slept soundly beside her.

She dressed them carefully, moving quietly. Gabrielle Flores entered just as she finished.

"Sebastian's here," Gabrielle whispered with a wink. "He wants to take you to breakfast and shopping. And he looks extra dashing today."

Evelyn smiled. "Alright."

Gabrielle beamed. "I'll handle the kids. Christian's acupuncture is done—no need for you to visit today."

Evelyn's expression sobered. "Gabrielle, Christian's situation stays confidential. There's more to his attack years ago. I'll investigate properly once things settle."

"Don't worry." Gabrielle lifted the hungry Ethan, who was chewing his fingers. "Let's get breakfast first."

Downstairs, Sebastian Orlando had been waiting.

He took Ethan from Gabrielle, cradling the boy like precious porcelain.

"Sleep well last night?" he asked softly.

Evelyn adjusted Felicia in her arms. "They were angels—slept through mostly."

Sebastian's eyes flickered with concern. "I just hate seeing you exhausted."

"Sis! Check the news!" Victoria Laurent burst in, phone raised, her face pale.
###Chapter 205

Sebastian Orlando frowned slightly, his gaze fixed on Victoria Laurent.

Victoria's fingers trembled under his icy stare.

She had never seen such sharpness in his eyes before.

Immediately, she understood—now wasn't the right time for Evelyn to know the truth.

"Evelyn, have breakfast first." Victoria shoved her phone into her pocket, forcing a stiff smile. "We can check later. No need to ruin your appetite."

Evelyn sensed something was off.

But Victoria was right—it was too early to spoil the morning.

"Sebastian, eat up." She placed a fried dumpling in his bowl.

Sebastian smiled warmly. "After this, I'll take you shopping."

The table was spread with steaming porridge, golden-brown dumplings, and soft-boiled eggs—Evelyn's signature breakfast dishes.

Suddenly, she remembered how Adrian Valentine had loved her cooking.

Her fingers clenched.

Why was she thinking about that traitor again?

"Evelyn?" Sebastian noticed her pale expression. "Are you feeling unwell?"

She shook her head. "I'm fine."

Taking a bite of the dumpling, she savored the burst of juices.

Sebastian picked out the egg yolk and gently placed it in her bowl.

"You don't like yolks either?" Evelyn was surprised.

Just like Alexander Durand.

A flicker of nostalgia passed through Sebastian's eyes. "Alexander and I never liked them, even as kids."

Evelyn froze. She hadn't known that.

After breakfast, the children were left in Gabrielle Flores and Victoria's care.

Sebastian drove Evelyn to the mall for children's clothes.

Though Gabrielle and Victoria often bought outfits, Evelyn always chose the styles herself.

She knew Adrian's tactics too well.

If he discovered the children existed, he'd stop at nothing to take them.

Every trace had to be erased.

Even if he'd heard the baby's cries last night, he'd find no leads.

Sebastian's SUV pulled into the mall's underground garage.

As he leaned over to fasten her seatbelt, Evelyn caught his crisp pine scent—strangely familiar.

"You can check your phone now." Sebastian started the engine. "But promise me you won't overreact. Let me handle this."

Evelyn unlocked her screen.

A headline exploded across it:

Nathan Aldridge's Secretary Caught Seducing Vincent Ashcroft—Revenge Ensues

Accompanied by photos of her with Vincent, and his public apology.
###Chapter 206

Evelyn stared at her phone screen, fingertips trembling slightly.

The flood of vicious comments cut into her heart like knives.

"That slut is back to seduce men again!"

"First Adrian Valentine, now Vincent Ashcroft. How shameless can she be?"

"Pretty face means nothing when you're rotten to the core!"

Evelyn took a deep breath and locked her phone.

She walked to the window, gazing at the distant skyscrapers.

Vincent had crossed the line this time.

Not only had he falsely accused her of drugging someone, but he'd also manipulated public opinion against her.

Evelyn picked up her phone and dialed Vincent's number.

The call rang for a long time before being answered.

"Evelyn?" Vincent's voice dripped with mockery. "Finally crawling back to beg?"

Evelyn gave a cold laugh. "Vincent, you think you're clever?"

"Cleverer than you," he sneered. "The whole world knows what kind of trash you are now."

"Really?" Her voice remained calm. "Then perhaps you'd like to know Sebastian Cortez just canceled all business with the Ashcroft Group?"

Dead silence on the other end.

"You—you're lying!" Vincent's voice cracked with panic.

"Your father spent ten years securing that partnership." Evelyn enunciated every word. "And you just destroyed it."

"Impossible!" he shouted. "Stop spreading nonsense!"

Evelyn chuckled. "Call your father right now if you don't believe me."

"One more thing," she continued. "Did you ever stop to wonder why only Julian Roscente got drugged last night?"

"Who else could've done it?" Vincent snarled.

"Idiot." Her tone turned glacial. "Why was it specifically the soup Isabella Langley brought?"

Another stretch of silence.

"Vincent," Evelyn said finally, "tune into the financial news at 3 PM."

She hung up without waiting for a response.

Evelyn turned to her computer.

She opened her email and began sending out meticulously prepared documents.

Meanwhile, Adrian stood before his office windows.

He scowled at the news on his phone.

"That moron Vincent..." he muttered darkly.

His assistant knocked and entered. "Sir, we've retrieved last night's surveillance footage."

Adrian took the tablet. The video clearly showed Isabella slipping something into the soup.

"Just as I thought." His eyes turned icy.

He grabbed his coat. "Get the car ready. We're going to Ashcroft Group."

Elsewhere, Julian was signing his discharge papers.

"Mr. Roscente, the doctors recommend—" his assistant began anxiously.

"Shut up." Julian's face darkened. "Take me to Vincent's place."

At that same moment, Isabella clinked glasses with Cassandra Valentine in celebration.

"Let's see that bitch recover from this!" Isabella crowed.

Cassandra sipped her wine. "Vincent made such a useful fool."

They shared a laugh, oblivious to the storm gathering around them.
###Chapter 207

A cold glint flashed in Sebastian Orlando's eyes as his fingers tapped twice on the steering wheel.

The traffic light turned red. He picked up his phone and sent a quick message.

"Evelyn, drink some water." He unscrewed the thermos and handed it to her.

Evelyn Roland cradled the cup lid, taking small sips as the warm liquid soothed her throat.

"You're so thoughtful, Sebastian."

The corner of his mouth lifted slightly as he restarted the car, heading toward the mall.

Meanwhile, the Ashcroft residence was in complete disarray.

Vincent Ashcroft hummed a tune as he pushed open the door, nearly tripping over a suitcase.

"Dad! What's going on? Didn't the company just recover?"

Vincent Ashcroft Sr. turned from the floor-to-ceiling window. Though father and son shared similar features, their expressions couldn't have been more different.

"Idiot!" The older man grabbed his son by the collar.

"Evelyn seduced you? As if you were worthy!"

Vincent struggled to defend himself.

"I was just trying to save the company—"

A sharp slap cut him off.

"By ruining a girl's reputation to save the company?" His father trembled with rage.

"Even Adrian Valentine couldn't win her over. Who the hell do you think you are?"

Vincent stood frozen, clutching his stinging cheek.

"I've paid the taxes." The older man released him, exhaustion weighing on his voice.

"From today onward, you're no longer the Ashcroft heir. Think hard about who was really using you last night."

The sound of rolling suitcase wheels faded into the distance.
###Chapter 208

Vincent Ashcroft Sr. stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, a cigarette between his fingers.

Smoke curled around him as his gaze pierced through the glass, settling on the distant skyscrapers.

"The tax issue was just the trigger." His voice was hoarse. "The company's cash flow dried up months ago. Those taxes have been overdue for three months."

Vincent Ashcroft's teacup clattered to the floor.

"Impossible! Last week's financial report showed profits—"

Vincent Ashcroft Sr. turned. Bloodshot eyes met his son's.

"Fabricated." A bitter smile twisted his lips. "To stabilize the stock price, I ordered cooked books."

Silence swallowed the study.

Vincent Ashcroft trembled, nails digging crescent moons into his palms.

"The Yangs' tip-off just played into their hands." Vincent Ashcroft Sr. crushed his cigarette. "The real force behind our downfall is the Cortez family."

Julian Roscente entered just as the words hung in the air.

Impeccably suited, his expression was grave.

"Mr. Ashcroft guessed correctly." Julian placed a document on the desk. "Sebastian Cortez has acquired 32% of Ashcroft Group's shares."

Vincent Ashcroft shot up, his chair screeching against hardwood.

"Evelyn..." His lips quivered. "Is Evelyn getting her revenge?"

Julian's gaze turned glacial.

"You still blame her?" Suppressed fury laced his tone. "The drug in your drink last night? Livia spiked it."

Vincent Ashcroft looked thunderstruck.

"That's a lie! Evelyn clearly—"

"Surveillance footage doesn't lie." Julian cut him off. "Livia doctored your glass when no one was looking."

Vincent Ashcroft Sr. collapsed onto the sofa.

"Too late..." He muttered. "The Cortezes laid this trap long ago. We walked right in."

Outside, the sunset stained the clouds blood-red.

Julian checked his watch.

"Two hours." He said quietly. "Before the exchange closes, Ashcroft Group will have new owners."

Vincent Ashcroft lunged for the door like a madman.

"I'll confront Sebastian Cortez!"

"Stop!" Vincent Ashcroft Sr. barked. "Haven't you humiliated us enough?"

Julian blocked his path.

"Pointless." He shook his head. "Sebastian has waited three years for this."

Vincent Ashcroft froze.

Three years ago, he'd led the business world in ostracizing the newly returned Sebastian Cortez.

"Why..." His voice cracked. "Julian, why help them?"

Julian's expression darkened.

"Because Evelyn saved my life. Twice." A pause. "While you nearly ended it."

The study door burst open.

Mrs. Ashcroft stood weeping in the doorway.

"The bank called." She choked out. "Our villa... It's been seized."

Beyond the window, the first evening star flickered to life.
###Chapter 209

Vincent Ashcroft Sr. let out a heavy sigh, his gaze complex as he stared at his son. "You're right. The Yangs can't touch us. But I've checked—Sebastian Cortez hasn't made a move against us either. Yet if he terminates our partnership, we're finished."

His fingers tapped absently against the desk. "Only the Cortez family can fund and produce this new project. I've waited six years for this opportunity."

So close to success, only to fail at the last moment.

"That Sterling Manor heiress is formidable. She developed it in just four years. If not for their production limitations, they'd never have partnered with us." A bitter smile twisted his lips. "My technology isn't inferior to hers. After finally gaining recognition..."

"They approached the Lowells first, but Isabella Langley stole credit. Then Adrian Valentine intercepted the deal. So the Sterling heiress took matters into her own hands. The product launched a year late but became an instant classic—it'll dominate the market for twenty years."

Vincent Sr.'s pupils constricted as realization struck. "Someone's been orchestrating this entire situation."

Vincent Ashcroft swallowed hard, his voice trembling. "Father... is there really no way out?"

"After paying a billion in back taxes, our cash flow is severed." Vincent Sr. shook his head. "Adrian Valentine is busy collaborating with Sterling Manor now—he won't help us. The Roscentes lost over a billion too."

Vincent's breathing turned ragged, his words choked. "I never thought it would come to this—"

"Enough!" Vincent Sr. snapped. "Tears won't solve anything. If you truly want to make amends, go work for Evelyn Roland."

Julian Roscente and Vincent Ashcroft froze simultaneously.

"Father, she's not even—"

"Are you certain?" Vincent Sr. slammed the table.

Vincent fell silent.

"Fortunes change overnight. The person you looked down on yesterday can leave you drowning today." A cold laugh escaped him. "That she hasn't kicked us while we're down is mercy enough."

Disappointment etched his features as he regarded his son. "Twenty-six years old, yet still acting like a reckless boy who doesn't know his place."

Selfish. Arrogant. Wealth had blinded him to reality.

And this was only the beginning.

Vincent Sr. turned to find his wife. With the political winds shifting in Vienna, self-preservation was paramount.

For over a year, he'd sensed something amiss. The Roscentes had been the first target.

Before leaving, he cautioned Julian: "Tell your father to tread carefully in the coming days."

"Thank you, Uncle Ashcroft." Julian inclined his head respectfully. "If you need anything..."

"Stay with him. Make him see reason." Vincent Sr. checked his watch. "I leave in an hour."

His shoulders slumped as he ascended the stairs. Some realizations, only his son could reach alone.

Vincent collapsed onto the sofa, his gaze hollow. "Julian... I never imagined the Ashcrofts would fall this far."

Never in his wildest dreams had he thought he'd plummet from the heights of privilege.

Julian's voice turned grave. "Believe it or not, we were both set up last night. Cassandra Valentine drugged me."
###Chapter 210

Vincent Ashcroft shot to his feet, his eyes bloodshot as he glared at Julian Roscente. His fists clenched with audible cracks. "Julian Roscente, how dare you? Cassandra would never drug you!"

His chest heaved violently, refusing to believe Cassandra Valentine could scheme against Julian.

After all these years of unspoken feelings, she couldn’t possibly be oblivious.

Evelyn’s words from last night suddenly echoed in his mind. A chill ran down his spine. Could it be...?

No. Cassandra would never fall for this playboy. The number of women he’d toyed with was countless.

Seeing Vincent’s emotional outburst, Julian said nothing more and turned to leave the Ashcroft residence.

At the Langley villa, Isabella Langley sipped black tea from a bone china cup, her movements deliberate.

Even confined indoors, no whisper of the outside world escaped her notice.

Vincent Langley strode in, beaming. "Isabella, last night’s plan was executed flawlessly! Pity we didn’t secure the core technology."

A cold glint flickered in Isabella’s eyes. "Patience. With the company in our grasp, the technology will follow. I already have a plan to deal with that fool. They’ll hand it over within six months. Father, keep a close eye on the acquisition."

Vincent Langley smirked in satisfaction. "Don’t worry. That wedding planning firm will be ours by this afternoon. Their product sales are strong—profits will pour in soon."

Isabella’s red lips curved.

Who knew setting up Evelyn and Vincent would yield such unexpected gains?

Evelyn, the humiliation you dealt me will be repaid tenfold.

She picked up her limited-edition handbag. "I’m going to see Adrian."

Vincent Langley grinned. "Secure the engagement soon."

A talent like Adrian Valentine must be firmly controlled.

If he couldn’t be used...

A murderous glint flashed in Vincent Langley’s eyes.

In the CEO office of Valentine Group, Adrian Valentine paced restlessly.

It wasn’t until noon that Victor Ashcroft called. "Sir, we couldn’t trace Madam’s whereabouts. But she was spotted shopping with Sebastian Orlando at the mall."

Adrian’s voice turned icy. "Keep them under surveillance. I’m on my way."

He grabbed his car keys and stormed out, only to collide with Isabella at the elevator.

"Adrian, where are you off to in such a hurry?"

Adrian ignored her, stepping straight into the elevator.
###Chapter 211

Isabella watched Adrian's hurried departure with a furrowed brow.

As the elevator doors closed, she clearly saw a flicker of panic in his eyes.

That wasn't like him.

She rushed downstairs, only to catch the taillights of his car vanishing around the corner.

Standing on the crowded street, her eyes reddened.

"Adrian...do you really love me?" she whispered to herself.

This relationship had begun with a mistaken act of heroism.

But only she knew the truth—it was Evelyn who had saved Adrian all those years ago.

"Well, well. If it isn't Adrian's precious darling. Crying all alone?"

Cassandra's mocking voice came from behind.

Isabella stiffened.

Why was this madwoman here again?

"Adrian had urgent business," Isabella forced a smile. "Unlike some people who have nothing better to do than stir up trouble."

She deliberately jabbed at Cassandra's sore spot—all of Vienna knew the Valentine heiress had a fiery temper and remained stubbornly single.

Cassandra's eyes turned icy.

Slap!

The sharp sound of the slap echoed down the street.

"Cassandra!" Isabella shrieked, clutching her cheek. "You lunatic!"

"Can't handle it?" Cassandra smirked. "You should've expected this the day you crossed me."

She would never forget that year at eighteen, when she'd nearly lost everything because of Margaret's schemes.

From then on, she'd sworn—anyone who dared plot against her would pay tenfold.

"You think I'm afraid of you?" A venomous glint flashed in Isabella's eyes.

Cassandra suddenly laughed, her striking face alight with madness under the sun.

"Bring it on," she leaned close to Isabella's ear. "I'm curious to see what tricks you've got."

With that, she turned on her heel, her red trench coat flaring dramatically in the wind.

Isabella stared after her, slowly pulling out her phone.

"Aunt Eleanor..." Her voice instantly trembled with tears the moment the call connected. "Cassandra just hit me..."
###Chapter 212

"That bitch Cassandra actually hit you?" Margaret Valentine's shrill voice pierced through the phone. "Don't worry, Isabella. Auntie will teach her a lesson."

Isabella Langley ended the call with satisfaction, a cold smirk curling her lips.

Her father had successfully mined the diamond concession. That fool Evelyn had no idea what she'd lost, letting him claim such a priceless fortune. Those diamonds were worth a king's ransom, with profits beyond imagination.

She cast a disdainful glance at Cassandra's retreating figure.

"Just you wait, Cassandra."

As Isabella turned, darkness suddenly engulfed her vision. A burlap sack yanked over her head. Before she could react, rough hands hoisted her into a waiting car. The door slammed shut, sealing her in silence.

Adrian Valentine sped to the mall, tires screeching.

Victor Ashcroft waited at the entrance, rushing forward as Adrian emerged.

"Where's Isabella?" Adrian's voice was steel.

Victor stiffened under his commanding presence, pointing toward the first floor. "Mrs. Langley is in the children's section."

Adrian's chest tightened. He strode inside, their striking appearances making them stand out in the crowd.

Evelyn wore a nude dress today, the delicate shoulder straps accentuating her graceful silhouette.

Clenching his jaw, Adrian approached silently.

"Sophia, what do you think of this princess dress?" Sebastian Orlando held up a pink tulle gown, his gaze tender.

Adrian's pupils contracted.

This should have been his moment with Evelyn—choosing clothes for their child. Instead, another man stood in his place. The sight stabbed through him like a blade.

"Sebastian, Sophia's too young for this." Evelyn shook her head with a soft laugh. "Gabrielle already bought so much. Let's not overdo it."

"Your call." Sebastian picked up tiny pink sandals. "These are adorable."

"Really, it's unnecessary." Evelyn rubbed her temple. "Our place is overflowing already."

They moved toward the sock aisle.

Nearby, a group of women whispered behind their hands.

"Isn't that the woman trending today? First Vincent, then Adrian, now this hottie?"

"Tsk. What a maneater, always upgrading to richer men."

"Look! Adrian's here!"

Adrian's icy glare silenced them instantly. They scattered like startled birds.

The online rumors kept spreading despite his PR team's efforts. His expression darkened further.

Then his phone rang.

Evelyn froze at the familiar ringtone. She turned.

Their eyes met.

The air between them crystallized.
###Chapter 213

Evelyn nearly dropped the baby bottle in her hand.

Her pupils contracted slightly as her fingers tightened unconsciously.

Why was Adrian here in a baby store?

How much had he heard?

The man approached with steady steps, his tall frame casting a shadow under the lights.

The familiar cold aura around him washed over her.

Evelyn instinctively took half a step back.

"Evelyn," Adrian's voice was low. "What was that crying last night? And now you're buying baby supplies?"

His gaze burned into her.

Her heart skipped a beat.

"Who are you?" she countered calmly. "Why should I answer your questions?"

She met his eyes directly.

"My ex-husband? Or just a friend?"

Adrian's breath hitched.

Only then did he realize he'd long lost the right to interrogate her.

"Evelyn..." His Adam's apple bobbed.

"Adrian." She cut him off. "Please don't disturb my life."

Turning to Sebastian, she said, "Sebastian, we should go."

Sebastian naturally wrapped an arm around her waist.

"We've been out too long. The babies must be missing their daddy." His pointed glance at Adrian carried unspoken meaning.

"Daddy?" Adrian's voice trembled. "The children are yours?"

Sebastian's lips curved.

"Don't you already know the answer?"

His gentle gaze shifted to Evelyn. "Let's go home, darling."

Adrian stood frozen.

He watched their retreating figures, the world spinning around him.

He had truly lost her for good.

The marriage that ended with Christian's death was now an irreversible fact.

Every time he saw her, the fire from that night flared before his eyes.

He could never forgive.

At the checkout counter, Adrian stared blankly.

Was it that child—Sophia?

He remembered the little girl sleeping peacefully in Evelyn's arms.

So these purchases were for her.

A self-deprecating smile twisted his lips.

For a moment, he'd almost thought...

Through the car window, he saw Sebastian hand Evelyn a bottle of water with tender care.

The man leaned over to fasten her seatbelt with practiced ease.

The sight stabbed at Adrian's eyes.

He turned and disappeared into the gathering dusk.
###Chapter 214

"Evelyn..." Adrian Valentine's voice cracked as the name escaped his lips.

Her car had already disappeared down the street.

He stood frozen, anguish threatening to consume him.

......

Inside the vehicle, Sebastian Orlando's knuckles whitened around the steering wheel. "Will this make him give up?"

Evelyn gazed out the window. "We're divorced. He's just uncomfortable seeing you with me."

No one understood Adrian's possessiveness better than she did.

A shadow flickered in Sebastian's eyes, his jaw tightening.

Evelyn caught the subtle shift in his demeanor.

But within seconds, his usual gentle composure returned.

The momentary darkness might as well have been her imagination.

After dropping off the items, Sebastian rushed back to his office.

Evelyn fed the children before meeting Scarlett Orlando for shopping. Returning to the studio, security and receptionists greeted her with deference.

Except one receptionist whose hostile glare didn't escape notice.

Evelyn ignored it, heading straight for the elevator.

Life offered too many battles—she chose her peace.

Adrian arrived at the building just as Evelyn reached the elevator.

He quickened his pace, only to be intercepted by Isabella Langley.

"Adrian, your cousin hit me." Isabella clutched his arm, her masked face the picture of委屈.

Evelyn's fingers trembled at the familiar voice.

She inhaled deeply, willing herself not to turn.

"Evelyn? What are you doing here?" Isabella's shrill demand pierced the air.

Evelyn turned, her gaze sweeping past the other woman.

Isabella's white plunging neckline dress left little to imagination.

"Meeting with a client." Evelyn's tone remained detached.

"Stop pretending!" Isabella stamped her foot. "Adrian already—"

"Enough." Evelyn's icy interruption cut through. "Your affairs don't concern me. Spare me the theatrics—it's nauseating."

Isabella's face contorted. "How dare you speak to me like that?"

Evelyn stepped into the elevator without another glance.

Adrian stood motionless, his expression unreadable.
###Chapter 215

"Evelyn, shut your mouth!" Adrian roared, his eyes blazing with anger. "Isabella is still under my protection. You have no right to criticize her. Apologize now!"

"Criticize?" Evelyn smirked, her red lips curling. "What exactly counts as criticism?"

She raised an eyebrow, feigning realization. "Ah, I see. When I called her blind, you called it criticism."

"Adrian, you two are a disgrace. Stay out of my sight from now on."

"Don't make me sick with your presence. And as for an apology—does she even deserve one?"

"Let's pretend we're strangers from now on. I won't waste another word on you."

Why should she apologize to Isabella?

"Even at my lowest, I won't let you trample over me."

"Evelyn, you—" Adrian's face darkened. "You found another man barely a year after the divorce. Shameless—"

"That's none of your business!" Evelyn cut him off coldly. "You're blind, and she's brainless. You two should book a hospital visit together."

Adrian fell silent. Her flushed cheeks and those defiant lips made him want to silence her with a kiss.

Every word she spoke stabbed at his heart.

"Isabella, you bitch! How dare you send Margaret after my daughter? You're asking for death!"

A furious shout erupted. Margaret Valentine stormed over, grabbing Isabella's hair and slapping her twice across the face.

"Ah—!" Isabella shrieked in pain.

Adrian: "..."

Evelyn burst into laughter at the sight of the scuffle.

Adrian glanced at her, his heart shattering. She would never smile at him like that again.

"Let go! What are you doing?" Isabella whimpered, too afraid to scream.

Margaret's grip was ironclad, nearly tearing Isabella's scalp off. Her low-cut dress threatened to slip, exposing her.

"Adrian, help me! Get this crazy woman off me!"

Adrian quickly stepped in, pulling Margaret away. "Aunt Margaret, stop! This is a public place!"

Margaret, plump and dignified, sneered. "Adrian, are you blind? You cheated with this trash? Evelyn was ten times the woman she is! Look at her—her chest is practically falling out!"

"What decent woman dresses like this?"

Isabella: "..." She hastily covered herself, too humiliated to look up.

Adrian draped his suit jacket over her shoulders.

Evelyn suppressed an eye-roll. Margaret was infamous for hair-pulling brawls—she'd once ripped off a chunk of someone's scalp.

"Aunt Margaret, control yourself!" Adrian snapped impatiently.
###Chapter 216

"Image?" The matriarch curled her lips in disdain. "I'm not like your pretentious mother, putting on airs while scheming behind the scenes."

"Throwing away a good daughter-in-law for some seductress you treat like treasure."

"Today your mother humiliated my daughter. Adrian Valentine, Isabella Langley, mark my words—if anything happens to her, you'll pay."

Before leaving, she kicked Isabella hard, sending her stumbling into Adrian's arms.

In her haste, she didn't notice Evelyn Roland standing in the corner.

Evelyn watched the elevator arrive and stepped inside silently.

As the doors closed, Isabella's tearful whimpers echoed clearly.

A faint smile touched Evelyn's lips. The Valentines were a nest of vipers, but the matriarch's outburst raised questions.

That selfish former mother-in-law, who'd abandoned her own daughter—why such concern for Isabella?

Besides, Vincent Langley and Margaret Valentine often met secretly at hotels.

Nathan Aldridge had uncovered that.

Evelyn's nose wrinkled in disgust as she dialed Zachary Deross.

"Boss."

"Investigate Vincent Langley and Margaret Valentine's relationship. Start from when they first met. Keep it discreet—focus on their communication records."

Zachary chuckled. "Got it. Those kidnappers are locked up, but they won't admit Vincent Ashcroft hired them."

Evelyn narrowed her eyes. That fool Vincent Ashcroft was just a pawn. Served him right.

"Leave him. He's on borrowed time. Monitor the Ashcrofts—see who ultimately acquires them."

Excitement colored Zachary's voice. "My money's on Vincent Langley. He's been quietly buying Ashcroft shares."

Evelyn's smile deepened.

"The real value lies in the elder Ashcroft's technology. Their event company can restart with full credentials. Vincent's buying an empty shell—let him."

The Ashcroft patriarch, clinging to his core tech, would suffer most.

"Roger that. Continuing surveillance."

Evelyn hung up as the elevator reached Scarlett Orlando's floor.

Meanwhile, Adrian guided Isabella into another elevator, finally learning the full story: Cassandra Valentine had struck Isabella, who then complained to Margaret. Margaret retaliated against Cassandra.

The matriarch had come for vengeance.

Adrian's expression darkened with each detail.

Isabella, mistaking his anger, clung to his arm. "Don't be upset, Adrian. Margaret already defended me. Dinner tonight? My father asked when we're marrying."

He shook her off impatiently. "Later."

Her face froze. He never intended to marry her?

Exiting the elevator, Adrian halted abruptly.

Vincent Ashcroft waited in the lounge, rushing forward. "Adrian, my sister's still studying abroad. The Ashcrofts can't fall—help me!"

###Chapter 217

Adrian Valentine's gaze darkened as he looked at Vincent Ashcroft. "Do you understand the current state of the Ashcroft Group?"

Vincent clenched his fists.

No one knew better than him what his family was about to face.

Only desperation had driven him to seek help from this former friend.

"If we can save the joint project between our companies, there's still a chance to turn things around."

He had spent the entire night tossing and turning in that cramped ten-square-meter rental apartment before standing here today.

The young master of the Ashcroft family, who had grown up in luxury, had bathrooms larger than that entire room.

Adrian was blunt. "I can't help. The Sterling Manor project requires massive funding. I won't risk the Valentine Group."

The business world was a battlefield.

Vincent stared at this brother-in-arms and suddenly laughed.

He should have known better. Sentiment meant nothing when profits were at stake.

That Adrian would protect their overseas project was already his greatest concession.

"No room for negotiation?" Vincent's voice tightened.

Adrian met his gaze. "I can only preserve our existing collaborations."

Vincent's face instantly drained of color.

So empires could crumble in the blink of an eye.

"Thanks." He stumbled slightly when turning away.

Isabella Langley watched coldly, mockery flashing in her eyes.

Fool.

Did he really think Adrian would gamble the Valentine Group for him? Even if Adrian wanted to, she would never allow it.

"Vincent, do you know how much capital it would take to save the Ashcroft Group?" Isabella's red lips parted. "Helping you would set the Valentine Group back at least ten years."

She looked at this stray dog as if he were garbage.

The video she'd sent to the Macmillans last night was already taking effect.

Suddenly Vincent remembered Evelyn's words.

He whirled around, catching Isabella's triumphant smirk before she could hide it.

So that was it.

"It was you." Vincent's voice trembled. "You used my prejudice against Evelyn—"

He laughed until his eyes turned red.

To think he'd been played like a puppet by this woman.
###Chapter 218

Isabella widened her eyes in feigned shock, her lashes glistening with unshed tears as she looked at Vincent. "Vincent, how could you think that of me? When the waiter said Evelyn didn't order anything, I reminded you it might be a misunderstanding."

"You were the one determined to confront her, even hiring people to ruin her."

"Now that you've lost everything, you're blaming me?"

A flicker of mockery passed through her gaze.

The fool had finally caught on.

Too late.

The Ashcroft Group would soon bear the Langley name.

Business was war—only the strong survived.

Without proper preparation, that half-baked technology of his was doomed to fail.

Vincent's lips pressed into a bloodless line, his face dark with fury.

He let out a cold laugh and turned to leave.

"Sir, the Ashcroft Group has been acquired by Langley Corporation."

Victor's voice came from the doorway.

Vincent whirled around, murder flashing in his eyes.

Isabella answered with a serene smile.

The unspoken truth hung between them.

"Isabella, I underestimated you." Vincent's voice was glacial. "You were the only one there last night. The only one near me when I made that call."

"Thank you for showing me who you really are."

He strode out without looking back.

Isabella scoffed at his retreating figure. "Business is war. If you couldn't protect your own company, that's your failure—not mine."

Vincent halted mid-step.

The depth of his stupidity crashed over him.

He'd handed his fortune to the enemy—and thanked her for it.

"No wonder Adrian chose you over Evelyn. You're ruthless." His voice carried bitter clarity. "Now I understand why Julian changed."

Adrian's gaze turned stormy.

Isabella immediately clung to his arm, pouting. "Adrian, he's slandering me! Aren't you going to defend me?"

"What do you want me to say?" Adrian's tone was icy. "He's my brother."

She bit her lip, frustration twisting her features. "In business, everyone plays their own game. His incompetence isn't my fault."

Arrogant, foolish men disgusted her.

Adrian studied her. "Last night—did you tell Vincent that Evelyn drugged me?"

Her eyes darted away. "The waiter said the lily chicken soup was Evelyn's order—your favorite."

"I only speculated she might've laced it to seduce you. How was I to know Vincent would take it so far?"

Her grip on his arm tightened. "You've changed lately. Do you not love me anymore?"

Her jaw clenched.

If he dared betray her now...

She'd killed Christian Lefèvre for him.

"Go home." Adrian's expression remained unreadable as he glanced at Victor.

Victor stepped forward. "Miss Langley, your driver is waiting."
###Chapter 219

Isabella Langley immediately stood up when she heard Warren Garten had arrived. "Adrian, I'll take my leave now. I don't want to disturb your work. Don't forget our dinner tonight."

Adrian Valentine responded without looking up.

Once Isabella was gone, Victor Ashcroft closed the door.

He lowered his voice. "Sir, something's off about the Ashcroft family matter. I investigated—Vincent Ashcroft Jr. was only with Isabella Langley yesterday. Either she sent that video to the Macmillans, or someone secretly recorded it. But I found no evidence linking her to the leak."

"The Macmillans are keeping tight-lipped."

He suspected Vincent Langley and his daughter were behind this.

Adrian smirked. "Vincent Jr. was a fool. He has no one to blame but himself. This lesson will make him grow. His father will discipline him properly."

"What has Vincent Langley been up to lately?"

Victor replied, "Diamond mining, in partnership with Mr. Harrison. Alexander Durand was truly a genius—he pinpointed the vein just from a few photographs. But a new underworld faction has emerged. They robbed Langley's diamond shipment today."

He couldn't help asking, "Sir, why didn't Evelyn give you those maps?"

Adrian's gaze turned icy. Those were her deepest scars. How could she ever reveal them?

"I'll get what I want, with or without those blueprints. Evelyn handed the maps to Vincent Langley for a reason. She's investigating Alexander's death and won't confront Langley yet. When he adopted her all those years ago, he must have had ulterior motives."

"Our priority is uncovering the truth about my father's death. With his diamonds stolen, Langley will pressure me to marry Isabella."

Victor frowned, thinking of the mysterious faction. "Should we investigate them, sir?"

Adrian narrowed his eyes. "No need. It's either Sebastian Cortez or Alexander's people. Monitor the situation closely."

"Will Zachary Deross return tomorrow?"

Victor nodded eagerly. "Yes, first thing in the morning."

Finally, he could catch his breath.

He'd been running himself ragged lately.

Tomorrow, he would rest properly.

Adrian shattered that dream with his next words. "Once Zachary's back, he'll handle covert operations. You keep watching Vincent Langley."

Then he returned to his work.

Victor's eyes widened.

Had he heard correctly?

So Zachary's return changed nothing for him?

Absolutely nothing!

He stared at Adrian's focused profile and sighed inwardly. He wasn't bad-looking—just terrible at sweet-talking.

His inability to charm the boss meant endless overtime.

Even his dates got interrupted for emergencies. When would he ever find a girlfriend?

What was a man's greatest sorrow?

No time for love. No time for relationships.

"Oh, sir, I ran into Evelyn downstairs earlier. She went out with Scarlett Orlando and that actor Lucien Valentine—the one who got hit by the car."

Adrian looked up. "Silence Lucien. Isabella's contract killing must never leak."
###Chapter 220

Victor's retreating figure radiated finality.

Adrian stared at the computer screen, unable to process a single word.

He kicked his chair aside and strode to the floor-to-ceiling window.

The city lights glittered in the distance, but couldn't pierce his gloom.

......

Scarlett linked arms with Isabella as they bumped into Vincent Ashcroft at the hotel entrance with Lucien.

Vincent's gaze instantly dodged away when he spotted Evelyn.

"Isn't this the CEO who slandered Evelyn online for seducing you?" Scarlett sneered. "With your pathetic self, you think she'd even glance your way?"

Vincent paled and hurried off with his head down.

"Coward!" Scarlett stamped her foot in frustration. "Can't even defend himself, yet dares to smear others!"

Lucien gently pressed her shoulder. "Don't waste anger on trash. We have real business to handle."

Evelyn's phone buzzed with an alert about Vincent Langley acquiring the Ashcroft Group.

Her pupils contracted. She turned to Lucien immediately. "Suspend the investigation. It's too dangerous now."

"Evelyn!" Scarlett tugged at her sleeve indignantly. "You promised to spend today with me!"

With a resigned sigh, Evelyn hugged her friend. "I'll book us dinner at KM's private kitchen tonight."

"Really?" Scarlett's eyes lit up. "I'm ordering their signature truffle foie gras!"

Lucien said gravely, "Don't worry, Ms. Roland. I won't act recklessly again."

Evelyn rushed off, but her phone rang once more as she exited the revolving doors.

"Miss Roland, can we meet tonight?" A familiar voice asked through the receiver.
###Chapter 221

Evelyn's voice turned icy. "Now or never. I'm busy tonight."

She had to be with her children. Every spare moment was dedicated to them.

At three years old, they would begin training.

She knew its brutality firsthand.

"Miss Roland, thank you! I'll wait at Palais de Beauté. Your identity stays secret."

Evelyn trusted his discretion.

"Forty minutes." She hung up as Zachary pulled up in the car.

She slid into the passenger seat.

"Palais de Beauté."

Nearby, Vincent Ashcroft watched Evelyn enter the luxury vehicle.

He decided to follow. Sebastian Cortez was his target.

Vincent had long resented Sebastian for cutting ties with the Ashcrofts.

Overseas, he'd ignored domestic affairs.

By the time he returned, the deal was dead.

An apology might salvage it—and the Ashcroft fortune.

Vincent clenched his jaw. Poverty had forced him to grow up overnight.

Forty minutes later, the car halted before ornate gates.

"Palais de Beauté" gleamed in gold leaf above the entrance.

Evelyn stepped out, gazing at the plaque with mixed emotions.

Her grandfather had built this for his mistress.

After her departure, it became a memorial.

Now it belonged to Evelyn.

The front housed a club and ballroom. The main palace lay a kilometer beyond.

Zachary grinned. "Boss, why are we here?"

He adored this place.

"When do we move in?"

Evelyn chuckled. "After Grandpa passes. And when the kids are older. This is retirement territory. The guesthouse is yours if you marry."

"You're the best! We'll follow you forever!"

They'd grown up under her wing.

Evelyn teased, "Find a wife first."

Zachary scratched his head. "Not happening yet."

No one had caught his eye.

"Let's go." Evelyn strode forward.

Vincent trailed discreetly.

The concierge stopped him. "Membership card, sir?"

Vincent produced a gold card.

The attendant smiled. "Mr. Ashcroft, your father is already inside."
###Chapter 222

The receptionist respectfully handed the membership card back to Vincent Ashcroft.

His brow furrowed.

Why would his father be at this exclusive private club?

He quickened his pace to follow.

Around the corner, Evelyn Roland and Zachary Deross flashed past, heading straight into his father's private room.

Vincent's heart lurched.

Had his father gotten a membership just to get close to Sterling Manor's people?

He strode forward and swiped his card to enter.

The scene before him froze the blood in his veins.

His father knelt on both knees, while Evelyn sat composed on the sofa, her expression detached.

"Young Mistress, please save my son." The elder Ashcroft's voice trembled.

Vincent stood rooted to the spot.

Young Mistress?

That Evelyn he'd looked down upon was Sterling Manor's heiress?

"Mr. Ashcroft, please rise." Evelyn frowned, her fingers lightly tapping the armrest.

He'd never seen her like this before.

An imperious aura radiated from her, her gaze sharp as a blade.

"If this continues, my son will be used as someone's pawn." The older man's voice broke. "I only beg you to give him a chance."

Zachary stepped forward to help him up.

Evelyn lifted her teacup, tone even. "The minimum requirement for my inner circle is dual master's degrees and mastery of two professional skills."

Her eyes met the elder Ashcroft's. "Your son can't even manage basic emotional control."

Vincent stood outside the door, icy dread seeping into his bones.

"What if he attends Falcon Training Camp?" His father pressed desperately.
###Chapter 223

Evelyn's slender fingers tapped rhythmically on the desk, her gaze sharp as a blade. "Mr. Ashcroft, Falcon Training Camp isn't a playground. Are you certain you want to send your precious son there?"

A cold smile curled her lips. "From what I know, your son finds ordinary apartments beneath him. Sleeping in tents? Living among venomous snakes and wild beasts?"

Zachary stood nearby, his brow furrowed. "Mr. Ashcroft, the debt Miss Roland owes you can be repaid another way. The brutality of Falcon Training Camp is beyond your son's endurance."

Vincent Ashcroft Sr. shook his head with a bitter laugh, stubborn determination flashing in his eyes. "Money can be regained, but a lost son is irreplaceable. I only want him to truly grow."

Evelyn abruptly rose to her feet, her black trench coat slicing through the air behind her. "What your son did to me—I've already shown mercy by not pursuing it. He doesn't deserve to remain at Sterling Manor."

Her voice was glacial. "A spoiled playboy who only knows how to waste his life—why should I gamble Sterling Manor's future on him?"

"Miss Roland!" Vincent tried to plead again.

"Dad!" A sudden voice cut him off.

Vincent Ashcroft stood in the doorway, his face deathly pale. His eyes were locked onto Evelyn, his lips trembling. "You... who are you really?"

The air turned to ice.

Evelyn narrowed her eyes. "How much did you hear?"

The aura radiating from her made Vincent's legs weaken. The pressure was suffocating, as if an invisible weight crushed his shoulders.

Vincent Ashcroft Sr. hurried to explain. "Miss Roland, I'm sure he didn't mean to—"

Elegantly settling back into the sofa, Evelyn lightly tapped the armrest. "Since you've heard, you should understand the consequences." Her voice was soft but laced with threat. "What happened today—forget it the moment you step out that door."

"You're really..." Vincent's voice shook. "The heiress of Sterling Manor?"

The realization struck him like lightning. The woman he'd looked down upon was actually standing at the pinnacle of power?
###Chapter 224

"Vincent, shut your mouth!" Vincent Ashcroft Sr. roared, barely restraining himself from slapping his disgraceful son.

How dare he speak like that?

Evelyn Roland's expression remained icy. "That's correct. I am the heiress of Sterling Manor."

Boom—

Vincent felt as though lightning had struck him.

Impossible.

The same Evelyn he'd bullied for three years was actually the heiress of Sterling Manor?

"Young Mistress, Vincent has been abroad for a year and isn't familiar with the current situation," Ashcroft Sr. hastily explained. "Please reconsider our earlier discussion."

Evelyn cast Vincent a frigid glance. "You know exactly what kind of reputation he has in their circles. Brawling, reckless behavior—I can't help someone like that."

She stood to leave.

Ashcroft Sr.'s face drained of color.

Seeing his father's devastation, Vincent's chest ached. He called after Evelyn's retreating figure, "Young Mistress, what will it take for you to give me a chance?"

If it meant reinventing himself, he was willing to try.

Evelyn turned, her gaze sharp as a blade. "I owe your father a favor. You have one month to prove yourself. Pass my test, and I'll restore the Ashcroft family's glory."

"Boss!" Zachary Deross protested urgently. "A waste like him would never survive Falcon Training Camp's evaluation!"

Evelyn raised a hand to silence him, her eyes locked on Vincent.

Vincent gritted his teeth. "What are your conditions?"

"First—you die before revealing my identity." Her voice was glacial. "Second—keep living as you are now. For this month, I'll be watching."

Without another word, she walked away.

Zachary shot Vincent a venomous glare before following.

Vincent stood frozen.

Evelyn was the heiress of Sterling Manor.

And he? Nothing but a pathetic joke.

Slap!

A stinging blow snapped him back to reality.

"Father!" Vincent clutched his cheek. "Do you enjoy hitting me that much?"

Ashcroft Sr. snarled, "I swallowed my pride to beg for the Ashcroft family's sake. With you like this, we'll be ruined!"

"You really think so little of me?"

"Prove me wrong!" Ashcroft Sr. scoffed. "Aside from Adrian Valentine, which of your so-called friends is reliable? The business world is a battlefield—you wouldn't even see your death coming!"

"If you want redemption, follow the Young Mistress. She began training at three, took over a company by eleven. Adrian's success? All her strategic maneuvering behind the scenes."

Vincent suddenly asked, "Then why did she marry Adrian?"
###Chapter 225

Vincent Ashcroft Sr. gripped his son's shoulder with a heavy hand, his gaze profound. "Stop asking why. Evelyn chose Adrian for her own reasons."

He adjusted his cuffs deliberately, voice measured. "Evelyn began specialized training at three. By eighteen, she'd earned multiple doctorates. Her achievements are beyond your comprehension."

"Her relationship with Adrian is none of your concern. The affair was his choice alone."

Vincent gestured for his son to sit, lowering his voice. "You want to know why Evelyn married Adrian? It traces back to Alexander Durand. The entire Tang family was wiped out overnight in Lyon. Alexander and Evelyn shared an unbreakable bond."

"Rumors say the Sterling Manor heiress vanished for four years hunting the perpetrators."

"If even the Tangs fell, what chance did our family have? This outcome is the best we could hope for. Stay away from Vincent Langley."

Vincent Ashcroft's eyes flashed with confusion. "But Adrian—"

"Focus on yourself!" his father snapped. "You can't even protect yourself now."

Did his foolish son still not understand? Only strength could prevent them from being pawns.

"Father... are you saying whoever destroyed the Tangs also targeted us?" Realization sharpened Vincent's gaze.

The Langley family. Their methods were too sophisticated to detect.

"Exactly." Vincent nodded. "The technology I possess is what Vincent Langley covets most. That man operates in both shadows and light, specializing in proxy warfare."

"When you enter Falcon Training Camp, I'll transfer the technology to you. Remember—aligning with Evelyn is your only path to survival."

Vincent studied his father's graying temples, jaw tight. "What must I do? What trial did the heiress mention?"

Vincent Sr. narrowed his eyes. "Rebirth through near-death. With our family's fall, every fair-weather friend will kick us. This trial will force you to see reality."

"Decide what you truly want. Your future depends solely on your own efforts."

Vincent clenched his fists. He'd never imagined the Ashcrofts could fall so far.

"I understand." He gave a resolute nod. "I'll pass the test."

"One more thing," his father warned. "Don't presume affection from Evelyn. To her, those who don't matter are invisible."

Vincent remained silent.

......

Inside the black sedan, Zachary Deross couldn't resist asking, "Boss, why give the Ashcrofts a chance? That Vincent is hopeless."

Evelyn gazed out the window, tone even. "I owe Vincent Sr. a debt. Whether his son proves worthy is up to him."

Zachary scoffed. "He won't last a month under your trial."

Evelyn said nothing, fingertips tapping the glass.

"Monitor him closely this month," she instructed quietly. "Report everything."
###Chapter 226

A ruthless glint flashed in Zachary's eyes. "Good!"

He wanted to see how long that bastard could last.

News of the Roland Group's overnight collapse spread like wildfire across the internet.

The top ten trending topics were all explosive headlines about "Roland Bankruptcy" and "Langley Acquisition."

Vincent Langley sat on his leather sofa, crushing his cigar between his fingers.

He had just swallowed the Roland family's fortune, only to lose a diamond mine worth billions.

"Those damn blueprints from Alexander!" he hissed through gritted teeth.

The diamonds had come too easily—now they were nothing but trouble.

On the very first day of mining, they were robbed.

The men Vincent sent to investigate had vanished without a trace.

Everyone in the underworld knew Vincent Langley's reputation.

Yet someone had the audacity to strike right under his nose.

What infuriated him most was not even knowing who his enemy was.

The black-clad assailants were highly trained, all wearing identical wolf-emblazoned combat boots, their attacks ruthless and precise.

He had anticipated the mining operation would attract greedy eyes.

That's why he had partnered with Director Harrison to tighten security, setting up layers of defenses.

Yet they were still cleaned out.

The first mining haul had earned him half a billion.

The second cost him three billion.

Vincent paced the living room, his expression dark.

"Must you keep circling like that?" Eleanor massaged her temples. "We'll hear when there's news."

She had just undergone a laser facial treatment, her skin glowing and flawless.

Her Chanel suit accentuated her commanding presence.

Vincent dropped onto the couch. "In all my years, I've never taken a loss like this!"

Eleanor cared about three things above all: money, face, and beauty.

Her lips thinned. "If even you can't find out who did this, who can? Three billion gone—I won't sleep tonight."

"Where's Isabella?" Vincent suddenly asked.

Eleanor's expression shifted.

She'd been preoccupied with her young assistant lately, barely sparing a thought for her daughter.

"With Margaret Valentine," she deflected. "Adrian still hasn't proposed after a year. Our Isabella isn't some desperate fool."

Vincent smirked confidently. "Relax. Margaret is more anxious than we are."

"You're sure about that?" Eleanor arched a brow.
###Chapter 227

Vincent Langley's eyes gleamed as he took a sip of tea. "Adrian Valentine dotes on Isabella, and Margaret Valentine favors our daughter. If this marriage succeeds, our business in Vienna will flourish."

She pursed her lips. If not for the benefits, she would never tolerate that cold-faced tyrant.

Every time he visited, he wore that icy expression—as if the world owed him a fortune.

"But what if his intentions aren't genuine? We should be cautious, especially after what happened back then—"

Vincent cut her off with a cold laugh. "He was just a child back then. What could he possibly know? I leave no traces. Even if Adrian investigates, he'll find nothing."

His confidence silenced her.

——

Night deepened, neon lights pulsing in the bar.

Bodies writhed on the dance floor, moving to deafening music.

When Vincent Ashcroft received the invitation, he almost declined. But suffocating in that cramped apartment drove him out.

Pushing open the VIP room door, he found his old crowd drowning in liquor and women.

The scene tightened his throat.

A year had passed since he last indulged in such luxury.

Lucien Croix lounged on the leather sofa, black shirt unbuttoned at the collar, his buzz cut gleaming under the lights.

"Well, if it isn't the mighty Vincent Ashcroft." He swirled his glass, lips curling mockingly. "Fallen so low, yet you came running. Here to beg or grovel?"

Vincent frowned. "What's that supposed to mean?"

A playboy nearby sneered, arm around a scantily clad woman. "Stop pretending. You're out of our league now. Be a good dog and pour us drinks—maybe we'll throw you scraps."

Vincent's face darkened.

"Lucien! When your family's finances collapsed, my father lent you thirty million! This is how you repay us?"

Lucien burst into laughter.

"Business is war. Fewer competitors mean bigger slices." Leaning closer, malice glinted in his eyes. "Gratitude is one thing—but I won't just watch your downfall. I'll make sure the Ashcrofts never rise again."

The words struck like lightning.

Once, Vincent had been the most admired among them.

Now, with Adrian Valentine withdrawing support, the Ashcrofts were truly finished.

At that moment, he finally understood his father's words about the fickleness of the world.
###Chapter 228

Vincent Ashcroft stood at the VIP room entrance, his fingers digging deep into his palms.

He watched the four men inside clinking glasses, his heart feeling as if it were being sliced open by a dull blade.

"Lucien Croix, from this day forward, we're through."

His voice was ice-cold.

Raucous laughter erupted in the private room.

Lucien swirled his wine glass with a mocking smirk. "Vincent, do you really think someone like you still deserves to call us brothers?"

He gestured to the lavish surroundings. "This private suite alone costs 150K. Can you even afford it?"

Vincent's throat tightened.

His wallet held less than 50K.

"Cat got your tongue?" Lucien strode forward and abruptly flung the red wine in his face.

The dark liquid dripped from Vincent's hair.

"You're dead!" Rage ignited in Vincent's eyes.

Lucien only laughed harder, jabbing a finger at his chest. "Look at you. Not even worth Adrian Valentine's pinky finger."

"He turned Valentine Group into the industry's second-largest in three years. And you? A worthless failure!"

Vincent's fist moved faster than thought.

Thud!

Lucien staggered back, blood trickling from his lip.

"Consider that a down payment." Vincent turned on his heel. "This isn't over."

He had to restrain himself.

The time for reckoning hadn't come yet.

Evelyn Roland had just dried her hair when her phone lit up.

Zachary Deross's video clearly showed Vincent's humiliated state.

She smirked.

She hadn't expected him to endure it this far.

"Mommy!"

Felicia rushed over, clutching a glittering diamond.

Evelyn caught her daughter with a laugh, then scooped up Ethan.

"My little treasure hunter. Did Great-grandfather buy you another toy?"

Gabrielle Flores entered with towels. "Evelyn, Christian Lefèvre showed signs of movement today."

Evelyn froze.

"What kind?"

"His fingers twitched." Gabrielle lowered her voice. "I wanted you to verify it."

Evelyn handed the children to Gabrielle.

That suspicious fire—it was time to uncover the truth.
###Chapter 229

Gabrielle wiped Christian's hands while speaking to Evelyn. "His fingers twitched three times today. His eyelids fluttered twice."

"Could he be in a vegetative state? It's been over four hundred days."

"I massage his muscles daily. At least his physique is maintained. If this continues for years, he'll be skin and bones when he wakes."

The light in Evelyn's eyes dimmed. She had hoped for improvement.

"These are just normal reflexes for coma patients. Unless he sits up and speaks, there's no real progress. But eyelid movement is something. Maybe in three to five years..."

Gabrielle nearly crushed the towel in her hand.

She'd been caring for this sleeping beauty for over a year.

Several more years of this?

Unbearable.

"When he wakes, I'm charging full market rate for nursing care. Not a penny less."

This wasn't charity work.

Though his face was distractingly handsome.

Money mattered more.

Even beauty fades.

Humming, Gabrielle went to draw the children's bath.

Evelyn chuckled at her irritated expression. "Charge whatever. He can afford it."

Gabrielle mentally calculated her fees.

Still uneasy, Evelyn bathed the children, handed them to Gabrielle, and descended to the basement.

Christian lay motionless. The image of the fire and his agonized expression surfaced. She decided to stop investigating.

Some truths were his to uncover.

Checking his pulse, she noted slight strengthening since last month.

But awakening remained distant.

"Christian, ICU costs a fortune daily. Even your wealth has limits. Can you hear me? If so, wake up."

"Hiding solves nothing. If you choose eternal sleep, I'll walk away. I saved you for vengeance."

"Who set the fire?"

"Who caused this pain?"

Evelyn turned to leave.

She missed the tear tracing Christian's temple.

Upstairs, she sent Gabrielle to rest. Cradling both children, she fell asleep.

Three days later.

Evelyn played with the kids in the yard. Sebastian had just left when Zachary rushed in.

"Boss! Vincent is losing it! Their latest dig yielded worthless stones! Harrison's imperial jade sold for 300 million!"

Leaning back on the wicker chair, Evelyn smiled.

Everything proceeded as planned.
###Chapter 230

Evelyn rose gracefully and handed little Sophia to Gabrielle.

A knowing smile curved her lips. "Vincent will be looking for me at tonight's gala."

Gabrielle cradled Ethan, concern flickering in her eyes.

Evelyn turned to Zachary. "Tell Nathan to get ready."

Zachary nodded in understanding. "Understood, boss."

The Imperial Palace Hotel glittered with lights.

Evelyn arrived on Nathan's arm, elegant and poised.

Her cream silk gown accentuated her porcelain skin.

Nathan looked striking in his tailored black suit.

At the entrance, they crossed paths with Sebastian Orlando.

The trio entered together, instantly commanding attention.

Sebastian exuded an innate aristocratic aura.

His enigmatic charm was impossible to ignore.

Conversations in the ballroom momentarily hushed.

Adrian Valentine stood prominently beside Isabella Langley.

Their matching black formalwear made them stand out.

Adrian's tall frame towered over the crowd.

His gaze briefly met Evelyn's.

She coolly averted her eyes, her expression detached.

Her heart had long grown still.

Especially after the incident with Vincent Ashcroft. She had truly moved on.

Vincent Langley hurried forward.

"Evelyn, perfect timing." His smile was paternal.

She inclined her head slightly, revealing nothing.

A flash of lethal intent crossed Sebastian's eyes before vanishing.

"This must be Mr. Orlando. As impressive as they say."

Vincent studied Sebastian, certain he hadn't imagined that momentary chill.

"You flatter me, Mr. Langley." Sebastian's tone remained even.

"What an honor to meet you!"

Vincent's eyes gleamed with calculation.

"Mr. Aldridge, Mr. Orlando, we've prepared specialty dishes. Why not take your seats?"

He turned to Evelyn. "I'd like a word with my daughter."

Nathan frowned. "Say what you need to here."

His gaze hardened meaningfully. "To avoid any... unfortunate misunderstandings."
###Chapter 231

Vincent Langley immediately thumped his chest in assurance. "Don't worry, Mr. Aldridge. Such a thing would never happen."

Evelyn arched a brow at Nathan. Did she look that easy to bully?

Just as she was about to speak, Cassandra Valentine stormed over in her stilettos.

"Evelyn Roland, how dare you show your face here?" Cassandra looked down her nose at her. "A parentless orphan, a mere assistant, sneaking into high society's banquet?"

Nearby guests turned to watch the spectacle—the Valentine heiress picking another fight.

Cassandra had been simmering with rage all evening. After Julian Roscente discovered she'd drugged him that night, he'd cut all contact.

All because of Evelyn's meddling!

"Since when do I need your permission?" Evelyn met her glare coldly.

"Of course it concerns me!" Cassandra shrilled. "Which proper lady here would tolerate sharing space with trash like you? You're dragging down the entire event!"

Her pretty face twisted with malice.

Isabella Langley smirked inwardly. Humiliating Evelyn in public would force her to hand over the money.

Evelyn saw right through her. Using her as a punching bag? Dream on.

"Oh? And you're so refined?" Evelyn chuckled. "What brand of trash bag are you? You hold so much."

A few socialites nearby snorted with laughter.

"You—!" Cassandra trembled with rage. "You're just a discarded bitch! How dare you act so arrogant!"

"What I do is none of your damn business." Evelyn narrowed her eyes. "But you? Your methods with men are quite...wild, aren't they?"

Cassandra paled.

"Mind your image, Miss Valentine." Evelyn feigned concern. "This shrew act is scaring off all the eligible bachelors."

So Julian had exposed her. She was bitter about her ruined scheme.

Cassandra glanced around frantically, spotting several heirs whispering and pointing. Panic set in.

That night at the hotel...she might have gone too far...

"Evelyn, how could you slander Miss Valentine like that?" Isabella cut in smoothly.

Evelyn's gaze turned glacial. "Slander? Should I show the evidence?"

Isabella choked.

Vincent frowned. "Enough of this!"

"Enough?" Evelyn scoffed. "Who started it? Your precious Miss Valentine."

Meeting her icy stare, Vincent stiffened. Since when did a country girl have such piercing eyes?

Cassandra shot Evelyn a venomous glare before fleeing in disgrace.

The scandal spread through elite circles instantly.

Listening to the murmurs, Isabella cursed Cassandra's incompetence. She glared at Evelyn—why was this bitch so hard to crush?

Noticing her stare, Evelyn turned to Vincent. "Didn't you have something to say, Mr. Langley? Shall we discuss it here?"
###Chapter 232

Adrian Valentine frowned slightly, his gaze locked onto Evelyn Roland's retreating figure.

Vincent Langley held only a few remaining pages of the manuscript. He would stop at nothing to extract Alexander Durand's secrets from Evelyn.

But she didn't even spare him a glance.

Sebastian Orlando lowered his voice. "Evelyn, that old fox—"

"Sebastian, wait here with them."

Evelyn pointed to the empty floor-to-ceiling window in the corner.

"Mr. Langley, a word in private." She strode toward the window without hesitation.

Harrison Macmillan immediately followed, unwilling to let Vincent gain the upper hand.

The three stood by the window, the space around them conspicuously vacant.

Onlookers held their breaths, watching the tense exchange unfold.

"Evelyn, do you have any other manuscripts?" Vincent cut straight to the chase.

She shook her head, a cold glint flashing in her eyes. "Weren't they always in your possession?"

She lowered her lashes to conceal the murderous intent swirling within.

Vincent's brow furrowed. She wasn't wrong.

Those photographs had been found among Alexander's limited belongings after his death.

Harrison's voice turned grave. "With the manuscripts exhausted, we must locate that map now."

Vincent's piercing stare remained fixed on Evelyn.

Her expression remained impassive. "I can't help you. The map surfaced at the Roscente auction. Over a year of searching has yielded nothing."

She relished watching these vipers turn on each other.

Harrison's background was just as complex as Vincent's. Their alliance was temporary—what would happen when their interests diverged?

"Evelyn, are you certain there are no other leads?" Vincent's suspicion was palpable.

Another shake of her head. "I didn't see him at all during his final three months."

Those months had been spent completing her final evaluation at Falcon Training Camp.

By the time she emerged, Alexander was already gone.

Her world had shattered in that moment.

The brother who always called her "Evelyn" with affectionate exasperation would never scold her for neglecting her health again.

A sheen of moisture flickered in her eyes before vanishing instantly.

Vincent and Harrison exchanged a loaded glance, united by greed.

Evelyn was now their only key to finding the map.

"Evelyn, you must assist me with this." Vincent adopted a solemn tone. "It was Alexander's dying wish."

She feigned surprise. "His wish?"

"Of course. He scoured the earth for those rare violet diamonds to gift his beloved."

Vincent studied her reaction closely. Surely this sentimental ploy would sway her.
###Chapter 233

Evelyn's brow furrowed slightly as her fingers tapped lightly on the table.

The Violet Diamond?

Alexander's beloved woman?

He had never mentioned her before.

"Mr. Langley, I'll keep an eye out for any leads. I'll do everything I can to fulfill Alexander's wish," Evelyn said softly.

Vincent Langley narrowed his eyes in satisfaction.

This was exactly the kind of obedient pawn he needed.

Harrison Macmillan chimed in at the perfect moment. "Evelyn, the three billion was just the beginning. Once we locate the ore, your share will be substantial."

A cold smile tugged at Evelyn's lips.

Three billion couldn't even buy the blueprint.

These two men were equally hypocritical.

"You're too kind, Mr. Macmillan. Finding the blueprint is our priority," she murmured, lowering her lashes to hide the icy glint in her eyes.

Seeing his objective achieved, Vincent rose to leave.

"Young people should enjoy themselves."

Evelyn remained alone on the terrace.

The night breeze brushed through her hair.

Sebastian Orlando approached with a tray bearing her favorite seafood salad.

"Care for a bite?"

His voice was so gentle it almost felt surreal.

Something about his tone struck Evelyn as eerily familiar.

"Thank you," she replied, settling into a white wicker chair.

They spoke in hushed tones.

Nearby, Adrian Valentine clenched his champagne glass.

His gaze burned into Sebastian as he peeled shrimp for Evelyn.

Once upon a time, that had been his privilege.

No one knew Evelyn's preferences better than he did.

A simple meal of shrimp and greens had always been her greatest comfort.

Now, all her joys belonged to someone else.

"Forgive me, there's an urgent matter," Sebastian suddenly stood.

Evelyn noticed the tension in his expression. "Do you need help?"

"Next time, I promise." He hurried away.

Inside the ballroom, Nathan Aldridge was mingling with guests.

Evelyn made her way to the lounge alone.

The sound of the closing door echoed through the empty hallway.

Leaning back on the sofa, she finally let her mask slip.
###Chapter 234

Evelyn tapped her phone screen lightly.

[Where's Vincent tonight?]

Zachary replied instantly: [At the Imperial Palace Hotel banquet, boss.]

A faint smile curved Evelyn's lips.

So he was there too.

She switched to messaging Gabrielle.

[How are the kids behaving today?]

Gabrielle responded quickly: [Perfect angels. Though the siblings just had a little fight.]

Evelyn massaged her temples.

Angels?

Felicia was downright tyrannical—she'd slapped her brother the moment he touched her toy.

Ethan just sulked and let his sister have her way.

Evelyn sighed.

Her son would grow up to be such a sweetheart.

But this daily brawling had to stop.

She'd fought often with Alexander and the others as a child too.

Sebastian had always protected her.

Eventually, Alexander learned to shield her as well.

Her fingers brushed the crescent-shaped scar beneath her eye.

Alexander's parting gift.

She typed another message.

[Don't indulge Felicia's hitting. We need to correct that.]

Gabrielle replied: [Don't worry, sis. Sibling rivalry is normal at this age. I'll guide them properly.]

Evelyn shook her head in amusement.

Gabrielle sounded like a parenting expert.

What a waste she wasn't running a kindergarten.

As she waited for Nathan's reply, a familiar icy fragrance drifted over.

She looked up into Adrian's penetrating gaze.

Evelyn edged away.

"What scheme are you plotting now, Mr. Valentine?"

Adrian's eyes flickered.

"I had nothing to do with last time."

Her laugh was brittle.

"For Isabella, you'd cross every line."

She made to leave.

Adrian caught her wrist.

"In such a hurry?"

He leaned in abruptly.

His palm grazed her curves by accident.

One brow arched.

"Darling, are you... blossoming again?"

Evelyn's face burned crimson.

"Adrian Valentine! That's sexual harassment!"
###Chapter 235

Adrian's palm felt noticeably broader than before.

Evelyn, still in her lactation period, felt the weight of her chest pressing heavily against his hand.

"Call the police?" Adrian held his phone before her, his lips curling into a dangerous smirk. "Go ahead."

Evelyn scoffed. "Is Isabella not enough for you? Are you so desperate you'd harass your ex-wife?"

She shoved him with all her strength.

The man didn't budge. Instead, he pulled her closer.

"Darling," his deep, magnetic voice dripped with temptation, "when have you ever won against me?"

His warm lips brushed against her earlobe.

Evelyn tensed, wishing she could kick him into orbit.

"Darling?" She laughed bitterly. "Adrian, you should get your head examined. We're divorced. Understand?"

"I have a suitable marriage prospect now. Stay away from me."

"Don't call me 'darling.' It's disgusting."

She couldn't comprehend it.

Isabella was the one he cherished, yet he always sought her out.

Adrian's eyes frosted over instantly.

Her familiar scent drove him mad—hating her ruthlessness yet craving her desperately.

His Adam's apple bobbed as he pressed closer.

"Marriage prospect?" His voice turned icy. "Sebastian? Or Nathan?"

Evelyn thought of Nathan's gentle gaze and raised a challenging brow. "None of your business. What are we besides exes?"

"You remember being my wife," his voice darkened, "but you never realized how cruel you could be."

His chest felt like it was weighed down by a boulder.

"Cruel?" Evelyn swallowed the bitterness in her throat. "That word suits you and Isabella better."

"Let me show you something." She pulled out her phone. "See how repulsive you both are."

A shrill female voice erupted from the video:
"This is Mr. Valentine's company! Next time Evelyn shows up, humiliate her to death!"
"Mr. Valentine can't stand her clinging to him!"
"Ms. Langley is so lucky—her private jet is stunning!"

Adrian's brows furrowed.

So Isabella was behind this.

"Evelyn," he suddenly chuckled darkly, "aren't you seducing me right now?"

He hated her betrayal even more than her lies.

It had started as a bet, but he'd fallen for her.

Evelyn stared at him like he was insane. "Adrian, you're sick. Get out!"
###Chapter 236

"Get away from me!" Evelyn struggled desperately, but couldn't break free from Adrian's iron grip.

"You'll never escape me." His arms tightened around her.

Evelyn let out a bitter laugh, her nails digging into her palms.

"Don't touch me with those filthy hands that have been all over another woman."

Adrian's expression darkened, remembering the disgust on her face when he'd last kissed her.

"Did you forget everything I just said?" His voice was low, eyes burning.

"Till death do us part? Never letting go?" Her lips curled in mockery. "Adrian Valentine, you don't deserve that."

"Remember that slap you gave me for your grandmother's shares?"

"That slap shattered my heart."

A sharp pain shot through Adrian's chest, spreading through his entire body.

He watched her silently, throat working.

That moment of impulse still haunted him—the scar from the chopstick piercing his palm hadn't even healed.

Seizing his distraction, Evelyn shoved him away hard.

The sudden emptiness in his arms made Adrian's eyes flash dangerously. "Come back here."

"Like hell!" She swung her handbag at him. "Who do you think you are? Calling every woman 'wife'?"

"To me, you're just pathetic."

"Dumping me then crawling back—are you insane?"

"Ganging up with your precious first love to bully me—I must've been blind!"

"Stay away. The stench of trash makes me sick."

Her rage boiled over as she kept hitting him with the bag.

Adrian had never seen this fiery side of her—and found it strangely captivating.

The knot in his chest suddenly loosened.

"Stop." He dodged with a frown. "That bag hurts."

"Hurts?" Her eyes reddened. "Did you care when you hit me?"

"Looked down on me for being an orphan? Did I ever take a penny from you?"

"No dowry at our wedding. Every deal I closed on my own. What right did you have to treat me like that?"

The bag struck his back with a thud. He grunted, his unhealed wound throbbing.

Her words made him freeze.

"You refused my money... because you never loved me?" His gaze turned icy.

Evelyn's arm ached from swinging. His question struck her as absurd.

She staggered back, confusion clouding her eyes.

"What counts as love? If none of that was enough..."

"Then maybe I really don't know how to love."

Tears blurred her vision as she met his intense stare.

She'd given everything to this marriage.

Quick to master any skill, yet love remained the one lesson she couldn't learn.

"I'm sorry." Her voice trembled. "If that wasn't love..."

"Perhaps I was never meant to understand it."

With those final words, she turned and walked away, her unsteady figure disappearing into the distance.
###Chapter 237

Adrian Valentine listened as Evelyn Roland's footsteps faded away. Her words "I don't know how to love" stabbed his heart like a sharp blade.

His entire body trembled. His fingertips turned ice cold.

He was the one who had destroyed her ability to love.

He had fallen for her first. How dare she marry someone else?

Adrian sat rigidly in place, his gaze dark and stormy. Yet the corners of his lips curled into a sinister smirk.

Outside, Evelyn clutched her chest as searing pain tore through her.

She pressed a hand over her heart, struggling to breathe.

Only Adrian could hurt her this deeply.

"Evelyn, what are you doing here? Where's Adrian?"

Isabella Langley and her agent suddenly appeared.

Evelyn quickly wiped her tears and fixed them with a cold stare.

The agent, Giselle Valois, had been arranged by Vincent Langley.

With her sleek short hair and glittering diamond earrings, Giselle appeared sharp and professional—but hid dangerous secrets beneath that polished exterior.

Evelyn knew better. No one around Vincent Langley was simple.

Including Giselle. Her credentials looked clean, but her true depths were unfathomable.

"Why ask me about your fiancé's whereabouts?" Evelyn turned to leave.

Giselle blocked her path. "Evelyn, know your place. You don't belong in high society, let alone with Sebastian Orlando. Mr. Cortez only pities you."

"Do your job as an assistant. Don't embarrass the Langley family."

Evelyn scoffed.

More psychological manipulation.

Did Vincent really think he could isolate her by weaponizing her background?

He had miscalculated.

Now that she knew he'd murdered Alexander Durand, she would personally send him to hell.

"Who do you think you are?" Evelyn met Giselle's gaze head-on.

Giselle lifted her chin. "I'm Isabella's agent."

"My relationships are none of your concern." Evelyn's eyes flashed with warning. "Worry about yourself."

Giselle's face flushed with anger.

"Evelyn, Giselle means well," Isabella interjected with fake concern. "Don't get abandoned by another man—"

"Enough!" Evelyn cut her off sharply. "The real disgrace is the homewrecker. Don't make me expose you."

Isabella hated when she brought this up.

"We're getting married soon," Isabella taunted with a smirk. "The one who isn't loved is the real outsider. Adrian loves me. You were just a plaything."
###Chapter 238

Flames of fury burned in Evelyn Roland's eyes.

She held Adrian Valentine and Isabella Langley's secrets in her grasp, but what good did it do?

None.

Not when Adrian could shatter her with three simple words: "I love you."

The pain was excruciating, like a blade piercing her heart.

She could barely breathe.

The agony made her restless, furious.

"Isn't this heartbreaking, Evelyn?" Isabella arched a perfectly groomed brow, looking down at her with disdain. "This is just the beginning. I'll make sure you suffer even more. Now get lost."

Evelyn was a shadow of herself—humiliated, defeated.

Without a word, she turned and walked away.

Giselle Valois watched Evelyn's retreating figure and lowered her voice. "Isabella, that woman needs to disappear. She's a ticking time bomb. If the truth about your interference gets out, the consequences will be disastrous."

Isabella wanted nothing more than to eliminate Evelyn, but the opportunity never seemed to present itself.

"Every plan we've tried has failed, Giselle. This time, we used Vincent Ashcroft against her, and instead, it backfired—his family went bankrupt."

"That idiot Vincent," Isabella scoffed, her lips curling in contempt.

"Once your father has squeezed every last bit of value from her, he'll dispose of her," Giselle said, her eyes glinting with calculation. "Now that the Ashcrofts are under our control, as long as they surrender their core technology, their company can be revived."

"Your father's strategy—using others to do his dirty work—is truly brilliant."

Isabella glanced around warily. "Not here. I just saw Adrian heading this way. Let's go find him."

The moment they disappeared around the corner, Vincent Ashcroft emerged from the shadows.

His gaze burned with hatred as he stared at Isabella's retreating back.

So it was all the Langleys' scheme.

Vincent turned toward the private lounge where Adrian was waiting and knocked.

The door opened, and Adrian frowned at the sight of him.

"Disappointed to see me?" Vincent smirked coldly.

Adrian studied the man before him. In just a few days, Vincent had changed—his usual recklessness now tempered with a dangerous calm.

"Or were you expecting your fiancée instead?" Vincent strode past him and dropped onto the sofa.

"You heard everything?" Adrian's voice was low.

A flicker of murderous intent flashed in Vincent's eyes. "Every word. Adrian, she's your woman now, so I can't touch her. But in six months—"

He stood abruptly, suddenly remembering Evelyn—her cold elegance, her unyielding pride.

"I've realized Evelyn has her own appeal. If I ever rise again, I'll pursue her properly."

"Vincent!" Adrian's voice turned icy.

"In six months, I'll make sure you both pay in blood." Vincent's smile was mocking. "A scumbag and a bitch—what a perfect match. Consider this an early wedding gift, since—"

"—women as 'virtuous' as Isabella are hard to come by."

Without another glance, he walked out.

Adrian remained still, his expression unreadable.

Was this what he had wanted?

To watch everyone he cared about drift further and further away.
###Chapter 239

Evelyn strode through the banquet hall in her stilettos, scanning every corner. Where had that glutton Nathan disappeared to now? She sighed inwardly.

Crystal chandeliers cast shimmering light over clinking glasses and perfumed guests. Many admiring glances followed her striking beauty. She exchanged brief pleasantries with acquaintances before resuming her search.

Ten minutes passed with no sign of Nathan. She pulled out her phone and sent a message. The screen remained dark—no reply.

"Time to go home." Thoughts of her waiting children made her turn toward the lounge.

The corridor's quiet was a relief after the noisy ballroom. At the far end, a cluster of men caught her attention.

Evelyn narrowed her eyes. She'd witnessed enough bullying scenes to recognize one instantly. Just as she turned to leave, a familiar name froze her in place.

"Vincent Ashcroft, you mangy mutt!" Lucien Croix's sneering voice echoed down the hall. "We have unfinished business from that bar incident."

"Fortune's wheel turns, Lucien." Vincent's voice held terrifying calm. "Let's see how long your luck lasts."

A dull thud. Vincent crumpled to the floor but kept his head raised defiantly.

Lucien loomed over him, grinding a polished shoe into Vincent's ribs. "My luck lasts forever! While you'll always grovel like the dog you are!"

His lackeys closed in with kicks and punches. Vincent shielded his head—then locked eyes with Evelyn through the gaps between his fingers.

She remained motionless. Watched as Vincent's resistance weakened under the assault. Yet his gaze burned brighter with each blow.

"Pathetic!" Lucien spat. "Heard you're sweet on Cassandra Valentine?"

Vincent's body tensed.

"Too bad," Lucien taunted. "She warmed my bed last night. Think a penniless wretch like you could ever impress her?"

Vincent's nails dug bloody crescents into his palms. Evelyn caught the murderous glint in his eyes—quickly extinguished.

"Beat him senseless!" Lucien ordered. Fists rained down like hail.

Finally, Evelyn moved. The sharp click of her heels made the attackers freeze. When she stepped into the light, stunned silence fell.

"M-Miss Roland?" Lucien stammered.

She ignored him, kneeling beside Vincent. Delicate fingers tilted his battered face upward, examining each wound with clinical precision.

"Does it hurt?" Her whisper was deceptively soft.

Vincent's pupils dilated violently.
###Chapter 240

Evelyn's words echoed in his ears like a curse.

"For the woman you love, for your best friend, you deserve this. But is she really worth it? We'll see."

He felt all strength drain from his body.

Vincent sprang up from the ground.

"Ah—" A feral roar tore from his throat.

"Lucien Croix, go to hell!" He swung his fist with lethal intent, charging into the crowd.

Thud! Lucien took the brutal punch to his face, doubling over in pain.

Screams erupted around them.

Lucien stared at the enraged Vincent, fear coiling in his gut.

Even the ruthless fear the suicidal.

Vincent had become a rabid dog.

"Vincent, you lunatic! I'll make sure you rot in prison!"

"Enough." Adrian's voice cut through the air like an ice blade.

Evelyn frowned slightly.

Lucien shrank back at the sight of Adrian. "Mr. Valentine... We were just—"

"Get out." Adrian's gaze was razor-sharp. "If I see you again, you'll be banished from Vienna by dawn."

Lucien didn't dare protest, scrambling to his feet.

"Move!"

The group fled in disgrace.

Adrian fixed Vincent with a suffocating glare.

"Vincent, you brought this upon yourself."

"You deserve this."

Vincent wiped blood from his lips, laughing wildly. "You're right, Adrian. I deserve this."

His eyes darted to where Evelyn had stood—she was gone.

"Evelyn! Evelyn!"

Vincent limped after her, dragging his injured leg.

Adrian's expression darkened as he followed swiftly.

——

Underground parking garage.

Evelyn was about to enter her car when Vincent blocked her path.

"Something to say?" Her tone was frosty.

Vincent gritted through the pain. "Miss Roland, what is the test? I want to join Falcon Training Camp as soon as possible."

His entire body trembled, veins bulging on his hands.

Evelyn studied him.

Impressive intensity.

But not desperate enough.

She crossed her arms, looking down at him. "Vincent, do you know what people do when they're truly desperate?"

He froze. "What do you mean?"

A faint smile touched her lips. "I said one month—no early exits. As long as hope exists, despair never comes."

Vincent pleaded urgently, "Miss Roland, please tell me what I must do!"
###Chapter 241

Evelyn looked up at him. "The test hasn't started yet. Wait for Zachary's notice."

"Understood!" Vincent clenched his fists, his gaze resolute.

Evelyn turned toward the car door.

Vincent stepped ahead and pulled it open, shielding her head with his palm.

"Careful," he said softly.

Evelyn paused mid-step. The once-arrogant young master of the Ashcroft family was now uncharacteristically deferential.

She pressed her lips together and slid into the car.

Zachary pressed the accelerator, and the black sedan rolled away.

Vincent remained standing, spitting out a mouthful of blood.

"Still waiting..." He wiped the corner of his mouth.

His father had warned him—countless eyes would be watching him this month. Only after passing the evaluation could he enter Falcon Training Camp.

In just a few days, he'd tasted the fickleness of the world.

Those who once fawned over him now avoided him like the plague.

"Vincent?" Adrian emerged from the shadows.

Vincent lifted his gaze. "Something you need, Mr. Valentine?"

"What were you doing just now?" Adrian's eyes were sharp.

Vincent scoffed. "Adrian, any regrets about the divorce?"

Adrian's fingers tightened.

"Who is she?" He stared at Vincent.

Vincent raised a brow. "Your ex-wife. What, only now that you're divorced do you care to ask?"

He took a step closer. "Honestly, I should thank you. If you hadn't let her go, I wouldn't have had a chance."

Adrian's expression turned icy.

"Get lost," he said, voice frigid.

Vincent laughed loudly as he walked away.

Adrian stood rooted in place, his chest tight.

"Drink?" Julian appeared out of nowhere.

Adrian nodded silently.

"Your place," Julian suggested.

Adrian turned and strode off, his phone vibrating in his pocket.

Julian glanced at it. "Isabella?"

"Shut up," Adrian warned, his tone dangerous.

Julian shrugged. "Someone's in a mood."

They arrived at the villa.

Julian scanned the surroundings. "Still living here?"

Adrian's hand paused as he uncorked the bottle.

"I thought you'd have moved in with Isabella by now," Julian continued.

A glass slammed onto the table.

"Looking to die?" Adrian's eyes darkened.

Julian wisely kept quiet.

Outside, the moonlight was cold and indifferent.
###Chapter 242

Adrian Valentine was consumed by fury.

He strode to the wine cabinet and retrieved a bottle of aged Romanée-Conti.

The crimson liquid swirled in the crystal glass as he wordlessly slid one toward Julian Roscente.

Julian took a sip. "Adrian, I've uncovered the truth about last time. Isabella Langley and Cassandra Valentine conspired together."

Adrian's gaze remained fixed on the night outside the window. "My family affairs are none of your concern."

Julian's grip tightened around his glass.

"Is she worth it?" His voice was low.

Adrian finally turned, his eyes sharp as blades. "You've crossed a line."

The air turned icy.

Julian gave a bitter laugh. "The recent events with the Ashcrofts made one thing clear—the mastermind is making their move."

"But someone seems to know the truth." His tone was pointed.

Adrian frowned. "Who?"

"Evelyn Roland." Julian drained his glass. "She predicted the danger twice."

Adrian's knuckles whitened. "She's just an ordinary woman."

"Is she?" Julian countered meaningfully.

Adrian fell silent. He knew better than anyone—that woman's secrets ran deeper than he imagined.

Evelyn had just stepped through her front door when Zachary Deross sidled up with a mischievous grin.

"Boss, sent the video to your phone." He winked. "It's... explosive. Recommend watching it alone."

Evelyn arched a brow. "You watched it?"

Zachary's ears turned red instantly. "Live footage... Old Jiang's got stamina."

Evelyn's face flushed, and she turned on her heel.

Behind her, Zachary burst into laughter.

"Still so innocent, Boss!" he called after her.

Without looking back, Evelyn raised her middle finger.

As she entered the living room, Nathan Aldridge's call came through.

"The tea exhibition is set." His voice was cheerful. "When are you 'borrowing' the old man's prized collection?"

Evelyn sighed. "Why does it have to be stealing?"

She glanced at her grandfather, happily playing with the two children.

"Don't worry. I have a plan." She ended the call and walked toward them with a smile.

"Grandpa, I'm home."
###Chapter 243

Frederick Roland's eyes crinkled with laughter. "Evelyn, you're finally back. These two little rascals keep me smiling so much I've gained new wrinkles."

Evelyn gave her grandfather an exasperated look.

"Grandpa, you're only sixty-seven. You could easily manage Sterling Manor for another decade."

"Sixty-seven is old," Frederick waved a dismissive hand. "In three years I'll be celebrating my seventieth. That's when I'll announce your official succession."

His gaze softened as he studied his granddaughter.

Handing Sterling Manor to her was the easiest decision he'd ever made.

"Ah, my bones ache just from sitting," the old man theatrically rubbed his lower back.

With a capable heir in place, he had no intention of burdening himself with corporate affairs.

Evelyn suppressed a laugh.

At eighteen, she was already being groomed to take over.

If not for her eldest brother's intervention—knowing how hard she'd trained since childhood—and the trauma of Alexander's incident, Frederick would never have allowed her these carefree years.

Scooping up her daughter, Evelyn changed tactics. "Grandpa, do you still have that Da Hong Pao reserve? I need to host a tea tasting to convince Old Harrison to supply my herbs."

Frederick's face fell. "Are you mad? That's a million-dollar tea! Just pay the markup. That stubborn old goat can't possibly outlast you."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow.

When it came to stubbornness, the man before her held the undisputed crown. Old Harrison didn't even rank.

"Two million for a long-term supplier is a bargain. My new Botanica line will be revolutionary."

"You're abandoning the NovaCore project?"

That announcement alone would trigger a bidding war among investors.

Evelyn nodded. "The company's stable. NovaCore has strong prospects, but Botanica has always been part of my vision."

"Fine, I trust you." Frederick winced. "But only two cakes. That tea is my pride and joy."

His heart bled at the thought.

Those were his treasured reserves.

Evelyn produced two pills with a smile. "Anti-aging formula. You don't look a day over fifty."

"Don't try to sweeten the deal," Frederick eyed the pills suspiciously. "I'm not your lab rat."

She swallowed one demonstratively. "Of course not. I take these myself. Your granddaughter plans to stay eighteen forever."

Only then did Frederick take his dose.

"Two million for youth? Worth it."

Energy surged through his veins. "Impressive. Your master taught you well."

He regarded Evelyn with pride.

Her medical prowess was unparalleled.

Evelyn played with her daughter, smiling silently.

A week later, Nathan secured Old Harrison's cooperation. Evelyn's Botanica research commenced in earnest.

...

Days flowed by, each morning bringing a new message from Vincent.
###Chapter 244

The sunlight was blinding. Vincent Ashcroft raised a hand to shield his eyes. Behind him, the prison's iron gate slammed shut with a heavy thud.

Twenty-three days behind bars had transformed him completely.

"Son!" Vincent Ashcroft Sr. rushed forward, his throat tightening at the sight of the scars on his son's shaved head and the bruises at the corner of his mouth.

Vincent gave a faint smile. "Dad."

The car was silent. The elder Ashcroft's hands trembled slightly on the steering wheel.

"It was worth it," Vincent said suddenly. "Those twenty-three days made me realize a lot of things."

His father glanced at him.

"I was naive before." Vincent watched the scenery blur past the window. "Now I know—no one in this world truly cares about me except you."

Before the words faded, the car screeched to a halt.

Lucien Croix stood in the middle of the road, flanked by a dozen bodyguards. Dressed in a tailored suit, his smirk was as blinding as the sun.

"Son," the elder Ashcroft said darkly, "a rabid dog barks, but we don't engage. Stay alert."

Vincent unbuckled his seatbelt. "I won't act recklessly this time, Dad."

He stepped out of the car. The sunlight illuminated his tall, composed figure. The arrogant young master from a month ago was gone.

Lucien swaggered forward. "Vincent, heard you had quite the experience inside?"

Vincent simply stared at him.

"Guess what?" Lucien waved his phone triumphantly. "The Horizon Tech project ended up in my family's hands. Thanks to your bragging about securing it, my father had time to make arrangements."

He leaned in, whispering in Vincent's ear, "The world changed while you were rotting in that cell."

Vincent suddenly smiled. "You're quite something, Lucien."

"Damn right I am!" Lucien sneered. "You're not even fit to polish my shoes now!"

The sound of a fist cutting through air.

Lucien staggered back, blood spraying from his mouth as two front teeth clattered to the ground.

"My teeth!" he shrieked. "Kill him!"

The bodyguards surged forward.

Vincent's eyes sharpened as he dropped into a fighting stance. His time in prison hadn't been wasted.

Amid the flurry of blows, a red sports car rolled to a stop in the distance. The window lowered, revealing Evelyn Roland's striking profile.
###Chapter 245

Zachary Deross drove the black sedan slowly forward, its window partially lowered to reveal the woman in the backseat wearing sunglasses. Her sharp features were accentuated by the dark frames, her crimson lips blazing under the sunlight like a warning sign. An aura of unapproachable authority radiated from her.

Through the window, she watched Vincent Ashcroft get knocked down repeatedly, only to stagger back up each time.

The men surrounding him were beginning to show fear.

"You're asking for death!" one man shrieked, delivering a brutal kick to Vincent's abdomen. His once-handsome face was now a bloody, unrecognizable mess.

Vincent crashed onto the pavement. The pain sharpened his awareness instead of dulling it.

Blood blurred his vision, but he clenched his teeth.

Survival depended solely on his ability to stand again.

Vincent Ashcroft Sr. stood at a distance, eyes locked on his son's battered form. He made no move to intervene—this trial required Vincent to endure through sheer willpower alone.

Vincent dragged himself upright, refusing surrender, fighting tooth and nail to live.

"Ahhh—" A feral roar tore from his throat as he summoned his last reserves of strength. He seized one attacker by the collar and unleashed a desperate counterattack.

Screams of agony pierced the air.

Evelyn Roland observed coldly. Five minutes later, half a dozen men lay scattered across the ground like broken toys. Vincent stood drenched in blood, the defiance in his eyes burning brighter than ever.

He swayed, then collapsed, utterly spent.

Zachary studied Vincent with newfound respect.

"Boss, he didn't disappoint you." Zachary recognized the shift in Evelyn's stance.

"Drive closer," she said tonelessly.

Zachary tightened his grip on the steering wheel, seeing his younger self in Vincent's struggle. He too had clawed his way up from nothing to earn his current position.

Sirens wailed in the distance as police surrounded Lucien Croix and his entourage.

"This bastard attacked us!" Lucien shouted furiously, pointing at the barely conscious Vincent. "He just got out of prison! Arrest him!"

The lead officer remained impassive. "Lucien Croix, you're under arrest for statutory rape of a minor."

Lucien's pupils contracted violently, all color draining from his face.

Who reported him?

His family's recent windfall had emboldened him—he'd taken any pretty girl to bed without question. That last one... he never asked her age.

A minor?

"Bullshit! I didn't do it!" Lucien screamed hysterically. Ten years minimum sentence. If they uncovered everything else, his life was over.

The officers hauled him away without ceremony.

Vincent finally released his tension, lying prone as he gulped air.

Click. Click. Click.

High heels approached with measured precision.

Vincent's fingers twitched. With immense effort, he pried open his blood-crusted eyelids, lashes fluttering as he struggled to focus.

Evelyn strode toward him.

Her crimson blazer cut severe lines against her frame, the short bob emphasizing her razor-sharp elegance. The staccato taps of her stilettos echoed like gunshots. Though her eyes remained hidden behind dark lenses, each step carried suffocating dominance.

Her regal bearing commanded involuntary submission.
###Chapter 246

Vincent Ashcroft struggled to open his eyes. Evelyn Roland's icy presence loomed inches away.

Her razor-sharp aura made his breath hitch.

He instinctively clenched his fists, only to find himself covered in blood and grime.

Evelyn looked down at him, her red lips curling into a faint smirk.

"Falcon Training Camp." Her voice was glacial.

Vincent's pupils contracted violently, his heart pounding.

He forced himself upright, voice trembling. "Miss Roland... Did I pass?"

The slight upward tilt of Evelyn's lips sent his blood boiling.

"Zachary will take you." She turned, her coat flaring with unquestionable authority.

A black Maybach glided silently to the curb.

Vincent Ashcroft Sr. helped his son into the car, eyes red-rimmed. "Son, you must endure."

Vincent looked back at his father, throat tight.

"Don't worry." His father patted his shoulder. "We'll be waiting for your rebirth."

Zachary Deross shut the door expressionlessly. The engine roared as the car sped away.

Vincent Ashcroft Sr. stood motionless, tears blurring his vision.

He knew what Falcon Training Camp meant—hell itself, yet also the chance for phoenix-like rebirth.

Around the corner, Adrian Valentine's Maybach rolled to a stop.

Julian Roscente narrowed his eyes. "That's Nathan Aldridge's personal driver."

Adrian stared at the retreating taillights, knuckles whitening.

He'd never seen Evelyn like this—a drawn sword, edges gleaming with lethal intent.

That imperious aura left his chest constricted.

A month.

He'd deliberately avoided all news of her, yet her name haunted every corner.

"Get me Evelyn Roland." Julian suddenly dialed a number.

Adrian whipped his head around, gaze sharp as a blade.

Julian met his stare with a cold smile. "Problem?"

"What do you want with her?" Adrian's voice could freeze hell itself.
###Chapter 247

Julian Roscente's eyes darkened as his slender fingers tapped the steering wheel. "Head back to the office first."

Victor Ashcroft's whereabouts remained a mystery.

If Mr. Ashcroft allowed him to leave without concern, he must have gone somewhere safe.

Adrian Valentine drove much slower than before, as if waiting for something.

When the car stopped at the company building, Julian's phone lit up at the perfect moment.

"Speak."

"Mr. Roscente, Miss Langley is in Ms. Orlando's office."

Julian glanced up at the towering skyscraper. "Perfect timing. I'm downstairs now."

Adrian had just turned off the engine when he heard those words. He stepped out of the car with a sharp gust of wind at his back.

Julian followed, a playful smirk curling his lips. "Drove so slow—afraid of seeing her?"

Adrian didn’t even spare him a glance. "Shut up."

Before the words fully left his mouth, Sebastian Orlando brushed past them with a massive bouquet of crimson roses.

"Sophia, I got the cake."

"The restaurant is booked. Just waiting for you to finish work."

He hurried toward the elevator, pretending not to notice the two CEOs.

Julian arched a brow. "Who is he calling?"

Adrian’s gaze fixed on Sebastian’s retreating figure, dark currents swirling in his eyes.

As the elevator doors began to close, Julian darted inside.

Adrian shot him a cold look.

"Just borrowing a hiding spot." Julian shrugged. "Your sister and fiancée are harder to shake than vengeful ghosts."

Adrian’s jaw tightened in silence, the air around him turning frigid.

Julian sighed inwardly. The man had grown even more brooding lately.

Downstairs, Cassandra Valentine stomped her foot in frustration. "Julian keeps avoiding me now, Isabella."

Isabella Langley gently patted her back, a calculating glint flashing in her eyes.

The prey had entered the cage.

How much longer could the Roscente family hold out?
###Chapter 248

Cassandra Valentine glanced around before lowering her voice. "Evelyn, there's no trace left from last time, right? Without evidence, you can still marry Julian Roscente."

"He's no saint himself. Who is he to judge you? If you dare to act, you'll succeed."

Isabella Langley encouraged her while secretly scheming. She knew every dirty secret Lucien Croix and his ilk were hiding.

"What's a little manipulation in the name of love? You did nothing wrong."

Cassandra clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms. The rumors Evelyn Roland had spread in their circle coiled around her like venomous snakes, suffocating her reputation.

"I did nothing! There's no evidence. Isabella, you have to help me this time."

Julian had been her obsession for years. She would never let go.

"And that bitch Evelyn—she's the reason everyone points fingers at me. Ever since she returned, even my brother has changed."

Jealousy burned in Cassandra's eyes. That fox-like face had ensnared so many men, even her backup Vincent Ashcroft had fallen for it.

Isabella smiled coldly inwardly but feigned sympathy. "True feelings always win in the end."

"But he's been avoiding me lately." Cassandra bit her lip. If not for her status as a Valentine heiress, Julian would have cut ties long ago.

The thought of Evelyn ruining her plans made her want to tear that face apart.

Isabella watched her twisted expression and knew the moment was ripe. "I heard Evelyn and Scarlett Orlando are upstairs. Could Julian be here to see her?"

She pretended surprise, though jealousy raged inside her. How dare a discarded woman steal the spotlight?

Cassandra exploded. "That whore! I won't let her get away with this!"

"Isabella, let's go upstairs."

Isabella feigned hesitation. "I have a meeting with my agent about an ad. Be careful on your own."

"Too bad you won't witness it firsthand." Cassandra stepped into the elevator, regret lacing her voice.

Isabella watched the elevator ascend before turning to find Adrian Valentine. She needed to stall him—he couldn't interfere.

Something about the siblings' relationship always struck her as odd. Cassandra only called her brother "eccentric," but instinct said there was more to it.
###Chapter 249

Isabella Langley's stilettos clicked across the marble floor as she strode toward the penthouse of Valentine Corporation. The elevator doors slid shut just as she caught sight of Julian Roscente stepping inside.

She narrowed her eyes at his retreating figure. Over the past year, the playboy heir had shed his frivolous demeanor, replacing it with an air of quiet authority.

But no amount of polish could disguise his privileged upbringing. Like Vincent Ashcroft, he was merely another stepping stone for the Langley family's ascent.

A smirk curled her lips as the elevator ascended. The mighty Roscente heir, groveling after a worthless woman.

Her knuckles rapped twice against the CEO's office door.

Adrian Valentine's deep voice granted entry. The memory of Julian heading upstairs sparked an idea.

With Cassandra Valentine making a scene and Evelyn Roland caught in the crossfire, this was too good to miss.

Her fingers flew across the phone screen. Penthouse showdown happening now. Goldmine for ratings.

Those hangers-around Adrian had been getting too cozy with Evelyn lately. Time to expose his ex-wife's true colors.

Adrian didn't glance up when she entered. The man radiated icy detachment, every movement exuding aristocratic precision as he flipped through documents.

"You're interrupting."

The chill in his tone made her stomach clench.

"Adrian, Julian went to see Evelyn. Cassandra's up there too." She injected false concern into her voice. "You know how she feels about him. If she sees them together—"

"Enough." His laugh held no warmth. "Cassandra's theatrics don't interest me. Go spectate if you're bored."

His attention returned to the computer where Nathan Aldridge's latest intelligence report glowed. Vincent Langley's empire had suffered consecutive blows this month, with Phoenix Group dominating the jewelry sector.

More puzzling was the shadowy force systematically dismantling Langley Holdings. The business landscape had transformed in thirty days.

Isabella approached as Adrian swiftly minimized the screen.

"Adrian..." She leaned in, lower lip trembling. "You've been so distant. Have I done something wrong?"

He met her glassy-eyed gaze. How many schemes hid behind that wounded fawn act? After a year, he saw through the performance.

"You're perfect." His smile didn't reach his eyes. "Just preoccupied with more pressing matters than romance."

"But couples should spend time together." Her voice cracked. "You haven't made time for me in weeks..."
###Chapter 250

Adrian Valentine's eyes glinted with amusement as his slender fingers tapped lightly on the desk. "I'll take you somewhere tonight to make up for all your wild thoughts lately."

Isabella Langley's eyes brightened, her lips curling into an unconscious smile.

"You always spoil me, Adrian." She pouted, clinging to his arm.

Adrian smoothly withdrew his hand, a cryptic smile playing on his lips. "Didn’t you want to see a show? Follow me."

Isabella stared at her empty arm, a flicker of confusion crossing her face before excitement took over.

When they arrived at Scarlett Orlando's floor, they collided with Cassandra Valentine storming out of the elevator.

Cassandra's gaze immediately locked onto Evelyn Roland and Julian Roscente standing at the end of the hallway.

"Isabella!" she shrieked. "Are you here to seduce Julian again?"

Julian, who had been quietly discussing antique authentication details with Evelyn, frowned deeply.

Cassandra charged forward, raising her hand to slap Evelyn.

Julian seized her wrist, his voice icy. "Cassandra, haven’t you caused enough trouble?"

Her eyes instantly welled up. "Julian, we were about to get engaged! Why are you still entangled with this woman?"

She glared at Evelyn’s stunningly beautiful face.

"Uncle Roscente and my mother have already agreed to the marriage alliance. The announcement is tomorrow." Cassandra raised her voice. "Evelyn, have you no shame?"

As soon as the words left her mouth, a swarm of reporters suddenly emerged from around the corner, cameras trained on the trio.

Evelyn’s gaze sharpened—she instantly understood Cassandra’s scheme.

Julian’s expression darkened dangerously. "Who approved this? My marriage is my own decision!"

Tears streamed down Cassandra’s face. "Julian, how could you do this to me?"

She turned to Evelyn and abruptly dropped to her knees. "Evelyn, you have no family, no ties. But I have my reputation to uphold. Please, let go of my fiancé!"

The reporters’ cameras flashed in unison.
###Chapter 251

Evelyn Roland gazed at her with icy disdain. "Beg me? You're not even worthy to speak."

"Accusing me of seducing your fiancé? Where's your proof?"

"It was you who drugged the food last time. Who knows what schemes you're plotting?" Cassandra Valentine deliberately spoke in vague terms, inviting speculation.

The mention of "drugging" sent shockwaves through the crowd.

Every camera lens swiveled toward Evelyn.

Her expression remained unshaken, her poised stance making Cassandra appear increasingly aggressive.

The live chat exploded with comments.

This scheming witch should be banished from high society!

She’s got that vixen look—specializing in stealing men

Rumors about her promiscuity weren’t unfounded

A glint of triumph flashed in Cassandra’s eyes as she skimmed the comments. Sebastian Cortez was overseas—too far to intervene.

Her goal was Evelyn’s utter ruin.

Evelyn’s gaze darkened as she scanned the live feed.

This fool had provoked her before, only to be outmaneuvered every time.

"Miss Roland, why did you interfere in their relationship?" A reporter thrust a microphone forward.

Evelyn’s eyes sharpened like blades. "I didn’t."

"Then explain the drugging incident," the reporter pressed, though his voice faltered under her glare.

Evelyn turned a meaningful look toward Cassandra. "That’s a question Miss Valentine should answer."

Cassandra’s heart skipped, but she summoned tears.

"Evelyn, you’re the one who drugged them! Now you’re framing me? How vile!" Her shrill accusation painted her as the victim.

"Cassandra, you—"

"Julian!" Cassandra cut her off dramatically. "We grew up together. I know you didn’t mean it. I’ll protect you from this woman’s schemes!"

Julian Roscente’s eyes burned with fury.

Cassandra tensed internally. Would her plan work?

"It was you who drugged us last time!" Julian snapped.

Panic flickered in Cassandra’s eyes before she sobbed harder. "Just because she’s prettier, you’d slander me like this?"

She wiped her tears, hiding a smirk.

If she could drown Evelyn in scandal...

"Mr. Roscente, are you and Miss Roland involved?" a reporter interjected.
###Chapter 252

Julian Roscente's expression remained indifferent. "Ms. Roland and I are merely professional associates. Have you ever seen an affair conducted in broad daylight like this?"

Cassandra Valentine quickly interjected. "Julian, I know you're just protecting her. But I'll never forgive what she did—drugging you and seducing you!"

Evelyn Roland let out a mocking laugh. "Since when do I need your forgiveness? Your audacity knows no bounds."

Cassandra stiffened.

How could this woman be so vulgar?

Evelyn waved her phone. "Did you really think you could slander me without consequences just because there was no evidence last time?"

At the sight of her gesture, Cassandra's face twisted in alarm.

The live chat exploded with comments.

~Here we go again! Evelyn always has an ace up her sleeve. Can she clear her name this time?

~I heard she's an orphan. People keep bullying her.

~So what if those wealthy heirs hang out with her? Jealous people just call her a temptress.

~Cassandra's the real wild one. I've got receipts!

Cassandra remained oblivious to the shifting tide in the chat.

"Well, isn't this lively?" A voice cut through the tension. Cassandra Valentine strode forward in striking red heels, her crimson dress impossible to ignore.

She paused deliberately beside Adrian Valentine and Isabella Langley. "Adrian, you're truly heartless. Standing by while your ex-wife gets harassed? Evelyn must have been blind to ever marry you."

Adrian paled instantly.

Evelyn's lips curved slightly at Cassandra's arrival.

This spectacle was getting more entertaining by the minute.

Isabella glared at Cassandra's retreating figure, teeth clenched.

That woman only brought trouble!

Even Cassandra's own cousin stiffened at her approach.

"Ladies and gentlemen," Cassandra announced, waving her phone, "I have proof that Isabella and Cassandra conspired to frame Julian and set Evelyn up that night. Anyone interested in seeing it?"

Isabella and Cassandra both gaped in shock.

That lunatic was here to ruin everything!

A reporter spoke up. "Ms. Valentine, Cassandra is your cousin. Why side against family?"

Cassandra smirked. "Since when does family scheme against each other? Their sins go far beyond this. Cassandra's private life is... quite the spectacle. Shall I show you?"

Adrian stepped forward. "Cassandra, enough."

"Enough?" She arched a brow. "Adrian, ganging up with these vipers to torment a defenseless woman—how noble of you."

Her tone dripped with sarcasm.

Evelyn's gaze turned glacial as it landed on Adrian.

So he'd been part of it too?

Adrian met her eyes, his stomach dropping.

Another misunderstanding.

"Cousin," he murmured, lowering his voice, "let's discuss this inside."
###Chapter 253

Cassandra Valentine watched Adrian Valentine approach with icy disdain, her lips curling into a mocking smirk.

"Adrian, why should I listen to you?" She crossed her arms, her stilettos clicking sharply against the marble floor.

She hadn't forgotten how Margaret Valentine had orchestrated her hospitalization last time.

"One month in a hospital bed, and I wake up to this spectacle. How could I miss it?"

Her gaze swept across the room.

Margaret was ruthless.

Cassandra was despicable.

Gregory was incompetent.

As for Adrian? Just a fool blinded by a woman.

"Your mother's debt comes due today." She pulled out her phone and waved it. "Valentine Group's stock could use a dip."

The recording button clicked.

Isabella Langley's voice rang out clearly.

"There's medication in the soup. Once Julian Roscente is drugged, follow him to the hotel—"

Isabella's face drained of color.

Cassandra jerked upright, nails digging into her palms.

"You set me up!" Her voice turned shrill. "I'm the victim here!"

Adrian's eyes darkened, his fists clenched until his knuckles cracked.

Evelyn Roland stood quietly to the side, expression unreadable.

She'd expected Cassandra to make her move.

After years in the Valentine household, no one understood this mother-daughter duo better than she did.

"Ever consider it's your own fault?" Evelyn stepped forward, red lips parting.

"You bitch!" Cassandra shrieked. "You planned this together!"

Evelyn's eyes turned glacial.

Her leg snapped up.

Thud—

Cassandra went flying, crashing at Adrian's feet.

"Ah!" She curled into a whimpering ball. "Evelyn, you're insane!"

Evelyn looked down at her.

"Didn't expect me to fight back?"

Cassandra scrambled up, her makeup smeared.

"I'm calling the police! You'll rot in jail!"

###Chapter 254

Evelyn's lips curled into a cold smile as she tapped her wristwatch.

"Time starts now."

Her stilettos clicked sharply against the marble floor as she strode toward Isabella.

Isabella's face paled. She clutched Adrian's sleeve desperately.

"Adrian, help me!"

Evelyn seized Isabella's wrist with a vice-like grip.

"Didn't think about consequences when you framed me?"

"Those recordings were fake!" Isabella's voice trembled.

Adrian barked out a warning. "Evelyn, that's enough!"

Evelyn responded with a sharp elbow strike. Adrian grunted and dropped to his knees.

She yanked Isabella's hair, slamming her onto the floor. The tip of her shoe pressed against Isabella's throat.

"This is payback for your false accusations."

Isabella curled into a whimpering ball, her makeup smeared across her face.

Adrian wiped sweat from his temple, stunned by her combat skills.

Julian whistled in appreciation. "Impressive!"

Evelyn shot him a glacial look. "Mr. Roscente, issue a statement clarifying we have no connection."

Julian grinned and stepped closer. "Come on, we grew up together—"

"Silence." Evelyn turned to Cassandra. "Your turn now."

Cassandra shrieked and stumbled backward. "Cousin, you're setting me up!"

A crisp slap landed across Cassandra's cheek.

"Want to see Lucien's bedroom photos?"

Julian's expression darkened instantly. "Unnecessary!"

A phone notification chimed abruptly.

Cassandra lunged at Julian like a madwoman. "Don't check his phone!"

With deliberate slowness, Evelyn swiped the screen open.

"The good stuff starts at photo three."
###Chapter 255

"Stop! Julian, you can't look!" Cassandra shrieked, lunging at Julian Roscente to snatch his phone.

Julian dodged with cat-like reflexes, holding the device high above his head. Cassandra stumbled forward, barely catching her balance. Her face turned deathly pale.

As Julian turned to show the reporters, he found them scattering like frightened rabbits. These paid journalists wouldn't dare expose their employer's dirty laundry.

"Adrian!" Julian whirled on his former friend, fury blazing in his eyes. "Must you drive Evelyn to ruin? You summon reporters to livestream her humiliation, yet shield your own disgrace?"

Adrian Valentine pressed his lips into a thin line, his handsome features darkening. He remained silent.

"Cassandra, thank you." Evelyn Roland spoke with quiet sincerity.

Cassandra Valentine scoffed. "Don't flatter yourself. This wasn't for you. Last time Isabella got me a month in the hospital with a fractured wrist." Her gaze swept the fleeing reporters. "Pity they're all bought off. Wasted effort."

She turned to Evelyn. "I just pitied you. Even after leaving the Valentines, they won't stop scheming against you." A cold smile. "Next time you marry, choose better. Avoid scum like Adrian."

Evelyn's lips curved gracefully. "I'll take that advice. I deserve someone who truly cherishes me."

Adrian's fists clenched until his knuckles turned white.

Cassandra studied Isabella with narrowed eyes. "What spell did you cast on Margaret? She neglects her own daughter yet dotes on you like treasure."

"Your mother's stunning. How did you turn out so... ordinary? Genetic mutation?"

Evelyn's breath caught. She'd always wondered about Isabella's plain features compared to Eleanor's beauty.

Isabella's face twisted. That same question haunted her.

Suddenly, Evelyn stepped forward.

"What are you doing?" Isabella retreated warily.

Evelyn yanked a handful of her hair. "From the Melanie incident onward, you've schemed against me repeatedly." Her voice dropped to a lethal whisper. "Next time, I won't hold back."

She discreetly pocketed two strands of hair before handing Cassandra an encrypted drive. "The files you wanted."

Cassandra arched a brow. "I've tormented you plenty. Why help me?"

"Some wear kindness like a mask yet harbor venom. Others seem harsh but uphold justice." Evelyn smiled faintly.

Cassandra gave her a long look before striding away, drive in hand.

Evelyn's icy gaze swept over Adrian. A mocking smile touched her lips as she pushed open Scarlett Orlando's door.
###Chapter 256

Sebastian and Scarlett Orlando stormed out of the exhibition hall.

Rage burned in their eyes, sharp enough to kill.

Sebastian grabbed Evelyn's wrist. "Why did you lock yourself in, silly girl?"

His fingers trembled slightly, terrified she'd been hurt.

"I had it under control." Evelyn's lips curved.

Scarlett swept a cold gaze over the crowd. "Isabella, you never learn."

Isabella bit her lip hard, eyes reddening.

Why did she always lose against Evelyn?

She plotted silently to involve her father.

If the painting couldn't be found, Evelyn had to disappear.

"Evelyn, we weren't finished talking." Julian Roscente interjected smoothly.

Evelyn considered the secret he'd mentioned.

"I have plans with Sebastian tonight. Tomorrow." Something about the Roscentes felt off.

Julian's eyes brightened. "I'll make reservations."

Scarlett suddenly linked arms with Evelyn. "I just remembered a date. Don't want to third-wheel!"

She dashed off before Evelyn could react.

Evelyn's eyes widened.

That little schemer!

Sebastian gently smoothed her hair. "Our table's ready. Let's go."

They walked away together, ignoring Adrian Valentine completely.

Julian shot Cassandra Valentine a frosty look. "Final warning."

He left without a backward glance.

Cassandra dug her nails into her palms, hatred blazing.

Adrian watched impassively.

Isabella rushed after him. "Adrian, Cassandra framed me for everything!"

Her words died as Evelyn suddenly reappeared.

"What do you want now?" Isabella blocked Adrian protectively.
###Chapter 257

Evelyn gave her an icy glare. "None of your business."

"You—how could you speak to me like that, Evelyn?"

"What's wrong?" A mocking smile curled Evelyn's lips. "Disgusting."

She had only taken a few steps when she suddenly turned back to face Cassandra. "Idiot."

Cassandra's face drained of color.

Evelyn pushed open Scarlett's office door and gathered the forgotten roses back into her arms.

The vibrant crimson blooms made her porcelain skin glow, breathtakingly beautiful.

Adrian's gaze darkened as he watched her. So she had returned just for these roses—gifted by Sebastian.

Sebastian caught up to her, shaking his head fondly. "Silly girl, I told you I could buy new ones."

Evelyn lowered her face to inhale the roses' fragrance, her smile radiant. "Such fresh flowers would be a shame to waste. I'll take them home for my bedside."

"Knowing you love roses, I designed a private rose garden in my new villa—planted just for you." Sebastian wrapped an arm around her waist, blatantly ignoring Adrian's presence.

This was his way of making Adrian pay for hurting Evelyn.

Her eyes lit up. "Then I'll wake up to a sea of roses every morning."

Their retreating figures pierced Adrian like knives. His murderous glare fixed on Sebastian's hand resting possessively on Evelyn's waist.

Isabella dug her nails into her palms, consumed by jealousy. Sebastian was not only devastatingly handsome and wealthy, but he doted on Evelyn so openly.

"How does a discarded woman deserve someone like Sebastian?" she hissed through clenched teeth.

Adrian's frigid gaze swept over Isabella as if she were already dead.

Cassandra added spitefully, "Some people have no shame, throwing themselves at wealthy men."

Without a word, Adrian turned and strode away.

Isabella watched his retreating back, torn between fury and helplessness. She could only wait for his anger to subside.

"Sister Isabella, if today's incident gets out..." Cassandra fretted.

Isabella smirked. "Relax. Those reporters were all arranged by me. They won't dare write anything unauthorized."

Only then did Cassandra exhale in relief. "But Julian will never trust me again..."

More terrifying—how had Cassandra Valentine discovered her affair with Lucien?

"We must eliminate Cassandra and Evelyn!" Venom flashed in Cassandra's eyes. "Especially Cassandra—she keeps slipping through our fingers!"

Recalling their failed assassination attempts, she gnashed her teeth in frustration.
###Chapter 258

Isabella Langley studied Cassandra Valentine with a knowing look. "Cassandra, don't tell me you've actually laid hands on Cassandra Valentine before."

That woman was her personal nemesis.

Every encounter brought nothing but trouble. She had to be eliminated.

"My mother despises the first and third uncles' families the most. Before Cassandra turned eighteen, she was a pushover—anyone could bully her. I tormented her the most, and she's held a grudge ever since. She's been trying to take me down, but she's failed all these years."

Isabella narrowed her eyes. "Murder is illegal. Don't do anything reckless. Deal with Evelyn Roland first. If she marries Sebastian Orlando, she'll come after us. We schemed against her back then just so you could have Julian Roscente. She won't let this go."

Evelyn belonged in the gutter. She didn't deserve a comeback.

"A discarded woman my brother threw away—what can she possibly do? I'll personally speak to Sebastian Orlando and tell him Evelyn is nothing but damaged goods. Would the Orlando family really accept such trash? My mother will also inform Mrs. Orlando."

Cassandra smirked venomously. Mrs. Orlando cared about appearances more than anything.

Evelyn would never set foot in the Orlando household.

Thinking of Mrs. Orlando's notorious temper, Isabella relaxed. With so many people gunning for Evelyn, she could sit back and enjoy the show.

Nearby, Adrian Valentine watched their whispered plotting with cold detachment. As he turned to leave, he sent a message to Victor Ashcroft.

Neither Isabella nor Cassandra realized their conversation had been recorded—and was about to go viral.

Isabella's face was blurred in the leaked audio, but Cassandra's identity was exposed in full.

~The Valentine heiress is pure evil! The Ashcrofts are the real victims here.

~Who's the blurred one? People who hide are even scarier.

~Get over yourself. Are you rich or handsome enough for her to even glance at you?

The internet exploded.

Inside an elevator, Cassandra saw the news and erupted. "Isabella, who did this? Why am I the only one exposed?"

Isabella was equally shocked. The reporter she hired would never dare leak this.

Damn it!

The more mysterious she remained, the harder netizens would dig.

"Get your brother to suppress the热搜."

Cassandra scoffed. "He won't lift a finger for me."

Better to call Mother.

Isabella frowned. What was going on between those siblings?

Cassandra dialed, only to be met with a furious tirade: "You idiot! I just convinced Chairman Roscente last night, and now you pull this stunt?"

"Mom, save the lecture! Get the热搜 taken down first!"
###Chapter 259

"Handle it yourself? I can't even get out of bed with this back pain. Instead of visiting me at the hospital, you expect me to clean up your mess? Cassandra, why can't you be more considerate like Isabella?"

Cassandra Valentine's throat tightened. Lately, her mother kept comparing her to Isabella.

Isabella was attentive, but honestly, she paled in comparison to Evelyn. Evelyn came weekly to administer acupuncture, while Isabella only offered empty words.

If not for Evelyn knowing that secret and having no one to rely on, she wouldn't have opposed her.

"Mom—"

"Enough. I have my acupuncture session. Sort out your own problems. Don't drag Isabella into this."

The dial tone pierced her eardrums.

Even her mother treated her this way. Don't burden Isabella?

What was wrong with her?

Isabella truly excelled at winning people over.

Cassandra forced a bitter smile. "I'll take my leave now, Isabella."

The elevator doors opened on the ground floor.

Isabella frowned at her retreating figure.

Her phone vibrated. Her father.

"Dad."

"All our collaborations with the Valentines and the Ashcrofts have been sabotaged. Adrian is facing pressure too. Meet him tonight to discuss."

Isabella's brow furrowed. "The Ashcrofts?"

"Impossible. They're no longer a threat. Phoenix Group is also targeting us. We urgently need to hire Master L, the top designer."

"I've won international awards. Let me try?"

"The company is in crisis. The billion-dollar diamond we just mined was stolen yesterday."

Vincent Langley hadn't slept all night.

Every diamond they unearthed was being hijacked. Harrison Macmillan faced the same plight.

Isabella's face darkened. "Could it be Evelyn?"

"That girl exposed the design secrets to ruin us. Despite our precautions, we're still being watched."

Evelyn had become the ultimate victor.

The stolen diamond was all her fault.

"Dad, Evelyn's useless now. Eliminate her." Isabella lowered her voice, scanning the surroundings.

Vincent thought of Evelyn's connections to Sebastian Cortez and Sebastian Orlando. This seedling had to be crushed.

She resembled that person too much. If she grew stronger, the truth would surface.

"Fine. Find Master L quickly. Only with your designs can the company recover."

"I'll locate Master L." Cold determination flashed in Isabella's eyes.

Who leaked today's news?

Clearly protecting Evelyn.

Her eyes narrowed as Adrian Valentine's car drove away.

By the time she chased out, it was too late.

Warren Garten approached.

Isabella shot him a frosty glare. "Watch your place. Stay away from me."
###Chapter 260

Warren Garten returned home with a dark expression. That woman always shamelessly exposed herself in front of him without restraint.

Even going upstairs required him to carry her, clinging to him like a koala.

"Isabella, the chairman sent me to pick you up." His deep voice carried a suppressed desire, instantly dissolving Isabella Langley's anger.

Adrian Valentine was nowhere to be found.

"Don't worry. Your father's men are watching Adrian. We'll know his every move."

Warren sensed her concern, bitterness rising in his chest.

Isabella had no choice but to leave with him. Before departing, she sent a message to those surveilling Adrian.

[If Adrian goes to see Evelyn, notify me immediately.]

She suspected Adrian was seeing that woman again. Every time Evelyn was involved, Adrian would mysteriously vanish.

[Understood, Miss Langley.]

The internet erupted in outrage. Cassandra Valentine was torn apart for drugging Julian Roscente in her desperate bid to marry into the Roscente family.

In the hospital, Margaret Valentine smirked at the news. Cassandra was finished.

Her Isabella would become an Academy Award-winning actress—the most distinguished Mrs. Valentine in Vienna.

Cassandra was nothing.

......

At the Noble Fin Restaurant, Evelyn Roland sat across from Sebastian Orlando.

Evelyn adored their coconut chicken stew, the rich broth irresistible.

Sebastian ladled soup into her bowl. "Drink it while it's hot. Have the meat afterward."

For breastfeeding, Evelyn consumed large amounts of broth daily.

She glanced down at her slightly rounded stomach, relieved it wasn't noticeable when standing.

Lately, she avoided fitted dresses.

"Don't worry. With your medical skills, losing weight won't be a problem." Sebastian smiled reassuringly.

Evelyn chuckled, serving him sweet and sour squirrel fish—his favorite.

"Scarlett loved this." Sebastian picked up a piece, shadows flickering in his eyes.

"Evelyn, it's been five years since Alexander passed. You should move on." He said abruptly.

Her smile froze, chopsticks suspended midair.

Sebastian hesitated, then his phone vibrated. His expression shifted. "An emergency. I have to go. I'll arrange a ride—"

"No need. I can get back myself." Evelyn knew that mysterious caller mattered deeply to him.

After hurried instructions, Sebastian left.

Evelyn sipped her soup alone when a figure suddenly appeared opposite her.
###Chapter 261

Evelyn looked up and recognized the man across from her. Adrian Valentine lounged lazily in his chair, his shirt collar slightly open, revealing the faint outline of his collarbone. Those peach-blossom eyes remained icy, yet they locked onto her with unsettling intensity.

She set down her chopsticks, her appetite gone.

"Seems like you didn't learn your lesson from that kick earlier today."

This man was like a ghost she couldn't shake.

"Can you just leave me alone?"

Her voice dripped with irritation. Once she made up her mind to walk away, there was no turning back.

Adrian's lips curled into a cold smirk. "So you're really going to be with that Langley guy?"

A flicker of pain flashed in his eyes.

Evelyn scoffed. "What's it to you? We've been divorced for two years. Who I marry is none of your business. Stay away from me."

His shirt collar gaped slightly as his Adam's apple bobbed, his entire body radiating danger. Long fingers tapped lightly against the table, his gaze burning into her.

"I just want to ask you one thing," he said, his voice low. "What's your real name?"

Even her name had been a lie.

"Does it matter?" Evelyn kept her expression blank. "It's all in the past."

For the sake of him being her child's father, she had held back. But he was the one who cheated. She was the one who lost.

"In that marriage, I was the one who was deceived." Adrian took a step closer.

Evelyn met his gaze head-on. "You were the one who played with my feelings. If I'd known it was all just a gamble, I would never have let you near me."

"Now that you've moved on, stop coming back to disgust me."

She had deliberately chosen this out-of-the-way restaurant to avoid him. Yet here he was. Some fates were truly cursed.

"Evelyn!" Adrian suddenly snapped, his temper flaring. "Don't you feel even a shred of guilt for Christian Lefèvre's death?"

He had sent her to prison—because she was his wife.

A sharp pain pierced Evelyn's chest. "Why should I feel guilty? The only thing I regret is that day—"

Her phone rang, cutting her off. Gabrielle was calling.

"Evelyn, Sophia has a fever. She keeps calling for you."

"I'm coming right now."

She grabbed her bag and bolted downstairs. Adrian chased her into the alley, seizing her wrist.

"Evelyn, answer me!" His palm burned against her skin. "Do you really feel nothing for Christian?"

"Why should I—" Her phone rang again.

"Evelyn, Sophia just threw up. Hurry back!"

She wrenched her hand free and flagged down a taxi. Adrian stood frozen, his fists clenched so tightly his knuckles turned white.

Evelyn, you're truly unforgivable.

But the worst part was—he still couldn't let her go.
###Chapter 262

Adrian Valentine stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, cigarette ash crumbling from his fingertips.

It had been nearly two years since the divorce, yet each day dragged on like an eternity.

Evelyn Roland burst through the front door in a flurry.

In the bedroom, little Sophia curled up on the bed like a wilted kitten. Hearing her mother's footsteps, she struggled to sit up, her small face pale as she reached out with chubby hands.

"What's wrong, sweetheart?" Evelyn gathered her daughter into her arms, pressing their foreheads together. The burning heat made her heart clench.

Gabrielle Flores hurried over. "Tristan was picked up by Grandpa. Sophia might have indigestion. I just gave her fever medicine."

Evelyn looked down at the little one in her arms. Sophia clung to her neck, burying her face in the crook of her mother's shoulder.

"Get the baby carrier." Evelyn patted her daughter's back. "I'll let her sleep on me for a while."

When Gabrielle returned with the carrier, a faint smile finally appeared on Sophia's pale face.

"You ungrateful little thing," Gabrielle said with mock bitterness. "I take care of you every day, but you never cling to me like this."

Evelyn expertly secured her daughter and headed downstairs. "Any changes with Christian Lefèvre today?"

"Same as always." Gabrielle shook her head.

Evelyn thought of Adrian's words, unease stirring within her. This past year, she'd been consumed by the NovaCore project and caring for her two children, neglecting too many things.

Where did Adrian's hatred come from? Misunderstanding her relationship with Alexander Durand was one thing, but that bone-deep loathing made no sense.

"Keep up the acupuncture treatments," Evelyn said firmly. "Some truths must be uncovered by him."

Gabrielle blinked. "Understood. I'll try the thickest needles tonight."

Evelyn's lips twitched, suddenly feeling a pang of sympathy for Christian.

Just then, Zachary Deross rushed in excitedly, holding up a sealed bag. "Evelyn, I got it!"
###Chapter 263

Evelyn adjusted Sophia in her arms and turned to Gabrielle. "Get the ziplock bag from my purse. There's a sample inside for testing."

She had previously asked Zachary to collect a hair sample from Eleanor.

Gabrielle nodded. "Right away, Evelyn."

Moments later, Gabrielle descended the stairs holding two sealed bags. She took the sample from Zachary and said, "The results will be ready tomorrow morning."

"Mm." Evelyn carried Sophia toward the living room.

Zachary leaned in to play with the little girl. The moment Sophia spotted him, she squeezed her eyes shut, pretending to sleep.

"Boss, Sophia's rejecting me," Zachary whined, his voice dripping with exaggerated hurt.

Evelyn shot him a glance. "Maybe you're just not handsome enough."

Zachary clutched his chest dramatically. "That cuts deep, Boss."

Sophia suddenly peeked open one eye, lazily scanned Zachary, then closed it again with a dismissive air.

"She's adorable!" Zachary's eyes sparkled. "Boss, I want a daughter just like her someday."

Evelyn smirked. "Even if you have one, she won't be as pretty as my Sophia."

Zachary gasped, pressing a hand to his heart. "Boss, you're breaking me."

"Feel like running thirty kilometers?" Evelyn arched a brow.

Zachary spun on his heel and bolted, vanishing through the front door in seconds.

Victoria emerged from the kitchen, phone in hand. "Evelyn, the Valentines' stocks are dropping because of today's scandal."

Evelyn pulled up the news.

The trending headlines blared:
#Valentine Heiress Drugged Tycoon's Son in Seduction Plot#
#Valentine Pharmaceuticals Violated Production Regulations#

Evelyn frowned. The reporters had been arranged by Isabella—how had this backfired?

"Find out who leaked this," she ordered.

Victoria grinned eagerly. "On it!"

Evelyn shook her head in exasperation. Some people just couldn't leave well enough alone.

Sophia stirred against her back, tiny fingers clutching her shirt. The warmth of that trust made Evelyn's heart soften.

Her grandfather had raised her as the heir from childhood. Though the training had been grueling, he'd surrounded her with brilliant orphans who became her lifelong companions. She had never known loneliness.
###Chapter 264

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, illuminating the living room of the Valentine family estate.

Evelyn Roland stood silently on the second-floor balcony, watching the commotion below.

Her fingers absently traced the jade pendant her grandfather had given her.

Though she had grown up without parents, her grandfather and brother had given her all the love she needed.

A sharp slap suddenly echoed through the room.

"Isabella Valentine! Are you happy now that the company stocks have crashed because of you?"

Margaret Valentine glared furiously at her daughter.

Cassandra Valentine clutched her stinging cheek, staring at her mother in disbelief.

"Mother, it was Adrian's mismanagement that caused this!"

She turned toward Adrian Valentine, who sat elegantly on the sofa in his white suit.

His long fingers tapped the armrest as he regarded her with indifference.

"Adrian, why should I take the blame for your failures?"

Isabella Langley lifted her teacup with practiced grace, a faint smirk on her lips.

"Cassandra, I already did everything I could to cover for you yesterday."

Cassandra's eyes widened.

"But those reporters were clearly—"

Slap!

Another harsh strike landed.

Eleanor Langley flinched, her nails digging into her palms.

Margaret snapped, "How dare you accuse Isabella? This must be Evelyn Roland's doing!"

Adrian's gaze flickered.

Her skill at shifting blame was truly impressive.

Vincent Langley frowned. "This isn't the time for accusations. We need to stabilize the stocks first."

Isabella set down her cup, her voice soft. "Adrian, let's get engaged."

Margaret brightened. "That's perfect!"

Adrian's eyes swept over Isabella's hopeful face before he gave a slight nod.

"Three days from now."

He stood, adjusting his cuffs, his imposing figure radiating authority.

"Mother, arrange the engagement details."

Isabella barely contained her triumph, her fingers tightening around her skirt.

Eleanor watched Adrian's retreating figure thoughtfully.

Margaret turned on Cassandra. "Get out of my sight! Go back to your apartment!"

Cassandra smiled bitterly.

It was always like this.

Isabella's schemes, yet she was the one who suffered.

Why did their mother favor Isabella over her own flesh and blood?

She stumbled out the door, oblivious to Eleanor's conflicted gaze.

Eleanor pressed a hand to her chest, that strange ache returning.

"I hope Adrian truly cares for Isabella."

Vincent wrapped an arm around his wife. "Rest. I'll handle the company matters."

Upstairs, Evelyn turned away.

The jade pendant glowed warmly in her palm.
###Chapter 265

Eleanor Langley adjusted her mink coat with practiced elegance, fingertips brushing the pearl buttons at the collar. Her sharp gaze locked onto Margaret Valentine. "I heard your mother-in-law has never approved of my Isabella. Will she attend the engagement party in three days?"

Margaret's smile deepened, crow's feet crinkling at her eyes. "Don't worry, Eleanor. I have my ways to ensure Beatrice's presence."

A frown creased Eleanor's brow. Things felt off. Ever since Beatrice moved out of the Valentine estate two years ago, she'd shown nothing but disdain for Isabella. Even Adrian's attitude had grown distant.

"Her attendance carries weight," Eleanor emphasized, her tone hardening. "This engagement must proceed flawlessly."

With that, she linked arms with Isabella and strode away, stilettos clicking sharply against the marble floor.

Once the guests dispersed, Margaret dragged Vincent Langley upstairs. The moment the door shut, he yanked at her collar with rough impatience.

"Not yet!" Margaret slapped his hand away irritably. "We still have unfinished business."

Vincent gripped her plump cheeks, desire burning in his eyes. "What's left to discuss? You got what you wanted."

He shoved her against the wall, movements brutish. Margaret gasped at the pain, oblivious to the shadow flickering past the door's crack.

"Gentler!" she hissed through clenched teeth. "I'm not as young as I used to be."

Vincent panted heavily. "You're far more exciting than Eleanor. That woman's frigid as ice."

Outside, bitter wind howled as Cassandra Valentine stood alone by the gates waiting for a cab. The streetlamp cast her slender frame into stark isolation. Silent tears traced her cheeks.

When Eleanor and Isabella passed by, Cassandra's fists clenched instinctively. Isabella's taunt about her stupidity echoed in her mind—now she realized how thoroughly she'd been played.

"Why don't you stay at home, Miss Valentine?" Eleanor feigned concern.

Cassandra smirked coldly. "Your intel's outdated, Eleanor. I was kicked out at eighteen." Her gaze slid pointedly to Isabella. "This house stopped being mine long ago."

Isabella smoothly extended a black card. "My apologies for today. Consider this $100,000 compensation."

Cassandra stared at the card, fingers trembling slightly. She recognized the bribe for what it was. But right now, she desperately needed the money.
###Chapter 266

"Thank you, Isabella." Her eyes glistened as she clenched the money tightly in her palm.

Eleanor Langley frowned slightly but remained silent.

This girl certainly knew how to win people over—even the Roland women were wrapped around her finger.

A black sedan pulled up slowly, and everyone got in.

...

Outside the window, the night was pitch black. Adrian Valentine stared absently at the falling snowflakes.

"Still no leads on Evelyn's whereabouts?" he asked abruptly.

Victor Ashcroft's grip on the steering wheel tightened.

He had no answer to that.

"Sir, we truly haven't found anything," he murmured, his voice barely audible.

A deep longing churned in Adrian's eyes.

The image of her fleeing in panic tonight haunted him relentlessly.

"I'm getting engaged to Isabella in three days."

A sharp screech of brakes pierced the air.

Victor whipped his head around. "Sir, if you go through with this, it's over between you and Evelyn!"

Adrian's gaze remained fixed on the window, icy and distant.

"That viper Isabella isn't fit to even breathe the same air as Evelyn. Your so-called protection will only hurt her more."

Adrian closed his eyes briefly. "Drive."

Victor gritted his teeth.

This stubborn fool would regret it.

As the car started moving again, Adrian spoke suddenly. "The engagement ceremony must be disrupted."

Victor's eyes lit up. "Sabotage is my specialty!"

"Leave no traces."

"Don't worry, it'll be flawless." Victor grinned.

Adrian smirked coldly. "You can't even find my wife, yet you boast?"

Victor's smile froze.

The burn came too fast.

"Make it happen tonight." A dangerous glint flashed in Adrian's eyes.

Victor's palms grew damp with excitement.

Evelyn, I'll hold your place for you!

He stole a glance at Adrian through the rearview mirror. "Sir, if we could locate that driver—"

"Not yet." A sudden chill radiated from Adrian. "Grandmother always said there's a traitor in the Valentine family."

Victor's heart skipped a beat.

If that were true... the late chairman's death was even more tragic.

...

Isabella Langley lay limp on the bed, too exhausted to lift a finger.

Warren Garten held her, thoroughly satisfied. "Heard you're engaged to Adrian Valentine?"
###Chapter 267

Isabella Langley slowly opened her eyes. The first thing she saw was Warren Garten's chiseled profile. At thirty-five, the man exuded an undeniable mature charm in every movement.

"Mmm." She let out a soft sigh.

"You know I'm in love with Adrian Valentine. We've had this conversation before. I'm exhausted. I want to sleep."

Just mentioning Adrian's name sent a wave of irritation through Isabella.

That man remained an enigma to her.

He treated her exceptionally well, always bringing gifts from his business trips.

Yet despite being physically close, he always felt impossibly distant.

Warren's expression darkened instantly. His love for Isabella was genuine—he'd walk through fire for her.

But if she married someone else, it would destroy him.

"Warren, I suspect Cassandra Valentine was behind today's incident." Isabella's voice turned icy. "Find someone to teach her a lesson."

A ruthless glint flashed in Warren's eyes. "Consider it done. But will you call off the engagement? You know how much I love you."

Isabella lifted his chin with her slender fingers, smiling with mocking allure.

"Warren, if you had Adrian's capabilities, I'd choose you in a heartbeat. But you're just my father's driver and bodyguard. Even if I wanted to, my father would never allow it."

All she craved was his body.

Warren's gaze dimmed. His background couldn't compare to Adrian's.

Without Vincent Langley, he wouldn't even have a respectable job.

But he was already making secret plans. One day, he'd make Isabella marry him willingly.

Ding—

Her phone vibrated abruptly.

Isabella opened the video message and paled instantly.

"How could this..." Her voice trembled.

Warren narrowed his eyes. "We've always been careful. How did they record us?"

A flicker of dark satisfaction stirred in his chest. If Isabella couldn't marry Adrian, she'd have no choice but to stay with him.

Another message popped up:
[Proceed with the engagement, and these videos along with evidence of your hired killers will go viral.]

The phone slipped from Isabella's fingers.

She stood frozen, her fingertips shaking faintly.

"Impossible..." She frantically scanned the room. "Are there hidden cameras?"

Warren's voice was firm. "No. I sweep this place daily with detection equipment. It's completely secure."

"The Chairman also has me conduct regular checks. We would've found any cameras."

He enlarged the video, his gaze lingering on Isabella's alluring figure. The embers of desire flared back to life.
###Chapter 268

The tree shadows swayed outside the window. Isabella Langley's gaze remained fixed on the large tree.

Her fingers clenched the bedsheet, nails nearly digging into her palms.

Warren Garten followed her line of sight. The treetop was empty.

"Who did this?" Isabella grabbed his wrist, her voice trembling. The intimate sounds from the video slithered into her ears like venomous snakes, chilling her to the bone.

If this footage got out, her carefully crafted socialite persona would be ruined. Her eyes burned with fury, chest heaving violently.

Warren glanced at the newly received text and lowered his voice. "Probably the Valentines' rivals. They don't want to see this alliance happen."

He gently stroked her back. "Call off the engagement first. Let me handle the video."

Isabella bit her lower lip until it bled. She and her mother had spent three years meticulously planning to get close to Adrian Valentine. Giving up now? Unthinkable.

A notification popped up on her phone.

#AdrianValentineIsabellaLangleyEngagementImminent# #PowerCoupleTiesTheKnot# dominated the trending list.

Her pupils constricted. Had the Valentines officially announced it?

She let out a scream and hurled a pillow at the wall, trembling uncontrollably. She was so close!

Warren wrapped his arms around her from behind. "Your father just discovered that diamond concession. Everyone has their eyes on the Langleys now."

His voice dripped with honeyed reassurance. "I'll always be your driver. Your weapon."

Isabella shoved him away, her fingertips icy. "Get out."

Warren didn’t move. "The new period drama gives you the perfect excuse. Adrian will understand."

She closed her eyes, lashes fluttering violently. The sender hadn’t even left a trace—clearly a top-tier hacker. This sword hanging over her head was inescapable.
###Chapter 269

"Delete it!" Her eyes flew open as she stabbed at the delete button, glaring at Warren. "What are you waiting for? Go inspect the area and cut down every single tree around here!"

Warren's tense shoulders relaxed slightly when she relented.

"I'll handle it personally tomorrow. Rest well, Isabella. I won't let anything happen to you."

He quickly pulled on his jacket and left the room.

At the hallway corner, Eleanor Langley appeared in her nightgown.

Warren halted mid-step, cursing inwardly.

"Madam, Miss Langley left something in the car." He held up a bag without flinching.

Eleanor frowned, waving dismissively. "Don't come up so late next time. Leave it downstairs."

"Understood." He strode away, his figure vanishing down the stairwell.

Eleanor tightened the belt of her robe. Her husband hadn't returned all night, scrambling over the stolen diamond shipment. Distracted, she went downstairs for water, the glass glinting coldly under the moonlight.

————

News of Adrian Valentine's engagement spread like wildfire. Within ten minutes, #ValentineLangleyAlliance trended with an explosive tag.

Adrian stood before the floor-to-ceiling window, his sharp profile reflected in the phone screen.

"President, we've confirmed it," his assistant's voice came through the call. "The trending topic was arranged by Madam Valentine. The press release was also her doing."

His fingers tapped against the window frame. His mother's unusual favoritism toward Isabella was suspicious.

After hanging up, the bedroom was so quiet he could hear his own breathing. The room remained exactly as Evelyn had left it—except for the missing documents in the drawer, as if she'd never existed.

His gaze fell on the wicker chair by the balcony. She used to curl up there like a lazy cat.

For a fleeting moment, her familiar silhouette appeared on the white chair. She'd wave her phone at him, laughing. "Honey, come look at this hilarious video!"

He reached out instinctively, but his fingers met only cold rattan.

"Evelyn..." His fingertips brushed the beige cushion, still faintly scented with jasmine. If only things had been different...

Adrian suddenly laughed coldly. Someone like him didn't deserve happiness.

————

Sebastian Orlando scrolled through his phone, his lips curling in mockery.

Adrian was finally marrying Isabella.

His Evelyn would always belong to him.

Outside, Regal Heights lay shrouded in night. She must be asleep by now. Sebastian quietly drew the curtains.

————

Evelyn didn't learn the news until breakfast the next morning.

Victoria handed her a tablet. "The Valentines and Langleys are uniting. The engagement is in three days."
###Chapter 270

Sunlight filtered through the curtains as Evelyn Roland stood by the window, scrolling through news notifications on her phone.

"Adrian Valentine, CEO of Valentine Group, Sets Wedding Date with Heiress Isabella Langley."

Her finger hovered over the screen for a second before she calmly swiped past it.

Victoria Laurent entered with breakfast, studying her expression carefully. "Evelyn..."

Turning, Evelyn accepted the tray with a perfectly measured smile. "I'm fine. It's been almost two years since the divorce. Felicia is already walking."

She stirred the porridge absently, lashes fluttering in the rising steam.

Victoria's eyes reddened. "Let's take a trip somewhere."

"Felicia had a fever last night. She just fell asleep." Evelyn lifted a spoonful, her wrist trembling imperceptibly.

The porridge stuck in her throat like a lump.

Her steps slowed as she climbed the stairs.

In the crib, Felicia slept soundly. Evelyn gently stroked her daughter's cheek, whispering almost inaudibly, "Daddy's starting a new family."

Felicia's eyes fluttered open briefly before drifting shut again with innocent trust.

That fleeting glance pierced Evelyn's heart.

The doorbell rang downstairs.

Gabrielle Flores burst in waving a document. "The results are in!"

Evelyn flipped straight to the final line—

"No Maternal Match Detected"

"I triple-checked," Gabrielle said excitedly.

A glint of steel flashed in Evelyn's eyes. "The show begins."

She went upstairs and photographed the report with a burner phone, sending it through encrypted software to Eleanor Langley.

Another message went to Zachary Deross: "Monitor Eleanor closely."

The medical textbook lay open on her lap, but the words blurred before her eyes.

The Diamond Project was halfway to completion. Now for the next move—

Her phone vibrated with a message from Isabella: "Sis, Mom's been acting strange lately."

Evelyn's lips curved slightly as she left it unanswered.

Meanwhile, in the master bedroom of Langley Manor...

Eleanor Langley woke from her nap to find the other side of the bed empty.

She reached for her phone. An unknown notification flashed:

"Would you like to know Isabella's true origins?"

Her finger froze above the screen.
###Chapter 271

She bolted upright and opened the mysterious file.

"Paternity Test Report?" Eleanor Langley frowned, scrolling through the document.

The final page clearly stated: No biological relationship between Isabella Langley and Eleanor Langley.

Her pupils constricted violently.

The phone slipped from her trembling fingers.

"Impossible..." Her whisper was fractured.

Over twenty years of devotion—had it all been for nothing?

Barefoot on the carpet, her body turned ice-cold.

Flashes of her childbirth surfaced in her mind.

She remembered collapsing from exhaustion, only to wake with the baby placed beside her.

If someone had switched them...

Her fists clenched abruptly.

"Vincent Langley..." The name hissed through her teeth.

Footsteps approached outside.

"Madam, breakfast is ready."

She swiftly wiped the dampness from her eyes. "Understood."

As she deleted the file, her gaze sharpened like a blade.

The bathroom mirror reflected her pallid face.

"Mom!" Isabella's voice floated up from downstairs.

Eleanor inhaled deeply, molding her lips into a flawless smile.

At the table, Isabella was placing dumplings into her bowl.

"Try these—I had the kitchen make them specially."

Eleanor studied her daughter's ordinary features.

The memory of that porcelain-perfect infant seemed like a mirage.

"Isabella," she said suddenly, "are you certain about marrying him?"

Isabella bit her straw. "Mom, not this again."

"A man like Adrian Valentine..." Eleanor trailed off.

Her gaze darkened as she stared at the chopsticks Isabella had used.

The meal turned to ashes in her mouth.

When the maid cleared the dishes, she discreetly wrapped the chopsticks in a napkin.

Today, she would visit the hospital herself.
###Chapter 272

Eleanor Langley twisted her napkin absently, her mind in turmoil.

"Mom, I want to marry him, but not now." Isabella set down her fork. "Let's cancel the engagement in three days. I'm aiming for Best Actress—I can't afford to lose focus."

Eleanor's hand paused midair as she reached for her coffee cup.

"As long as you're sure." She took a sip, studying her daughter's flawless makeup.

"I'll visit Adrian later with Dad and Margaret." Isabella dabbed her lips. "We should explain this face-to-face."

Eleanor nodded silently and resumed her meal.

She missed the cold glint in her daughter's eyes. That damned blackmailer would pay dearly if she ever got her hands on them. The sleepless night had left her nerves frayed.

"A press conference in three days will clear things up. It's manageable." Eleanor kept her tone even.

If the paternity test results were unfavorable, she'd never let this girl enter the Valentine family.

After breakfast, Isabella went upstairs to change. Eleanor discreetly pocketed her used toothbrush and drove alone to the hospital. She didn't notice the black sedan trailing her.

At Sterling Group's boardroom, Adrian Valentine had just finished his morning meeting. News of the engagement had quashed Cassandra's scandal, stabilizing the stock.

He stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, facing Horizon Tech's building. Evelyn hadn't come to work today.

Had she seen the news? Was she hurting?

A knock interrupted his thoughts.

"Come in."

Isabella entered with Vincent Langley and Margaret Valentine. Adrian turned with practiced warmth.

"Have a seat." He gestured to the sofa.

Isabella sat beside him, fingers trembling. She drank in the face that haunted her dreams, her heart twisting. So close to happiness, yet she had to push it away.

"Aunt Margaret, Dad, Adrian." She inhaled deeply. "There's something I need to say."

Vincent frowned. "Unhappy with the dowry?"

"No." She shook her head urgently. "I've taken a new role—filming starts soon. With stocks stabilized, let's postpone the engagement."

Margaret's teacup clattered onto the table.

"Isabella, these aren't mutually exclusive!" Margaret protested. "You could move into Sterling Manor after the engagement. I truly—"

"This film could win me Best Actress." Isabella lowered her gaze apologetically.

Vincent's expression darkened. No one knew his daughter's obsession with Adrian better than him. Why this sudden change? Given the Langley family's current situation...

"Nonsense! Do you think this is a game? The whole world is celebrating this union!"

"Dad—"

Adrian stood abruptly, the air turning icy.

"Isabella." His voice was glacial. "You agreed last night. Is this how you repay my betrayal of Evelyn?"
###Chapter 273

Isabella knew Adrian would be angry, but she never expected this level of fury.

His chiseled profile was rigid with tension. The ice in his eyes made her heart tremble.

Biting her lip, she stood and lightly grasped his sleeve with slender fingers. "Adrian, give me one more year. We can get married right after."

She couldn't reveal the truth. If that video surfaced, everything she'd built would crumble.

Adrian shook off her hand, his voice glacial. "Do as you please."

As he turned away, the faintest smirk touched his lips.

Tears spilled from Isabella's eyes. "Adrian—"

The office door slammed shut with a resounding bang.

Margaret rushed to embrace her. "Don't cry. His temper flares fast but fades just as quickly."

Isabella wiped her tears. "Aunt Margaret, I'll make it up to him."

One year was enough to find the person blackmailing her.

They would pay dearly.

"Focus on your acting. Time will pass before you know it," Margaret said kindly, patting her hand.

Vincent approached with a frown. "What's going on?"

"Father, I need to achieve greater success," Isabella forced a smile. "Only then will I be worthy of Adrian."

Impatience flickered in Vincent's eyes.

His meticulously groomed daughter was proving useless when it mattered most.

"Suit yourself," he said coldly before walking away.

Isabella exhaled in relief and turned to Margaret. "Aunt, I should prepare for filming."

In the opposite office, Victor murmured, "They've all left."

Adrian stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, long fingers tapping the glass.

"Well done," he said tonelessly. "Double your bonus this month."

Victor's eyes lit up. "Thank you, sir! My fiancée's dowry was giving me headaches."

Gazing outside, Adrian felt a sudden pang in his chest.

The memory of someone forever lost surfaced in his mind.
###Chapter 274

Julian Roscente walked out of his office with an impassive expression. He took the elevator straight down.

He was going to meet Evelyn Roland.

......

In the dimly lit corridor of the underground clinic, Eleanor Langley fidgeted nervously.

Her fingers turned white as she clutched her handbag.

This hospital didn’t ask for identities—only cash.

Two hours later, the door to the testing room finally opened.

"Your report."

The masked doctor handed her the file and walked away without another word.

That was the rule here—no questions, no records.

Eleanor’s hands trembled as she took the report.

She couldn’t bring herself to look.

What if the daughter she had raised for twenty years wasn’t hers?

Taking a deep breath, she flipped to the last page.

"Impossible!"

She staggered back, hitting the wall.

The results were clear: Isabella Langley shared no blood relation with her.

"How…"

The precious daughter she had groomed with such care—was she just an imposter?

For this girl, she had sent her abroad for elite education.

To keep up appearances, she had even endured years of separation.

And now, with the wedding approaching, the truth mocked her cruelly.

"Where is my real daughter?"

A cold glint flashed in Eleanor’s eyes.

Who had switched her child?

......

Evelyn had just woken up when she received Zachary Deross’s message.

Eleanor had indeed gone for the paternity test.

The result was exactly as she had predicted.

A faint smile curved her lips.

Only Vincent Langley knew the secret of her origins.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t have abandoned her in the countryside at birth.

And he wouldn’t have suddenly brought her back to the city only to neglect her.

There had to be more to this.

"Keep watching."

She replied to Zachary.

How ironic.

She still remembered Eleanor’s words when she first returned to the Langley family:

"Know your place, bastard! Isabella is the true heiress of the Langley family!"

Every child should be their mother’s treasure.

If not for the switch…

Her phone buzzed suddenly.

A message from Julian:

[See you tonight. Sent you the location. Will you come?]
###Chapter 275

Evelyn was nearly ready to forget the whole matter if he didn't reach out soon.

In rare good spirits, she decided to accept Julian's invitation.

The once frivolous young master had indeed matured lately, his brow now carrying an air of steadiness.

Her fingers tapped the screen: [See you at six.]

Sophia stirred awake. Evelyn moved to cradle her daughter. "Awake, sweetheart?"

The little girl slumped weakly against her, pale-faced, her usually bright eyes dull with illness.

Evelyn's heart ached as she offered a sippy cup. "Some water?"

Sophia shook her head, tiny fingers clutching Evelyn's collar with pleading eyes.

Understanding, Evelyn lay down to nurse. The child barely drank before dozing off again, but the fever had broken. Relief washed over her.

She pressed a kiss to her daughter's smooth forehead.

Get well soon, my little princess.

......

Golden Palace Club shimmered under crystal chandeliers.

Julian lounged across from Adrian, both exuding identical careless elegance.

Swirling his wine, Julian's smile didn't reach his eyes. "Congratulations on finally marrying your precious Isabella."

The words dripped with false cheer, his gaze sharp with mockery.

If this wedding proceeded, Adrian was walking into disaster.

Isabella's ruthlessness far surpassed her delicate facade.

She'd orchestrated the entire scheme yet let Cassandra take the fall, emerging spotless.

Not that Cassandra was innocent—poetic justice, really.

Adrian's voice turned icy. "Any news on Victor?"

He'd asked Julian to track Victor's whereabouts, only for the man's phone to go dead.

Evelyn's people had taken Victor that day—something was off, yet he couldn't uncover a single lead.

The man who commanded Vienna's underworld couldn't trace his ex-wife's movements.

His covert identity remained unusable for now. He'd have to wait.

The day his father's death was avenged would be Isabella's last as his fiancée.

Julian's expression darkened. "Uncle Ashcroft said he's overseas for medical treatment—six months minimum. Won't elaborate further."

"But why was my ex-wife there?" Adrian narrowed his eyes, recalling Evelyn's commanding presence that day—a queen surveying her domain.

Julian scoffed. "Divorce papers were signed two years ago, Adrian. Ex-wife? Let Isabella hear you say that and she'll make Evelyn's life hell again. Your darling bankrupted the Ashcrofts overnight—she terrifies me now."

Sarcasm oozed from every syllable.

His phone buzzed. Seeing Evelyn's reply, his eyes lit up instantly.

Adrian frowned. "What's got you so happy?" The man had changed lately, that habitual flippancy fading.

Julian grinned like a smitten teenager. "Evelyn agreed to dinner."

Adrian's face hardened. "You're serious about her?"

A bitter laugh escaped Julian. "Even if I were, she'd never look my way. Know Nathan's credentials? Ivy League double master's, elite hacker. Sebastian? So accomplished it's depressing."

He shook his head ruefully. "We're not even in their league."
###Chapter 276

Adrian Valentine tapped his fingers lightly on the desk before speaking abruptly. "Have you ever looked into Evelyn Roland's background?"

Julian Roscente's hand paused mid-pour, nearly spilling the wine. "Why would I?"

That docile girl's history seemed transparent at a glance.

Adrian's gaze darkened. As expected, even Julian hadn't noticed anything unusual. But even if investigated, nothing would likely surface.

"Do you know where she lives?" Adrian pressed further.

Julian slammed his glass down. "Damn it! Now that you mention it, I only have her number saved. I don't even know which district she lives in!"

A knowing smirk curled Adrian's lips.

Someone once overlooked now seemed shrouded in mystery upon reflection.

Julian suddenly lowered his voice. "She's always coming and going with Nathan Aldridge. Could it be..."

The possibility lodged like a stone in his chest.

How had he failed to recognize such a radiant gem before?

The blinders of status truly obscured one's vision.

Adrian's eyes frosted over instantly. "How would I know?"

Julian chuckled with feigned nonchalance. "Right, it's been nearly two years since your divorce. But I'll have my answer tonight."

Adrian stood and left without another word. Confirming Victor Ashcroft's safety was enough.

They'd been brothers since childhood.

Even after betrayal, he still wished for the man's survival.

Right now, his agitation bordered on murderous.

The undisputed king of the business world now stood with a clenched jaw and bloodshot eyes.

Julian watched Adrian depart, his own gaze turning icy.

He hadn't mentioned family matters.

Vincent Langley was his prime suspect, but evidence remained elusive.

Isabella Langley constantly hovered around them, skillfully extracting information in casual conversation. Only she could have uncovered the Roscente family's secrets.

Killing intent swirled in Julian's eyes. Only now did he see Isabella for the venomous serpent she was.

He walked to the floor-to-ceiling windows. Dark clouds pressed heavily against the skyline.

Winter was coming to Vienna.

It was time Vincent Langley paid his dues.

His father's investigation had already uncovered traces of the man's misdeeds.

Wind howled against the glass as Julian picked up his phone and dialed a familiar number.

Evelyn Roland was about to head out for a run when the caller ID made her frown.

"Yes?"

"Evelyn, good afternoon." Julian's voice carried false cheer.

She halted mid-step. Since when were they on such familiar terms?

Julian was Adrian's closest friend, one who'd often joined Victor in mocking her—

Convinced she'd married above her station.

"Mr. Roscente, are we acquainted?"

The words pierced Julian's chest. They'd all assumed Evelyn married Adrian for money.

Now he knew how wrong they'd been.

"I called to warn you—don't wear a skirt today."

A chill raced down Evelyn's spine. What was he planning?

"Why not?"
###Chapter 277

Julian Roscente stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, watching the swaying tree branches outside.

"Don't wear a dress tonight," he said to Evelyn Roland on the phone. "The wind's too strong."

Evelyn remained silent for a moment.

"Thanks for the warning." Her voice was icy.

Julian chuckled softly. "Evelyn, aren't we friends? No need to be so formal."

"We're not close." Evelyn hung up decisively.

Julian stared at the darkened screen, a bitter smile playing on his lips.

First impressions mattered too much.

In Evelyn's eyes, he would always be that irresponsible playboy.

Changing her opinion now would require life-and-death circumstances.

He ran his fingers through his hair in frustration.

He shouldn't have said those stupid things in front of her before.

Now she saw him as nothing but a complete jerk.

Julian sighed, grabbed his coat, and headed out.

...

Eleanor Langley stumbled into her home.

Isabella Langley was in the living room, arranging manpower against Julian.

"Mom?" She noticed her mother's pale complexion. "Are you feeling unwell?"

Eleanor avoided her daughter's concerned gaze.

This wasn't her biological child.

The girl she'd poured half her life into raising belonged to someone else.

Where was her real daughter now?

"Just a slight cold." Eleanor forced a smile. "I'm going to rest."

She couldn't bear to look at Isabella.

Every glance reminded her that her true daughter might be suffering somewhere.

"Let me get you some water." Isabella stood up.

"No need." Eleanor hurried upstairs.

She wanted nothing more than to be alone.

Isabella frowned at her mother's retreating figure.

Her mother was acting strangely today.

"Mom, should we go to the hospital?"

Eleanor froze mid-step.

That word "Mom" stabbed through her heart like a knife.

"I'll be fine after some sleep." She shut the bedroom door without looking back.

Collapsing onto the bed, the tears finally came.

What had really happened all those years ago?

Was her real daughter safe? Was she happy?

Eleanor curled up on the bed and wept like a child.
###Chapter 278

Eleanor Langley wearily closed her eyes.

......

Evelyn Roland had just stepped out the door when her phone vibrated.

"Speak."

"Boss, Mrs. Langley has returned. What's our next move?"

A sly smile curved Evelyn's lips. "Stand down. She'll make her move soon. Keep close surveillance—you're too conspicuous."

"Send me your location. Pick me up and grab dinner on your own."

After hanging up, Evelyn remembered Julian Roscente's invitation and texted Nathan Aldridge.

[Any progress?]

Nathan replied instantly.

[Boss, we've identified a suspicious individual. Photo sent.]

A man in a black suit appeared on her screen.

The sharp-eyed thirty-six-year-old had a prominent mole between his brows. His muscular frame betrayed years of combat training.

Evelyn called immediately. "Got his identity? Name?"

Nathan's voice turned grave. "Shang. Thirty-six. Ex-mercenary. Highly skilled. Be careful."

"Understood."

Nathan added anxiously, "I'll arrange covert protection. You can't afford any incidents these years."

A cold glint flashed in Evelyn's eyes. "You think I can't take him?"

"Wouldn't dream of it," Nathan backpedaled.

"Later." Evelyn pocketed her phone and started the car.

Julian had booked her favorite private dining club.

Parking swiftly, she strode toward the entrance.

A familiar silhouette caught her eye near a black sedan. She passed without reaction.

At the second-floor staircase, Julian waited eagerly.

Tonight Evelyn wore pink casualwear, her porcelain skin glowing, starry eyes mesmerizing.

Julian's breath caught. "Evelyn."

She nodded curtly.

"Private room's at the end. This way."

As they walked, Adrian Valentine lurked around the corner, glaring at Evelyn's retreating figure.

She actually came.

Skipped work today, yet remembered Julian's invitation.

Two years divorced, she shone brighter than ever.

Did Christian Lefèvre's fiery death weigh nothing on her conscience?

Evelyn Roland, is your heart made of stone?

Adrian clenched his fists and turned away.

This torment of love and hatred was driving him mad.

In the private room, dishes already covered the table.

Julian eagerly piled food onto Evelyn's plate.

She frowned at the mountain in her bowl. "I'll serve myself."

Noticing her displeasure, he withdrew awkwardly. "Care for some wine?"
###Chapter 279

Evelyn set down her chopsticks, a mocking smile playing on her lips. "Julian Roscente, you've learned to bow your head."

She never expected to hear so many apologies from him.

The once-arrogant young master of the Roscente family now spoke with such humility.

Julian gave a bitter laugh. "This past year, I've tasted the bitterness of life."

His long fingers tapped lightly on the table. "First the lawsuit, then the counterfeit antiques scandal. The Roscente assets shrank by billions. Someone is clearly pulling the strings behind the scenes."

His eyes darkened at the mention of the Ashcroft family.

"Evelyn, I was blind before." His voice was low. "I hope you'll accept my apology."

She arched a brow. "Why come to me about your family's troubles?"

"Because you always see what others don't." Julian leaned forward. "You predicted both crises. I suspect someone is targeting the Roscentes, just like they did to the Ashcrofts."

A flicker passed through Evelyn's eyes.

Since the Evans family incident, she'd sensed an invisible net tightening around them.

"Be careful lately." She picked up a piece of fish. "All the major families could be targets."

Julian's pupils constricted. "You mean..."

"I don't have concrete evidence yet." Evelyn's tone was calm. "But if you're not careful, you'll be the next one sleeping under a bridge."

His face paled.

Clenching his fists, he whispered, "Evelyn, help me."

She thought of the photos Nathan had sent, her expression thoughtful. "Let's wait and see."

"I can't wait!" Julian's voice trembled. "My father's hair has turned white from worry."

Evelyn suddenly laughed. "Why would you think I know anything?"

"You're investigating Alexander Durand." Julian met her gaze directly. "And... you're not ordinary."

He leaned back in his chair. "Only now do I see Isabella Langley's true colors."

Sunlight streamed through the window, casting shadows across his sharp profile.

Evelyn scoffed. "Didn't someone say Isabella was kind and gentle, while I wasn't fit to carry her shoes?"

"Or that I was some country bumpkin who lowered your standards just by sitting with you?"

Julian's ears turned red. "Enough..."

"I was blind before." His voice was hoarse. "I'd never known hardship, never understood real suffering."

He looked up, his eyes filled with unprecedented sincerity. "I've truly changed."

Evelyn paused, momentarily taken aback.
###Chapter 280

"Julian Roscente, you don't need to do this. We were never friends to begin with. Your words can't hurt me."

Evelyn Roland lowered her gaze, idly pushing food around her plate with chopsticks. The hurt dissipated like raindrops vanishing into water.

Julian's chest constricted sharply.

The phrase "never friends" cut deeper than any blade.

He forced a bitter smile. "After how I treated you, I understand why you'd refuse to acknowledge our friendship. But Evelyn, making mistakes is easy—atonement is hard. Don't I deserve a chance?"

A faint laugh escaped her lips. "You're all just passing figures in my life. Does forgiveness even matter? If you need it so badly, then fine—I forgive you."

"Life is nothing but laughing at others' misfortunes while occasionally becoming the joke yourself. Your happiness built on others' pain only proves you've never truly lost anything."

Finally, she met his eyes. "Julian, these past few years I've paused everything just to search for the meaning of existence."

She'd found it—and been wounded most deeply in the process.

Love had become an unattainable luxury.

"Evelyn... Adrian Valentine is getting engaged. Are you... alright?" He studied her expression carefully.

The name struck like a physical blow. Her heart contracted violently. "If there's no love left, why would it matter?"

"No love means no pain."

Julian saw the flash of anguish in her eyes. She hadn't moved on at all.

Adrian had betrayed her first, yet what had they all done to Evelyn?

If it were him, he'd want to tear the perpetrator limb from limb.

Yet they'd taken pleasure in hurting her.

The more Julian thought about it, the more monstrous he felt.

"Evelyn..."

"Evelyn..."

"I've been investigating your family matter. I'll inform you if I find anything. But don't misunderstand—this isn't for you. My own inquiry happens to intersect with your family's affairs. I don't hold grudges about the past because... I don't even remember what you said."

She stood, observing his stunned expression, then turned and walked away without another word.

Julian laughed bitterly. So this was how it felt to leave no impression on someone who didn't care about you.

They'd looked down on Evelyn, but when had she ever truly regarded them?

Stepping out of the restaurant into the night breeze, Julian didn't notice the shadowy figure emerging behind him.

"If there's no love left, why would it matter?" The words echoed relentlessly in Adrian Valentine's mind.

A sharp pain lanced through his chest as he quickened his pace after them.

Evelyn slid into her car, watching Julian's vehicle exit the parking lot.

Her gaze shifted to another car tailing his.

Just as Nathan Aldridge had warned—Julian was being followed.

Who could have sent them?

Starting the engine, she maintained a discreet distance behind the procession.

Adrian's car melted into the darkness, bringing up the rear.

Julian lived in the suburban villa district. As traffic thinned, the streets grew eerily quiet.

An inexplicable unease gripped him.

"Young master, several cars have been following us for a while now." The driver's voice tensed.
###Chapter 281

Julian Roscente leaned back in the car seat, his fingers tapping lightly on the armrest. He pondered how to make Evelyn Roland see him in a new light.

Through the window, his gaze followed her slender figure. There was an undeniable sharpness in Evelyn's every movement—a stark contrast to Isabella Langley's affected mannerisms.

"Mr. Roscente, we've got a tail," his assistant suddenly warned.

Julian's expression darkened. Evelyn had just cautioned him to be careful. Had the threat arrived so soon?

He turned to look. The black sedan behind them abruptly accelerated.

"Watch out!" Julian barked.

CRASH!

The deafening impact shattered the night. Their car was violently rammed into the guardrail.

Evelyn's pupils contracted. The assailants had struck faster than she anticipated.

Julian's world spun. The brutal collision left his vision swimming.

Instinctively shielding his head, he managed a bitter smile. Was this how he would die today?

The car flipped multiple times before finally coming to a stop.

Not far away, a man wielding an axe emerged from the black sedan.

Evelyn narrowed her eyes. The attacker raised the axe and swung it at the car window without hesitation.

BANG! BANG!

The glass shattered instantly.

The axe lifted again, poised to strike Julian's skull.

At the last possible second, Evelyn slammed her foot on the accelerator.

The man sensed danger and hesitated for a split second.

That was all the time she needed.

A gun appeared in Evelyn's hand.

BANG!

The bullet struck the man's wrist with deadly precision. The axe clattered to the ground.

The assailant quickly retrieved his weapon and fled back to his car.

With a roar of the engine, the black sedan vanished into the night.

But the danger wasn't over.

A lighter was tossed onto the pavement.

WHOOSH!

Flames erupted skyward.

Evelyn leaped from her car and sprinted toward Julian.

Through his fading consciousness, Julian glimpsed her agile silhouette against the inferno. She knew how to shoot?

"Julian!" Evelyn pounded on the shattered window.

"E...Evelyn..." His bloodied lips curved weakly. Of all people, she was the one who came back for him.

"Get out! The car's going to blow!"

Julian shook his head. "Run... Save yourself..."

Evelyn yanked at the mangled door with all her strength.

Nearby, his assistant Lucas kicked open his door but couldn't move. "Mr. Roscente! My leg's trapped!"

The fire grew fiercer by the second.

Evelyn whirled around and dashed back to her car. She grabbed a jack and a steel rod before charging back into the flames.
###Chapter 282

Evelyn slammed the jack switch.

The car lifted rapidly under hydraulic pressure.

She grabbed the crowbar and wedged it into the door seam with brutal force.

Inside the driver's seat, Victor Ashcroft was barely conscious. The steering wheel had crushed his chest, blood trickling from his lips.

Evelyn quickly assessed his injuries—nothing immediately fatal.

Just as Victor slumped forward, a pair of strong hands steadied him.

Adrian Valentine had appeared out of nowhere.

Evelyn only paused for a second before turning to smash the passenger door.

Bang!

The door finally gave way.

Her palms were split open, blood dripping from her fingertips.

Julian Roscente lay unconscious in the seat.

"Wake up!" Evelyn yanked his shoulders, dragging him out.

Adrian moved to help.

Together, they pulled the tall man free.

"Move!" Adrian barked.

The explosion's shockwave sent all three sprawling.

Evelyn felt weight press against her back.

The familiar scent of cedar enveloped her.

"Are you hurt?" Adrian's voice was close, strained.

In the firelight, worry etched his features.

Her heart stuttered.

Then she steeled herself. "Not your concern."

Adrian staggered to his feet.

His white suit jacket was soaked with blood.

Evelyn's breath caught.

The metallic tang filled her senses.

He'd shielded her with his body.

An invisible fist clenched around her heart.

She forced herself to look away.

The three limped to Evelyn's car.

She tossed them止血药 from the first-aid kit.

Tires screeched against asphalt.

The hospital corridor lights glared sterile white.

Evelyn mechanically answered her phone.

"Evelyn?" Victoria's voice was tight with worry.

"Watch the children." Evelyn stared at the手术室's red light.

Silence.

"You're injured?" Victoria's sharp intuition never missed a beat.
###Chapter 283

Evelyn hesitated for a moment before dialing Victoria's number.

"There was an accident tonight," she whispered. "Please take care of the children."

Victoria finally relaxed after hearing the details. Knowing Nathan had arranged bodyguards to protect Evelyn eased her worries.

Meanwhile, Isabella's phone screen lit up.

[The mission failed, but Julian Roscente is severely injured.]

Isabella's fingers tightened around her phone, a cold glint flashing in her eyes.

[Make sure he never wakes up. With him gone, the Roscente family will collapse.]

[Understood. I'll find another opportunity.]

......

The operating room lights finally turned off.

The doctor removed his mask. "Mr. Ashcroft has fractured ribs, which we've treated. Mr. Roscente suffered a head injury with minor concussion and multiple external wounds. He's currently unconscious. Mr. Valentine has back injuries—superficial wounds."

Evelyn saw Adrian being wheeled out face down. His intense gaze locked onto the wound on her hand, his brow furrowed.

"Miss," the doctor asked excitedly, "was there any special treatment administered before arrival? The bleeding was severe but stopped remarkably fast."

"I used a special hemostatic agent," Evelyn replied calmly.

"Incredible!" The doctor marveled. "The rib fracture patient's thoracic bleeding was controlled in time, avoiding a second surgery."

Adrian watched Evelyn silently. For the first time, he realized her medical skills were extraordinary.

The well-stocked first aid kit in her car, her practiced movements—none of it was coincidence. He knew so little about his own wife.

"Please arrange a triple room," Evelyn told the nurse.

She needed to monitor all three patients until their families arrived.

"The ward is across from the inpatient department. Follow me." The nurse pushed the gurney.

The doctor hurried after her, eyes alight with curiosity. "Could you introduce me to the pharmacist who developed that formula?"

Evelyn smiled without answering and followed the gurney.

The doctor sighed, shaking his head at her retreating figure. "Such a groundbreaking hemostatic formula... what a waste."

In the ward, Vincent and Julian were already asleep. Only Adrian remained stubbornly awake.

Evelyn frowned at the bedside. None of them had contacted their families.

She had to return home to the children and couldn't stay overnight.

Her gaze met Adrian's.

She'd meant to ask for the Roscente family's contact, then remembered someone else.

"Victor," she said when the call connected, "your CEO was in a car accident. I'm sending the address. Come immediately."
###Chapter 284

Victor's voice was laced with urgency. "Understood, thank you, Mrs. Roland. I'll be there right away. Please keep an eye on Mr. Valentine in the meantime."

Evelyn gave a curt acknowledgment before ending the call.

She double-checked the IV drips for both patients, then took a seat on the bench near the doorway, maintaining a deliberate distance.

Adrian watched through half-lidded eyes as she positioned herself far from his bedside. The familiar ache flared in his chest.

She had changed.

In the past, even for a simple cold, she would have stayed by his side day and night, refusing to sleep until he recovered. She would remind him to take his medication long after he'd healed.

But now...

He shut his eyes, the image of Christian writhing in flames flashing behind his eyelids.

Evelyn sent a message to Nathan.

Nathan: [Still tracing the person in the photo. He targeted Julian today—I happened to be there.]

She stared at the screen, lost in thought.

Could this be the same group that framed Vincent?

Or were they Vincent Langley's men?

Vincent had always been ambitious. Last year, he'd even run for public office. Given his nature, it wouldn't be surprising if he coveted the presidency itself.

But why target the elite families?

Did they oppose him?

Was elimination his answer to dissent?

Evelyn leaned against the cold wall, brows furrowed.

No. Vincent was currently tied up with the diamond smuggling case. He wouldn't have the bandwidth to orchestrate an attack on the Roscente family.

Something felt off.

Sophia had been missing for over a year. Isabella's movements needed to be investigated as well.

The woman had been acting strangely lately.

Her gaze shifted unpredictably—sometimes sharp as a blade, other times deceptively gentle. That tenderness felt meticulously crafted.

Yet too many inconsistencies remained unexplained.

From Alexander's family to Vincent's, then Julian's... What connected them?

Evelyn massaged her temples.

She knew these families' public profiles inside out. Unless... there were secrets even she wasn't privy to.

Nathan's reply interrupted her train of thought.

[Where's Vincent Langley tonight?]

Zachary responded promptly: [Boss, he's currently wrapped up in a cozy evening with Mrs. Valentine.]

A thought struck her. [Hypothetical question.]

Zachary: [Go ahead, Boss.]

Evelyn: [Suppose Isabella is Mrs. Valentine's daughter.]

A string of question marks followed: [???]

[Boss, are you serious? If she were Mrs. Valentine's daughter, how could Isabella have married Adrian?]

Evelyn studied the screen blankly.

Right. Siblings couldn't marry.

Had she really regressed to such wishful thinking?

But Mrs. Valentine's behavior toward Isabella... Was it because she was her daughter-in-law, or due to her ties with Vincent?

Evelyn stood and began pacing.

The nagging sense of an elusive truth gnawed at her.

Adrian opened his eyes to see her striding back and forth, lost in thought.

Some habits never changed. Whenever she wrestled with a problem, she would pace like this, retreating into her own world.

In that moment, he remembered—this seemingly fragile woman had once committed an act so ruthless, it still haunted him.
###Chapter 285

"Evelyn, come here." Adrian Valentine's smoldering gaze burned into her silhouette by the doorway.

Why should he suffer alone while she remained composed?

Evelyn Roland took a wary step back, her voice icy at his darkened expression. "We'll talk when your assistant arrives."

This man had no sense of boundaries. Divorce meant distance.

Adrian's fingers clenched the hospital sheets before falling still.

The strained position aggravated his wounds, sweat soaking through his gown.

Evelyn glanced at her phone.

A message from Zachary:
[Boss, how bad are the injuries?]

Evelyn: [Surface wounds. Getting treated soon.]

Zachary: [Go now! If Gabrielle sees you hurt, she'll skin me alive.]

Evelyn: [She's gentle. Don't exaggerate.]

Zachary: [Gentle? Last time I lost your pen, she chased me down three blocks screaming!]

Her fingers paused.

That pen had been Gabrielle's birthday gift to her.

The sweet-faced woman turned into a spitting wildcat when protecting what she cherished.

Evelyn: [Monitor Mrs. Langley's movements.]

Zachary: [On it! But please tend to your wounds first!]

A soft laugh escaped her. Fearless Zachary had finally met his match.

Confirming the three patients were stable, she turned to leave.

The closing door startled Adrian.

He jerked upright—only catching the swinging door.

"Tch." A bitter smirk twisted his lips as fire lanced across his back.

Then he remembered the blood trailing down her arm.

Gritting his teeth, Adrian hauled himself up and staggered after her.

The nurses' station glowed brightly.

"Change the dressing daily," a nurse murmured, admiring Evelyn's wrist. "Such beautiful skin shouldn't scar."

Evelyn lowered her lashes. "It won't."

She had her own remedies.

Adrian lurked in the shadows.

That delicate wrist had once fit perfectly in his grasp.

Her calming fragrance, skin softer than silk—

He'd canceled all social engagements, insisting she accompany every business trip. Only in her arms could he sleep.

Now he stared at the ceiling till dawn.

Hate and longing tore at him.

Her light laughter floated down the hall.

She laughed more freely since leaving him.

Perhaps Alexander's shadow had finally lifted.

As she turned, Adrian hastily retreated.

Blood seeped through his bandages with each step—like walking on blades.
###Chapter 286

Adrian Valentine staggered into the room first, collapsing weakly onto the hospital bed.

Evelyn Roland pushed the door open and saw beads of sweat glistening on his forehead.

The man turned his face away sharply, avoiding her gaze.

She walked slowly to the bedside and sat down, watching him with calm eyes.

This was the first time she'd seen Adrian so disheveled.

In her memories, he was always poised and elegant—even when delivering their divorce papers with that cruel smile.

A faint floral scent drifted into Adrian's senses, making his pulse quicken. He'd underestimated how much she still affected him.

"Mr. Valentine, your engagement party is in two days." Evelyn's lips curled coldly. "Congratulations on finally getting what you wanted."

The words "girlfriend" stabbed at Adrian's heart.

"Your congratulations make me sick," he sneered.

Instantly, he regretted it.

Evelyn felt as if a needle had pierced her chest. So in his eyes, she'd always been worthless.

She remembered that night when he'd asked hesitantly, "Evelyn, will you marry me?"

No romantic proposal—just a blunt request.

How foolish her past self had been to feel touched by that.

She rose gracefully, meeting his furious gaze before turning away without a word.

Adrian shut his eyes in agony.

"Evelyn!"

Sebastian Orlando burst in, his eyes frantically searching for her.

"Why didn't you tell me you were hurt?" His voice was thick with worry. "You never listen. Now you've learned your lesson?"

He began inspecting her injuries with trembling hands.

Evelyn stared at him dazedly. "Alex..."

Sebastian froze, pain flashing across his face. "Silly girl, Alex has been gone for six years."

Tears slid silently down her cheeks.

He pulled her into his arms, gently stroking her hair. "Don't cry. Alex would want you to be happy."

"Evelyn Roland!" Adrian's sharp voice cut through the room. "Couldn't wait to throw yourself at him?"

Sebastian shot him a icy glare. "I'm holding my girlfriend. That's none of your concern, Mr. Valentine."

"Girlfriend?" Adrian scoffed.

Sebastian tightened his arm around Evelyn. "Let's go."

"Okay."

A sudden emptiness gripped Adrian's chest.

Just as Evelyn reached for her bag, the door slammed open violently.
###Chapter 287

Margaret Valentine stormed into the hospital room in her stilettos, immediately spotting Evelyn Roland by the window.

She rushed forward and raised her hand to strike. "Evelyn, you jinx! Every time you're around, something terrible happens to my son!"

Evelyn sidestepped the blow, her gaze icy.

"His injury has nothing to do with me," she said calmly. "Mrs. Valentine, your son and I are already divorced."

Margaret trembled with rage. "His engagement party is in two days, and now he's hospitalized! Don't pretend you had no part in this."

"Your imagination is impressive," Evelyn scoffed. "If I wanted to sabotage things, wouldn't I just crash the engagement party?"

Margaret was momentarily speechless.

"You fatherless bastard," she spat. "How dare you still cling to our family? Get lost!"

Evelyn's fingers twitched slightly.

"Mrs. Valentine," she enunciated each word, "this 'bastard' was once your son's lawfully wedded wife."

The door swung open.

Victor Ashcroft supported Adrian Valentine as he stood in the doorway. Pale but determined, Adrian's eyes locked onto Evelyn.

"Mother," he rasped, "my injury has nothing to do with Evelyn."

Margaret instantly changed her tone. "Adrian! You shouldn't be out of bed. The doctor said—"

"Enough." Adrian cut her off. "I asked Evelyn to come."

Margaret's eyes widened in shock. Evelyn also turned to Adrian in surprise.

"Evelyn," Adrian said with difficulty, "can we talk alone?"

Margaret shrieked, "Absolutely not! Adrian, have you lost your mind? Isabella is waiting for you at home—"

"Mother!" Adrian raised his voice uncharacteristically. "Please leave."

Stunned by her son's rare firmness, Margaret shot Evelyn a venomous glare before stomping out and slamming the door.

An uneasy silence fell.

Victor discreetly exited to the hallway.

Evelyn remained still. "What do you want, Mr. Valentine?"

Adrian, his chest bandaged, slowly approached her.

"That day in the parking lot..." His voice was low. "Thank you."

Evelyn turned her face away. "Don't mention it. I'd have done the same for anyone."

Adrian's expression darkened.

"Congratulations on your engagement," Evelyn suddenly said with a smile.

Adrian grabbed her wrist. "Evelyn!"

"Let go." Her voice was frigid.

"What if..." Adrian swallowed hard. "What if I don't want to go through with it?"

Evelyn yanked her arm free.

"Adrian," her eyes were glacial, "don't make me lose respect for you."

Margaret's shrill voice pierced through the door. "Isabella! What are you doing here?"

Isabella Langley's delicate voice answered, "Aunt Margaret, I heard about Adrian's injury..."

Evelyn's lips curled in derision.

"Your fiancée is here." She stepped back. "Get well soon, Mr. Valentine."

Adrian tried to follow but winced in pain.

Evelyn walked out without looking back, nearly colliding with Isabella's tearful face.

"Evelyn..." Isabella began timidly.

Evelyn brushed past her without acknowledgment, heading straight for the elevators.

Margaret's spiteful voice carried down the hallway. "See how ill-mannered she is? Don't take it to heart, Isabella..."

As the elevator doors closed, Evelyn's eyes finally reddened.

She clenched her fists until her nails dug into her palms.

The elevator dinged at the ground floor.

Evelyn took a deep breath and strode out with her head high.

Just outside the hospital entrance, a black Maybach pulled up beside her.

The window rolled down to reveal Sebastian Orlando's amused face.

"Did the Valentines give you trouble again?" He raised an eyebrow.

Evelyn got in. "Just drive."

Sebastian chuckled and accelerated.

The hospital shrank in the rearview mirror.

"Was it worth it?" he suddenly asked.

Evelyn watched the passing scenery. "It stopped being worth it long ago."
###Chapter 288

Adrian Valentine's brows furrowed deeply, his gaze sharp as a blade as he stared at Margaret Valentine.

His fingertips trembled slightly as he suppressed the fury surging in his chest.

Evelyn Roland's words still echoed in his ears. He let out a cold laugh. "Evelyn, do you really think I won't send you to prison?"

Evelyn lifted her eyes, meeting his hate-filled stare.

That look was like a poisoned arrow, piercing straight through her heart.

Sebastian Orlando tightened his grip on her hand, his voice deceptively gentle. "Evelyn, should I make the Valentine family disappear?"

His gaze locked onto hers, dark currents swirling in his eyes.

Evelyn's breath hitched.

She hated Adrian, but she had never considered destroying the Valentines.

Not loving someone wasn't a crime.

Betrayal was.

Adrian scoffed. "With just the Orlandos?"

He didn’t even spare Sebastian Cortez a second glance, let alone the insignificant Orlando family.

Isabella Langley appeared at the perfect moment, a calculating glint flashing in her eyes.

She feigned weakness as she approached. "Evelyn, it's all my fault—"

Evelyn cut her off sharply. "Had enough of your act?"

Isabella's face stiffened.

"Get lost." Evelyn turned to leave.

Margaret suddenly blocked her path. "If you want to repay your debt, then disappear forever!"

Evelyn narrowed her eyes. "Would the Langleys even dare to admit it?"

She caught the flicker of panic in Margaret's gaze.

Isabella quickly interjected. "My father saved you—"

"Wasn't billions in diamonds enough?" Evelyn sneered.

Sebastian's dark eyes swept over Isabella with chilling intensity.

Adrian watched their intertwined hands, his chest tightening with an inexplicable ache.

It suddenly occurred to him—the recent string of canceled business deals.

Was Sebastian pulling the strings behind the scenes?
###Chapter 289

"Stop." Adrian Valentine's icy voice echoed through the hospital room.

Evelyn Roland and Sebastian Orlando turned simultaneously.

Adrian's sharp gaze pierced Sebastian. "You're the one who intercepted those three projects last month."

A provocative smile curled Sebastian's lips. "Guilty as charged. Bring it on if you want revenge."

Evelyn stared at him in shock.

Margaret Valentine's face darkened as she pointed at Evelyn. "You vile wretch! How dare you collude with outsiders to sabotage the Valentines? Make him return those projects immediately, or you'll regret it!"

Isabella Langley chimed in, feigning concern. "Evelyn, even after divorcing Adrian, how could you be so cruel?"

"Shut it." Sebastian's glare turned lethal. "Evelyn had nothing to do with this. Unlike you, whose specialty is framing others."

Isabella trembled with rage.

"Let's go." Sebastian took Evelyn's hand.

She walked away without looking back.

Adrian's eyes darkened as he watched their intertwined fingers.

"Adrian, are you badly hurt?" Isabella hovered by his bedside, a flicker of resentment in her eyes. He'd taken a knife for Evelyn.

"Get out." His tone was glacial.

Isabella shot a resentful glance at Julian Roscente in the adjacent bed. The man was still alive.

"Darling, shouldn't you be resting for tomorrow's shoot?" Margaret cooed at Isabella.

Adrian narrowed his eyes. His mother treated Isabella with more affection than her own daughter.

Remembering Isabella's connection to Vincent Langley, a chill crept into his bones.
###Chapter 290

"Mrs. Valentine, don't worry. I'm young and strong enough to take care of Adrian. You should go home and rest—your back injury hasn't fully healed yet."

Isabella gently supported Margaret's arm.

Margaret frowned. Her chronic back pain had plagued her for years, and only Evelyn's touch had ever brought relief. But pride kept her from begging that girl for help.

Now she relied on painkillers. As long as she avoided strenuous activity, she could endure it.

The memory of Evelyn's healing hands left a bitter taste in her mouth.

"Fine. You young people should spend time together. Isabella, I'll inform Julian's family about his condition."

Isabella nodded sweetly. "Let me walk you downstairs, Mrs. Valentine."

"Such a thoughtful girl." Margaret patted her hand approvingly. "If only Adrian would marry someone like you."

Adrian's cold voice cut in. "Everyone leave. Victor stays."

"Adrian—"

"You have filming tomorrow. Don't neglect your work." His tone brooked no argument. "Victor knows my routines better."

Victor stepped forward. "Don't worry, Ms. Langley. I'll take care of the CEO."

Isabella was exhausted. Dark circles wouldn't suit her on camera tomorrow.

"Rest well, Adrian. I'll visit after filming."

Adrian gave a noncommittal hum.

Margaret paused at the door. "Remember, Adrian—that Evelyn conspired against our family. Don't you dare soften toward her."

Silence.

Margaret's eyes gleamed with grim satisfaction. She knew exactly how much her son had loved Evelyn.

Now he would taste the same agony she'd endured.

As she left, Isabella discreetly planted a surveillance bug on the doorframe.

Once alone, Adrian spoke. "Call Mr. Roscente."

Victor understood. "Right away."

In the hallway, Victor dialed the Roscente residence.

Adrian lay facedown, memories flooding back—Evelyn tending his wounds, her gentle hands. Even Sebastian Orlando knew her childhood nickname, while her own husband remained ignorant.

"CEO, what really happened?" Victor returned, voice tight. "Why were you both injured?"

Adrian's eyes snapped open. "Someone tried to kill Julian."

Victor inhaled sharply. "Who would dare?"

The Roscente family had suffered heavy losses these past years. Even their shrewd patriarch had stumbled in his twilight years.

A cold smile curled Adrian's lips. "I'd very much like to know who's so eager for his death."
###Chapter 291

Victor stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, his fingers lightly tapping the glass. "Mr. Valentine, should I investigate who targeted Julian Roscente?"

Adrian Valentine paused briefly while flipping through the documents. "No need."

He closed the folder, a cold glint flashing in his eyes. "Let him find out himself."

Victor wisely fell silent.

He knew exactly how deep the Roscente family's secrets ran. Their patriarch's ruthlessness surpassed even their darkest expectations.

Sebastian Orlando's car glided through the bustling streets.

Evelyn Roland stared out the window at the passing scenery, silent.

At a red light, Sebastian glanced at her. "Evelyn, are you upset that I went after Adrian?"

Her lashes trembled slightly. "Sebastian, I just don't understand."

She turned to face him directly. "Why target him?"

His grip on the steering wheel tightened, shadows flickering in his eyes.

"He hurt you." His voice softened. "I promised Alexander I'd protect you."

Evelyn's fingers dug into her palms.

Sebastian watched her bowed head, his chest tightening. She still cared about that man.

"Evelyn..." He suddenly frowned. "I'm not feeling well."

Her head snapped up. "What's wrong? Why didn't you say something sooner?"

She reached for his forehead, her fingertips meeting scorching heat.

"You're burning up!" She quickly checked his pulse.

Sebastian closed his eyes, savoring the warmth of her touch.

The pulse was weak, his lungs irregular. Evelyn's heart clenched. "Sebastian, you—"

"Aftereffects from the car accident two years ago." He casually withdrew his hand. "It's nothing."

Evelyn remembered Sebastian Cortez mentioning it.

"I'll drive." She unbuckled her seatbelt with finality.

This time, Sebastian didn't protest.

The car pulled smoothly into Regal Heights.

"Sit down first." She helped him into the living room. "I'll get the medicine."

Sebastian leaned back on the sofa, his gaze tender. "No rush. Where are Felicia and Ethan?"

A faint smile touched his lips. "I already miss them after just one day."

Her children were as precious to him as his own.
###Chapter 292

Evelyn stood in the living room, listening to Sophia's bell-like laughter drifting down from upstairs.

The corners of her lips lifted unconsciously.

"Mommy!" Sophia waved excitedly from Victoria's arms.

Victoria held the quiet Ethan in her other arm.

Both children squirmed eagerly toward Evelyn the moment they saw her.

Watching their innocent joy warmed Evelyn's heart.

"Take them downstairs first. I need to get the medical kit."

Gabrielle's sharp eyes caught the injury on Evelyn's arm, her face instantly darkening.

"Sister! This is how Zachary protects you?" She stomped her foot in anger.

Evelyn chuckled at her sudden outburst.

"It's just a scratch. Don't overreact."

She turned and headed to the bedroom, retrieving the medical kit to check the supplies.

When she came downstairs, she saw Sebastian holding Sophia.

The little girl clung to his neck, planting a sloppy kiss on his cheek.

"Mr. Orlando, Sophia just adores you." Gabrielle looked slightly embarrassed.

Sebastian smiled gently. "How could I mind?"

He reluctantly handed Sophia back to Gabrielle, worried about passing anything to the child.

Evelyn approached with the medical kit.

"Thank you for this." Sebastian's voice was hoarse.

Victoria and Gabrielle tactfully took the children away.

Evelyn poured him a glass of water and handed him a pill.

"Take this first. One daily. Your condition will improve in six months."

Surprise flickered in Sebastian's eyes.

"Your medical skills remain impeccable."

Evelyn smiled faintly. "Years of practice."

She urged him to rest and personally walked him out.

When they reached the opposite courtyard, she froze.

Moonlight bathed the garden of swaying roses.

She remembered his promise—to fill a garden with roses for her.

Sebastian suddenly stopped.

"Evelyn, have you truly let go of Adrian?"
###Chapter 293

Evelyn gazed into Sebastian Orlando's deep eyes, sensing an uncanny familiarity about him tonight.

The way he scolded Isabella Langley with that roguish attitude was identical to Alexander Durand's mannerisms.

Meeting his expectant gaze, she dismissed her doubts. A person's essence couldn't change so easily. Alexander's unique aura wasn't something anyone could replicate.

"Sebastian, that chapter of my life is over. You should rest. I need to check on the children."

She turned to leave.

Sebastian watched her retreating figure, a shadow flickering in his eyes. Evelyn, have you really given up on me?

Only after confirming she'd safely entered the opposite apartment did he shut the door. The thought of Vincent Langley's successful scheme twisted his lips into an uncharacteristically cold smirk.

Vincent Langley, I'll make sure you savor every bitter drop of defeat.

The mineral atlas was exhausted. Even with Vincent's resources, not a single diamond remained to be mined.

Evelyn's phone rang the moment she stepped into the living room.

Seeing Vincent's caller ID, her eyes turned glacial. So he's finally made contact.

"Hello." Her voice could freeze hell itself.

"Evelyn, Phoenix Group seized all the diamonds I excavated. Their influence is too powerful. The atlas is depleted now—there's nowhere left to dig."

Vincent's tone held an unfamiliar gentleness she'd never heard before.

"You're the only one who's seen that painting. Can you help me locate it?"

Evelyn smirked inwardly. The atlas had been destroyed long ago. This was her chance to toy with him. Those diamonds had fallen into her hands effortlessly.

"Mr. Langley, I've been searching for that painting too, but found no leads. I truly wish to fulfill Alexander's dream."

Everything proceeded according to plan. Next, she'd lure Vincent into his own trap.

"Evelyn, this was Alexander's final hope. At the auction that day—do you really not remember what that woman looked like?" Vincent pressed urgently.

"Chairman Langley, I'll keep searching and notify you immediately if anything surfaces."

Ending the call, her eyes hardened further.

Adrian Valentine's venomous threat to imprison her still haunted her. Knowing him, this vendetta ran deeper than just Alexander.

But with no concrete clues, her priority remained the children.

Vincent paced his bedroom like a caged predator.

Alexander had discovered ore a hundred times more valuable than diamonds. Without that painting, even the most advanced equipment couldn't pinpoint its location.

Alexander was a born genius. Finding that masterpiece meant acquiring wealth beyond imagination.
###Chapter 294

To amass a fortune that could rival nations—that was Vincent Langley's relentless pursuit.

Anyone who stood in his way would vanish without a trace.

The call connected, and Dominic Lombardi's voice came through.

"Mr. Langley."

"Have you uncovered Phoenix Group's background?"

Dominic's voice tensed. "Sir, they're too well-hidden. Not even a shadow of them can be traced. These people are highly trained—far beyond my clearance level."

Vincent narrowed his eyes.

Abroad, he could operate with impunity.

But on home soil, he had to tread carefully.

His path to legitimacy couldn't afford a single misstep.

"Keep digging!" Vincent slammed his palm on the desk. "Find them. Retrieve those diamonds at any cost. How dare they touch what's mine!"

A weighted silence filled the line.

Dominic knew how obsessively his boss coveted those diamonds.

They were the golden ticket into the world's elite.

"Sir, I've been monitoring the diamond situation. But the operation against Julian Roscente failed. He survived and is now hospitalized with Adrian Valentine."

Vincent's brow twitched.

Adrian was in the hospital too?

"Perfect," he sneered. "Now we have grounds to postpone his engagement to Isabella."

Dominic understood immediately.

Adrian's sudden interest in Isabella was clearly an investigation into the past.

After hanging up, Vincent stood before the floor-to-ceiling windows.

Years of meticulous planning, yet progress remained agonizingly slow.

What was Adrian compared to him?

If only he could secure Sebastian Cortez's alliance...

But that man cared only for power.

——

Downstairs in the living room, Isabella flipped through a script, noticing her mother's distracted expression.

"Mother, is something troubling you?" She closed the binder.

Eleanor Langley snapped out of her thoughts, forcing a smile. "Just missing your brother. Another year without him home for the holidays. The house feels incomplete."

Isabella handed her a teacup. "He's doing well abroad. Don't worry."

Eleanor stared blankly at the cup.

This wasn't her real daughter.

Where was her true child?

She rose and headed upstairs, her posture heavy with exhaustion.

Watching her mother retreat, Isabella dialed Warren Garten.

"Miss me already?" His tone was teasing.

Isabella's voice turned icy. "Cut the act. Track my mother's recent movements."

"Consider it done." He paused. "Should I come over tonight?"
###Chapter 295

"Do you have a death wish? My parents are home." Isabella Langley sneered before hanging up.

Her fingertips lingered on the phone screen.

Warren Garten's deep chuckle still echoed in her ears. "Come to my place tonight, Bella. I have a surprise for you."

She bit her lip.

Adrian Valentine could never give her this kind of thrill.

......

On the day of the engagement.

Evelyn Roland sat in the playroom building blocks with her two children.

"Mommy, this is for you." Ethan handed her a red block.

She accepted it with a smile.

Her phone vibrated suddenly.

A message from Victoria Laurent popped up: [Adrian's engagement is canceled. Rumor says he's hospitalized with injuries.]

The block slipped from her fingers.

She shouldn't care.

Yet her heart clenched painfully.

Julian Roscente woke at dawn on the third day.

"Mr. Roscente!" Victor Ashcroft's voice trembled with relief.

He frowned. "Why are the lights off?"

The hospital room fell silent.

Sunlight streamed through the curtains.

Victor waved a shaking hand before Julian's eyes.

No reaction.

"It's broad daylight," Adrian rasped.

Julian's grip tightened on the sheets.

Darkness.

Endless, suffocating darkness.

"Where's Evelyn?" His voice strained.

"She's fine," Victor whispered.

Julian raised a hand to touch the bandages swathing his head.

His fingers brushed cold metal bed rails.

"My eyes—"

For the first time in his life, panic laced his words.
###Chapter 296

Julian Roscente's fingers trembled as they groped through empty air.

He refused to believe this eternal darkness before him.

"Victor, open the curtains!" His voice came out hoarse and broken.

Victor Ashcroft stood by the window where sunlight already flooded the hospital room. His Adam's apple bobbed. "Mr. Roscente, the curtains are already open."

Adrian Valentine leaned against the wall, coldly observing the scene. The cigarette between his fingers had burned down to the filter.

"Impossible!" Julian violently overturned the water glass on his bedside table. "How can I be blind?"

The shattering glass plunged the room into dead silence.

Victor took a subtle step back. He'd never seen the young master lose control like this.

The imposing figure of Mr. Roscente Sr. appeared in the doorway. The business tycoon seemed to have aged ten years overnight.

"Father?" Julian turned toward the sound.

Roscente Sr. strode to the bed and gripped his son's shaking shoulders. "Julian, face reality."

"Reality is that I'm blind now?" Julian let out a bitter laugh.

The medical team rushed in. The chief physician adjusted his glasses. "Mr. Roscente, we need to run more comprehensive tests."

After Julian was wheeled away, the atmosphere grew heavier.

Roscente Sr. turned to Adrian. "Who else was there besides Evelyn?"

Adrian narrowed his eyes. "What are you implying?"

"Someone sent me this." Roscente Sr. showed his phone screen.

[How Christian Lefèvre died is how your son got hurt.]

Adrian's pupils constricted sharply. The memory of Christian's gruesome death flashed through his mind.

"Evelyn saved Julian," Adrian said icily.

Roscente Sr. sneered. "There's no smoke without fire. From the fake antiques to the forged artifacts—she exposed them all. Too convenient, don't you think?"

Adrian silently crushed his cigarette butt. Evelyn was indeed shrouded in mystery.

"I won't let anyone who harmed my son get away with it." Ruthlessness flickered in Roscente Sr.'s eyes. "I hope you won't interfere."

Adrian turned toward the window. Sunlight illuminated the sharp angles of his profile.

Suddenly, he remembered Evelyn's resolute silhouette when she'd fired that shot.
###Chapter 297

Adrian Valentine's gaze was sharp as a blade, fixed unwaveringly on Julian Roscente. "Uncle Roscente, what exactly are you trying to do?"

"She went too far! I suspect Evelyn Roland is the mastermind behind this." Julian Roscente's voice dripped with venom. "My son is blind now. I will have my revenge."

Adrian's knuckles turned white as he lowered his eyes in silence.

For a moment, he couldn't distinguish reality from illusion.

Evelyn wasn't that kind of person. "Where's your proof?"

Julian's expression darkened. "From Christian Lefèvre to Vincent Ashcroft, and now our Roscente family—that woman is cunning. She appears ordinary, yet she's connected to powerful figures like Sebastian Cortez and Nathan Aldridge."

Adrian lifted his gaze, mockery flashing in his eyes. "And if it's not her?"

Julian scoffed. "Still hung up on Evelyn? Didn't you already choose Isabella Langley? Defending your ex-wife who betrayed you—is it worth it?"

Adrian's voice dropped low. "I saw with my own eyes that Evelyn saved Julian that night."

No matter how much he resented her, he couldn't bear to see her hurt.

Julian shook his head with a sigh. "Young man, sometimes seeing isn't believing. Maybe she staged that rescue act because she knew the truth was about to come out."

"So saving your son makes me the villain now?"

A cold female voice cut through the air from the doorway.

Julian spun around.

Evelyn stood at the entrance, her icy glare piercing through him. The sheer intensity of her presence made him falter.

Just moments ago, he'd been certain she was the culprit. Now, doubt crept in. Could someone so breathtakingly beautiful truly be so cruel?

Evelyn had come to the hospital to pick up medication and decided to check on Julian Roscente—only to overhear this conversation.

"All the evidence points to you," Julian narrowed his eyes.

"Your reasoning." Evelyn didn't even glance at Adrian.

To her, distrust from those who should know better was the sharpest blade of all.

"Why were you following Julian? Do you live in that area too?"

Evelyn stepped into the room, noticing Julian's absence.

"I followed him because I knew he was in danger. Believe what you want."

"After how he insulted you, you held no resentment?"

"A child's misbehavior reflects the parent's failure." Evelyn's lips curled into a cold smile. "I wouldn't waste my energy on meaningless words from a stranger. And I certainly wouldn't throw my life away over petty grudges."
###Chapter 298

Adrian's knuckles turned white as he clenched his fists. "Evelyn, explain yourself!"

Evelyn paused mid-step without turning. "The truth is right in front of you, yet you choose to ignore it."

"Evelyn!" Adrian's voice simmered with restrained fury. "This isn't the time for games."

She spun around, her gaze glacial. "Games? Doesn't Mr. Roscente have all the evidence he needs?"

Julian Roscente's expression flickered. "Ms. Roland, I only want to uncover the truth—"

"Uncover?" Evelyn cut him off with a bitter laugh. "You won't believe what's right before your eyes. What's left to uncover?"

As she pushed the door open, her pupils contracted.

Sebastian Orlando leaned against the wall, his white coat accentuating his refined features. "Long day in the pharmacy?"

"Sebastian?" Her frosty demeanor melted instantly. "What are you—"

"Just passing by to pick you up." He took the medicine case from her hands effortlessly. "Dinner with me tonight?"

The corners of her eyes crinkled. "Sure. I can give you the new prescription I prepared."

He ruffled her hair. "Wait for me in the car."

The moment the elevator doors closed, his smile vanished.

The atmosphere in the hospital room turned suffocating.

Adrian's stare burned into him. "Quite the performance, Dr. Orlando."

Sebastian adjusted his cuffs leisurely. "Still not as impressive as a CEO harassing another man's fiancée."

"You—"

"Mr. Roscente." Sebastian turned to Julian, a surgical blade glinting between his fingers. "If I hear you slander my fiancée again..." His voice dropped to a lethal whisper. "I won't hesitate to settle this professionally."

Adrian shot to his feet. "Fiancée?"

"Engagement next month." Sebastian's lips curled as he turned away. "Do come to the wedding."

The door slammed shut with a force that made Julian flinch.

He suddenly grabbed his coat. "I need to find Vincent Sr."

Adrian frowned. "What does Victor's father have to do with this?"

Julian's steps were frantic. "That car accident years ago... I have to verify it again."
###Chapter 299

Julian Roscente frowned deeply. "He sees things more clearly than I do. I want to know his true thoughts."

Adrian Valentine wore an equally grave expression as he pondered Vincent Ashcroft's whereabouts. "Uncle Julian, I'll go with you."

After giving Victor Ashcroft brief instructions, Julian left in a hurry with Adrian.

Victor stood rooted to the spot, utterly bewildered.

He couldn't make sense of the situation.

What was wrong with the chairman?

Was there some misunderstanding?

How could they suspect Evelyn Roland of being the murderer?

......

Inside a black sedan parked outside the hospital, Evelyn sat in the backseat.

Zachary Deross studied her flawless face through the rearview mirror.

"Boss, Eleanor Langley has been quiet, but Isabella is investigating her mother's recent strange behavior."

A faint smile curved Evelyn's lips. "Let her dig. The best outcome would be uncovering the truth and watching them tear each other apart."

With Vincent Langley already frantic over the stolen diamonds, some family drama would make things even more entertaining.

It might also help her solve the mystery of her own origins.

Excitement flashed in Zachary's eyes. "Brilliant, boss. The messier the Langley family gets, the better."

He loved a good spectacle.

"Oh, Nathan called. Mr. Lefèvre wants to see you."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Me?"

"He said he wants details about Horizon Tech's R&D project."

After a brief pause, she nodded. "Set it up. I'll bring the project proposal to ease his mind."

The elderly always had too many concerns.

"Boss, it's Sebastian." Zachary barely finished speaking before Sebastian Orlando opened the car door and slid in.

"My assistant took my car. Mind if I hitch a ride?" He buckled his seatbelt casually.

Zachary grinned. "Perfect timing. You two live across from each other."

At the hospital entrance, Adrian witnessed the scene.

The possessive look in Sebastian's eyes as he gazed at Evelyn sent shockwaves through him.

Julian's words echoed in his mind: What you see isn't always the truth.

Years ago, he'd seen Evelyn kill Christian Lefèvre with his own eyes—but could that have been an illusion too?

Guilt had stopped him from digging deeper, afraid of uncovering something even more horrifying.

"Adrian, are we still going?" Julian's question snapped him back to reality.

"Yes." His voice was low.

Thirty minutes later, they arrived at a secluded teahouse on the city outskirts.

Julian finally found Vincent Ashcroft Sr. sipping tea in quiet contemplation.
###Chapter 300

Vincent Ashcroft Sr. sat by the window in the teahouse, sunlight streaming through the glass and casting a warm glow on his navy-blue jacket. He sipped his tea slowly, fingers tapping the table in rhythm with the opera playing in the background.

Two shadows suddenly fell across his table.

Vincent looked up to see Adrian Valentine and Julian Roscente taking seats opposite him. He grabbed a handful of sunflower seeds and cracked one open leisurely. "What brings two busy men like you to such a humble place?"

Adrian frowned at his relaxed demeanor. "You seem to be enjoying life, old Vincent."

Vincent chuckled. "Poverty brings freedom. Heard your son got hurt?" His tone was casual, as if discussing the weather.

Since his company went under, he'd found unexpected peace. His son's future was secure, and he and his wife had settled into a simple life—no schemes, no danger. For the first time, he felt truly at ease.

Adrian lowered his voice. "I suspect Evelyn Roland is behind this. Her people were there the day your son was released. We should team up—"

"Stop right there!" Vincent cut him off with a sharp wave. "Adrian, if you want to court death, don’t drag me into it."

He glanced around warily before whispering, "Evelyn is my family’s savior. Without her, I’d be on the streets by now."

Julian suddenly spoke up. "Uncle Vincent, where’s Victor?"

Vincent’s expression hardened. "You know better than anyone how ruthless this world is. My son would only be trampled if he stayed here." He stood. "I sent him abroad."

Julian’s gaze turned sharp. "If this really is Evelyn’s doing—"

"Julian!" Vincent interrupted. "Your future father-in-law is the real culprit. Evelyn saved you twice, and this is how you repay her?"

He scoffed. "My son nearly lost everything because of you, and I never said a word. Yet here you are, turning your savior into an enemy."

"After all she’s done for you, you repay her with suspicion? I suggest you tread carefully. That woman has already set her sights on the Roscente family."

With that, Vincent turned to leave.

Julian’s fists clenched until his knuckles turned white. Had he misjudged Evelyn all along?

Adrian shot to his feet. "Vincent! Don’t you dare walk away!"
###Chapter 301

Vincent Ashcroft Sr. felt cold sweat trickling down his spine.

He had pulled every string to get his son into Falcon Training Camp. He wouldn't let Julian Roscente's mess ruin those efforts.

Their families were barely acquaintances. Sacrificing his son's future for outsiders wasn't an option.

His gaze turned icy as it landed on Julian. "What's there to discuss? You can't even distinguish allies from enemies."

Julian fell silent.

He knew Vincent well. If the man chose to trust Evelyn Roland, there had to be a reason.

Had he misjudged the situation?

"Evelyn risked her life saving your son, and this is how you repay her?" Vincent's laugh was bitter. "Mark my words—the Roscente business will collapse within a month."

He turned on his heel and left.

Everyone had their own fate. This wasn't his burden to bear.

Vincent Langley was unfathomable. Isabella Langley wore masks beneath masks. Those eyes of hers always unsettled him.

Whether Adrian Valentine knew the truth didn't matter. Vincent would keep his guard up.

Adrian watched Vincent's retreating figure, his gaze darkening. The man was clearly hiding something.

"Mr. Roscente, I'll take my leave."

He needed to investigate this personally. When he dialed Victor Ashcroft's number, his eyes had frosted over.

In the hospital room, Julian had just finished his examination.

He sat motionless by the bed, his bloodshot eyes terrifying, his pallid face etched with despair.

"Dr. Lee, my son's vision—" Julian's voice trembled.

The doctor adjusted his glasses. "The blindness resulted from cranial trauma. No signs of cerebral hemorrhage. We'll need another scan in three days to confirm the cause."

Julian's fingers clenched the sheets.

"However..." The doctor's tone shifted. "I recommend consulting Doctor Z. Traditional medicine could help without side effects."

"Doctor Z?" Julian gave a hollow laugh. "Vanished six years ago. No one even knows if it's a man or woman."

"A woman." Dr. Lee lowered his voice. "Graduated from a top overseas medical school at eighteen, dual-trained in Eastern and Western medicine. That's all I can say."

After the doctor left, Julian's heart ached as he watched his son.

He understood that pride better than anyone.

"Julian, I'll find Doctor Z."

Julian gave a stiff nod, his knuckles whitening from the force of his grip.
###Chapter 302

Julian Roscente's lips curled into a bitter smile. "Dr. Lee made it clear. Only Dr. Z can cure my blindness."

Arthur Roscente remained silent.

Julian continued, "Father, our assets in Vienna may seem substantial, but they're nothing compared to the top conglomerates. If even they can't secure Dr. Z's services, what hope do we have?"

His vision might never return.

Arthur's eyes reddened. "Julian, was Evelyn truly your savior?"

"If she hadn't appeared when she did, that axe would have killed me."

Arthur's expression darkened abruptly.

He'd been wrong.

Who sent that mysterious text?

Just a string of eerie numbers. Technologically masked, untraceable even by IP address.

"Rest now. I'll find a way to contact Dr. Z."

Julian sensed his father's unease. Before he could inquire, retreating footsteps answered instead.

His lips parted. No words came.

......

Langley Mansion.

Isabella Langley adjusted her headphones, listening to Warren Garten's latest recording.

A flicker of surprise crossed her face when it ended.

Arthur hadn't suspected Evelyn.

Interesting.

Far more competent than that fool Vincent Ashcroft.

Her fingers flew across the screen: [Release the Roscente family scandal. That illegitimate son should do nicely.]

Warren responded instantly: [Found him. Marcus Roscente. Longstanding feud with Julian. Though Arthur despises the boy—product of a calculated seduction during his marriage.]

Isabella's laugh dripped ice. "Love? What kind of devotion includes infidelity?"

Message sent, she tossed the phone into her bag.

From the second-floor window, the once-lush trees stood decimated.

Her entanglement with Adrian Valentine had reached its conclusion.

Though the engagement fell through, public opinion favored her.

Arms crossed, she arched a flawless brow. "Adrian Valentine, do you love me?"

The answer mattered little. Her own feelings were undeniable.

......

Dusk found Evelyn Roland dragging exhausted limbs home.

After assisting Sebastian Orlando with medicinal formulations at the lab, she'd sent Victoria Laurent to deliver them before returning.

Gabrielle Flores practically vibrated with excitement at the door. "Sis! Breaking news! Arthur Roscente's love child just trended!"

Evelyn frowned.

Arthur was renowned for doting on his wife. An illegitimate son?

The puppeteer had made their move.

Gabrielle leaned in conspiratorially. "Rumor says Julian's blindness prompted Arthur to recall the bastard as heir. Think it's true?"

###Chapter 303

Evelyn gave Gabrielle a wry smile. "Gabby, do you really think I'd bother verifying gossip?"

Gabrielle froze.

Right. Her sister never concerned herself with trivial matters.

Unless it involved someone she cared about.

Evelyn dismissed the issue entirely.

The Valentine family drama meant nothing to her. More pressing matters demanded her attention.

Vincent Langley's web needed closing.

Her phone vibrated. Zachary was calling.

"Boss, we've scheduled Mr. Harrison for eight tonight."

Evelyn scoffed. "Eight? That's practically my bedtime."

Zachary fell silent.

Their boss kept hours like a retired bureaucrat. While the rest of them burned midnight oil, she maintained an unshakable early schedule.

"So..."

"Thirty minutes. Make it quick."

Zachary exhaled in relief.

Securing Harrison's cooperation had been difficult. If Evelyn canceled, they'd have no way to explain.

After instructing Gabrielle to watch the children, Evelyn retrieved a prized tin of Da Hong Pao tea from her collection.

One hour later, a luxury car pulled up to an exclusive club.

Zachary waited in the vehicle while Nathan had arrived earlier.

This was Adrian Valentine's territory.

Evelyn wasn't worried about encountering him—she simply found the association distasteful.

"Sis." Nathan hurried out to meet her.

Evelyn nodded. "Where's Harrison?"

Nathan hesitated. "He hasn't arrived yet—"

A water bottle came flying through the air.

Nathan shielded Evelyn as it grazed his shoulder.

Evelyn looked up into Margaret Valentine's venomous glare.

"Evelyn! You cursed wretch!" Margaret shrieked. "You ruined Adrian and Isabella's engagement!"

"Fatherless gutter trash! Why didn't you die abroad? The Valentines knew no peace since your return!"

Every word dripped poison.

For the first time, Evelyn truly felt the depth of the woman's hatred.
###Chapter 304

The moment had arrived.

Evelyn's fingertip tapped the screen, sending the video.

When she looked up, Nathan was already striding toward Margaret.

Margaret stumbled back half a step from the icy aura around him, forcing composure. "Mr. Aldridge, is offending the Valentines worth it for an assistant?"

"Even Sterling Manor needs connections."

Nathan's eyes flashed cold.

"My people aren't yours to discipline. The Valentines' connections mean nothing to me."

"You said Evelyn lacks upbringing? With your breeding, how did you raise such foul-mouthed offspring?"

"Adrian's incompetence has nothing to do with Evelyn."

"Aren't you ashamed to still breathe at your age? If you want someone dead, lead by example."

"The Valentines can't compare to Sterling Manor's pinky. What makes Adrian so desirable that Evelyn would covet him?"

Evelyn blinked.

Margaret paled.

No one had dared speak to her like this in decades as a Valentine.

Nathan was being polite.

Had Sophia been present, she'd have thrown hands.

Margaret's voice trembled. "Is this your upbringing, Mr. Aldridge?"

"Is this your elder's dignity, Mrs. Valentine?" Nathan shot back.

Margaret sneered. "What's wrong with scolding her? A country bumpkin dares disrespect me?"

Her gaze burned with jealousy at Evelyn's exquisite face.

Nathan scoffed.

Their boss—a country bumpkin?

The truth would give this hag a heart attack.

Evelyn smoothed her hair. "Weren't you also from humble origins, Mrs. Valentine?"

"Gold and jewels can't mask vulgar roots."

Margaret's chest heaved.

This girl had changed.

Once submissive, now every word drew blood.

"Evelyn Roland! How dare you—"

Evelyn tilted her head. "Do you deserve my respect?"
###Chapter 305

Margaret Valentine's pupils constricted sharply as she stared at the transformed Evelyn Roland before her.

The timid girl she once knew was gone.

Now Evelyn stood with crimson lips curved in a smirk, her gaze razor-sharp.

The tailored black blazer accentuated her slender frame. The Patek Philippe on her wrist glinted coldly under the chandeliers.

"Having Nathan Aldridge as your backer certainly changes things," Margaret spat through clenched teeth.

Evelyn idly adjusted her cuff. "You flatter me, Mrs. Valentine. I simply realized—"

"Reasoning with rabid dogs is pointless. Sometimes you just have to hit back."

Margaret's meticulously maintained face twisted in rage.

She jabbed a finger at Evelyn's nose. "If you hadn't seduced Adrian, he and Isabella would've—"

"Proof?" Evelyn stepped forward abruptly, her stilettos clicking sharply. "Or is slander part of the Valentine family values?"

The crystal chandeliers reflected in Evelyn's eyes like shattered ice.

Margaret stumbled half a step back from the sheer intensity.

"Take your hysterics back to the Valentine estate." Evelyn turned, her blazer slicing through the air. "But if you dare come after me again—"

"I won't hesitate to replace you as the Valentine matriarch."

Margaret trembled with fury.

Spotting a reporter in the corner, she lowered her voice to a venomous whisper. "I hear Sterling Manor is negotiating herbal contracts. One word from me, and you won't get a single gram of supplies."

Nathan started to speak, but Evelyn rested a hand on his arm with a laugh.

"By all means, try." She tucked a stray lock behind her ear. "Let's see who ends up begging to work with whom."

Margaret stormed off in her towering heels.

Then she froze at the corridor's turn.

"Old Man Li?" Her snake-like smile returned as she watched Evelyn's retreating figure.

Her phone flashed open to "Madam Li's" contact.

"Wanyi, darling," she cooed sickeningly sweet. "I'll have the West District villa keys delivered tomorrow..."

As the call ended, Margaret's nails dug deep into her palms.

If she could eliminate Evelyn's mother years ago...

What was one more little bitch to dispose of?
###Chapter 306

They appeared to be close confidantes, but each harbored their own hidden agendas.

Mutual benefit without emotional entanglement—that was the safest kind of relationship.

Fine lines crinkled at the corners of Mrs. Langley's eyes as she smiled. "Melanie, leave this trivial matter to me. The old man dotes on his daughter-in-law. The transfer will be processed tomorrow."

Mrs. Valentine's red lips curved slightly. "Then I'll treat you to brunch at the Peninsula tomorrow morning."

"Deal." Mrs. Langley agreed readily.

The moment the call ended, a flash of ruthlessness crossed Mrs. Valentine's eyes.

Evelyn Roland, how dare you cross me? This is your fate.

The business world was a battlefield. Talent alone wasn't enough—connections were everything.

Did she really think securing Sterling Manor's backing would guarantee her safety?

With effortless grace, she picked up her Hermès bag and strode away in her stilettos.

Around the corner, Adrian Valentine emerged from the shadows. His dark eyes followed his mother's retreating figure, his expression stormy. He'd overheard the entire conversation, though the specifics remained unclear.

This household thrived on schemes.

Ever since Evelyn married into the family, his mother had targeted her relentlessly. The source of that inexplicable hatred eluded even him.

Of the three siblings, Gregory Valentine was their mother's clear favorite. Cassandra Valentine was ignored, and he—Adrian—was met with nothing but indifference.

Straightening his suit, he walked briskly into the club.

...

Mrs. Langley hadn't been to the office in three days.

Discovering that the daughter she'd raised for twenty years wasn't her biological child—and that her own husband was likely behind the switch—had left her emotionally shattered.

Once doubt took root, it spread like wildfire.

Propped weakly against the headboard, her illness only accentuated her delicate beauty, adding a touch of vulnerability.

Her phone vibrated.

She glanced lazily at the screen—a video message. The moment she opened it, her pupils contracted sharply.

The footage showed Vincent Langley in an intimate embrace with Margaret Valentine.

"Vincent... Langley!" She spat out each syllable, her nails digging into her palms.

She'd always known her husband was a womanizer, but this—with her own daughter's mother-in-law—was beyond contempt.

A violent coughing fit seized her. She clutched her chest, but the searing pain refused to subside.

She'd severed ties with her own family to marry Vincent Langley all those years ago. It hadn't been love so much as admiration for his boldness.

His handsome face had captivated her briefly, but the novelty wore off within years. For him, she'd even risked criminal dealings.

Whatever affection remained between them had long since eroded—which was why she'd taken up with her assistant.

But this betrayal crossed every line.

The sender's ulterior motives were obvious, but betrayal was betrayal. Worse still was the realization that the daughter she'd raised wasn't hers.

When her breathing steadied, she dialed her assistant.

"Madam, still not coming in today?"

"Jonathan," she rasped, "have someone track Vincent's movements. I want to know where he is right now."
###Chapter 307

Nathan frowned at the weak voice on the phone. "Eleanor, why do you sound so hoarse? Is your cold still not better?"

Eleanor Langley leaned against the leather sofa, her face as pale as paper, fingers digging into the armrest.

Her eyes were red-rimmed, but she stubbornly refused to let the tears fall.

The concerned call warmed her heart slightly.

Since childhood, her life had been like a meticulously designed cage.

She had barely escaped the shackles of her family, only to sink into an even deeper quagmire.

Her husband's betrayal, the truth about her adopted daughter—each revelation stabbed like a dagger to the heart.

Eleanor Langley had never been a weak woman.

Love had never been the entirety of her life.

She knew better than anyone that only power in her grasp could be relied upon.

All these years, she had poured her energy into the company, preparing for this very moment.

"I'm fine," she said, her voice icy. "Handle what I asked you to do. Report back immediately."

She ended the call and encrypted the surveillance footage.

She wouldn't weep like a scorned woman.

An eye for an eye—that was her way.

The plain face of Melanie Evans flashed in her mind.

A widow for twenty years, yet she dared to seduce her husband?

Such foolishness always came with a price.

......

Inside the upscale club, Nathan Aldridge sat across from Evelyn Roland.

Suddenly, Harrison Macmillan's call came through.

"Nathan, the deal is off," Harrison said coldly. "The penalty will be paid in full. The tea you sent will be returned tomorrow."

Nathan's gaze turned sharp. "Harrison, may I ask why?"

"It's my freedom to choose who I work with," Harrison replied firmly. "This ends here."

Nathan smirked. "Thank you for the lesson. I wish you good health."

The call disconnected.

Evelyn had already guessed the outcome.

Nathan's expression darkened. "It's Margaret Valentine's doing. Harrison's daughter-in-law is the head of surgery—close friends with Margaret."

Some deals seemed within reach, but hidden dangers lurked beneath.

The Nine-City Alliance was a tangled web of power, full of unpredictable variables.

Evelyn's eyes dimmed.

Margaret Valentine's methods were indeed formidable.
###Chapter 308

Evelyn tapped her fingers lightly on the desk. "We chose the Lee family solely for their superior medicinal herb quality, but they're not irreplaceable."

"A general's sword shouldn't be wasted on swatting flies." She took a sip of tea. "Once we announce the partnership termination tomorrow, better options will come knocking."

Her voice turned icy. "The Lees are clinging to outdated methods with zero innovation and poor execution. The patriarch is stubborn yet bends to his daughter-in-law's whims. Such a company won't survive three years."

The golden age of the herb trade had long passed.

The Lee family's profits had plummeted last year.

In today's volatile market, one misstep meant total ruin.

Sterling Manor had deep roots—this partnership meant nothing.

The Nine-City Alliance boasted countless superior herb suppliers, all actively modernizing.

Market analysis predicted an industry freeze within six months.

"Boss, I'll scout new partners tomorrow." Nathan flipped open his schedule. "I'll vet candidates for your review."

Evelyn gave a slight nod. "No rush. The NovaCore division is progressing well—we can use this breather." She grabbed her bag. "Call if urgent."

Nathan hurried after her. "Let me drive you home."

Evelyn chuckled. "Zachary's waiting downstairs." She arched a brow. "Having you chauffeur me daily makes me look incompetent."

Nathan suddenly lowered his voice. "After your injury, Gabrielle chewed Zachary out so badly he couldn't show his face for days."

"Really?" Evelyn paused mid-step.

Nathan instantly clapped a hand over his mouth.

"On second thought, I'll drive you," he backpedaled.

Evelyn spun around abruptly.

"Nathan, know what's most fascinating about business?" Her lips curved slightly.

Nathan straightened. "Enlighten me, Boss."

"Market volatility," she purred.

Nathan's pupils contracted.

Two years under Evelyn's wing made him grasp her meaning instantly.

The Lee family's breach was Margaret's doing.

Let the market teach them a brutal lesson.

Some people should never be crossed—especially this queen of vengeance.

Industry upheavals always hid opportunities within crises.

"Oh," Evelyn added casually, "how's the Lee family's biggest competitor's herb quality?"

This marked her first-ever contract breach.

If Margaret dared meddle, she'd lose more than just a fingernail.

"Got it!" Nathan's eyes gleamed. "I'll investigate tomorrow."

Evelyn waved him off toward the elevator.

A private room door suddenly swung open at the corner.

A large hand yanked her violently inside.
###Chapter 309

Evelyn's foot slipped, sending her tumbling backward.

"Ah—!" The startled cry escaped her lips.

A strong hand caught her wrist, yanking her upright.

When she saw the man's face, fury ignited in Evelyn's eyes.

"Getting jumpy, Evelyn? I haven't even touched you yet." Adrian's deep voice held a mocking edge.

He studied her panicked expression with amusement.

The usually composed woman now resembled a bristling kitten.

The corner of Adrian's mouth lifted, danger glinting in his narrowed phoenix eyes.

"Let go!" Evelyn wrenched her arm free, the corners of her eyes reddening.

Adrian remained unmoved, his gaze darkening like ink.

"I can help with the Langley matter. But tell me—did you have anything to do with Vincent and Julian's situation?"

Evelyn's pupils contracted.

He suspected her?

An invisible hand seemed to squeeze her heart, tightening her throat.

"Mind your boundaries, Mr. Valentine. We've been divorced for two years." Her laugh was icy. "You and Isabella know the Ashcroft and Roscente affairs best."

"Don't pretend innocence now, you cheating pair."

Adrian's expression turned glacial. "Explain."

"That phone number contacted Isabella—and you." Evelyn met his gaze head-on. "You framed me."

She broke free of his grip.

"Try scheming against me again, and I'll personally send you both to hell."

Surprise flickered in Adrian's eyes.

"How did you trace it?" He stepped closer. "Evelyn, who are you really?"

Her lips curled in derision. "Does it matter?"

Adrian's breath hitched.

Of course it mattered.

She had been his wife, yet he didn't even know her true identity.

"You lied to me." His voice roughened.

"I wanted to tell you." Evelyn lowered her lashes. "But you asked for a divorce the moment you returned."

"Everyone has secrets. Mine would never harm you."

Adrian pressed stubbornly, "What's your real name?"

"The Langleys abandoned me. Grandfather Roland took me in." Her voice softened. "I'm Evelyn Roland. My friends call me Chu Chu."

"Chu Chu." He repeated the name quietly.

Evelyn's heart trembled.

The way he said it—so tender it made her dizzy.
###Chapter 310

"Evelyn..."

"Enough! We're divorced. Let the past stay in the past."

Evelyn turned and walked away, her stilettos clicking a resolute rhythm down the silent hallway.

Adrian watched her retreating figure, his knuckles whitening from the force of his grip.

His phone vibrated abruptly.

"Uncle Vincent."

"Adrian, someone intercepted my diamond shipment. It must be Phoenix Group! Find out who their CEO is!"

Adrian narrowed his eyes.

Phoenix Group had gone public within a month, its background shrouded in mystery.

"Investigating without evidence—are you prepared for the consequences?"

He would never help Vincent Langley.

The man who killed his father would pay in blood.

"I suspect Evelyn did this! She leaked those manuscripts deliberately to provoke me!"

A cold glint flashed in Adrian's eyes. "Proof?"

"Adrian, Evelyn's existence is the only obstacle between you and Isabella. You hate her. Why not arrange an... accident?"

Adrian's knuckles turned bone-white. "Murder in Vienna? Do you take me for a fool?"

"So you don't love Isabella?" Vincent's voice darkened.

The fox had finally shown its tail.

"Love isn't proven through murder," Adrian sneered. "If that's the proof Isabella demands, then this love isn't worth having."

Using him as a weapon?

Dream on.

Ending the call, Adrian's eyes churned with hidden storms.

Two years of preparation—it was time to close the net.

A news alert flashed on his phone: Roscente Family's Illegitimate Son Makes Grand Return.

He grabbed his coat and headed for the hospital.

Simultaneously, he texted Victor:
[Execute Plan B. Secure the evidence at all costs.]

Grandmother wanted Vincent Langley brought to justice, not mere revenge.

Victor replied instantly:
[Understood!]

Meanwhile...

Evelyn didn't take a car.

Running into Adrian tonight had unsettled her.

She preferred wandering through alleyways, where the hum of ordinary life soothed her restless heart.

"Hey beautiful, all alone?"

A leering voice slithered from the shadows.
###Chapter 311

"Get lost!"

Evelyn Roland paused mid-step. That voice sounded familiar.

It was Cassandra Valentine.

She had no intention of interfering, but the thought of Cassandra's usual sharp demeanor gave her pause.

Shadows flickered in the dimly lit alley.

A black cat darted out from behind a trash bin.

Neon lights cast fragmented reflections on the damp pavement.

The distant clamor of the bar district hummed in the background.

"I'll call the police if you don't back off!"

Cassandra's voice trembled—uncharacteristically unsteady.

Evelyn narrowed her eyes. That didn't sound right. Almost like she'd been drugged.

Five intoxicated men had Cassandra cornered.

Evelyn remembered how this sister-in-law had made her life difficult after she married into the Valentine family. But compared to Sophia Valentine's venomous schemes, Cassandra's antics were child's play.

"Lonely? Let me take you somewhere fun," slurred the blond ringleader, reeking of alcohol as he leaned in.

Cassandra forced herself to retreat two steps. "Stay away—you stink!"

The blond's face darkened.

"Such sharp words from the great Miss Valentine?"

Beads of sweat formed on Cassandra's forehead. A realization struck her—this wasn't random.

"Who sent you?"

The blond shook a water bottle in her face. The acrid scent made her pupils constrict instantly.

Acid!

"Not just having our way with you—we're ruining that pretty face too." He unscrewed the cap with a vicious grin.

Cassandra bit her tongue hard, using the pain to stay alert. For the first time, fear gripped her.

"Take her!"

Two burly men seized her arms.

Just as despair set in, a scream pierced the night.

A slender but iron-strong hand yanked her out of danger.
###Chapter 312

"Hiss..."

Concentrated sulfuric acid splashed onto the exposed skin of several men, instantly releasing acrid white smoke.

"Ah! My face!"

Piercing screams echoed through the narrow alley.

Evelyn wrinkled her nose in disgust, covering it with her hand.

Cassandra's blurred vision finally focused on the newcomer, her pupils contracting sharply.

"You?"

Evelyn smirked. "Disappointed?"

Though feverish and disoriented, Cassandra felt an inexplicable wave of relief.

She gave a bitter smile. "Never thought you'd be my savior."

Seizing the moment, Evelyn slipped a pill into Cassandra's mouth.

"What did you just give me?" Cassandra's eyes widened in alarm.

"Arsenic," Evelyn deadpanned.

A bitter taste spread across Cassandra's tongue.

"Evelyn!" she growled through clenched teeth.

But Evelyn had already turned away, coldly observing the writhing men on the ground. "The police are coming."

Cassandra froze, an unexpected pang of guilt surfacing.

Years of betrayal had taught her to distrust everyone.

Even Margaret Valentine, who once showered her with affection.

Those exquisite gifts? Nothing but carefully laid traps.

Before turning eighteen, she'd lived in the shadow of Cassandra Valentine.

Only when Margaret targeted her mother did she understand true malice.

"If not for Beatrice..." Cassandra clenched her fists.

Sirens wailed in the distance.

Evelyn handed the phone recording to the arriving officers. After giving her statement, she prepared to leave.

The feverish heat had subsided from Cassandra's body.

"I'm sorry," she murmured.

Evelyn waved it off. "No trouble at all."

They weren't friends. Tonight was mere coincidence.

Call it consideration for the children—after all, Cassandra was their aunt.

That justification satisfied Evelyn's conscience.

Watching Evelyn's retreating figure, Cassandra's emotions churned.

In her eyes, Evelyn remained the only worthy match for Adrian Valentine.

If only...

"That bitch Isabella!" Cassandra's fists tightened.

Meanwhile, Evelyn scrolled through hacked data from the attackers' phones.

"Evelyn! Wait up!"

Cassandra's sudden shout made Evelyn pause mid-step.
###Chapter 313

Evelyn turned, her calm gaze settling on Cassandra Valentine.

"Something else?" Her tone was cool.

Cassandra stepped forward with a bright smile. "Can I buy you a drink?"

"I don't drink." Evelyn refused bluntly.

Cassandra blinked. "Then let's get some grilled food. Consider it thanks for saving me tonight."

Evelyn hesitated before nodding.

It had been a while since she'd had grilled food.

The frustration of tonight called for something warm and lively.

"Perfect!" Cassandra's eyes lit up. "I know an authentic place nearby."

They walked through dim alleys into a bustling side street.

The aroma of grilled meat filled the air.

Cassandra swallowed—she hadn't eaten dinner yet.

"This is the spot." She pointed to a cramped corner stall.

The humble eatery was packed with customers.

The owner recognized Cassandra and brought them chilled tea and marinated pork brains with enthusiasm.

Evelyn eyed the plate of pork brains, brow slightly raised.

"Try it. Their marinade is special." Cassandra poured Evelyn a cup of hot tea.

Evelyn took a sip—the familiar floral taste of camellia tea.

"Evelyn, are you really not angry?" Cassandra suddenly asked.

Evelyn looked up. "If anger solved anything, there wouldn't be so much suffering in the world."

She knew Cassandra was referring to Adrian.

Love couldn't be forced. She had no time to wallow in heartbreak.

"Adrian must be blind!" Cassandra gritted her teeth. "How dare he marry a viper like Isabella. Tonight's incident—it was either her or Margaret behind it."

Evelyn caught the hatred in her eyes.

"Do you have proof?" Evelyn probed.

Cassandra shook her head. "If I did, I'd have confronted them already. Don't you think Margaret's affection for Isabella is unnatural? She never cared that much for her own daughter."

Evelyn grew thoughtful.

Isabella's origins remained a mystery.

If her suspicions were correct...

Evelyn didn't dare finish the thought.
###Chapter 314

"Evelyn, do you know how Mrs. Valentine and Mrs. Langley first met?"

Evelyn recalled the elderly Mrs. Valentine mentioning their long-standing friendship during her last visit to the Valentine estate.

Cassandra Valentine's lips curled into a sardonic smile. "They've known each other for decades. That's why Mrs. Valentine favors Isabella so much. Their families are well-matched socially and benefit each other commercially."

She paused, giving Evelyn a frustrated look. "Like this diamond deal—Vincent Langley's goods are exclusively sold through Adrian Valentine's department stores."

Cassandra exhaled sharply. "You could've kept those mining rights for yourself. Why hand them to Vincent Langley?"

Evelyn's expression remained neutral. "Consider it repayment for raising me."

Cassandra fell silent.

The price was staggeringly high.

A server arrived with roasted brain in spicy oil. Evelyn eyed the white curds floating in crimson sauce, her brow furrowing slightly.

Cassandra eagerly scooped a spoonful. "Try it! This is Vienna's signature dish."

Evelyn took a tentative bite—then her eyes lit up.

"Good, right?" Cassandra grinned like a child. "I come here monthly for my fix."

Two platters of skewered meats soon covered the table. Evelyn blinked at the mountainous portion.

"Trust me, you won't stop eating." Cassandra handed her a lamb skewer.

Juicy meat sizzled with fragrant spices. Evelyn's first bite revealed tender, perfectly charred perfection.

They lingered until past ten. Evelyn walked slower, pleasantly stuffed.

"Burp—" Cassandra sighed contentedly.

Evelyn bought two yogurt drinks from a vending machine.

"Shouldn't we get coffee?" Cassandra raised an eyebrow.

"Healthier." Evelyn twisted open a bottle for her.

Suddenly, Cassandra burst into laughter—then tears streamed down her face.

Evelyn stopped walking.

"You understand me, don't you?" Cassandra wiped her cheeks, voice cracking.

Evelyn studied her quietly.

All these years, Cassandra had shouldered the Valentine family burdens alone. Her abrasive demeanor was merely armor.

"I understand," Evelyn said softly.

Cassandra stiffened. "Do you really?"
###Chapter 315

Evelyn walked slowly through the night. Her slender silhouette stood out under the moonlight, every movement exuding grace.

Cassandra followed behind, suddenly realizing Evelyn seemed like a completely different person. The aura surrounding her was unlike anything before.

"Evelyn..."

"Everyone has burdens they must bear." Evelyn's voice was soft. "Haven't you endured all these years? The sun still rises after tears fall."

She stopped and turned to face Cassandra. Moonlight cast a silver glow upon her.

"Change is life's greatest challenge. All we can do is hold fast to what we believe is right."

Cassandra froze. Evelyn's words were like a key unlocking her heart.

"The path of growth is lonely," Cassandra murmured. "Working alone by day, studying alone at night."

"While friends partied, I reviewed contracts. While others shopped, I negotiated deals."

Evelyn listened quietly, her gaze gentle.

"But look at you now," Evelyn's lips curved slightly. "How radiant you've become."

Cassandra stared at her, seeing Evelyn's beauty for the first time.

"Evelyn... can we be friends?"

Evelyn nodded. "Evelyn Roland. Evelyn with an E."

Their hands clasped under the moonlight.

"Cassandra Valentine. Pleasure to meet you."

The living room lights were still on when they returned home.

Sophia dozed on the couch, her face covered in black scribbles. Felicia waved a marker excitedly.

Ethan huddled in a corner, watching his sister with terrified eyes.

This was the scene that greeted Evelyn when she opened the door.

Felicia immediately dropped the marker and crawled toward her mother for a hug. Ethan seized the chance to dive into Evelyn's arms, escaping his sister's "clutches."

Evelyn laughed as she lifted both children.

Ethan stuck his tongue out triumphantly at his sister, while Felicia waved her little fists in frustration.

Moonlight streamed through the window, bathing this tender moment in silver.
###Chapter 316

Felicia's tiny hand smacked her brother's forehead with a loud "thwack."

Evelyn Roland: "..."

Her daughter glared like an angry tiger cub robbed of its meal.

Tristan buried his face in his mother's shoulder, sulking. His little sister always bullied him.

Evelyn observed Felicia's domineering personality—a mirror image of her own childhood self. Tristan, however, took after Adrian Valentine. Though she'd never seen Adrian as a child, Beatrice Valentine had mentioned he'd been a quiet boy who kept to himself.

She placed both children on the bed and fixed Felicia with a stern look. "No hitting your brother."

Felicia pouted and rolled over, presenting her back to her mother.

Evelyn suppressed a laugh. These two little troublemakers.

In the adjacent bed, Gabrielle stirred awake, rubbing her eyes. "Evelyn, it's past midnight. Late nights cause wrinkles." She yawned and shuffled out. "I'm getting my beauty sleep."

Evelyn noticed the turtle drawing Felicia had doodled on Gabrielle's cheek but held her tongue.

Thump. Thump. Thump. Gabrielle's slippers slapped against the stairs.

Evelyn counted down silently: Three. Two. One—

"Felicia Roland! I'll skin you alive!"

Felicia flinched and burrowed under the covers.

Evelyn pinched her daughter's cheek, barely containing her amusement. "Scared now, aren't you?"

She tucked both children in. "Stay put. Mommy will be right back."

The shower hissed in the bathroom.

Tristan lay perfectly still.

Felicia eyed her brother's fluffy hair and suddenly lunged for it.

Tristan's eyes flew open. He seized her wrist in a death grip.

"Waaah—" Felicia wailed as red marks bloomed on her skin.

Panicked, Tristan scrambled up and patted her back clumsily, imitating Evelyn.

Felicia seized the opportunity to tackle him, punching him square in the face.

Tristan froze in shock.

When Evelyn rushed out with shampoo still in her hair, she found Felicia triumphantly straddling her brother while Tristan peeked out from the blankets with wounded puppy eyes.

She gritted her teeth, thinking of Adrian. That infuriatingly quiet personality is exactly the same!

By the time she finally got both children to sleep, dawn was breaking.

The next morning, Zachary Deross burst in. "Boss! Vincent Langley's in trouble!"
###Chapter 317

Evelyn took the phone from Victoria. The trending hashtags on the screen made her pupils constrict.

#LangleyGroupTaxEvasion
#LangleyGroupIllegalMining

The comment section exploded.

~Isn't this Isabella's family company?
~Spot on. Your beloved idol Isabella.
~Unfollowed. This scandal is too juicy.
~Vincent even stole his adopted daughter's manuscripts. Mining without permits? Disgusting.

Evelyn tapped her fingers on the table. She hadn't made this move yet. Who was pulling the strings behind the scenes?

She immediately dialed Zachary.

"Boss." His voice was steady.

"Find out who leaked the Langley scandal." Her tone was icy.

"Already on it. No leads yet." He paused. "By the way, Nathan enrolled you in the fashion design competition. The PT Company design director position—"

Evelyn cut him off. "You want me to design personally? Should all the world's designers just quit?"

Silence filled the line for two seconds.

Click. She hung up. Her gaze shifted to the twins across the dining table.

Gabrielle immediately shielded the toddlers. "Evelyn, they just learned to crawl. You're already planning their succession?"

Evelyn speared a piece of steak. "With their IQ, when can I retire?"

"Dream on." Gabrielle wiped cereal off her niece's face. "Your face screams 'workaholic.'"

Evelyn turned to Victoria.

Victoria buried herself in cutting steak, pretending not to notice.

Evelyn sighed. Her peripheral vision caught her son quietly eating while her daughter smeared oatmeal everywhere.

"Gabrielle, isn't it time to wean them?"

Gabrielle pulled a parenting manual from under the high chair. "Experts recommend breastfeeding twins until age three."

Evelyn's fork clattered onto the plate.

"Which expert?"

"Black and white right here." Gabrielle pointed. "Boosts immunity. Enhances brain development."

Evelyn arched a brow. "I never had breastmilk. Turned out fine."

"You didn't have a choice." Gabrielle wiped her nephew's mouth. "Now we compensate."

Evelyn: "......"

The dining room door burst open.

"Felicia!" Scarlett rushed in breathlessly.

Three adults simultaneously turned to the children eating breakfast.
###Chapter 318

Victoria's voice trembled. "Is it too late to run now?"

Evelyn's eyes flickered. "No need to hide. Scarlett would find out eventually. With our resources, Adrian can't take the children no matter how cunning he is."

Victoria and Gabrielle still looked uneasy. Adrian Valentine was no ordinary man.

To elevate the Valentine Group to Vienna's elite in just three years?

This was a man both ruthless and brilliant. That's why they'd been living discreetly all this time.

Evelyn never purchased baby supplies under her own name—Gabrielle handled everything.

Even if Adrian investigated, the trail would only lead to Gabrielle.

During her pregnancy, Evelyn hadn't actively suppressed the Valentine Group's growth.

Not even Sterling Manor, the wealthiest family in the Nine-City Alliance, could afford to underestimate them.

"Oh my god! Whose adorable babies are these?"

Scarlett had just entered the restaurant when two porcelain-doll-like toddlers caught her eye. They were unbearably cute!

Her burning gaze darted between Victoria and Gabrielle. "Which one of you got married in secret? How could you keep this from me?"

Victoria and Gabrielle bolted from their seats.

The answer was obvious.

Scarlett: "..."

She turned to Evelyn in shock.

Could it be...?

Today, Evelyn wore casual tweed with wide-leg pants accentuating her long legs. Guilt flickered across her stunning face.

"Ev... Are these your children?"

Evelyn nodded calmly. "Tristan, Felicia, say hello to Mommy."

"Evelyn!" Scarlett shrieked.

Evelyn flinched. She'd expected anger, but not this intensity.

"Waaah—" Felicia burst into terrified tears.

Tristan shot Scarlett a disdainful look and covered his ears with tiny hands.

The crying snapped Scarlett back to reality.

She immediately scooped up Felicia, whose face was smeared with rice cereal, not caring that it stained her clothes.

"Don't cry, sweetheart. Mommy didn't mean to scare you." She patted the baby's back. "I'll buy you treats later."

Evelyn: "..."

Gabrielle had strictly forbidden junk food for Felicia's sensitive stomach.

At the word "treats," Felicia instantly stopped crying. Her big, watery eyes blinked before she planted a messy kiss on Scarlett's cheek—rice cereal and drool included.

Scarlett didn't mind. Settling Felicia on her lap, she reached to ruffle Tristan's hair.

The boy dodged but couldn't escape her clutches.

He wrinkled his nose in clear disgust.

Scarlett's heart shattered. "Ev, your son hates me?"

Evelyn massaged her temples. That expression was Adrian Valentine in miniature.

"Start talking. When did you give birth?" Scarlett's frown deepened as realization struck.

She'd been immersed in filming lately, only seeing Evelyn through video calls. Had twins been born right under her nose?

Evelyn read her thoughts. "I was already pregnant last time we met. I wanted to tell you, but your schedule was packed."

Scarlett's eyes reddened. "So it's my fault for being too busy?"
###Chapter 319

"You kept this from me on purpose!"

Scarlett's delicate face flushed crimson with anger, her almond-shaped eyes blazing with fury.

Evelyn offered an apologetic smile. "I'm sorry."

"Whose children are they?" Scarlett gritted her teeth. "What have you been through these years? If you don't tell me the truth, I'll never forgive you."

Evelyn briefly recounted her past with Adrian.

Tears welled up in Scarlett's eyes.

She suddenly pulled Evelyn into a fierce embrace, pounding her back with a fist. "Who dared to hurt you like this? Why didn't you tell me sooner?"

She wished she could kill Adrian right then.

"It was a mistake from the beginning." Evelyn smiled bitterly. "It ended two years ago. He doesn't know about the children. Promise me, Scarlett—don't tell anyone. They're heirs. Their training begins at three."

Scarlett understood.

She studied the woman before her, adored by so many, yet broken by that bastard.

"Love isn't about right or wrong. Only love or no love," Evelyn murmured. "I've experienced everything in this life—even love. It's complete now."

"Complete? So you'll become a nun?"

Scarlett wept uncontrollably.

Evelyn waited quietly for her to calm down.

It took a long time before Scarlett's tears subsided. She ached for Evelyn.

Her friend was extraordinary. Men were just accessories.

"I failed you as your best friend. I never noticed your pain."

Regret consumed her.

Evelyn had always been exceptional, the center of attention.

Scarlett assumed someone so strong could never be hurt.

Yet Evelyn had been shattered the most.

"I'm fine now," Evelyn said with a soft smile.

Scarlett studied her.

True, she remained stunning, her smile radiant.

"What use are men?" Scarlett wiped her tears. "For women like us, they're just emotional comforts."

Evelyn nodded in agreement.

"You..." Scarlett still felt a pang of heartache.

Her gaze shifted to the two adorable children. "For their sake, I forgive you."

"Thank you. But please keep this secret."

Scarlett pouted.

She was terrible at keeping secrets.

But this time, she would try.

The past year had matured her.

The thought of Isabella, that homewrecker, reignited her fury.

"By the way, there's an auction tonight. Come with me. I'll buy you anything you like."

Evelyn almost refused.

She preferred operating behind the scenes, staying low-key.

But seeing Scarlett's hopeful eyes, she agreed.

Evelyn called Gabrielle to watch the children.

After breakfast, the two beauties strolled through the garden, braving the cold wind.

###Chapter 320 

The city was shrouded in gloomy skies, thick fog blurring the outlines of distant buildings.

Scarlett Orlando clenched her fists, nails digging deep into her palms. "Evelyn, I can't swallow this injustice."

Evelyn Roland leaned against the window, fingertips lightly tapping the glass. "How many people in this world haven't been betrayed by their own flesh and blood?"

Her lips curved slightly, but her eyes remained icy cold.

"Consider it a trial by fire." As Evelyn turned, sunlight pierced through the clouds, casting dappled shadows across her profile.

Scarlett's nose stung with unshed tears.

Now that Evelyn had a child, she could never marry her brother.

What would become of Sebastian?

The lobby of Horizon Tech headquarters blazed with lights.

Vincent Langley stood impeccably dressed in a tailored suit before a bank of cameras, a stack of documents laid out before him. "Thank you all for coming," his voice resonated with steady authority. "Regarding the recent false rumors circulating online, I must set the record straight."

He methodically displayed tax certificates and mining permits.

Live stream comments exploded across the screen.

~Mr. Langley was framed all along!
~Those rumor-mongers deserve hell!

Vincent's expression turned sorrowful. "My persistence in diamond mining stems solely from fulfilling my dear friend Alexander Durand's dying wish."

As he spoke, donation records from the Bright Future Fund flashed across the massive screen behind him.

Simultaneously, a prominent blogger dropped a bombshell.

[EXCLUSIVE: How Evelyn Roland Sold Alexander Durand's Manuscripts for 300 Million!]

Accompanying the post were screenshots of Harrison Macmillan's wire transfers to Evelyn.

Public opinion flipped instantly.

~Disgusting! Counting blood money before Alexander's body was cold!
~This woman belongs in hell!
~Get Evelyn out of Vienna!

In Evelyn's apartment, the television broadcasted Vincent's press conference.

Scarlett trembled with rage. "I'll hold a press conference! I know exactly how Alexander treated you!"

Evelyn placed a restraining hand on her shoulder.

She should have seen it coming.

Harrison's 300 million had been an elaborately baited trap all along.

"Patience." Evelyn narrowed her eyes. "If Vincent dares play this game, he's prepared countermeasures."

Outside, the last rays of sunlight vanished behind gathering storm clouds.
###Chapter 321

Scarlett stomped her foot in frustration. "That old man is twisting the truth! Don't you want to rip his lying mouth apart? Isabella stole your husband—aren't you furious?"

Her chest heaved violently, nails digging deep into her palms.

Evelyn remained composed. Only by lulling Vincent Langley into complacency could she expose his crimes.

"Patience. If a dog bites you, do you bite back? Revealing Isabella's schemes now would only alert them."

Scarlett's eyes widened.

A sudden realization struck her.

Was Evelyn's silence connected to Alexander Durand's death?

Her friend would never tolerate Isabella and Christian Lefèvre's arrogance for this long without a reason.

Scarlett's heart clenched, but she couldn't voice the question. That name was Evelyn's deepest wound.

Vincent Langley's PR campaign succeeded brilliantly.

Not only had he cleared his name, but he'd also gained public admiration.

Isabella's followers multiplied overnight, transforming her into an inspirational icon.

Meanwhile, Evelyn was vilified online as an ungrateful traitor.

She observed the spectacle coldly.

The higher they climbed, the harder they'd fall.

Vincent's current glory would make his future disgrace all the more humiliating.

"Scarlett. Evelyn." Sebastian Orlando entered, his navy overcoat accentuating his tall frame. Behind gold-rimmed glasses, his peach-blossom eyes shimmered with warmth.

"Sebastian." Evelyn nodded slightly.

Scarlett turned away with a huff. "Brother! You knew the truth all along, didn't you? Am I not your real sister?"

His calm demeanor confirmed he'd known about Evelyn's children.

Though admittedly, her gentle brother wasn't Evelyn's type.

Now she understood why Adrian Valentine's dangerous allure had captivated her friend.

Sebastian ruffled his sister's hair. "Some things are better heard from Evelyn herself."

Scarlett snorted.

If these two had conspired to keep secrets, Adrian would face her wrath when the truth came out.

"Evelyn, about the online rumors..." Sebastian hesitated.

She shook her head. "Not worth mentioning."

Scarlett's eyes lit up. "Brother! The auction tonight has pink diamonds—buy Evelyn the most expensive one!"

Sebastian's gaze softened as it lingered on Evelyn.

Diamonds always suited her radiance.

"Consider it done. That's actually why I'm here. Excuse me—I'll check on the children."

As long as she was unharmed.

He knew her well. Trivial attacks couldn't scratch her armor.

Watching her brother head toward the nursery, Scarlett suddenly smiled.

"Evelyn, what's your next move?"

The official report called the Durand mansion fire an accident. But they both knew it was a massacre.

Evelyn tousled her hair. "Focus on your acting. Don't overthink it."

Scarlett pouted.

Always treating her like a child needing protection.
###Chapter 322

Evelyn's slender fingers traced the rim of her teacup as her gaze lingered on her phone screen. The Roscente family scandal still dominated the top three trending topics.

Her fingertip paused when she saw the news about Julian's insomnia caused by the car accident.

Setting down the teacup, she decided to stay out of the Roscente family's mess.

The revelation about Nathan's identity as Julian's illegitimate son surprised her.

She quickly texted Zachary: [Dig up everything on Nathan.]

This man's background was more complicated than she'd imagined. Her previous investigations had always hit a wall.

Zachary replied instantly: [Boss, why the sudden interest in him?]

Evelyn responded: [Just do it.]

Zachary followed up: [I can look into it, but you need to bring bodyguards. After today's news broke, too many eyes are watching you.]

Her reply was brief: [Fine.]

She hated trouble. Even more, she hated being watched.

......

The Langley mansion blazed with light.

Vincent Langley and Isabella lounged on leather sofas.

Isabella wore a pink silk nightgown, the picture of innocence.

Father and daughter exchanged satisfied smiles as they watched the skyrocketing numbers on the tablet.

"Brilliant move, Dad." Isabella eyed her exploding follower count. "I'll land top-tier roles next year."

Vincent smirked. "That little bitch thought she could ruin me? Dream on."

"Dad!" Isabella suddenly shrieked.

Vincent nearly toppled off the couch.

"What the hell?" He clutched his chest.

Ice flashed in Isabella's eyes. "Just ruin her? I want her dead."

Vincent frowned. "Not yet."

"On my wedding day to Adrian." Isabella's red lips curved. "That's the gift I want."

Her smile was sweet. Her eyes held poison.

Vincent nodded. "Don't worry. She won't live long."

Isabella's satisfied gaze narrowed.

At the stairwell, Eleanor Langley covered her mouth, trembling.

She'd never seen this side of her adopted daughter.

......

Valentine Group CEO office.

Victor removed his headphones, face grim as he pressed play.

The Langley father-daughter conversation played crystal clear.

"Sir, why do they want to kill Mrs. Valentine?" Victor's voice tightened. "And why involve your mother?"

Adrian's eyes darkened.
###Chapter 323

Adrian Valentine's slender fingers tapped rhythmically against the mahogany desk, dark currents swirling in his eyes.

The movement ceased abruptly. A dangerous smirk curled at the corner of his lips.

He'd recognized Evelyn Roland's identity the moment he saw her after the fire.

"They've been trying to kill my wife." Each word dripped with glacial venom.

Victor Ashcroft frowned. "She's not your wife anymore, sir."

The title grated on his nerves whenever it left Adrian's mouth.

The man's feelings for Evelyn were a suffocating paradox—seething hatred intertwined with sleepless obsession.

The same hand that had struck Evelyn now bore cigarette burns, self-inflicted scars covering every inch.

The bitterest irony? Margaret Valentine had been part of the conspiracy.

"Shut up." Adrian's glare could freeze hell.

Victor mimed zipping his lips. "Right. My bad."

A sudden realization made his voice tremble. "Sir... Isabella Langley's close ties to Vincent Langley... Could it mean the late chairman's death was..."

He choked back the rest.

Murderous intent flashed in Adrian's eyes.

His grandmother's warning echoed—the killer lived within the Valentine family.

"Dig deeper. We must uncover the truth about my father's death." The temperature in the room plummeted.

Victor's spine turned to ice.

The connection between Vincent Langley and Margaret Valentine was far more terrifying.

This quagmire had no bottom.

"Isabella requested your escort to tonight's charity auction."

Adrian's eyes narrowed. "Hmm."

Victor studied his boss's clenched jaw, swallowing unspoken words.

"Any progress on Phoenix Group?" Adrian stood, his tailored suit emphasizing his imposing frame.

"Nothing. Whoever's behind it remains buried. Even Vincent's network came up empty." Victor hesitated. "Could it be the Evans family? Launching an IPO within a month suggests long-term planning."

Adrian scoffed. "If it were them, they'd have struck already. Evelyn searched six years without evidence. The Evanses wouldn't stand a chance."

Victor exploded. "She. Is. Not. Your. Wife!"

Adrian scowled. "What's wrong with you?"

The door slammed behind Victor's furious exit.

Adrian's fist crashed onto the desk. Fresh blood seeped through his bandages.

Somehow, over two years, the hatred had begun dissolving like mist.

Christian Lefèvre... Why did you have to die?

He squeezed his eyes shut, agony etching his features.

Remembering Julian Roscente's condition, he snatched his keys and sped toward the hospital.

——

Julian had grown accustomed to darkness.

At the familiar footsteps, he turned toward the door. "You came."

Adrian stood motionless by the hospital bed, staring at his friend's pallid face.
###Chapter 324

Adrian Valentine gazed into Julian Roscente's bloodshot eyes, a pang of bitterness tightening his chest.

"I came to see you." Adrian's deep voice carried its natural magnetism.

"Any news from Dr. Z?"

Julian's expression darkened at the mention of his assistant's report. "He's busy handling corporate scandals and his illegitimate son. My survival is the last thing on his mind."

Adrian's brow furrowed. "Is Mason really your father's love child?"

Julian gave a humorless smirk. "Who knows?"

The answer no longer mattered. Blind and broken, he was already written off by that man.

"How are things outside?" Julian's grip tightened on the sheets. His assistant Victor only delivered good news, leaving him isolated like a prisoner.

"Everything's under control. Your father handled it well."

Julian suddenly turned serious. "Adrian, when my father suspected Evelyn... did you doubt her too?"

Adrian's knuckles whitened before he admitted, "An anonymous tip claimed Evelyn tried to kill you."

"Make a call for me." Julian fumbled with his phone.

Adrian eyed the device. "Use mine."

Julian shook his head. "I need mine. Dial and hand it to me."

He feared Evelyn would reject the call. That woman never forgot a grudge.

Adrian unlocked the phone, dialed, and returned it.

"Thanks."

Adrian froze. In just days, this proud man had learned gratitude.

The call connected instantly.

"Evelyn, it's me." Julian's voice trembled. "Can we meet?"

She almost refused, but the false murder accusation flashed through her mind, chilling her gaze.

"At the hospital?"

"Yes."

"I'll be there in an hour."

......

When Evelyn pushed open the hospital door, her diamond shoulder brooch glinted coldly under the lights.

Adrian leaned against the window, exuding dangerous charm. Their eyes met—then she looked away indifferently.

"Julian." She set a fruit basket on the floor.

A rare smile touched Julian's lips. "Thank you for coming. And for saving me."

Evelyn crossed her legs. "This is just the beginning. By tomorrow, the entire internet will say I tried to kill you."

Adrian's eyes narrowed. She'd become a stranger.

Yet Julian laughed. "I believe you. Evelyn... do you know who did this?"
###Chapter 325

Evelyn gazed into Julian's bloodshot eyes. The restlessness between his brows had faded, replaced by quiet composure.

"I don't know," she said calmly. It wasn't time to reveal the truth yet.

Julian's face turned deathly pale. "Evelyn, you must know something. Are you keeping it from me to protect me?"

Her expression remained cold. "The Roscente family's affairs don't concern me. Focus on recovering. Your eyes need rest."

She turned to leave.

Adrian stepped forward, blocking her path. "Evelyn, how can you be so sure his eyes are difficult to treat?"

A sharp female voice cut through the air. "Hmph!" Mrs. Roscente stood at the doorway, clutching a thermal container, her gaze like daggers. "A country bumpkin dares to treat my son?"

The fifty-year-old woman still carried an air of elegance, but her face twisted with fury.

"The whole internet is talking! Photos from the accident scene prove you're the one who tried to kill him!"

Evelyn's brow furrowed slightly. They'd moved faster than she anticipated.

Adrian's voice turned grave. "Aunt Sophia, if Evelyn hadn't arrived in time, Julian would've—"

"Enough!" Mrs. Roscente snapped. "You divorced her, yet you still defend her? My son almost died!"

Evelyn replied evenly, "If you think I'm the culprit, call the police."

"Evelyn!" Julian suddenly called out.

She turned back.

"I believe you." Julian's vacant eyes stared straight ahead, an eerie smile playing on his lips.

Those three words sent a jolt through Evelyn's heart.

"If not for your shot, I'd be dead from that axe." Julian fumbled out of bed. "Evelyn, you can heal my eyes, can't you?"

She arched a brow. "You truly believe I can?"

Adrian stared at her in shock. At this moment, Evelyn seemed as distant and untouchable as a star.

"Yes!" Julian's voice was resolute.

Mrs. Roscente shrieked, "She's just a saleswoman! Your father already went to fetch Dr. Z!"

A flicker of surprise crossed Evelyn's eyes. After six years, someone still remembered the legend of Dr. Z.

The prodigy who had stunned the medical world at just eighteen.
###Chapter 326

"I won't go to the hospital." Julian Roscente leaned weakly against the hospital bed, his voice firm. "If it weren't for Evelyn's medicine that day, I would've bled to death. Even the doctors said its hemostatic effect was remarkable."

He turned toward Evelyn Roland, sincerity in his tone. "Evelyn, you're the only one I trust."

Evelyn retrieved a blue-and-white porcelain vial from her bag, its surface glowing softly under the light. "Then do as I say. Take three pills daily after meals. It'll relieve your headaches and eye pain."

She placed the vial on the nightstand. "Tomorrow, I'll apply herbal compresses. In ten days, your vision will return."

Without another word, she turned and walked away, her departure decisive.

Julian fumbled for the vial, clutching it to his chest like a treasure. "Thank you, Evelyn. See you tomorrow!" His voice brimmed with anticipation.

Sophia Blanchet stood nearby, brows furrowed. She didn't believe Evelyn's kindness—how could a murderer genuinely want to save her son?

The moment Evelyn left, she'd discard those suspicious pills.

——

In the hallway, Adrian Valentine quickened his pace to catch up.

Evelyn sensed his approach and deliberately switched elevators.

"Do you hate seeing me that much?" His voice was low.

Evelyn stared at the elevator numbers, not turning. "Should I be eager to?"

"Can you really cure Julian?"

"If you doubt me, why ask?" Her laugh was cold.

"Sophia won't let you off easily." A flicker of concern crossed his eyes.

"Not your concern." Her tone was distant.

"Darling—"

The elevator doors slid open.

Isabella Langley stepped out arm-in-arm with Cassandra Valentine. Their expressions darkened at the sight of the two.

"Brother! How could you be with her? After all Isabella's done for you?" Cassandra shrilled.

Isabella's gaze burned into Evelyn. "Evelyn Roland, daring to show your face here? Still bitter you failed to kill Julian last time?"

Evelyn lazily lifted her eyes. "How do you know I wanted him dead?"

Isabella faltered, then snapped, "It's all over the internet! Seducing Adrian, trying to murder Julian—you're utterly depraved!"

Slap!

The sharp sound echoed down the hall.

Evelyn swiftly plucked a strand of Isabella's hair, too fast for anyone to notice.

"You hit me?" Isabella clutched her cheek, staring at Adrian in disbelief.

Evelyn's gaze was ice. "Who's more vile than you, Isabella? Spare me the innocent act."

"You—"

Slap!

Another stinging blow landed.

Isabella lost control. "You're dead, Evelyn!"

A cold smile curled Evelyn's lips. "You first. Once I have proof, you'll learn what true depravity means."
###Chapter 327

"What do you mean by that, Evelyn?" Isabella clutched her stinging cheek, her eyes wide with disbelief.

She had been slapped?

How dare this orphaned country girl lay hands on her?

Evelyn's lips curled into a mocking smirk. "I don't need a reason to hit you."

Isabella trembled with rage.

Adrian's expression darkened as he recalled Vincent's phone call. "Evelyn, apologize to Isabella now."

"Apologize?" Evelyn scoffed. "You're not worth it."

The elevator doors dinged open.

As she moved to step inside, Adrian's towering frame blocked her path.

"Move," she said icily.

"What if I refuse?" He knew her stubbornness all too well.

Her eyes flashed. In a blur, her right leg swept toward his knee.

Thud—

Adrian crashed to the ground, caught off guard.

Without a backward glance, Evelyn strode into the elevator.

Isabella gaped in shock.

Cassandra shrieked, "How could she—"

Helping Adrian up, Isabella whimpered, "Adrian, you're just letting her walk away?"

He shook off her hand, his face stormy as he entered another elevator.

"Adrian!" Isabella called out indignantly.

Cassandra tugged her arm. "You know how proud he is. He must be humiliated..."

Isabella clenched her fists.

She could feel Adrian growing colder toward her.

Inside the hospital room...

The moment Evelyn left, Julian groaned in agony, clutching his head.

His mother wiped away tears.

The scandal about the Roscente family's illegitimate child had spread like wildfire.

She couldn't bring herself to tell her son.

"Julian, let me call the doctor—"

"No." He gritted his teeth. "Evelyn's medicine..."

"Absolutely not!" His mother panicked. "She's not a doctor! What if—"

"Mom!" Julian snapped his head up. "If it weren't for Evelyn that night, I'd be dead! Don't you get it? Someone's using our family to eliminate her!"

Without hesitation, he swallowed the bitter pill.

Warmth bloomed in his chest despite the acrid taste.

His mother shuddered suddenly.
###Chapter 328

Everyone focused on the text message's content but overlooked the most crucial detail—the timestamp.

"Evelyn isn't a doctor!" Mrs. Roscente stomped her foot in frustration.

She always upheld clear principles, but when it came to medication, she never compromised. How could anyone take medicine so recklessly?

"Julian, you should listen to your mother." Isabella Langley approached in her designer heels, her voice dripping with false sweetness. "Evelyn grew up in the countryside and never even finished high school. What does she know about medicine?"

"The gossip online says she tried to seduce you and, failing that, decided to poison you instead. Didn't she also throw herself at Vincent Ashcroft?"

Her tone was saccharine.

Julian's blood ran cold. If anyone was the culprit here, Isabella was the prime suspect.

Who was spreading these vicious rumors about Evelyn?

Clearly, someone wouldn't stop until they achieved their goal.

He needed to regain his sight—fast.

"None of your business," Julian snapped, his voice icy. "Who invited you?"

His hatred for Isabella burned fiercer than ever after the incident with Vincent.

Isabella's eyes glinted with malice as she took in his fury.

Why wasn't this man dead yet?

She lowered her head in feigned hurt. "We heard about your injury. Cassandra and I came to check on you."

Cassandra Valentine quickly chimed in, "Julian, you know Evelyn's background better than anyone. How could you trust her with medication? I'm already reaching out to Dr. Z."

"All Evelyn wants is to climb the social ladder," Isabella added venomously. "With Nathan Aldridge backing her, if she actually cures you—"

Julian slammed his hand against the bed. "Get out! All of you!"

Isabella smirked and nudged Cassandra. "Aren't you staying to take care of Julian? I'll leave first."

Her plan was already in motion—time to retreat.

Cassandra stayed behind, though every instinct screamed at her to flee.

Julian groped for the edge of the bed and sat down, surprised to find his headache easing.

Mrs. Roscente glared at Cassandra. "Miss Valentine, please leave. My son doesn't need your care."

"Auntie..." Cassandra gazed longingly at Julian's gaunt profile.

"Julian, I was wrong last time..." Her voice trembled.

"Get out!" Julian roared.

Her betrayal hadn't just hurt him—it had devastated the entire Ashcroft family.

Cassandra fled in tears, calling for doctors.

Moments later, a team of white-coated physicians rushed down the hallway behind her.

The chief examiner's face darkened after checking Julian's vitals. "Mr. Roscente's condition is critical. We need to run comprehensive tests immediately."
###Chapter 329

Julian Roscente sensed something amiss.

"Who are you?" His voice was icy. "My attending physician doesn't sound like you."

This doctor's arrival was suspicious. His father had specifically arranged for an old friend—why would there be a sudden replacement?

"Don't be alarmed, Mr. Roscente." The doctor spoke gently. "I'm Dr. Zhang from the ER. This young lady ran into me on the way and explained your condition."

Julian's brow furrowed.

"No examination needed. I want to rest."

The doctor's gaze flickered over the medicine bottles on the nightstand before he ushered the medical team out.

As footsteps faded, Julian counted silently in his head.

"Mother, how many came in?"

"Six." Mrs. Roscente stood by the door. "All male doctors."

Cassandra Valentine remained rooted in place.

"Still here?" Julian's voice was frigid. "Cassandra, I despise being manipulated."

Her eyes reddened as she snatched her purse and stormed out.

Once certain they were gone, Julian lowered his voice. "Mother, check the surveillance footage."

"What's wrong?"

"Two doctors reeked of cigarettes." His expression darkened. "They didn't seem like hospital staff."

Blindness had sharpened his other senses.

Mrs. Roscente's pulse quickened with understanding.

She slipped toward the security room, heart pounding.

——

Isabella Langley sat in her car as her phone screen lit up.

[Task complete]

Her smirk tugged at facial wounds, making her wince.

"Evelyn..." She ground her teeth.

Another vibration—Victor Ashcroft calling.

"Ms. Langley, the CEO asked me to escort you to the auction."

Triumph flashed in Isabella's eyes. "Take me home to change first."

Tonight, Evelyn would pay.

——

Evelyn Roland returned to Regal Heights.

Nathan Aldridge had gone to investigate witnesses from that night.

Online rumors accusing her of attempting to murder Julian were spiraling out of control.

The "murderer" label spread like wildfire.

Evelyn stood by the window, gaze glacial.

This game had only just begun.
###Chapter 330

Evelyn scrolled through the comments on her phone, her expression calm as still water.

The vicious words rained down like hail, yet not a single one left a mark on her heart.

She wouldn't let these rumors affect her.

The moment she stepped through the door, Scarlett's furious voice greeted her.

"Have these keyboard warriors lost their minds? Accusing you of killing Julian Roscente? They should write fiction instead!"

Warmth blossomed in Evelyn's chest, and the corners of her lips lifted slightly.

"Scarlett, don't let it upset you."

Scarlett whirled around, her eyes widening when she saw Evelyn still smiling. She stomped her foot in frustration.

"The internet is tearing you apart! How can you laugh at a time like this?"

She rushed forward and pulled Evelyn into a tight embrace. "Those people are despicable!"

Evelyn gently patted her back. "A few insults won't kill me."

"You always say that!" Scarlett's eyes reddened with urgency. "Isabella's fans are protesting outside Sterling Manor with banners!"

Evelyn arched a brow, unshaken. "Looks like I'm trending again."

Scarlett and Victoria exchanged bewildered glances.

Meanwhile, in Sebastian's apartment...

He was on the phone with Sebastian Cortez, whose voice simmered with suppressed rage.

"You promised to protect her, and now the entire internet is attacking her!"

Sebastian's expression darkened. "I underestimated the situation. But this confirms one thing—Vincent still has a mole in the presidential palace."

Sebastian Cortez's voice sharpened. "That person has been hiding for over a decade, and Sterling Manor has always been their target. Vincent is just their pawn!"

"I know." Sebastian tightened his grip on the phone. "I'll handle the online backlash. Be careful on your end."

"Don't act rashly!" Sebastian Cortez warned. "She has her own plans. Interfering could ruin everything."

After hanging up, Sebastian immediately called his assistant.

"Release the statement as planned."

He grabbed his coat and strode toward the door to pick up Evelyn and the others.

The auction hall glittered under dazzling lights.

Scarlett looped her arm through Evelyn's, eagerly describing tonight's auction items.

"Evelyn, I'm going to make my brother win that pink diamond for you!"

Evelyn glanced at the composed Sebastian and shook her head with a smile. "My jewelry box is already overflowing."

Scarlett opened her mouth to argue when her pupils suddenly constricted.

A stranger charged toward them, a bucket in hand.

"Evelyn Roland, you murderer—die!"
###Chapter 331

Sebastian Orlando's eyes turned icy. He lunged forward and kicked the woman to the ground.

The scalding kettle in her hands clattered onto the floor.

Evelyn Roland stared at the steaming water, her gaze darkening like spilled ink.

She stepped closer, looking down at the woman curled up in pain.

Anyone bold enough to attack at an auction was no ordinary person.

Sebastian's kick had been brutal. The woman's face was drained of color.

"Even if I were a murderer, you have no right to judge me," Evelyn said coldly.

"Julian Roscente was the love of my life!" The woman's lips trembled. "You're the reason he went blind!"

Evelyn's brow arched slightly.

This situation was more serious than she'd anticipated.

She glanced at Zachary Deross behind her. "Find out how this woman got in."

"Evelyn, do you think you own this auction house?" Cassandra Valentine's mocking voice carried from a distance.

Adrian Valentine, Isabella Langley, and Victor Ashcroft were approaching.

Evelyn's gaze flickered over Adrian. Surprise flashed in his deep eyes.

The corner of her mouth lifted.

Funny. This auction house actually was hers.

Isabella stared at the woman on the floor, her eyes glinting with malice.

Useless!

That kettle was supposed to contain sulfuric acid. How had they failed?

Scarlett Orlando suddenly frowned. "What's that smell?"

She bent closer to the spilled liquid and paled. "It's sulfuric acid!"

"Sulfuric acid?" Sebastian's pupils constricted.

The woman on the floor looked terrified.

She hadn't known about the acid!

Sebastian immediately dialed his phone. "Call the police. This was attempted murder."

Nathan Aldridge arrived with officers and bodyguards.

When Evelyn saw Nathan, her eyes reddened.

"Nathan..." Her voice shook.

Nathan's eyes were also wet. "Miss Evelyn."

This foolish girl had been willing to get hurt just to lure Alexander Durand out.

"After the young master passed, he asked me to follow Mr. Orlando," Nathan said quietly.

Evelyn froze.

The word "passed" shattered her last hope.

She'd waited so long.

Refusing to believe Alexander was truly gone.

Last time, she'd even let Adrian stab her—just to see him one more time.
###Chapter 332

Evelyn burst out of the hospital room and immediately spotted Adrian standing at the end of the corridor.

"Evelyn." Sebastian pulled her into his arms, his long fingers gently stroking her hair. His Adam's apple bobbed, but no words of comfort came.

"Sebastian, Alex he..." Her voice trembled like a candle flame in the wind.

Sebastian lowered his gaze, avoiding her hopeful eyes.

The silence said it all.

Alexander Durand would never return.

The brother who had protected her since childhood now rested forever beneath those ocean waves.

"I'll always be here." Sebastian tenderly wiped the tears from her cheeks.

For a fleeting moment, Evelyn saw Alexander's shadow in him.

The resemblance was uncanny.

Scarlett shot a cold glance at the woman curled on the floor and signaled Adrian with her eyes. "Take her away."

Adrian immediately stepped forward to coordinate with the police, and soon the woman was escorted out.

Isabella stood in the corner, her nails digging deep into her palms.

Evelyn always had such damned luck.

Even Sebastian was on her side.

Just who were these siblings?

After years of digging, she still couldn't uncover their origins.

Seeing Evelyn unharmed, Cassandra sneered, "Evelyn, aren't you being too cruel? It was just a misunderstanding, yet you're sending her to prison?"

Evelyn smirked. "Seems your eyes aren't the only thing that's defective."

"You—"

"Get lost." Evelyn couldn't be bothered to waste another word.

Isabella stepped in to mediate. "Evelyn, that lady only acted out of confusion—"

"Oh? So acid to the face is just a simple misunderstanding now?" Evelyn arched an eyebrow.

Isabella's face turned ashen.

How she wished that bottle had ruined Evelyn's pretty face.

"Miss Langley," Scarlett mocked, "when you framed Evelyn with your little schemes, did you ever stop to think about your own cruelty?"

Isabella flushed with rage. "The one who isn't loved is the real outsider!"

"Scarlett," Evelyn tugged at her sleeve, "why lower yourself to argue with an animal?"

Scarlett feigned realization. "My apologies, Evelyn. I shouldn't have compared you to a dog."

"Pfft—" Victor couldn't hold back his laughter.

Adrian finally spoke up. "Enough."

His gaze lingered on Evelyn, safely sheltered in Sebastian's arms, before he led Isabella and Cassandra into the auction hall.

Sebastian guided Evelyn to the front row.

As fate would have it, her seat was right beside Adrian's.

Watching her take the neighboring spot, Adrian's lips curved in an almost imperceptible smile.

Only then did Evelyn notice who sat beside her.

She immediately turned to Sebastian. "Let's switch seats."
###Chapter 333

Sebastian Orlando's lips curved slightly, his eyes brimming with affection. Seeing her reluctance to sit beside Adrian Valentine, his mood lifted further. "Alright."

Adrian's expression darkened, his fingers tightening imperceptibly on his knees.

Sebastian switched seats with Evelyn Roland.

Scarlett Orlando, however, beamed as she shifted to ensure Evelyn remained next to her brother.

"Evelyn, I heard they're auctioning the Stellar Dream diamond series tonight. Let my brother get it for you. And the Ocean's Heart too."

Evelyn smiled faintly. "There's no need for such extravagance. I'm just here to enjoy the atmosphere."

"Nonsense!" Scarlett insisted. "I brought you here to have fun. Choose between the Ocean's Heart and the Stellar Dream. If you won't accept a gift from him, then let me give it to you."

Touched by her persistence, Evelyn felt warmth bloom in her chest.

"Scarlett, don't worry about me. I'm content with my life as it is."

"No!" Scarlett lowered her voice. "You deserve to pamper yourself. That bitch Isabella Langley isn't worth your concern. Let her scavenge through the trash you discarded."

Evelyn: "..."

She'd nearly forgotten how sharp Scarlett's tongue could be—just like her own.

A faint smile tugged at her lips. "Fine. If I see something I like, I'll bid."

She'd find a way to repay Scarlett with an even better gift later.

Their conversation, neither too loud nor too soft, carried clearly to Adrian and Isabella's ears.

Adrian's gaze turned icy.

Trash?

Scarlett's mouth needed to be taught a lesson.

Isabella trembled with rage, jealousy gnawing at her over Evelyn's good fortune.

The first round of bidding commenced.

The auction hall was packed.

The first item was the Stellar Dream diamond necklace.

Its central gemstone dazzled, surrounded by shimmering smaller diamonds, but the angular design didn't appeal to Evelyn.

She signaled for Scarlett and Sebastian to refrain from bidding.

It was ultimately claimed by a socialite in the back row for thirty million.

The second item was the Ocean's Heart.

The diamond ring boasted exquisite craftsmanship and a unique design.

Scarlett brightened. "Evelyn, your birthday is coming up. Let me win this Ocean's Heart for you!"

Evelyn blinked in surprise.

November 4th—her birthday.

Adrian's head snapped toward Evelyn.

Only now did he realize how neglectful he'd been as a husband, failing to even remember his wife's birthday.

His father's death anniversary coincided with his own birthday.

He never celebrated it.

The concept of "birthday" felt foreign to him.

Yet as his own approached, she hadn't mentioned it once.

Did she not care, or was she avoiding the subject?

Adrian's eyes darkened like stormy seas.

Isabella glanced sideways, catching the moment his gaze lingered on Evelyn.

He still cared for her.

Murderous intent flickered in Isabella's eyes.

Julian Roscente's plan had failed, but she could still use Christian Lefèvre's death to ruin Evelyn.

Did Adrian want to protect her?

She'd make sure the truth went public, dragging Evelyn into irreversible ruin.

"Ladies and gentlemen, next we have the Ocean's Heart. This piece features fluid lines and a striking diamond pendant that enhances facial contours and elongates the neckline. A masterpiece of refined elegance, starting bid at ten million."

Evelyn did admire the pendant.

As a designer herself, she recognized the hand of a true master.

The diamond's quality was exceptional.

Scarlett gasped. "Evelyn, this is Master Peachbloom's work!"

Evelyn frowned.

So it was her design.

That woman was practically her nemesis.
###Chapter 334

Evelyn Roland studied the Ocean's Heart necklace, struck by its familiar design aesthetic.

The auctioneer's voice snapped her back to reality.

"Eighty million!"

Sebastian Orlando and Adrian Valentine were locked in a fierce bidding war.

Adrian raised his paddle. "One hundred million."

Sebastian countered without hesitation. "Two hundred million."

"Two hundred fifty million," Adrian upped the bid.

Sebastian lifted his numbered card with practiced ease. "Three hundred million."

The room fell silent.

Isabella Langley tugged urgently at Adrian's sleeve. "Adrian, I truly adore this piece."

Adrian's expression remained impassive. "It's not worth the price."

Isabella's knuckles whitened as her nails dug into her palms.

"But I've secured Master Peachbloom's collaboration. Acquiring this would demonstrate our sincerity."

Adrian kept his gaze forward. "Sincerity isn't measured in currency."

Isabella's hopes shattered.

"Three hundred million, going once!" The auctioneer scanned the crowd.

"Three hundred million, going twice!"

"Three hundred million—sold!"

Attendants swiftly processed the transaction.

Sebastian accepted the velvet case and turned to Evelyn. "For you."

Evelyn's lips curved. "Thank you."

The necklace's craftsmanship had genuinely captivated her.

Adrian's grip tightened until his knuckles bleached white.

Isabella trembled with suppressed fury—Adrian wouldn't even spend pocket change for her.

Cassandra Valentine spoke up. "Brother, Isabella rarely—"

"Enough." Adrian's icy tone silenced her.

Cassandra bit her lip.

Isabella forced a smile. "It's fine. Evelyn needs that necklace more—being single and all."

She deliberately raised her voice.

But Evelyn remained engrossed in examining the necklace, oblivious.

The third lot appeared—a necklace of twenty-six pigeon-blood rubies, each encircled by diamond pavé.

Isabella's eyes lit up.

"Perfect for Mother's birthday."

She missed the razor-sharp gaze boring into her back.

A stylish young woman glared daggers at her oblivious figure.
###Chapter 335

"Starting bid at twenty million."

The moment the auctioneer finished speaking, Isabella Langley raised her paddle.

"Thirty million." Her eyes gleamed with determination.

"Forty million."

A clear feminine voice rang out from the back.

Isabella whipped around and spotted Natalie Lowell.

Evelyn Roland also turned to look.

Natalie gave Evelyn a faint smile and waved lightly. "Evelyn, long time no see."

Evelyn nodded slightly. After their last meeting, she had only sent medicine. She hadn't expected Natalie to recover so well.

Isabella's expression darkened. Why was this woman here?

"Forty million."

Another bidder joined the fray.

Isabella swiftly raised her paddle. "Fifty million."

She had to win this pigeon blood ruby. Her mother adored red—it would be the perfect gift to please her.

Lately, Warren Garten's mother kept visiting the hospital but refused to say why.

Natalie didn't hesitate. "Sixty million."

Isabella turned to face her. "Ms. Lowell, would you consider stepping aside? I want this for my mother."

Natalie shook her head apologetically. "I'm sorry, but I'm buying it for my mother too."

Isabella narrowed her eyes. This woman was clearly retaliating.

Last time, she had deliberately revealed Natalie's identity to Daniel Sherwood, hoping he'd cause trouble for her. But Natalie had vanished, only to reappear completely transformed.

Still, Daniel hadn't divorced her yet. She'd suffer soon enough.

"Seventy million." Isabella raised her paddle again while quickly sending a text.

Natalie countered without pause. "One hundred million."

Isabella spun around. The Lowell family's wealth was truly staggering.

But spending a hundred million on a necklace was excessive.

She hesitated.

Natalie smirked. So much for filial devotion.

Then Isabella remembered Evelyn was watching. She couldn't lose face.

"One hundred fifty million!" She gritted her teeth and raised her paddle.

Natalie remained composed. "Two hundred million."

"Two hundred fifty million!" Isabella went all in.

Natalie set down her paddle, done with the bidding.

The room fell silent.

The auctioneer looked at Isabella. "Two hundred fifty million for bidder six. Going once. Any other offers?"

No one responded.

Evelyn saw through Natalie's ploy. Pity Isabella was too shrewd to keep falling for it.

Isabella frowned. Why had Natalie given up?

After three confirmations, the ruby necklace went to Isabella.

Evelyn glanced at her through Adrian Valentine, a knowing smile curving her lips.

This necklace had been her arrangement all along.
###Chapter 336

The Langley family's surveillance system was an impenetrable fortress, maintained daily by a professional team.

Evelyn had to find another way in.

Isabella traced the newly acquired gemstone necklace with her fingers, a smug smile curling her lips. This piece would surely please her mother, who had been gloomy about the marriage arrangements lately.

"Congratulations to bidder number six." The auction concluded with the host's announcement.

Isabella swiftly completed the paperwork and secured the necklace.

Sophia's gaze drifted through the crowd, landing on Adrian. The man radiated a dangerous yet intoxicating allure, impossible to resist.

She silently prayed Isabella would succeed in marrying into the Valentine family.

"Adrian keeps looking at Evelyn strangely," Sophia whispered in warning.

Isabella clenched the jewelry box, her chest tightening at the memory of Adrian's dismissive "not worth it."

"Adrian, let's go." She forced a smile as she approached him.

Without a glance, Adrian strode away.

Watching his retreating figure, Isabella bit her lip. Sophia was right—his indifference toward her was growing.

As Evelyn and her companions exited the venue, they spotted Natalie waiting by the entrance. Dressed in a sleek black pantsuit with cropped hair, she exuded confidence.

"Evelyn!" Natalie beamed, rushing forward.

Evelyn took her wrist, checking her pulse before smiling. "You've recovered well."

"Thanks to you." Natalie's eyes glistened. "No asthma attacks in six months."

Their warm exchange caught Adrian's eye as he stepped out.

He studied Evelyn's radiant smile, perplexed. How could someone so luminous be a murderer?

"Natalie."

The sudden voice made Natalie freeze.

Isabella smirked. The show was about to begin.

"Evelyn knows medicine?" Sophia whispered.

"Just putting on an act," Isabella scoffed.

Adrian ignored their petty remarks.

Daniel grabbed Natalie's hand desperately. "Come home with me. I swear I'll change—"

Natalie shot him a cold glare. After six months of transformation, she was no longer the meek woman he'd bullied.

His grip loosened instinctively under her piercing gaze.

This unfamiliar version of Natalie both terrified and fascinated him.
###Chapter 337

"Natalie, I'll never sign these divorce papers." Daniel Sherwood's knuckles turned white as he clutched the documents.

Even if her father took the irrefutable evidence to court, this marriage could still limp along as long as he refused to cooperate.

Natalie Lowell's lips curled into a mocking smile. "What's the point?"

"What?" Her icy stare sent a shiver down his spine.

"Domestic violence. Infidelity. Leaving me to die." She enunciated each word. "When I was too ill to file before, this evidence is enough for the civil affairs bureau to grant an immediate divorce."

She took half a step back, avoiding his outstretched hand. "Mr. Sherwood, maintain some dignity."

Daniel's face twisted with rage. "If you hadn't hidden your identity, I wouldn't have had to grovel for help! If your family had just—"

"Marrying within your social class?" Natalie suddenly laughed. "If you'd known I was a Lowell heiress, do you really think you'd have been worthy?"

Scarlett Orlando nearly choked on her coffee. Evelyn Roland watched the pathetic display with cold detachment.

Daniel's face darkened. He knew exactly how despicable his mother and sister were—ever since she left, that house had become a cesspool.

"I was wrong, Natalie!" He dropped to his knees with a thud. "Ms. Zhang meant nothing, I swear I never touched her! I'll do all the housework from now on—"

"A broken mirror can't be made whole again." Natalie's light words sliced through any possibility of reconciliation like a blade.

Adrian Valentine's head snapped up. Through the crowd, he caught sight of Evelyn's indifferent profile.

Some mistakes could never be undone.

In the parking lot, Adrian slammed his fist against the steering wheel. The rearview mirror reflected Isabella Langley's puzzled gaze, haunting him like a shadow.
###Chapter 338

"Cassandra, you should head home first tonight." Isabella Langley clung to Adrian Valentine's arm, flashing a saccharine smile at his sister. "I'll invite you to Julian Roscente's concert tomorrow."

Cassandra Valentine winked knowingly. "Go ahead with my brother."

As Isabella walked away with Adrian, her peripheral vision caught Daniel Sherwood harassing Natalie Lowell. The corner of her lips curled imperceptibly.

Evelyn Roland stared at Adrian's retreating figure, her gaze darkening.

"Evelyn." Natalie extended an invitation. "Would you and your friends like to join me for supper?" Her eyes held genuine warmth as she glanced at Scarlett Orlando and her brother.

Evelyn turned to them. "Sebastian? Scarlett?"

Scarlett, who had taken a liking to Natalie, nodded readily.

Sebastian offered a genteel smile. "The honor would be ours."

He secretly hoped this outing would help Evelyn emerge from her gloom.

The quartet departed together.

Daniel stood rooted to the spot, watching Natalie step into a limited-edition luxury car while her three companions entered vehicles far beyond his reach. Greed flickered in his eyes.

"Natalie Lowell..." he muttered under his breath, a sinister grin spreading across his face. "Just you wait."

——

Isabella didn't return to the Valentines' residence but went straight to the Langley mansion.

Eleanor Langley had been haggard lately, though today she looked slightly better.

"Mother!" Isabella threw herself at the older woman, presenting a velvet jewelry box like a prized offering. "I saw this ruby necklace at the auction and immediately thought of you."

Eleanor accepted the box, her fingers trembling faintly. The beaming face before her would never truly be her daughter's.

"How exquisite." She forced a smile, lifting the necklace into the light. The gemstone refracted dazzling beams across her meticulously maintained complexion.

Seizing the moment, Isabella cooed, "Mother, about my engagement to Adrian—"

"Your dowry is already prepared," Eleanor interrupted, her expression inscrutable. "The Langleys won't shortchange you."

Isabella's eyes gleamed. "This necklace cost two hundred fifty million."

She added casually, "I heard little brother just acquired several overseas companies?"

Eleanor's fingers stilled. The ruby pendant swayed midair like a pendulum.
###Chapter 339

Eleanor Langley's fingers trembled slightly as the ruby necklace glinted sharply under the light. So this gift had been part of his scheme all along.

She should have known.

Vincent Langley's cruelty never failed to disappoint.

Isabella wasn't her flesh and blood, but she carried Vincent's genes. That man had swapped her real daughter with his mistress's child years ago. What was he plotting now?

A sharp pain pierced her chest. For twenty years, she'd wondered where her true daughter might be.

Vincent owed his success entirely to her family's support. Every dirty deal he'd made—she'd been the one cleaning up after him.

And this was how he repaid her.

Her lips curled into a cold smile as she set the necklace gently on the coffee table. "You'll get what's due to you. We'll discuss your marriage when your father returns."

If Vincent dared to conspire with Margaret Valentine, if he dared to push Isabella into the Valentine family—then he'd brought this upon himself.

He'd destroyed her daughter's life. Now she'd make sure his daughter wished she were dead.

"You're the best, Mom!" Isabella sprang up eagerly. "Get some rest. I'm heading upstairs."

Eleanor watched her leave, her gaze lingering on the necklace. Ice formed in her eyes.

She placed the necklace inside the display case herself. This ruby would serve as a constant reminder—the flames of vengeance would never die.

Night had fallen when Evelyn Roland returned home. Her first stop was the nursery.

Two little bundles immediately crawled toward her the moment she entered.

Gabrielle Flores pouted nearby. After spending all day playing with them, these ungrateful rascals forgot her the second their mother appeared.

"Go rest, sis." Gabrielle yawned. "These clever little things are a breeze to handle."

Evelyn rubbed her sore shoulders. "Thanks for your help."

"But..." Gabrielle lowered her voice. "Still no change with Christian Lefèvre. If he stays like this, I can't guarantee his bodily functions will hold up in three years."

Evelyn frowned. "We've done all we can. The rest is up to fate."

"Honestly, even if he wakes up, what's the point?" Gabrielle scoffed. "Wasting his prime years moping around instead of making something of himself."

In her opinion, life offered endless possibilities. She holed up researching every day and still enjoyed herself.

After Gabrielle left, Evelyn bathed the children. They nestled against her, hungrily nursing.

By ten o'clock, the little ones were fast asleep, their cheeks flushed with dreams.
###Chapter 340

Evelyn gazed at the two sleeping children, her eyes softening with tenderness.

Since their arrival, warmth had gradually filled her world.

She rose quietly and slipped into the adjacent study. The computer screen flickered to life, displaying a clear feed of the Langley family living room.

Vincent Langley sat across from Margaret Valentine.

"You've been returning early lately," Margaret remarked, lifting her teacup.

Vincent's expression was gentle. "The diamond concession matters are settled. I wanted to spend time with you."

"Isabella mentioned dowry arrangements today," Margaret shifted topics abruptly. "How much are you planning to give?"

Vincent's brow furrowed. "Adrian's been increasingly distant. There's no rush for marriage."

"Because you indulged her schemes," Margaret countered coldly. "What man would marry such a woman?"

Vincent's gaze turned sharp.

Margaret's lips curved knowingly. She understood this paranoid man too well.

"How could you speak of your own daughter that way?" Vincent's voice darkened. "Surviving in the Valentine family requires strategy."

"Those filthy tactics can't stay hidden forever," Margaret held her ground. "We agreed to start fresh, yet you let her repeat past mistakes."

"You've been acting strangely lately." Vincent stood abruptly. "She even secured Master Peachbloom's mentorship! She's always been our most accomplished daughter!"

He stormed out, slamming the door.

Margaret watched the trembling doorframe, a chill curling her lips. Off to see that old mistress again.

Evelyn chuckled at the screen. The cracks in this marriage were widening.

Margaret held Vincent's darkest secrets after twenty years together.

The hypocritical man paraded his angelic wife in public while keeping a plain-faced lover in the shadows.

Evelyn recalled the paternity test. She already had samples from Isabella and Margaret. Just one more piece remained...

She sent Zachary an order: Obtain Margaret's DNA sample.

Tomorrow she'd visit Julian at the hospital for his dressing change. Closing the laptop, she returned to the bedroom.

Dawn's first light had barely touched the sky when frantic knocking startled Evelyn awake.

Instinctively, she pulled the frightened children close, soothing them with gentle pats until their breathing steadied. Barefoot, she padded to the door.

Victoria stood there, face pale with alarm.

"Sister, something terrible has happened!"
###Chapter 341

Evelyn's eyes darkened, her voice hoarse. "What happened?"

"Julian collapsed after taking the medicine you gave him. His mother called the police. They're on their way to the company now."

Evelyn frowned. "The medicine was fine. How could this happen?"

Victoria stamped her foot in frustration, unable to make sense of it.

All evidence pointed to her sister.

"Cooperate with the investigation for now. Zachary and I will find proof."

Evelyn remained calm, a calculating glint flashing in her eyes.

Someone had always wanted Julian dead.

Perhaps it was time to turn the tables.

"Send Gabrielle here. I have arrangements to make. You stay home with the children."

Her steady tone carried an unshakable authority.

Victoria remembered then—her sister always had everything under control.

Nothing ever truly challenged Evelyn except matters of the heart.

Her words were always precise, each syllable weighted with command.

"I'll call Gabrielle now." Victoria turned, her steps already regaining composure.

Evelyn went upstairs to freshen up.

Ten minutes later, she descended dressed impeccably.

She finished breakfast alone before Gabrielle arrived in a rush.

The young woman's furious expression showed she'd seen the online storm.

"Gabrielle, check on Julian at the hospital."

Seeing Evelyn's unflappable demeanor, Gabrielle visibly relaxed.

"Right away."

Evelyn gestured to the table. "Eat first."

Her tranquil presence soothed both sisters.

They sat down to eat.

After giving instructions, Evelyn picked up her bag and headed out.

Zachary waited by the car.

As soon as she entered, he reported, "We found him. He visited the hospital yesterday right after you left."

Evelyn recalled Isabella had been there too.

Every visitor was suspect.

"Investigate Isabella and Cassandra."

Zachary's expression darkened. "Adrian went as well."

Evelyn paused.

Why did his tone sound so bitter?

"Then investigate them all."

Zachary's tense shoulders finally eased. With her approval, he could pursue every lead.

As the car pulled through the gates, Sebastian stepped into their path.

Zachary braked. Sebastian yanked open the door, breathing hard.

His gaze locked onto Evelyn. "I'm coming with you."

She knew what awaited at the company—a swarm of reporters.

Yesterday's rumors had festered. Today they'd brand her a murderer.

Julian's mother's tactics were legendary.

Evelyn smiled faintly. "No need, Sebastian. I can handle this."

Her poise suggested she'd already orchestrated every outcome.

Sebastian insisted, "I brought our best lawyer. We can get you released."

She shook her head. "I need to draw them out. It might be Vincent. Or someone else."

Only by catching the black-clad figure would they unmask the mastermind.

Unless, of course, that person chose to take the fall alone...
###Chapter 342

The perpetrator was clearly a seasoned professional, leaving no trace behind.

She wouldn't have believed it if she hadn't witnessed it herself.

The man had been brazen, utterly without restraint.

Committing murder in broad daylight, then turning the tables to pin the blame on her.

There had to be someone else pulling the strings.

She'd already assigned Victoria to monitor the Langley family, hoping her suspicions were correct.

Sebastian's expression darkened. "Evelyn, whatever you plan to do, I'll stand by you."

This time, he wouldn't let her get hurt again.

Evelyn sighed inwardly. She didn't want to drag the Orlando family into this.

After a moment of silence, she signaled Zachary to drive to the company.

Valentine Group CEO's Office.

Victor barged in without knocking.

The moment the door swung open, he froze—Isabella was already there.

Victor swallowed his words mid-sentence.

Isabella smirked. "In such a hurry, Victor? Something urgent? Adrian and I were about to have breakfast."

She'd come specifically to ensure Adrian couldn't assist Evelyn.

Victor locked eyes with Adrian before speaking. "Sir, Julian's been poisoned. Evelyn's being framed."

Adrian's brow furrowed as he grabbed his phone. "To the hospital."

Isabella clutched his arm. "Adrian, you promised me breakfast."

His icy gaze cut through her. "Breakfast or a life?"

She faltered. "I—I'll come with you."

He shook her off. "Suit yourself."

Isabella shot Victor a venomous glare.

Victor stifled a laugh. The woman's act was impeccable.

Feigning surprise, he remarked, "Not worried about your dear Julian, Isabella?"

Her face paled. "Of course I am. I was just about to visit him."

Victor nodded sagely. "My mistake. Thought you were having a facial spasm."

With that, he hurried off to prepare the car.

Isabella trembled with rage. "Adrian, did you hear—"

"He's right." Adrian strode toward the elevator without looking back.

Isabella dug her nails into her palms.

Adrian, you chose the divorce yourself.

She swore silently: Evelyn must die. Adrian would be hers alone.

Sterling Manor Branch Entrance.

The moment Evelyn stepped out of the car, reporters swarmed her.

Mrs. Roscente lunged forward, grabbing her collar. "Evelyn! Give me back my son!"
###Chapter 343

Evelyn arched an eyebrow at Mrs. Roscente. "Why would I kill your son? What reason could I possibly have?"

Her tone was eerily calm.

The question caught Mrs. Roscente off guard. The image of her son lying in the hospital bed flashed through her mind. Suddenly, she lost control and raised her hand.

Slap!

The sharp sound of the slap echoed through the hallway.

Evelyn turned her face slightly, her cheek burning. This was only the third time she'd ever been struck—the first two had come from Adrian.

She slowly lifted her gaze, a cold glint flickering in her eyes.

"You vile woman! My son fell ill after taking your medicine. How could you be so heartless?" Mrs. Roscente shrieked, tears streaming down her face. "He's my only son!"

Evelyn pressed her tongue against the numb spot on her cheek.

Mrs. Roscente raised her hand again.

Sebastian Orlando swiftly caught her wrist. "Mrs. Roscente, the police will investigate this thoroughly. We're heading to the station now."

The woman collapsed to the floor, sobbing uncontrollably.

First, her husband's illegitimate child had been exposed. Now, her son was in critical condition. She was completely shattered.

"Evelyn, what did my son ever do to you?" She clutched desperately at Evelyn's sleeve.

Evelyn looked down at her. "If I were truly responsible, I wouldn't be standing here right now."

Her voice was soft, but it sent a chill down Mrs. Roscente's spine.

Suddenly, reporters swarmed around them.

"Ms. Roland, the medicine you gave Julian Roscente was allegedly tainted. Do you even have a medical license?" a female reporter demanded aggressively.

Evelyn met the woman's hostile gaze. "I have the right not to answer."

"This is a standard press inquiry!"

"Is refusing to answer a crime?" Evelyn smiled faintly.

The live chat exploded.

~This woman is outrageous! Does she think beauty gives her the right to do whatever she wants?

~What are the police waiting for? Arrest her already!

~Calm down. Julian isn't dead yet. Would the real culprit be this composed?

~She's just that good at hiding it! Killing with kindness—literally!

Amid the barrage of insults, Evelyn stepped calmly into the police car.

Sebastian shielded her the entire way.

In the VIP hospital room, Adrian Valentine watched the live broadcast, his expression darkening as he saw Sebastian protecting Evelyn.
###Chapter 344

Julian Roscente lay motionless on the hospital bed, his breathing shallow, his face an unnatural shade of gray. The doctors were at a loss—they confirmed he'd been poisoned but couldn't identify the antidote.

Isabella Langley sat by the window scrolling through a livestream on her phone. A cold smirk curled her lips as she watched Evelyn Roland being escorted into a police car. This is what happens when you cross me.

"Adrian, how could Evelyn be so cruel? Why would she hurt Julian?" Isabella set her phone aside and approached Adrian Valentine with feigned concern.

Adrian remained silent, his gaze dark and unreadable.

The door swung open abruptly. Gabrielle Flores strode in wearing a white coat, her eyes flashing with disdain when she spotted Adrian and Isabella.

"Out. I need to examine the patient."

Adrian looked up, recognizing Gabrielle—Evelyn's friend and Sophia's mother.

Isabella frowned. "You're not Julian's attending physician." She distinctly remembered a middle-aged male doctor.

Gabrielle arched a brow. "How would you know?"

"I visit Julian every day. Of course I know." Her tone was confident.

Gabrielle nodded thoughtfully. "Then everyone who entered this room yesterday is a suspect."

Before Isabella could react, Gabrielle pulled out her phone and dialed.

"Officer, I'd like to report a crime. Everyone who accessed Julian Roscente's room yesterday is a potential suspect."

Isabella and Adrian froze simultaneously.

Gabrielle continued, "Two people are here now, plus six men from yesterday. Their whereabouts are already tracked. Come quickly—I'll help you apprehend them."

Isabella's face paled.

"Who are you?" Her voice rose sharply, the gentle facade crumbling.

Ignoring her, Gabrielle focused on Julian's condition. Odd—the poisoning symptoms were mild.

"Tsk." She frowned. "Not severe. He'll wake by tomorrow."

Isabella's pupils constricted. Impossible! That poison was lethal upon contact—how could he—

"You're not hospital staff!" she hissed.

Gabrielle tilted her head. "Your brother's fine. Aren't you happy? Why so agitated—guilty conscience?"

Isabella faltered, realizing this seemingly naive woman had a razor-sharp tongue.

"Did Evelyn send you?" she forced out, struggling to maintain composure.

Adrian spoke suddenly. "Dr. Flores, will Julian really be alright?"

"Of course." Gabrielle produced a pill from her bag. "I can wake him right now."

Isabella shot to her feet. If Julian woke, her entire scheme would collapse.

"What are you giving him? If something happens, it's on you!" Her voice trembled.
###Chapter 345

Gabrielle nodded slightly. "Yes, I'm responsible. But it's strange—he took the antidote yet still hasn't woken up."

Isabella suddenly tensed.

Her eyes widened in realization.

This bitch had set a trap.

As expected, Adrian's probing gaze landed on her.

Her heart raced as she hurried to explain, "Adrian, I was just worried. If anything happens to Julian, Evelyn is still part of our family—"

Her excuse was flawless.

Adrian's lips curved slightly, his expression unreadable.

Even after two years, she still couldn't decipher this man.

Sirens wailed in the distance.

Isabella's face paled.

Adrian stood, his gaze heavy. "Dr. Flores, Julian is in your hands."

"Don't need you to tell me," Gabrielle snapped coldly. "Get lost. You're an eyesore."

The police escorted them away.

A sense of unease coiled in Isabella's chest.

This feeling always preceded failure.

Gabrielle watched the police car disappear, a faint smile playing on her lips.

She turned to the hospital bed. "Julian, drop the act."

His eyes flew open.

Darkness surrounded him.

But the sweet, clear voice painted the image of a pure-hearted girl in his mind.

"You're Evelyn's person?"

"Yes. With her detained, I came to confirm if you were poisoned. Isabella's reaction was suspicious."

Julian's gaze turned icy.

While pretending to sleep, he'd heard every bit of Isabella's agitation.

Those doctors had been summoned by Cassandra.

What a calculating woman.

"If we leave now, the mastermind won't show themselves."

"No need," Gabrielle murmured. "The six assailants are already captured. Evelyn said the culprit is too cunning—we lack evidence."

Julian pushed himself up. "Let's go save Evelyn."

"Wait." Gabrielle pressed him back down. "She said to act this afternoon. First, let me treat your wounds."

She retrieved ointment and applied it gently.

"This might sting."

Julian smirked.

Her voice was so pure it made his heart flutter.

Outside the police station, Isabella watched as the six men she'd sent were led away in cuffs.

Her sense of foreboding grew stronger.

The original plan had been to kidnap Julian and frame Evelyn.

But the hospital was swarming with Roscente family bodyguards.

She'd been forced to improvise.
###Chapter 346

Isabella Langley had already received word that Evelyn Roland intended to deliver medicine to Julian Roscente. Without hesitation, she altered her plans and secretly swapped the medication. Framing Evelyn was child's play for her.

These six captured men would never lead back to her.

Besides, her father had planted his own people within the police department. Soon, they would force Evelyn to confess through special means.

"Adrian, I'm starving. Let's grab something to eat." Isabella rubbed her stomach, her voice dripping with sweetness.

Adrian Valentine didn't even glance her way. His icy gaze remained fixed on the six suspects. He strode toward the leader, his expression hardening.

A four-leaf clover tattoo marked the back of the man's neck.

Adrian had seen that tattoo before.

The night Julian was attacked.

"You killed Julian Roscente." Adrian's voice was glacial as he stood before the man.

The man grinned, his thin mustache twitching. "That's right."

Isabella shot him a subtle look, and he responded with a reassuring nod.

Adrian didn't miss a thing.

So Isabella was involved.

She had also been present when Christian Lefèvre was murdered.

A chill ran down Adrian's spine as a horrifying realization exploded in his mind.

Christian Lefèvre. Victor Ashcroft. Julian Roscente.

His three most trusted allies—all met with tragedy when Isabella or Evelyn were nearby.

If Isabella had orchestrated all of this...

Then his wife...

His legs nearly gave out beneath him.

"Mr. Valentine, we need to take them in for questioning now," an officer cautiously reminded him.

Adrian nodded mechanically.

Meanwhile, in the interrogation room.

Evelyn sat handcuffed to a chair.

Across from her, Officer Nanyang glared with razor-sharp intensity. "Evelyn Roland, confess now, and things will go easier for you."

Evelyn lifted her eyes lazily. "Confess to what?"

Nanyang held up a ceramic vial. "This contains poison. Why were you trying to give it to Julian Roscente?"

"That cheap thing isn't mine." Evelyn smirked. "My porcelain vial is priceless. You think I'd use this trash? Or are you not worried about contaminating the evidence?"

Nanyang's face darkened. "Looks like you won't talk unless we get rough."

"Planning to torture me?" Her gaze turned arctic.

She knew exactly what that blinding interrogation light could do—it would ruin her eyesight.

Vincent Langley's influence had clearly reached the police.

Nanyang sneered. "Make this easy on yourself."

"And if I'm innocent? You think a flimsy bottle is enough to convict me?" Evelyn didn't back down an inch.

"No one walks out of here once we've got them." Nanyang slammed his palm on the table. "Talk! Did you kill him or not?"
###Chapter 347

Evelyn's lips curled slightly, a hint of mockery flashing in her eyes.

In this world, few truly stood for justice.

"Nanyang, does my acknowledgment even matter? As Vincent Langley's lapdog, how long do you think you'll last?"

"Among those clawing for power, who can match Vincent's tactics? At best, you're his right-hand man. At worst, you're just a disposable pawn."

Vincent's methods were indeed masterful.

Escaping unscathed wouldn't be easy for her.

But fortunately, she'd prepared in advance.

Vincent secretly controlled several underground factions, amassing wealth effortlessly.

He never showed his face—plenty were eager to do his dirty work.

Everything he did now was just an attempt to whitewash his reputation, to become "respectable."

Too bad he was already knee-deep in the muck.

Nanyang stiffened, meeting her clear gaze.

This was the first time he'd encountered such an opponent.

Calm under interrogation.

And able to see right through him.

He forced a smirk. "I don't understand what you're saying."

Evelyn replied lightly, "You know exactly what I mean."

Nanyang's eyes darkened, murderous intent flickering.

"Evelyn, this vial contains a lethal poison. Julian Roscente won't survive."

"Confess now, and we can all save time." Nanyang spoke with righteous conviction.

To Evelyn, he was nothing but a greedy, pathetic clown.

"Then show me the concrete evidence proving this is poison before interrogating me. Until my lawyer arrives, I won't discuss the case."

"Evelyn, public opinion is an invisible blade. The rumors outside aren't in your favor."

Nanyang still refused to give up, baiting her to confess.

Evelyn saw the greed he could barely conceal.

"Officer, do you know life's greatest tragedy?"

Nanyang frowned. "Cut the nonsense."

Evelyn smiled. "Dying before fulfilling your ambitions."

She knew all too well—in this world, a person's worth depended on their position.

Vincent was indeed at the height of his power now.

Nanyang: "..."

Her words struck a nerve.

"Lights." Nanyang changed tactics.

Harsh beams blasted into Evelyn's eyes.

Tears welled up uncontrollably.

Nanyang sneered. "Evelyn—"

"Nanyang, torturing me without solid evidence? My lawyer will sue you."

Nanyang narrowed his eyes at the woman in the blinding light. "Want to see your lawyer? Confess first."

Bang—

The interrogation room door burst open.

Nanyang spun around angrily, his face paling when he saw who it was.

"Captain... Laurent."
###Chapter 348

"Nanyang! Who authorized you to use coercive tactics?" Captain Song shoved open the interrogation room door and switched off the blinding spotlight.

Evelyn's vision swam with dark spots.

Nanyang's brow furrowed. The captain's sudden appearance had caught him off guard.

"Sir, Evelyn refuses to confess. The public pressure is overwhelming. I just wanted to close the case quickly. These pills are irrefutable evidence."

He brandished the so-called proof before the captain could speak.

"Irrefutable?" Captain Song sneered. "Where's the lab report? The fingerprint analysis? Witness statements? You call a bottle of pills irrefutable?"

He pointed to the adjacent room. "The real evidence is next door. We've arrested six men who swapped the medication. Evelyn gave Julian Roscente medicine for his eye condition."

"She's innocent."

Though Evelyn had anticipated this outcome, her chest still tightened.

The mastermind remained at large.

Nanyang's pupils contracted. He lowered his head. "Ms. Roland, my apologies."

Evelyn rose, meeting his gaze with a faint smile. "No need. My attorney will be in touch."

She turned to Captain Song. His face was unfamiliar, but gratitude warmed her voice.

"Thank you."

Nathaniel Song studied her for a long moment. "Don't mention it. You're free to go."

Evelyn blinked until her vision cleared, then exited the interrogation room.

Nanyang clenched his fists, speechless.

Captain Song's voice turned glacial. "Three-thousand-word disciplinary report. Expect a court summons."

He strode out without another word.

Nanyang kicked the table, then grimaced at the pain.

Where had he gone wrong?

Nathaniel watched Evelyn get into Sebastian Orlando's car before dialing Adrian Valentine.

Adrian waited alone in his vehicle. Isabella had been dismissed hours earlier.

"Status?" he answered immediately.

Nathaniel: "You were right. Vincent Langley has a mole in the precinct—Nanyang. He subjected Evelyn to light torture."

"Fortunately, I intervened in time. Her eyes should be fine."

Adrian's gaze followed Evelyn's departing car through the window. His eyes turned razor-sharp.

"Thanks." The words came out rough.

Nathaniel said, "My father never stopped investigating your father's case. I'll keep close tabs on Nanyang."

Adrian: "Good."

"Julian Roscente woke up," Nathaniel continued. "He installed surveillance in his hospital room and caught the medication swap on camera. Faked poisoning this morning to lure them out. That assassin from your video was among them."

Adrian's jaw tightened. So Julian had been playing the long game.

"Nathaniel, clear Evelyn's name publicly."

Nathaniel chuckled. "You're invested? She remained remarkably composed throughout."

"She always does." Adrian ended the call.

Outside the precinct, reporters swarmed Nathaniel.

"Captain Song! Is Evelyn Roland innocent?"

Nathaniel straightened his tie. "The real perpetrators are in custody. An official statement will be released."

A female journalist pressed, "Is the evidence conclusive? Can you completely exonerate her?"
###Chapter 349

Captain Song's gaze sharpened like a blade as it locked onto the female reporter.

"The truth will be announced on our official website shortly," he stated calmly.

The reporter pressed on relentlessly. "Captain Song, Evelyn Roland was clearly the murderer. Why was she suddenly released? And picked up in a limited-edition luxury car..."

She deliberately trailed off, sending the live chat into chaos.

~Money can buy anything these days?
~What's wrong with this reporter? The officer already said the truth will come out.

A cold smirk curled Captain Song's lips.

"From the moment this broadcast started, you've been manipulating public opinion against Evelyn," he said icily. "You're now suspected of defamation. Cooperate with our investigation."

The reporter's face drained of color.

She'd only taken money to do this job—she never expected to be exposed.

"I didn't! I was just raising reasonable questions!" she insisted shakily.

Captain Song remained unmoved.

Two officers stepped forward and seized her arms.

Her legs gave out, collapsing beneath her.

The live chat exploded.

~She's definitely guilty!
~Look how she's trembling with fear.
~Someone's targeting Evelyn.

In her hospital room, Evelyn closed the live stream.

The mastermind still hadn't shown themselves, but she wasn't in a hurry.

The police department's official website soon released a statement.

The real culprit was a man who had confessed to the crime.

Evidence of the reporter taking bribes to smear Evelyn was also made public.

Public opinion flipped instantly.

The sound of shattering glass echoed through Isabella's apartment.

Furious, she smashed everything within reach.

Vincent Langley stared at his phone screen, his expression dark.

He'd arranged everything perfectly.

His phone rang. He answered.

"What happened, Dominic?" His voice was razor-sharp.

"Sebastian Orlando led the arrest," Dominic reported. "We could use this to move against the Orlandos."

Vincent scoffed. "Acting now would backfire."

His gaze fixed on the window, eyes glinting dangerously.

"I should've strangled that bitch years ago."

Dominic hesitated. "Mr. Shang suffered significant losses this time."

"Relax." Vincent's lips curled into a cold smile. "Do you really think he'd actually go to prison?"
###Chapter 350

The call ended.

Vincent Langley listened to the crashing sounds from upstairs, his brow furrowed.

He knew his daughter's temperament too well—reckless ambition would only dig her own grave.

He ascended the stairs. Eleanor Langley watched coldly from the sidelines.

This meticulously planned scheme had been orchestrated by Vincent and his daughter together.

She had once taught Isabella the art of manipulation, but now the girl had surpassed her—her methods even more ruthless.

Eleanor traced the edges of a faded photograph in her hands—Isabella as a child.

The little girl in the picture was innocent and carefree, her features unmistakably Vincent's. She had never doubted the girl's parentage.

She set the photo down carelessly on the hallway console.

Only by stirring the hornet's nest could she force Vincent to reveal the truth of that year.

Her gaze hardened as she thought of the paternity test report hidden in the bedroom safe.

This family would soon crumble.

She descended the stairs slowly. Beyond the ten-meter floor-to-ceiling windows, dusk settled.

Her oatmeal-colored knit sweater lent her a gentle elegance, the white wide-leg trousers adding sophistication.

Her eyes flickered over Isabella's childhood photo—the last trace of warmth in her heart extinguished.

She had married Vincent in a fit of pride, only to realize now how foolish she had been.

With measured steps, she walked toward the front door. Behind her, the sounds of destruction continued unabated.

...

Isabella's bedroom was in ruins.

Vincent winced at the shattered porcelain scattered across the floor.

"Isabella, these are antiques! No matter how angry you are, you can't take it out on money!"

Even with his vast wealth, such waste was unbearable.

His cheeks trembled with fury.

Isabella's eyes burned with malice. "Dad, the plan failed! We didn't get the Roscentes. What good is an empty-shell Ashcroft family?"

The viciousness in her gaze sent a chill down Vincent's spine.

Of his three daughters, Isabella and his other illegitimate child were his favorites.

Outwardly sweet and docile, but at their core, just as merciless as he was.

"Patience. There will be other opportunities. Dominic is still by your side—he's a sharp blade."

In his line of work, trust was paramount.

Knowing when to cut losses was survival.

Using a scapegoat was too risky.

Win, and they'd have everything. Lose, and it would be their ruin.

If the Roscentes couldn't be taken down, they'd find another target.

One by one, they'd climb to the top.

Isabella lounged lazily on the white leather sofa, the setting sun casting a bloody glow over her.

Her eyes narrowed darkly. "Evelyn was supposed to die in prison, but now she's cleared her name."

A country bumpkin—how did she have so many powerful allies?

It had to be that fox-like face of hers.

She would destroy it. But her last attempt had failed.

The more Isabella thought about it, the more her hatred festered.

She had pulled so many strings for this scheme.

"Dad, I won't rest until Evelyn is dead. Adrian's heart will always belong to her."

These past two years had made it clear—Adrian wouldn't even lay a finger on her.

On their divorce day, he'd smudged her lipstick on purpose—a show for Evelyn.

In truth, nothing had ever happened between them.
###Chapter 351

Vincent Langley stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, his knuckles whitening around the stem of a wine glass.

He had just discovered the whereabouts of that painting, yet Evelyn Roland remained oblivious.

This secret must be buried forever.

"She has to die." A dark glint flashed in Vincent's eyes. "But we can't dirty our hands."

Several attempts to eliminate Victoria Laurent had failed, costing him valuable operatives.

Isabella Langley strode in on stilettos, her red lips curling into a smirk. "Father, let me handle this."

Vincent turned to study his daughter, then abruptly changed the subject. "Isabella, Adrian Valentine isn't the right match. Sebastian Cortez is the better choice."

"Because of his father's death?" Isabella arched an eyebrow mockingly.

Vincent's pupils constricted.

"Mother told me years ago." She examined her freshly manicured nails. "Adrian will never learn the truth. Besides..." Her eyes glazed with obsession. "He's far more captivating than Sebastian."

Vincent left with a stormy expression.

Isabella stared at his retreating back, her nails digging crescent moons into her palms.

A name suddenly occurred to her—Daniel Sherwood.

——

In the hospital corridor, Sebastian Orlando guided Evelyn toward Julian Roscente's room.

When they entered, Mrs. Roscente sat by the bedside.

The older woman sprang to her feet upon seeing Evelyn.

Slap!

A resounding blow landed across Julian's face.

Evelyn froze.

Julian cupped his cheek. "Mother?"

"You made me wrong Miss Roland!" Mrs. Roscente's eyes reddened.

Julian sighed. "Then you should apologize to Evelyn."

Though his eyes remained bandaged, he turned unerringly toward Evelyn's direction.

The charade must continue.

After discovering the switched medication this morning, he'd immediately contacted Evelyn. Only this ruse could expose the mastermind.

Mrs. Roscente took a deep breath and bowed deeply. "Miss Roland, I apologize."

Evelyn touched her still-stinging cheek.

"I accept your apology."

Mrs. Roscente exhaled in relief. As a mother, she understood the agony of losing a child better than anyone.

An abrupt silence fell over the room.

Mrs. Roscente recalled the Ashcroft family tragedy—the eerie parallels to this very moment.
###Chapter 352

Julian Roscente lay on the hospital bed, his eyes covered with gauze.

Evelyn Roland stood by the window, sunlight casting a golden halo around her silhouette.

"Evelyn?" Julian called out hesitantly.

She turned, her gaze settling on the medicine bottles on the nightstand.

"The medication is tainted." Her voice was barely above a whisper.

Mrs. Roscente nearly dropped her glass of water.

Julian bolted upright, his brow furrowing beneath the bandages.

"Six men," Evelyn stepped closer to the bed. "They weren't here to kill you."

Julian suddenly laughed.

"Trying to capture me?" His fingers tapped rhythmically against the bed frame. "My father's men are everywhere outside."

Evelyn retrieved a small black device from her bag.

"Surveillance bug." She pressed the switch, and a red light blinked to life.

The room plunged into eerie silence.

Mrs. Roscente covered her mouth, her face turning ashen.

Julian groped for his mother's hand.

"Cassandra Valentine," he ground out through clenched teeth. "She came with Isabella Langley."

Evelyn moved to the door as the detector emitted a shrill alarm.

Beneath the doorknob, a miniature listening device glinted faintly.

"Don't speak," Evelyn mouthed silently.

Julian nodded, his eyes narrowing beneath the gauze.

A sharp knock shattered the tension.

Evelyn pulled the door open to meet a pair of piercing dark eyes.

Adrian Valentine stood framed in the doorway, his tailored suit immaculate.

His gaze locked onto the bruise near Evelyn's eye, his Adam's apple bobbing.

"Move." Her voice was glacial.

Zachary Deross peered over Adrian's shoulder, clutching a laptop bag.

Adrian didn't budge.

"What happened to your eye?" He reached toward Evelyn's face.

Sebastian Orlando materialized behind Evelyn.

"Mr. Valentine," he said with deliberate amusement, "long time no see."

Adrian's expression turned arctic.

He strode into the room, his frown deepening at the sight of Julian's condition.

"You're recovering well."

Julian smirked.

"Thanks to you." He turned toward the sound of Adrian's voice. "Shouldn't you be with your fiancée?"

Adrian's fingers went cold.

"What do you mean?"

Julian groped for the water glass on his nightstand.

"Isabella's little gift to me," he hurled the glass against the floor with sudden violence, "I won't forget."

Shards of glass scattered like diamonds.

Adrian remained motionless, his face darkening with stormy fury.
###Chapter 353

"Julian..."

"Adrian, this incident is most likely connected to the Langleys. You're Isabella's fiancé. Only you and she knew about Evelyn delivering medicine to me. The fact that it was tampered with—I can't think of anyone else who could be responsible."

Julian's words left no room for misinterpretation.

Adrian's dark eyes bore into him, flickering with disbelief.

After years of brotherhood, was Julian really suspecting him?

Rage simmered in Adrian's gaze.

"Get some rest." He turned sharply, only to meet Evelyn's icy stare.

Their eyes locked for a tense moment before Adrian strode out of the hospital room.

Evelyn didn’t spare him another glance. The moment he left, Zachary entered to check the surveillance bug and immediately began tracking the signal.

Within five minutes, the location pinged a nearby office building.

Evelyn typed instructions into her phone, signaling Zachary to pinpoint the exact spot.

Soon, the coordinates for Room 1105 flashed on the screen.

After murmuring a few words to Victor, Evelyn left with Sebastian, heading straight for the target location.

Inside the car, Sebastian studied the towering glass façade. "Which floor, Evelyn?"

Recognizing the building as part of the Valentine Group's holdings, she answered coldly, "Eleventh."

Just as Sebastian moved to exit, his phone rang. His expression darkened at the caller ID.

"Hello?"

"Keep an eye on her. Don’t let her do anything reckless. I can’t break away right now."

Evelyn pressed a hand over his. "Go. I can handle this."

She knew how important that call was.

Sebastian hesitated, then relented. "I’ll have Zachary meet you here."

Evelyn forced a smile. "Fine."

She didn’t argue—just to ease his mind.

Suddenly, Sebastian pulled her into a tight embrace. "Wait for me, Evelyn."

The words sent a jolt through her, echoing Alexander’s last words to her before he was gone.

Panicked, she shoved the car door open and bolted toward the building.

From a distance, Adrian watched the scene unfold, his grip on the steering wheel turning his knuckles white.

A storm raged in his dark eyes.

Only when Sebastian’s car drove off did Adrian’s breathing steady. His gaze followed Evelyn as she disappeared into the lobby.

Frowning, he pulled up the security feed and saw her heading straight for the eleventh floor.

He sped into the underground garage, tracking her real-time location while calculating her motives.

Evelyn stood outside Room 1105—the signal strongest here.

This was Adrian’s private office.
###Chapter 354

Evelyn stood at the end of the hallway, her brow furrowed. She had sensed someone shadowing Julian for days.

The target was her.

Adrian's insistence that she leave suddenly made sense.

Could it be...?

She shook her head sharply.

That man felt nothing for her. Why would he care about her safety?

The door clicked open.

A masked figure emerged, gun aimed squarely between her eyes.

"Evelyn Roland. Your skills are impressive," the distorted voice rasped through a modulator. "Your moves match Phoenix Group's style."

Her gaze swept over the olive-green mask covering all but those cold, calculating eyes.

"If you want me, why involve Julian?"

"You're both targets." A humorless laugh. "Using the Roscentes to eliminate you was clever. Pity it failed."

Her slender frame blended into the shadows. "Who sent you?"

"Do I look like a snitch?"

"Pride makes men careless with secrets." Her tone was deceptively light.

Surprise flickered in those eyes before hardening. "Curiosity kills."

Her lips curved. "Heard that before."

A beat. Then—

"Let's talk."

The gunman hesitated. Despite his wariness, human contact was a rare luxury.

"Lower your weapon."

"Scared?"

"Concerned you won't escape after firing."

A scoff. "Cameras are disabled."

Her assessing gaze traced his physique. "Your build... Have we met?"

"Country girls don't fight like you."

Silence. Her mind raced through memories.

"Vincent Langley's man."

His pupils dilated. "Smart mouths get silenced."

The barrel shifted to her heart.

Evelyn's eyes turned lethal. "Those who try to kill me end up dead."

The gunman faltered. His finger spasmed on the trigger.

The shot echoed through the corridor.
###Chapter 355

The bullet whizzed through the air.

Evelyn Roland was suddenly yanked into a scorching embrace as someone tackled her to the ground.

A silver mask glinted coldly under the lights, the engraved "SZ" insignia making the gunman's pupils constrict in shock.

"Adrian Valentine of Shadow Zenith!" The man's voice trembled.

"Get lost!" Adrian's roar echoed through the hallway.

As the man fled in panic, Evelyn caught a clear glimpse of the four-leaf clover tattoo on the back of his neck.

Her heart lurched.

The "merchant" who had turned himself in today—his demeanor had been all wrong.

"Are you hurt?"

The raspy voice snapped Evelyn back to reality.

She swiftly pulled away from Adrian's arms, the "ZS" mark on his silver mask flickering in her vision.

"Thank you for saving me, Mr. Valentine." She took two steps back, her tone icy.

Adrian's jaw tightened as he stared at her red-rimmed eyes.

Evelyn turned and walked into the room.

Surveillance equipment blinked with red lights. The listening devices were still active.

Cigarette butts and liquor bottles littered the floor, reeking of decay—someone had been lurking here for days.

The computer screen lit up. All surveillance records had been wiped clean.

Only the hallway footage remained, flickering intermittently.

That four-leaf clover tattoo burned in her mind.

The real "merchant" was still at large.

She closed her eyes, taking a deep breath, her nails digging into her palms.

Vincent Langley's lackeys were proving more tenacious than she'd anticipated.

Adrian stood in the shadows, his Adam's apple bobbing.

"Why are you hunting them?" His voice was strained.

"Personal vendetta." Evelyn didn't turn around. "You should leave now, Mr. Valentine. I'm calling the police."

Her tone was glacial.

Adrian gave her one last lingering look before turning away.

Evelyn dialed Julian Roscente's number.

Twenty minutes later, Captain Julian arrived in full uniform with his team.

"Ms. Roland." He snapped a crisp salute, his shoulder badges gleaming under the lights.

"It's all yours." Evelyn gave a slight nod.

Julian offered a professional smile. "Safe travels."

His tone was so deferential it bordered on comical.

Evelyn shot him a cool glance and strode toward the elevator.

As the doors began to close, the silver mask reappeared.

"Something else, Mr. Valentine?" She arched a brow.

"Just passing by." Adrian leaned against the elevator wall, the corner of his lips curling beneath the mask.

"You saved me today. What do you want in return?" She cut straight to the point.

Adrian suddenly leaned in, his breath hot against her ear.

"Your name."

The gaze behind that mask burned like fire.
###Chapter 356

"Just call me Evelyn."

Evelyn met the dark eyes behind the mask without flinching.

There was something wicked and untamed in that gaze—strangely familiar.

Men like him always seemed to gravitate toward her.

Sebastian Orlando was gentle as jade, while Sebastian Cortez wore refinement like a cloak over his roguish core.

"Evelyn, today's news claims you're a murderer?"

Her eyes turned icy. "Watch your words, Mr. Roland."

A low chuckle. "I'm curious. Have you ever gotten blood on your hands? You're remarkably composed for someone who just found her way here."

Her gaze sharpened. "Flattery won't work on me. I'm just an ordinary woman."

"You're skilled with computers." He'd noticed her deft movements earlier.

"A passing familiarity," she said coolly.

"More than passing." He pulled out his phone. "Let's exchange contacts."

Evelyn frowned, reluctant to engage further.

"Wasn't this about repaying a life debt?" His lips curved. "Or were those just empty words?"

"..."

She hadn't needed his help to begin with.

With a silent sigh, she added his number.

He immediately dialed to verify, satisfied only when her phone rang.

Evelyn exhaled through her nose.

Back on the ground floor, she made a brisk farewell. "Goodbye, Mr. Roland."

She strode toward the luxury car idling at the curb and slid inside without looking back.

He watched the vehicle disappear before turning toward the underground garage.

——

In the hospital room, Julian Roscente recognized her footsteps.

And that faint, elusive fragrance she carried.

"Evelyn, did you catch them? Are you hurt?" Concern laced his voice.

Since the Vincent Ashcroft incident, his attitude toward her had warmed noticeably.

"They got away." She took a seat. "I think they were targeting me—using you as the weapon."

His laugh was cold. "Just like Vincent. Too bad they miscalculated. You saved me."

"I dragged you into this," he admitted quietly.

Evelyn studied him. Julian wasn't inherently bad—just privileged and arrogant from birth.

"The medicine is with Victor. You'll recover in ten days." She stood.

"Leaving already?"

"Yes." She nodded. "They'll try again. Next time, you're on your own."

She turned to go.

Julian called for Victor, his voice grim. "Investigate Isabella Langley. And don't worry about Adrian Valentine's reaction."

Victor thought of Isabella's deceitful smile, baffled by Adrian's inexplicable fondness for her.
###Chapter 357

"Don't worry, young master. I'll investigate immediately." Victor responded respectfully.

He noticed the exhaustion etched between Julian's brows. In just a few days, this privileged heir seemed completely transformed.

Even the golden child born with a silver spoon must weather storms to grow.

"Help me check out of the hospital." Julian suddenly spoke.

Victor recalled Gabrielle's instructions—ten applications of the herbal remedy would ensure full recovery.

There was truly no need to stay.

The attending physician entered the room. "Julian, this prescription is miraculous. Who was that young woman this morning?"

A faint smile touched Julian's lips. "Dr. Harrison, I don't know either."

He wouldn't reveal Evelyn's identity.

The doctor sighed regretfully. "Pure herbal formula with zero side effects. Our hospital's medical expertise could never have cured your eyes."

"Traditional medicine remains unfathomable." Admiration for ancient healing arts shone in his eyes.

Julian clenched his fists. In a few more days, he'd see the world again.

"Next time I meet her, I'll ask for you."

The doctor brightened. "You must introduce us! I want to apprentice under her. You know how obsessed I am with medical arts."

Julian suppressed a laugh. Would Gabrielle accept a middle-aged disciple?

"Of course, Dr. Harrison."

Pleased with the promise, the doctor left contentedly.

......

Isabella paled upon learning her scheme had been exposed by Evelyn, with Shadow Zenith's leader present at the scene.

Pacing her room, she dug her nails deep into her palms.

She'd been too obvious in her interference with Vincent's affairs.

At least her accomplice had escaped.

Furious, Isabella flung open her door, seeking her mother for distraction.

The lavish bedroom stood empty.

Her gaze caught on a childhood photo displayed on the dresser. Compelled, she picked it up.

"So innocent back then." The carefree smile in the image momentarily soothed her rage.

As she moved to replace the frame, she spotted a document wedged in the cabinet door.

The words "Paternity Test" leaped out at her.

Isabella's blood turned to ice.

Hands trembling, she opened the file—a DNA report between her and her mother.

"Impossible..." She stared at the results, fingers shaking so violently the paper nearly slipped.

She wasn't her mother's biological daughter?

No wonder...her plain features contrasted sharply with her mother's striking beauty.

She pulled out a second report—this one between her and her father.

The results confirmed their biological relationship.

The world spun around Isabella.

That elegant, refined woman she called mother shared no blood with her.

Every beautiful illusion shattered in that instant.
###Chapter 358

Isabella's fingers trembled slightly.

She stared at the paternity test report, the paper rustling in her shaking hands.

So Mother's recent strange behavior wasn't due to illness.

Those expensive diamond necklaces were nothing but guilt offerings.

The document slipped from her fingers with a soft thud.

She turned and rushed out of the room, her steps unsteady.

At the staircase landing, she collided with Vincent who had just returned home.

"Isabella?" Vincent caught her shoulders. "What's wrong?"

Tears spilled from her eyes. "Dad... I'm not Mother's biological daughter..."

Vincent's pupils constricted sharply.

"Nonsense!" He hissed in a lowered voice.

Isabella pointed toward the living room. "Those photos! Mother's treasured album from twenty years ago—it's all displayed now!"

Her voice shook. "And that paternity test... I found it in your bedroom drawer..."

Vincent's expression darkened.

After a long silence, he finally spoke. "You're right. You're not her biological daughter."

The words struck Isabella like lightning.

"But you are my flesh and blood." Vincent gripped her trembling shoulders. "The child she bore wasn't mine. Did you expect me to raise another man's daughter?"

Isabella's world crumbled.

Her nails dug deep into her palms.

"Then... where is Mother's real daughter?" Her voice turned hoarse. "Why did she—"

"Enough!" Vincent cut her off sharply. "This discussion ends here. Just remember—you'll always be my beloved daughter."

His eyes turned icy. "Your brother is indeed her biological child. With my campaign underway, this family must maintain appearances. Understood?"

Isabella nodded mechanically.

She dragged her heavy feet upstairs.

Behind her, Vincent's phone dial tone sounded. "Where are you? We need to talk..."

Meanwhile, Evelyn had just stepped through her front door.

Victoria rushed over excitedly. "Sis! Come quick—you won't believe what's happening!"
###Chapter 359

Evelyn watched Victoria's excited expression and leaned closer to the screen with curiosity.

The surveillance footage clearly showed Isabella and Vincent Langley's conversation.

The truth was shocking.

The child Eleanor Langley had given birth to years ago had been secretly switched by Vincent.

A meaningful smile curled Evelyn's lips. "Eleanor will soon learn this secret. The show is about to begin."

Given Eleanor's temperament, she would never let this go.

This was exactly the outcome Evelyn wanted.

As for the mystery of her own origins...

Evelyn's gaze darkened. Vincent wouldn't reveal the truth easily.

But she believed the answers would come to light eventually.

Victoria quickly sent a message to Nathan.

"Keep a close eye on Eleanor. Vincent is already on his way to see her."

With Eleanor's methods, she would undoubtedly force the whereabouts of her real daughter out of him.

Evelyn rubbed her temples. "Victoria, keep monitoring. I'm going upstairs to rest."

"The children aren't home. Get some proper rest," Victoria said with concern.

Evelyn nodded and headed upstairs.

Her nerves, strained all day, could finally relax for a moment.

Meanwhile, Eleanor sat in a speeding car.

The father-daughter conversation in the surveillance footage had left her in tears.

Twenty-five years of lies.

Twenty-five years of a misplaced life.

The child she had raised with her own hands belonged to someone else.

The cruelest irony—that child wasn't even Vincent's.

"Hahaha..." Eleanor laughed through her tears.

Her phone suddenly vibrated.

Vincent's caller ID flashed on the screen.

"I'm at the office," she said coldly before hanging up.

The car accelerated toward the company.

She would never return to that house again.

If Vincent dared to steal her child, he had only himself to blame for what came next.

Alexander Durand's secrets, the Valentines' skeletons...

She had plenty of ways to make that old fox talk.

...

In Adrian Valentine's office, the computer screen froze on Vincent and Isabella's conversation.

"Interesting." His slender fingers tapped the desk lightly.

Isabella wasn't Eleanor's biological daughter after all.

Then whose child was she?
###Chapter 360

Adrian Valentine swiftly answered the call.

Victor Ashcroft's voice came through the receiver: "President, Vincent Langley went to see Mrs. Langley. She's preparing to use her trump card against him."

Adrian's eyes turned icy.

Vincent had survived the underworld for decades. No woman could easily manipulate him.

"On my way. Keep watching," he ordered in a low voice before hanging up.

He strode out of his office without hesitation.

Inside Eleanor Langley's office...

She discreetly adjusted the hidden camera and poured Vincent a cup of tea.

The door lock clicked.

Vincent entered, carefully locking the door behind him. Every movement was calculated.

His gaze fell upon Eleanor's haggard face. The fragility in her once-perfect features softened his heart. He had genuinely loved this woman.

"Eleanor, I thought you were unwell these past few days. So you've learned the truth. Why didn't you come to me directly?"

Eleanor let out a cold laugh.

"Vincent, I only want to know one thing—where is my daughter?"

Tears and tantrums were pointless now.

Vincent smiled gently. He'd always valued her beauty and sharp business mind.

"Eleanor, I kept it from you because I feared you couldn't handle—"

"Enough!" She cut him off sharply. "No more games. Either tell me my daughter's whereabouts, or I'll reveal to Adrian how you killed his father."

This was her only bargaining chip.

Vincent wanted Isabella to marry into the Valentine family to control their empire. That was his fatal weakness.

His eyes darkened instantly. "Eleanor, you're complicit in Adrian's father's death. Exposing this helps neither of us. Are you certain?"

She closed her eyes in anguish, her chest heavy as if crushed by stone.

Vincent pressed his advantage: "What about our son? Have you considered his fate if you destroy everything?"

Her eyes flew open. In her grief, she'd forgotten Vincent would use their son against her.

"Vincent!" She spat his name through clenched teeth, hatred overflowing.

A glint of triumph flashed in his eyes. He'd dragged her into this conspiracy precisely for this moment.

Fortunately, one secret remained hidden. Otherwise, the situation would spiral beyond control.

He never left loose ends. What he concealed would stay buried.

"Eleanor, the truth is your daughter stopped breathing at birth. To spare you pain, I brought Isabella to you. Haven't you been happy all these years?"

"Without Isabella, you would have shattered long ago."

His feigned concern made Eleanor nauseous.

She refused to believe her daughter was dead. This had to be another lie.

But to find her child, she had to endure—for now.
###Chapter 361

She quickly wiped away her tears, forcing a smile onto her lips. "Vincent Langley, you're truly heartless. If our daughter was dead, you should have told me the truth. Why make me suffer like this?"

Her fingers trembled slightly, but she refused to let her composure crumble.

"You knew how much I loved her." Her voice was feather-light, yet every word cut deep.

The fact that the girl wasn't her biological daughter—she could pretend not to know.

If Vincent wanted to keep up this charade, she would play along.

Protecting her son and finding her real daughter—that was her mission now.

She had to hold onto the company, waiting for her daughter's return.

Vincent's gaze flickered as he took in her tear-streaked face. The delicate features, now etched with devastation, sent an unexpected pang through his chest.

He stepped forward and pulled her into his arms, kissing away the traces of tears.

So she truly believed him.

Now, isolated and vulnerable, she had no choice but to rely on him.

"Eleanor, I was afraid you couldn't handle it back then. Isabella's birth mother is gone. From now on, she is your real daughter."

Eleanor Langley leaned against his shoulder, a cold smirk hidden in the shadows. He couldn't raise her daughter—and she would never treat his spawn with kindness.

That venomous girl, Isabella—she would watch her downfall with her own eyes.

What she had raised with her own hands, she would destroy with them.

Vincent's crisis was averted.

Emotionally stirred, he tightened his grip on Eleanor, turning the office into the stage for a passionate display.

Humiliated, Eleanor dressed herself afterward. This endurance was all for her daughter.

Only this self-delusion could suppress the urge to vomit.

Vincent, thoroughly satisfied, kept her close, admiring the flush on her cheeks and the rise and fall of her chest. Her reactions had proven his prowess.

In high spirits, he tenderly adjusted her collar.

"Eleanor, I'll call Isabella. Let's have dinner together as a family. She's been devastated since learning the truth—comfort her."

At the mention of her son, a flicker of warmth passed through Eleanor's eyes.

"Isabella was raised by me. Of course, I'll treat her as my own. Call her. I'll order her favorite strawberry cake."

Her smile was flawless, as if she genuinely cared for Isabella.

Vincent was completely reassured. With their son in the picture, she wouldn’t dare act recklessly.

Once the cake was ordered, he guided her out of the company, arm around her waist.

In the car parked downstairs, Adrian Valentine removed his earpiece.

Silent fury thickened the air.

Victor Ashcroft watched him with aching sympathy. After two years, they had finally found the lead connecting Vincent Langley to the death of Adrian's father.

Just as they'd suspected.

Victor turned his head, taking in Adrian's striking features twisted with anguish. He stayed silent, giving him space to regain composure.

Outside, Vincent's car pulled away.

Victor narrowed his eyes. How many lives had this monster ruined?

His grip tightened on the steering wheel. Vincent Langley, your reckoning is coming.

The truth—what the Dowager wanted, what Adrian wanted, what he himself had been chasing—was finally within reach.

Adrian lowered his gaze, shoulders weighed down as if bearing an unbearable burden. Pain seeped from every pore.

After a long silence, his voice emerged hoarse. "Keep close surveillance on Mrs. Langley. If Vincent is a dead end, we'll target Isabella and Eleanor."

Victor nodded. "Understood. I'll arrange it immediately."

Hatred flashed in his eyes.

Vincent Langley, this time, you won't escape.

A cold smirk curled Victor's lips.

The car pulled away, heading toward the Valentine estate.
###Chapter 362

Adrian Valentine raised his hand to signal the driver. "Victor, head to the club."

Victor glanced at him through the rearview mirror. "Not returning to the office?"

"No." Adrian leaned back against the seat, eyes closed, exhaustion evident between his brows.

The black sedan turned into the parking lot of Royal Marquis Club. Adrian strode straight toward his reserved private room.

Just as he reached the door, something tugged at his pant leg.

Looking down, he saw a cherubic little girl beaming up at him. Her tiny front teeth peeked out as she blinked her large, sparkling eyes.

"Sophia?" Adrian crouched down, and the child immediately steadied herself against his knees to stand.

He scanned the surroundings. "Where's your mother?"

Sophia babbled and pointed at the private room door, her small fingers tightly gripping his index finger.

After a brief hesitation, Adrian took her soft little hand in his. The toddler wobbled as she walked, like an unsteady penguin.

He simply scooped her up instead. Sophia instantly wrapped her arms around his neck and planted a loud kiss on his cheek.

Adrian froze. The child in his arms giggled, her milky scent enveloping him.

"You like me that much?" His voice softened unconsciously.

Sophia suddenly squirmed to be let down, her gaze locked onto the cake on the coffee table.

The moment Adrian set her down, she lunged for the cake, grabbing a handful of frosting and shoving it into her mouth.

"Wait!" He hastily pulled out his phone to check if babies could eat frosting.

By the time the search results loaded, Sophia's face was already smeared with cream. Adrian sighed and reached for a tissue.

As his fingers brushed her delicate cheek, memories surged without warning. That night, he had held his wife close, whispering in her ear, "Let's have a daughter. One as beautiful as you."

The way she had blushed and nodded felt as vivid as yesterday.

A cold dollop of frosting suddenly smeared across his cheek. Sophia held up her cream-covered hand, grinning at him with pure delight.

Adrian stood motionless, his heart struck by an invisible force.
###Chapter 363

Felicia tiptoed and smeared a dollop of cream right on Adrian Valentine's face.

Adrian froze.

The little girl's face was covered in cream, grinning like a mischievous kitten.

"Little troublemaker, learning to ambush now?"

He pulled out a tissue and gently wiped her cheeks. For a fleeting moment, he thought of the dream that never came true. If things had been different... their child would've been about her age.

"Thank you, Felicia. Uncle is very happy."

Felicia scooped another spoonful of cream and held it to his lips. Almost instinctively, Adrian opened his mouth.

"Ah—"

The sweetness of the cake melted on his tongue. Felicia's eyes curved into crescents as she fed him another bite.

They finished the entire cake together. Felicia patted her round belly and pointed to the sofa.

Confused, Adrian carried her over.

She glanced between the sofa and him, then suddenly spread her arms wide.

"Want a hug?"

The little one clumsily climbed onto his lap, found a cozy spot, and fell asleep instantly.

Her thick lashes fluttered like tiny fans.

Adrian's breath hitched. This child... why did she resemble him?

Her eyes were just like hers, but her features held a faint trace of his own.

He shook his head with a self-deprecating smile. Since when did he deserve such fortune?

Soft, even breaths warmed his chest. The little girl slept soundly in his arms.

This feeling of being needed melted his heart completely.

Scarlett Orlando was having tea with the old master.

"Tristan should be napping by now." She picked up the fussy toddler. "Where's Felicia?"

"Asleep on the sofa."

Half an hour later, after putting Tristan to bed, Scarlett returned to find the sofa empty.

"Felicia?"

She searched every corner, her back drenched in cold sweat.

The old master's voice trembled over the phone. "What do you mean gone?"

"I mean—" Scarlett's throat tightened. "Felicia is missing!"

She locked the door and rushed outside, calling down the street, "Felicia Roland! If you don't come out right now, Mommy will be very angry!"

That clever little imp was probably hiding somewhere, giggling to herself.
###Chapter 364

Scarlett Orlando rushed toward the security room, her stilettos clicking urgently against the marble floor.

The surveillance footage clearly showed little Sophia pushing open the private room's door by herself.

The toddler wobbled down the hallway before being led into another room by a pair of slender hands.

Scarlett's pupils constricted.

Those were Adrian Valentine's hands.

She spun around and sprinted back, her heart pounding so violently it threatened to burst from her chest.

Knock knock knock—

The sharp rapping startled the sleeping child awake.

Rubbing her bleary eyes, Sophia snuggled deeper into her father's embrace upon recognizing him.

Adrian glanced down at his daughter's reaction, a flicker of amusement crossing his gaze.

When the door opened, Scarlett forced a smile onto her face.

"Mr. Valentine, thank you so much."

She reached for the child.

Adrian frowned. "This is how Gabrielle takes care of a child?"

Scarlett froze.

He thought Sophia was Gabrielle's daughter?

This misunderstanding was perfect.

"Gabrielle's been swamped with work, so I've been helping out," she smoothly lied, taking the child. "We really appreciate your help today."

Adrian stared at his now-empty arms, an inexplicable hollowness settling in his chest.

Scarlett hurried away with the toddler, a cold sweat dampening her back.

"My precious girl!"

Old Mr. Orlando trembled as he gathered his great-granddaughter into his arms.

"Scarlett, you reckless—"

"Grandpa, I'm sorry!" She clasped her hands pleadingly. "Please don't tell Evelyn!"

At the end of the hallway, Adrian paused mid-step.

Don't tell who?

He turned back, but only saw a closed door.

At the club entrance, Evelyn Roland passed by Adrian without a word.

Neither spoke.

As Evelyn stepped inside, Adrian glanced over his shoulder.

She looked well.

The realization eased some tension from his rigid posture.

In the parking lot, Adrian lit a cigarette.

Through the swirling smoke, murderous intent darkened his gaze.

Vincent Langley's days of comfort were numbered.
###Chapter 365

Victor stood by the club entrance, the cigarette between his fingers burned down to the filter. His dark eyes simmered with long-dormant fury as Adrian emerged from the doors.

Three years.

At last, he had clawed his way out of the abyss of grief.

"Back to the office, sir?" Victor crushed the cigarette and stepped forward.

Adrian adjusted his tailored suit, his sharp features schooled into impassivity. A glance at the neon-lit club, then his voice cut through the night air. "Investigate Christian's death."

Victor's pupils contracted.

The fire three years ago had consumed every shred of evidence.

"Understood." He swallowed his questions. "Let me drive you home first."

The black Maybach purred to life. Adrian lowered the window, letting the night wind rush in.

"Isabella has a man with a clover tattoo near her." His fingers tapped the leather seat. "He's Julian's assassin."

Victor's grip on the steering wheel tightened.

"Plant my father's photo in Vincent's study tonight."

A smirk curled Victor's lips. The reckoning was about to begin.

In the rearview mirror, Adrian watched the club recede. If he'd been wrong all along—how could he face the one buried deepest in his heart?

Evelyn pushed open the private dining room door. Under the crystal chandelier, Old Mr. Orlando sipped tea with evident pleasure.

"Grandfather Orlando." Her voice was clear as mountain spring.

The old man's eyes lit up. This Roland girl—master physician, lethal fighter—outshone any man.

"Come here, child." He beckoned with a smile. "Your grandfather's been boasting about you again."

Old Mr. Roland stroked his beard, smug.

Evelyn settled beside Scarlett. The moment her scent reached the sleeping toddler, tiny hands flailed toward her.

"Ungrateful little thing." Scarlett handed over the child with mock indignation. "Ditches her godmother the second Mommy appears."

Evelyn pinched her daughter's cream-smeared cheek. "Stole some cake again?"

"Tristan just fell asleep." Scarlett lowered her voice. "Called for you in his dreams."

Warmth flickered in Evelyn's eyes. Two more months, and both children would be running wild.

"Everything resolved?" Scarlett asked abruptly.

The memory of the escaped clover-tattooed man darkened Evelyn's gaze. "Mostly."

The elders exchanged glances and tactfully changed the subject. They knew—this woman had never needed coddling.
###Chapter 366

After Ethan Roland woke up, the group headed to Sterling Manor for dinner.

As night fell, Vincent Langley returned home with Isabella Langley and Eleanor Langley, who had reconciled.

Eleanor had ultimately chosen to return to the Langley family in her search for her biological daughter.

Remembering the Roscente family matter, Vincent summoned Dominic Lombardi for discussion.

Dominic pushed open the study door, his gaze landing on the photo of Jonathan Savigny on the desk.

He took a sharp step back, thinking his eyes were playing tricks on him.

"Chairman... Why is there a photo of Adrian Valentine's father on your desk?"

Vincent snapped, "Dominic, have you been drinking today? I—"

Mid-sentence, he finally noticed the photo on the desk.

"What is this?" Vincent's face darkened instantly.

Dominic picked up the photo with trembling hands. Jonathan's smiling eyes sent a chill down his spine.

"Investigate this immediately!" Vincent slammed the desk and stood up.

Dominic pulled up the security footage, which showed a nimble young man climbing in through the window.

"Useless! Is security just for show?" Vincent roared in fury.

Dominic lowered his voice. "Chairman, is this a warning from him?"

Vincent narrowed his eyes. "Keep a close watch on Adrian Valentine."

...

With Julian Roscente's matter settled, Evelyn Roland finally had a moment to breathe.

That day, she arranged to meet Nathan Aldridge at the club to discuss the herbal medicine business.

Just as she reached the entrance, she ran into Margaret Valentine and Eleanor Langley.

"Evelyn, I told you you couldn't win against me," Eleanor said haughtily.

Evelyn smirked. "Montreal is the capital of herbal medicine. We don’t have to source from Vienna."

Eleanor lifted her chin. "I could point you in the right direction."

"Oh?" Evelyn raised an eyebrow.
###Chapter 367

Margaret Valentine lifted her chin arrogantly. "If you kneel before the entire nation, apologize to Isabella, and cure her spinal stenosis, the Langley family might consider working with you."

Evelyn Roland met her gaze calmly.

This woman had despised her from their first meeting, constantly finding fault.

Was it simply because she had once been married to Adrian?

Even after the divorce, Margaret refused to let go.

Such obsession could only stem from either inherent malice—

Or some hidden agenda.

"Evelyn, you'd better think carefully about Eleanor's proposal." Isabella smirked, tilting her head. "Everyone knows you're losing this deal because of me. Nathan is watching. Even he will question your competence. Kneeling and apologizing would benefit us all."

Her back injury had worsened over the years. Excessive indulgence with Vincent Langley had left her body frail.

The pain couldn't be ignored any longer.

A dangerous glint flashed in Nathan Aldridge's eyes as he stared at Margaret. Did this woman truly think Evelyn would kneel to her? The audacity!

Eleanor pressed on, seeing Evelyn's silence. "Evelyn, the finest medicinal herbs in the Nine-City Alliance belong to the Langleys. No amount of money can buy them elsewhere. Inferior ingredients will ruin your cosmetics."

She turned to Nathan. "Mr. Aldridge, Sterling Manor values competence. Don't let someone's incompetence tarnish your reputation."

Though capable, Nathan was merely an executive. Poor performance could cost him his position.

Nathan scoffed. "Eleanor, my hiring decisions are none of your concern. As for your so-called 'solution,' keep it. The only one who should apologize is this shameless woman."

"Expecting help with that attitude? Dream on."

Margaret narrowed her eyes, stunned by his defiance.

Eleanor's face darkened. "Let's make a deal, Nathan. Fire her, and the Langleys will partner with Sterling Manor immediately."

Nathan didn't even glance at her. "Sterling Manor has no interest in the Langleys."

With that, he escorted Evelyn away, heading for their reserved private room.

Margaret and Eleanor trembled with rage but could only watch them leave.

Margaret glared at Evelyn's retreating figure, murderous intent swirling in her eyes.

This woman had to die.

Eleanor patted her arm. "Don't worry, Isabella. Nathan won't secure that contract."

Margaret smiled knowingly. The Langleys' influence in Vienna was absolute. "Thank you. Let me treat you to dinner tonight."

"Wonderful! But tomorrow is my father-in-law's seventieth birthday. You must help me prepare the banquet."

Margaret linked arms with her. "Of course. I'll be at the Imperial Palace Hotel first thing in the morning."

Eleanor beamed.

......

Inside the private room, the potential partners ultimately declined the deal, fearing the Langleys' retaliation.

Profit meant nothing if it cost them their business in Vienna.

Evelyn understood their predicament and remained silent.

As they exited, Nathan's fury erupted. "Do the Langleys truly believe they rule Vienna? How dare they oppose Sterling Manor!"

He was already considering extreme measures.

Evelyn gave him a sidelong glance. "Control yourself. Where's that market analysis I asked for?"

Nathan forwarded a document. "Here you go, Evelyn. Sent."
###Chapter 368

Evelyn's fingertip traced across her phone screen. The coordinates of the Lee family's medicinal herb plantation flashed on the display—located in Montreal.

"Montreal had perfect weather this year." A faint smile touched her lips. "The Lees' herb yield tripled."

Nathan flicked his lighter open and shut. The flame cast shadows across his sharp profile. "Are they trying to intimidate Sterling Manor?"

Evelyn scrolled through the latest production report, amusement glinting in her eyes. "Remember what I said? The market has its own temper."

Nathan's gaze brightened. Whenever his boss wore that expression, someone was about to get wrecked.

"What do you need me to do, boss?"

"Old Man Lee's birthday banquet is tomorrow night. Did the invitation arrive?"

Nathan nodded. "Sterling Manor is on the guest list."

Evelyn leaned closer, murmuring instructions. With each word, Nathan's excitement grew, his knuckles cracking audibly.

"Got it!"

......

Vincent Langley's study was thick with cigarette smoke. Bloodshot eyes stared at the computer screen.

Eleanor Langley pushed open the door, coughing at the acrid haze. "Still no breakthrough with the diamond situation?"

"Phoenix Group only took a fraction." Vincent stubbed out his cigarette. "This year's profits actually increased by a billion."

He tossed a photograph from his desk drawer. Eleanor's pupils contracted, her fingers trembling.

"Someone left this in my study." Vincent's laugh was icy. "Seems the cockroaches from back then aren't extinct yet."

Eleanor stared at the handsome face in the photo—the most radiant man she'd ever seen.

"No leads on the source?"

"Whoever's behind this is playing mind games." Vincent twisted his wedding ring. "Either it's a warning, or..."

Eleanor abruptly cut him off. "Evelyn has been spending time with Alexander Durand."

Her fist clenched around the anonymous paternity test that remained an unsolved mystery.

Vincent's eyes narrowed. "Speaking of which... how did you discover Isabella's true parentage?"
###Chapter 369

Eleanor Langley turned her phone screen toward Vincent Langley. "This paternity test was sent to my email anonymously. There's no lab signature."

The report was clearly visible on the screen.

Vincent's pupils contracted slightly. His fingers tapped the desk unconsciously.

Who was watching from the shadows?

He had always been the one in control. Now, he felt like prey being stalked.

This loss of control pricked at him like thorns.

Only that woman had known the truth back then. Even the medical staff hadn't realized the babies had been switched.

Dead men tell no tales.

"Don't fall for their divide-and-conquer tactic," he said, crushing his cigarette.

Eleanor lowered her gaze. "I didn't want to bring this up, but Isabella found the report. I just want our family to be stable."

Vincent's expression softened. "The Li family's birthday banquet is tonight. I hear they're competing with Sterling Manor. Let's go see the show."

"I'll prepare the gifts. Meet me at the office at five." She hesitated. "Will Isabella and Adrian be joining us?"

At the mention of Adrian Valentine, a cold glint flashed in her eyes.

That boy's indifference toward Isabella suggested he already suspected something.

If Isabella had stolen her daughter's life, then she wouldn't lift a finger to help.

Footsteps sounded upstairs. Isabella peered down curiously.

By the time Eleanor turned around, her face had regained its gentle smile.

CEO Office, Roland Group.

Evelyn Roland opened the surveillance footage Victoria Laurent had sent.

The contents of the photo in Vincent's hand were indistinguishable.

"Keep watching him," she said, closing her laptop.

Outside, dusk settled over the city.

The Imperial Palace Hotel glittered with lights.

Evelyn stepped out of the car in a black dress, pearl earrings swaying near her neck.

"Evelyn." Sebastian Orlando approached quickly, his gaze lingering on her delicate collarbone.

Nathan Aldridge popped up from the other side. "Doesn't my sister look stunning today?"

"Stay away from her," Sebastian frowned.

"Can't stop childhood friends," Nathan smirked triumphantly.

Evelyn watched them bicker, a faint smile touching her lips.

Under the chandelier's glow, their elongated shadows stretched across the banquet hall.
###Chapter 370

"Evelyn, let's go in." Sebastian Orlando's deep eyes brimmed with tenderness.

Evelyn Roland's lips curved slightly. The feeling of being protected warmed her heart. "Alright."

The trio walked side by side toward the banquet hall.

Madame Macmillan and her husband stood greeting guests at the entrance.

Her eyes flickered when she spotted Evelyn's group.

Why was Evelyn here?

"Mr. Aldridge, Mr. Orlando, thank you for coming." Madame Macmillan forced a smile. "Though I must ask—why does Mr. Aldridge always bring Miss Roland along? Surely Sterling Manor has other assistants?"

Her pointed glance at Nathan Aldridge carried unspoken implications.

Nathan smiled coolly. "The invitation clearly stated plus-ones. Who I choose to bring hardly requires your approval, Madame."

Madame Macmillan stood regal in her crimson cheongsam, hair elegantly coiled. Yet her gaze toward Evelyn dripped with disdain.

Evelyn merely nodded in silent acknowledgment.

"Of course Mr. Aldridge may bring whomever he pleases," Madame Macmillan sniffed. "But some freeloaders tarnish company reputations. I merely find it...unbecoming."

Beside her, Mr. Macmillan frowned.

Evelyn said nothing.

As if the Roland heiress needed free meals.

The warmth drained from Sebastian's eyes.

Nathan's smile turned razor-thin. "Can the Macmillans not afford an extra plate? My mistake—I assumed Mr. Macmillan headed this household. Since you've made your stance clear, we'll leave after presenting our gift."

Madame Macmillan blanched.

She simply loathed seeing this provincial girl at elite gatherings.

Who did Evelyn think she was?

Mr. Macmillan's gaze sharpened. "Was terminating our Sterling Manor contract your doing?"

He knew exactly why his father favored this daughter-in-law—she was his first love's child.

Madame Macmillan turned ashen.

Her husband didn't love her, but business always came first.

Nathan's words struck the Macmillan pride.

"Mr. Aldridge, let's discuss business matters later. Please, come inside." Mr. Macmillan offered an apologetic bow.

Nathan inclined his head, then paused mid-turn.

"Oh, Madame Macmillan—your loyalty to Mrs. Valentine is truly touching. Sacrificing family interests for her whims? Admirable devotion."

Madame Macmillan looked ready to collapse.

Evelyn watched Nathan's retreating back with quiet approval.

Mr. Macmillan glared at his wife. "You'd dare offend Sterling Manor's standing in the Nine-City Alliance? Do you think they need the Macmillans?"

Madame Macmillan lowered her head.

Hadn't she succeeded? What could Sterling Manor possibly do to them?
###Chapter 371

Adrian Valentine's group happened to witness the earlier commotion.

His deep-set eyes narrowed slightly.

The business world was a battlefield where the strong preyed on the weak.

Margaret Valentine using such tactics to crush competitors was hardly surprising.

Since Old Li had already refused to cooperate, why would Evelyn Roland humiliate herself further?

Isabella Langley clung to Adrian's arm, her lips curling in smug satisfaction.

With Aunt Margaret overseeing things, Evelyn truly had no room to maneuver.

The real spectacle awaited her inside the banquet hall.

Daniel Sherwood and Natalie Lowell would both be present.

The thought of Evelyn's impending public disgrace made Isabella tremble with excitement.

"Adrian, why is Evelyn being so stubborn?" She tilted her head with feigned innocence. "Should we cut off her escape routes like last year?"

Adrian turned, his gaze sharp as a blade.

Her venomous nature was gradually revealing itself.

What a waste of this custom-tailored suit—he'd have to discard it later.

"Think you're popular?" His voice dripped with ice.

Isabella stiffened. "What do you mean?"

"Mind your own business." He shook off her grip. "Don't forget about the video."

Her face drained of color.

That damned video!

She still hadn't uncovered who was behind it.

Warren Garten, that useless fool, couldn't even handle such a simple task.

Adrian strode into the banquet hall without a backward glance.

Vincent Langley frowned at his daughter. "Isabella, no trouble tonight."

"Dad!" She stamped her foot. "It's all that bitch Evelyn's fault—"

"Enough!" Vincent hissed. "Important people are here. Don't embarrass me."

His daughter's ruthlessness sometimes unsettled even him.

Isabella bit her lip.

She wouldn't dirty her own hands, of course.

The best strategy was to let others do the work for her.

Ideally, she'd make Adrian destroy Evelyn himself.

"Dad, I know my limits." Lifting her skirt, she hurried after Adrian. "Wait for me!"

Vincent shook his head wearily.

That girl would never let go of Adrian Valentine.
###Chapter 372

Eleanor Langley smiled faintly. "Adrian is exceptionally capable. Haven't you always admired him? Let's finalize the engagement by year-end. It'll put Isabella's mind at ease. The poor girl has been so anxious lately."

Vincent Langley's gaze flickered. His preferred son-in-law was Sebastian Cortez.

But it didn't matter. He had his own methods.

After all, what man could resist the twin temptations of beauty and power? Even the most principled were merely mortal.

After exchanging pleasantries with the host, the couple entered the banquet hall.

At six-thirty, the birthday celebration commenced.

The elderly Mr. Macmillan took the stage with his granddaughter's support. Dressed in a deep red traditional jacket, he radiated vitality and dignity.

Nathan Aldridge stood among the guests, a cold glint in his eyes. He wouldn't swallow the insult Mrs. Macmillan had publicly hurled at his boss.

Applause erupted as well-wishes filled the air.

When Nathan's turn came, he proclaimed, "May your fortune be as boundless as the ocean, and your years as enduring as the mountains."

Mr. Macmillan's brow furrowed slightly before he smiled. "Your thoughtfulness is appreciated, Mr. Aldridge. Please enjoy the festivities."

"You're too kind." Nathan's smile remained. "I'd hate to disrupt your celebration, but Mrs. Macmillan accused me of gatecrashing earlier. Since you personally issued the invitation, I find myself in an awkward position."

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

Mrs. Macmillan, who had just entered, paled.

Isabella's stomach clenched. Nathan's move had derailed her plans completely.

Her gaze involuntarily landed on Evelyn Roland. The woman stood quietly beside Nathan, yet shone like a rare pearl. Even Adrian's attention seemed drawn to her.

Mr. Macmillan's expression darkened. "My daughter-in-law speaks without thinking. I beg your indulgence."

"With all due respect," Nathan scanned the room, "that explanation doesn't satisfy me. Your family halted our contract negotiations over a single remark. Now I understand who truly holds power in the Macmillan household."

He pivoted sharply. "For the herbal medicine partnership, we're offering double market price. We need your decision tonight—our production line can't wait."

A calculating gleam entered Mr. Macmillan's eyes. The young man had come to make trouble.

"You exaggerate, Mr. Aldridge. Business requires mutual consent. Our limited inventory leaves us unable to accommodate."

The double offer had been Mr. Macmillan's original demand—one Nathan had previously refused. His sudden concession now raised suspicions. What game was he playing?
###Chapter 373

Nathan Aldridge's words were clearly meant to sabotage the evening's celebration.

He deliberately pushed Mrs. Lee into the spotlight, making everyone believe the Lee family was being run by the daughter-in-law.

The old patriarch's face darkened with anger, secretly relieved he hadn't partnered with Nathan.

"Mr. Aldridge, our hospitality tonight has been lacking," the patriarch said gravely. "But this is not the occasion for business discussions."

Nathan feigned remorse with a smile. "My apologies for being overeager. Our young mistress's new product is truly remarkable—a game-changer in the market."

Then his tone shifted. "Though I never expected Mrs. Lee would sever ties with Sterling Manor over a friend's petty grudge. Such recklessness is unlike you, sir. The Valentines are one family, the Lees another—"

"Mr. Aldridge!" Mrs. Lee interrupted, her face pale.

This accusation was too heavy for her to bear.

Nearby, Margaret Valentine sensed trouble, her brow furrowing.

Guests whispered among themselves.

"Did the Lees really oppose Sterling Manor? No matter how much the patriarch dotes on his daughter-in-law, he can't gamble with family business."

"It's all because of Mrs. Valentine. Her future daughter-in-law Isabella has issues with Evelyn. This is just settling scores."

"Mrs. Valentine spoils Isabella rotten. Last time she even sent Cassandra to the hospital. Cross anyone but Isabella."

Margaret froze mid-step.

If she admitted targeting Evelyn, it would confirm the rumors.

But staying silent would make Mrs. Lee's position even more precarious.

She was trapped.

"Mr. Aldridge, you misunderstand—" Mrs. Lee attempted to explain.

Nathan abruptly stood. "My gift has been delivered. I won't intrude further."

Mrs. Lee's eyes widened.

"I only have personal grievances with Evelyn."

"Evelyn represents Sterling Manor in negotiations," Nathan said meaningfully. "That makes her under my protection."

Mrs. Lee turned to Evelyn with a sneer. "Word is you've been seducing men everywhere since leaving Valentine Corp—"

"Mrs. Lee." Evelyn's voice cut like ice. "Is befriending the opposite sex seduction now? Where's your proof?"

"I—"

"We're strangers, yet you slander me publicly." Evelyn pulled out her phone. "Shall we let the police investigate who I've supposedly seduced?"

Mrs. Lee flushed with rage. "You backwater tramp dare threaten me with the police?"

The room erupted in gasps.
###Chapter 374

Old Mr. Lee's face turned ashen, his chest heaving violently. Never had he imagined his daughter-in-law would make such a scene in front of everyone.

"Shut your mouth!" Mr. Lee slammed the table and stood abruptly.

All eyes in the banquet hall swiveled toward the Lee family's table.

Mrs. Lee's face flushed and paled in rapid succession under her husband's public scolding. Her fingers clenched around the napkin, nails nearly piercing her palms.

Evelyn Roland set down her wine glass with calm precision. "No need to apologize, Mr. Lee."

Her gaze lifted to Mrs. Lee, lips curving in a faint, knowing smile. "After all, Mrs. Lee merely judges others by her own standards."

Mrs. Lee's pupils contracted sharply.

"What do you mean by that?" Mr. Lee's voice sharpened with suspicion.

Evelyn gave a slight shake of her head. "Just an observation."

A ripple of murmurs spread through the crowd.

Adrian Valentine stood among the guests, amusement flickering in his eyes. Still as sharp-tongued as ever.

"Let's go," Sebastian Orlando murmured.

The trio had barely reached the exit when a drunken figure staggered toward them.

"Evelyn!" Daniel Sherwood blocked their path, face flushed with alcohol. "You're the reason my wife left me!"

Evelyn regarded him coldly. "Natalie left because she finally saw you for who you are."

"Lies!" Daniel waved his arms wildly. "That video was fake!"

Evelyn retrieved her phone from her clutch. "Shall we play it for everyone now?"

In the shadows, Isabella Langley's expression darkened.

"Natalie!" Daniel suddenly shouted toward the crowd. "Don't listen to her nonsense!"

Natalie Lowell emerged from the guests, her gaze glacial. "Daniel, when will this charade end?"
###Chapter 375

Natalie Lowell pulled a crimson booklet from her purse and slapped it across Daniel Sherwood's face with a sharp crack.

"Going home? Take a good look at what this is."

The divorce certificate gleamed an offensive red under the chandelier lights.

Daniel's gaze dropped to the embossed gold lettering. His pupils constricted violently.

"Filed today." Natalie's lips curled in a frosty smile. "Check with the Civil Affairs Bureau if you don't believe me."

Her eyes raked over his ashen face.

"One more thing, Daniel. Who put you up to harassing Evelyn? Think carefully before answering."

His entire body trembled. Lips quivered soundlessly.

Whatever affection she'd once harbored had long curdled into revulsion. Natalie wanted this man excised from her life like a malignant tumor.

Evelyn Roland stood nearby, understanding flashing in her eyes.

So there was a puppeteer pulling strings.

Daniel stared at the divorce papers, bloodshot eyes bulging. He jerked his head up, voice ragged. "Impossible! I never signed anything!"

"Your adultery videos and domestic violence evidence could grant ten divorces." Natalie's laugh was brittle.

Color drained from his face.

Everything—the wealth, the status—gone.

He whirled toward Evelyn, features contorted. "This is all that bitch's fault!"

"Enough!" Natalie's voice cracked like a whip. "Even without Evelyn, I would've divorced you!"

She stepped closer, words dropping to a lethal whisper. "The moment you and your mother left me to die that night, you sealed your fate."

Daniel lunged.

A bodyguard intercepted him mid-motion, twisting both arms behind his back.

"I went through your phone." Natalie's tone turned arctic. "Anonymous texts coaching you how to frame Evelyn. Every single day."

He froze.

How did she know?

True, someone had been feeding him strategies to sabotage Evelyn. But today he'd deviated from their script—accusing Evelyn of seducing him would only push Natalie further away.

"Natalie, let me explain!" Daniel thrashed against the restraint. "Those messages meant nothing! I just wanted us—"

Her hand slashed through the air. "Throw him out."

The bodyguard dragged the howling man toward the exit.

Evelyn observed the spectacle with detached amusement. Such a pathetic clown wasn't worth her attention.

"My apologies for dragging you into this." Natalie's voice softened with genuine remorse.

Evelyn offered a faint smile. "No matter. I'll take my leave."

"Tomorrow." Natalie nodded. She couldn't depart yet—this was her brother's business function.

After Evelyn's departure, the banquet hall plunged into glacial silence.

Old Mr. Lowell's face darkened. Mrs. Lowell fidgeted nervously. At the crowd's center, Margaret Valentine stood as if standing on nails.
###Chapter 376

"Mrs. Valentine's methods are utterly despicable. Evelyn may be an orphan, but she's earned her place through hard work. How dare she harass her at every turn?"

"It's strange. She never showed this much concern for her own daughter, yet she dotes excessively on her future daughter-in-law."

"You don't understand. A daughter will marry into another family, but a daughter-in-law must serve her for life."

The noblewomen huddled together, whispering behind their fans.

Margaret Valentine shifted uncomfortably, her face alternating between pale and flushed.

Eleanor Langley observed her from across the room, brows furrowed.

That night, she had witnessed Margaret's icy indifference toward her own flesh and blood.

Yet she treated Isabella with such warmth—it defied reason.

Eleanor studied the similarities between Margaret and Isabella's features. Her pupils constricted. Could it be...?

She dared not finish the thought. If her suspicions were correct, then Isabella and Adrian...

Once doubt took root, the urge to uncover the truth became unbearable.

Meanwhile, Mrs. Li had become the evening's laughingstock.

Several ladies who disliked her deliberately raised their voices.

"The Li family must be very proud, snubbing Sterling Manor's invitation. Their new pharmaceutical factory is a golden opportunity."

"Exactly. Aligning with Sterling Manor guarantees influence in the Nine-City Alliance. What game is the Li family playing?"

"Tsk. As one of the Four Great Families, they must consider such ventures beneath them. Especially when the head of Sterling Manor is... a woman."

"What's wrong with a woman? The young mistress of Sterling Manor is a legend in the business world. How dare the Lis look down on her? Though with their monopoly over Montreal Herbal Market, no wonder they're so arrogant."

Those in the know understood the source of the Li family's confidence.

Mr. Li's expression darkened at the remarks.

Isabella's plan had failed. A shadow flickered in her eyes.

Vincent Langley remained unperturbed. His sole objective tonight was securing Old Mr. Li's support.

He shadowed the elderly man, laying on the charm with practiced ease.

Adrian had vanished without notice.

Even Isabella hadn't registered his absence.

Outside the Imperial Palace Hotel, Sebastian Orlando received another urgent call. He sighed, turning to Evelyn. "Scarlett..."

Evelyn smiled faintly. "Go ahead, Sebastian. Zachary's here."

Sebastian nodded at Zachary. "Keep her safe."

Zachary responded gravely, "You have my word."

As Sebastian drove off, Evelyn turned to Nathan. "Head back and rest. You've got the international conference tomorrow."

Nathan, still exhilarated from verbally dismantling their detractors, grinned. "Will do. Don't stay up too late, boss."

She clapped his shoulder. "You've had a stellar year. Consider your salary doubled."

Nathan's eyes lit up—his wedding fund was secured!

Evelyn slid into the car, instructing Zachary, "To Dominic's place."

Zachary blinked. "Boss, did you say... where?"
###Chapter 377

Evelyn tapped her fingers lightly on the desk. "Dominic has been with Vincent for fifteen years. Vincent leaves no loose ends, but Dominic always has a backup plan."

A cold glint flashed in her eyes.

Vincent was ruthless.

The diamond smuggling case had revealed his methods. Last year's election was sabotaged by her interference, and now he had set his sights on the Lee family.

With the Ashcrofts and the Roscentes already targeted, the Lees wouldn't escape unscathed.

Tonight's banquet was the perfect opportunity.

Zachary frowned. "Boss, Dominic is even more treacherous than Vincent. Do you know how many mistresses he keeps? Seven!"

Evelyn smirked. "Men are all the same."

Zachary protested. "I'm a rare exception!"

She shot him a warning look. "If you ever cheat, I'll be the first to end you."

The night was pitch black.

Dominic's villa stood just across the street from Vincent's.

Evelyn changed into her stealth suit and vaulted over the wall effortlessly.

Zachary had already disabled all surveillance.

The study door lock clicked open.

As the computer screen lit up, a scandalous photo appeared—Lydia Kalmie, a famous actress, half-naked in Dominic's arms.

Evelyn arched a brow. "The old man has interesting tastes."

"Very interesting."

A deep male voice spoke behind her.

Evelyn froze.

She turned to meet a pair of mocking eyes behind a mask.

Adrian.

She hadn't sensed his approach.

Footsteps suddenly echoed outside.

Evelyn snapped the laptop shut.

Adrian seized her wrist and yanked her toward the balcony.
###Chapter 378

Evelyn felt the man's powerful arm tighten around her waist, her back pressed against his scorching chest. The heavy curtains completely concealed their figures.

She instinctively tried to break free but froze at the sound of approaching footsteps outside.

His hot breath brushed against her ear.

Adrian rested his chin on her shoulder, his gaze lingering on the porcelain skin of her neck. The faint scent of jasmine filled his senses, setting his blood ablaze.

He closed his eyes, greedily savoring this fleeting intimacy.

Evelyn trembled under his scorching presence, every muscle in her body tense.

This bastard was too close.

Last night had been stormy, but tonight was eerily silent. The slightest misstep would give them away.

So why was he clinging to her like this?

"Dominic is insane, using this kind of photo as his lock screen," a woman's furious whisper cut through the silence. "How many secrets has that old man hidden? If this gets out, we're finished."

Evelyn and Adrian both held their breath.

They didn’t need to look to know—it was the woman from the screen.

"Damn it! What’s the password? His birthday?"

The frantic tapping of keys was followed by an exasperated sigh.

After failing to unlock it, hurried footsteps retreated.

The confined space grew thick with tension.

The moment the lock clicked, Evelyn drove her elbow hard into the man’s chest. "Let go!"

Adrian grunted in pain, but amusement flickered in his eyes. "You hit hard, Ms. Roland."

Evelyn stiffened.

He recognized her.

"Mr. Valentine, keep your distance," she said coldly, wrenching free. "If not for the circumstances, you’d be lying in the courtyard right now."

Adrian chuckled, following closely behind her.

"You’re investigating Dominic?"

"None of your business."

The computer screen lit up as Evelyn’s fingers flew across the keyboard. The encryption system crumbled before her.

Adrian’s gaze darkened.

"I didn’t know you had such skills, Ms. Roland."

His voice was rough, edged with anger.

Evelyn focused entirely on searching the files, running a global scan for the name "Alexander Durand."

No results.

Her fists clenched.

The air behind her turned icy.

After swiftly copying the critical data, she stood to leave.

Adrian yanked the power cord.

"Send me a copy," he said, waving his phone. "Resource sharing."

"Do it yourself." She didn’t look back as she pulled open the door.

Adrian wiped down all traces of their activity with a damp cloth. When he caught up, she was standing at the basement entrance.

"Don’t go," he said, seizing her wrist.
###Chapter 379

Evelyn turned to face him, her silver mask obscuring most of her face except for those cunning fox-like eyes.

He was clearly a regular here.

What secrets did this basement hold?

Her lips curved slightly. "Just curious. Or is there something down there you don't want me to see?"

Adrian's gaze locked onto her mischievous eyes, bright as stars in the night sky.

He stepped closer, his long fingers brushing the edge of her mask. "Look all you want. Just don't regret it later."

Just some adult toys. If she insisted, he'd see how long this little fox could keep her composure.

Evelyn arched a brow. She wasn't leaving empty-handed now.

Adrian sighed and followed as she descended.

The basement was more spacious than expected—a temperature-controlled pool on the left, a lounge area with a bathroom on the right.

Evelyn's ears burned when she saw the furnishings.

So Dominic had these tastes.

Adrian noticed her flushed earlobes and swallowed hard.

He leaned in, his breath warm against her ear. "Perfect for couples, don't you think?"

She shot him a cold glare. "Watch your words, Mr. Valentine. I'm single."

"Oh?" Amusement flickered in his eyes. "Then why not try me? Guaranteed satisfaction."

Evelyn scoffed.

Her gaze raked over him deliberately. "You look fit enough. Pity about the... stamina issue."

She turned to search for clues.

Tonight, she would find proof.

Adrian froze. "Stamina issue?"

Since when?

Ignoring him, she pulled on gloves and began inspecting the area.

The most obvious place was often the safest.

The giant padded mat in the center spoke for itself.

Finding nothing, she focused on the pool and bathroom.

The layout was suspiciously simple.

Adrian silently joined the search.

Twenty minutes later, they'd found nothing.

Evelyn frowned. A fox like Dominic would never leave himself unprotected.

After years serving Vincent Langley, he knew the price of betrayal better than anyone.

Her eyes scanned the walls—then stopped.

This wall was in the wrong place.

The main structure should be behind it.

She strode forward and knocked lightly.
###Chapter 380

Evelyn's fingers froze mid-air.

A faint echo resonated from within the wall.

Adrian moved swiftly to her side, catching the unusual sound.

This was his third time entering this basement.

The first two attempts had yielded nothing.

He lowered his voice. "There's a hidden layer."

Evelyn's eyes gleamed. "This wall was added later. Something's definitely concealed inside."

She glanced at her wristwatch.

Only thirty minutes remained before the banquet ended.

Her fingers tapped rapidly along the wall surface.

A hollow "thunk" sounded at one particular spot.

This section was noticeably wider than the surrounding walls.

She pressed firmly with her fingertips.

A concealed door sprang open.

Adrian's eyes flashed with admiration.

This woman never ceased to surprise him.

But the biometric lock inside made him frown. "It's the latest security model."

Evelyn's lips curved. "The mighty underworld king stumped by such a simple device?"

Adrian fell silent.

He suddenly remembered the lock's designer.

"You work at Sterling Manor. You should know this system."

Evelyn nodded. "The young mistress designed it personally. Of course I know it."

"You've met her?" Adrian couldn't hide his surprise.

Another nod.

Adrian leaned against the wall with interest. "Rumors say the young mistress never leaves her residence. Even company executives rarely see her. The gossip claims—"

"Claims what?" Evelyn's hands stilled.

"That she's housebound and... overweight."

Evelyn's fingers clenched.

Who dared spread such vile rumors?

"Our young mistress is Sterling Manor's brightest jewel." Her voice turned icy. "Those gossipmongers are just jealous."

Anger simmered as she added, "In this world, good deeds never outshine vicious tongues. The wicked only see darkness."

Adrian studied her furious profile.

Something felt both familiar and strange about her.

He chuckled softly. "Well said."

Evelyn gestured behind her. "Step back."

Adrian obediently retreated two paces.

But his gaze remained fixed on her.

Time was running out.

Evelyn took a deep breath, focusing entirely on the lock.

Two attempts failed.

Only one chance remained.

Adrian warned, "Another mistake will trigger the alarm."

She closed her eyes, steadying her breathing.

The numbers "3399" flashed through her mind—her computer password.

Eternal love...

The lock's display showed "92131".

Suddenly, inspiration struck.

Love for eternity.

Her fingers flew over the final digit.

"Beep—"

The lock disengaged with a click.
###Chapter 381

Adrian strode to her side, his gaze burning with intensity. "How did you crack it?"

A flicker of admiration flashed in his eyes.

This was his third attempt. The previous two had ended in failure.

Evelyn's lips curved into a sly smile.

Her slender fingers danced lightly across the safe's keypad.

Adrian's stare remained fixed on her face, but she seemed oblivious.

"It's a numeric cipher," she murmured. "921314—the Eternal Code. It means 'cherished for eternity.'"

"His computer password followed the same pattern."

She'd played similar number games during university.

Every digit held a special meaning.

Adrian fell silent.

Who knew the old fox had such sentimental tendencies?

The safe clicked open.

Neatly stacked documents inside made his breath hitch.

Evelyn turned, her expression unreadable. "Mr. Valentine, we're even now."

She was referring to the life debt from before.

Adrian's eyes darkened like spilled ink.

"Ms. Roland, saving a life warrants repayment with one's person."

Evelyn ignored him. "Focus on the files first."

They worked swiftly, photographing evidence.

An agreement was made to share the findings later.

Evelyn moved with precision, capturing the crucial list.

A flash drive slipped from one folder.

She immediately produced a data cable.

Her phone screen lit up as the transfer began.

Zachary's call interrupted abruptly.

Dominic had returned.

"Take the drive now," Evelyn decided instantly.

Adrian gripped her wrist. "Too risky."

His voice was low and edged with steel.

The data volume was too large for a quick transfer.

Evelyn prepared to grab it anyway.

Adrian tightened his hold. "Wait."

His gaze held depths that unsettled her.

Something about it felt strangely familiar.

While waiting, she flipped open a yellowed notebook.

Its pages were crammed with records from twenty years ago.
###Chapter 382

Evelyn's fingers trembled as the words in the notebook seared her vision like hot iron—June 9, 2003, Redwood Blvd accident. Adrian Valentine Sr. died on impact.

June 9.

The date stabbed her heart like a dagger.

It was Adrian's birthday. And the anniversary of his father's death.

"Vehicle explosion..." Evelyn's throat tightened, tears welling in her eyes. Adrian Valentine Sr. had burned alive.

Vincent Langley and Dominic Lombardi—those monsters!

Nathan's gaze swept across the documents, his pupils constricting abruptly. His knuckles turned white, the notebook cover creaking under his grip.

Killing intent crystallized into ice in his eyes.

The rustling of turning pages filled the silence.

"April 29. Lynch Bay execution of Alexander Durand. Body dumped at sea."

Evelyn snatched the notebook, the paper trembling violently in her hands. Alexander had left her only two months before...

She staggered back, her spine hitting the cold safe.

Nathan seized her wrist, fury simmering beneath his voice. "Evelyn!"

Tear tracks streaked the young woman's pale face. She quickly photographed two diary pages, sending Adrian Valentine Sr.'s section to Nathan.

"Forward it to Adrian." Her voice was feather-light. "Tell him the truth."

Nathan sneered. "Why don't you tell him yourself?"

"He won't believe me." A bitter smile twisted Evelyn's lips. "He never has."

Her fingers traced the torn edges. "There should be more before this..."

Footsteps suddenly echoed from upstairs.

They moved like lightning to restore the scene. The data transfer completion light glowed faintly.

"Now!" Nathan yanked her into a hidden compartment.

The cramped space was suffocating.

"Dominic, let's go upstairs~ It's creepy down here..." A woman's coquettish voice trembled.

"Don't want that $200k surgery fee?" Dominic's slimy voice oozed like a snake. "Serve me well, and I'll transfer it tomorrow."

"You're awful~ I just don't want to catch a cold..."

Lewd whispers mingled with rustling fabric.

Evelyn found herself pressed against Nathan's chest. His scorching breath against her ear made her body stiffen.

The obscene sounds amplified unbearably in the darkness.

Nathan's arm muscles tensed, his palm burning through her clothes onto her waist.

"Let go." Evelyn drove her elbow back sharply.

A muffled grunt sounded in the dark.
###Chapter 383

Evelyn gasped sharply as searing pain jolted her awake.

His obsidian eyes reflected her flushed cheeks, a smirk playing on his lips.

Her stomach churned with discomfort.

The obscene noises burned her eardrums.

Nathan tightened his grip, trapping her against his chest as he inhaled her floral scent.

She recited poetry silently, desperate for distraction.

The commotion behind them finally ceased.

Running water echoed from the bathroom.

"All show, no substance," Evelyn muttered coldly.

Nathan chuckled near her ear. "Seems your ex-husband outperformed him?"

Only then did she realize their proximity, heat rushing to her face.

She seized the chance to break free and stride toward the exit.

Nathan caught her wrist, steering her upstairs instead.

Outside the villa, his gaze burned into her. "Evelyn—"

"Don't forget our agreement, Mr. Roland." She cut him off.

He frowned. "Why would Adrian Valentine trust me?"

Her lips twisted. "His choice. I've done my part."

She didn't ask his purpose here.

Everyone in their world had secrets.

Nathan watched her car vanish into darkness before leaving.

Her phone buzzed upon arriving home.

Nathan had sent photographed documents.

She converted them swiftly, attaching her own evidence in reply.

In her bedroom, the USB drive whirred to life.

Moans erupted from the laptop. She snapped it shut.

"Mommy!" The twins burst in, propelled by Gabrielle.

Her screen lit up.

[Don't watch.]

She arched a brow.

[Filth. Destroy it.]

Understanding dawned.

[Didn't.]

[Never will.]

Evelyn rolled her eyes.

"Welcome back," Gabrielle beamed.

Tiny arms reached up. "Up..."

The baby's plea melted her resolve.
###Chapter 384

Ethan usually wore a serious expression, only breaking into sweet smiles when he saw his mother.

He glanced disdainfully at the places they'd visited that evening, his little lips puckered in displeasure.

"Gabrielle, watch them for a bit while I take a shower," Evelyn said, rubbing her sore neck.

Gabrielle carefully lifted the two toddlers from their car seats and set them on the bed to play.

"Go ahead. Zachary delivered Mrs. Valentine's sample yesterday. The DNA results are ready—you can check them after your shower."

Evelyn nodded and headed to the bathroom.

Under the warm spray, she studied her shoulder-length hair in the mirror, deciding it needed a trim tomorrow.

Half an hour later, she emerged, drying her damp hair.

Gabrielle handed her the thin report.

Evelyn flipped straight to the last page, her pupils contracting sharply.

The results confirmed her suspicions exactly.

"Shocking, isn't it?" Gabrielle asked, noting her stiff expression.

Evelyn nodded slowly. "I had my doubts, but I didn't expect it to be true."

"The wealthy play dangerous games," Gabrielle sighed.

Evelyn tucked the report away and sent Gabrielle off to rest.

Climbing into bed, she gazed at her two rosy-cheeked children, her features softening unconsciously.

"Felicia, did you bully your brother today?" She pulled her daughter close, tapping her tiny nose.

Felicia clapped her hands triumphantly, gloating over her mother's embrace to her brother.

Evelyn sighed at her daughter's antics—the little troublemaker loved teasing her brother.

Seeing Ethan's pitiful expression, she lifted him onto her lap to comfort him.

Slap!

Felicia suddenly struck her brother across the face.

Evelyn froze.

Ethan buried his face in his mother's chest, nuzzling her in distress.

Felicia, seeing his reaction, pouted. "No... hug!"

She hated when her brother stole their mother's attention.

"Felicia, you can't be this selfish," Evelyn chided, pinching her daughter's cheek. "I hold you just as often."

Felicia stubbornly burrowed into her mother's arms, tugging at her collar for milk.

Evelyn lay down, resigning herself to coaxing them to sleep.

Thirty minutes later, both children finally drifted off.

But sleep eluded Evelyn.

Adrian's father had died by Vincent Langley's hand.

And...

She turned over irritably, forcing herself not to think about the man who no longer mattered.

Moonlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting dappled shadows.

Adrian stood in his study, crumpling the documents in his grip.

"Adrian, grow into a man who takes responsibility. I failed someone who loved me deeply—don't repeat my mistakes."

His father's gentle voice echoed in his memory.

He would never forget that birthday, waiting by the window for his father to come home and cut the cake.

Instead, Margaret Valentine's hysterical screams had greeted him.

"It's your fault! If you hadn't kept calling to rush him home for your birthday, he wouldn't have crashed! Are you happy now?"

The sight of her smashing the cake, her face twisted in rage, remained a nightmare he couldn't escape.
###Chapter 385

On the morning of his fifth birthday, he leaned against the windowsill, counting the blooming roses in the garden.

His father had promised over the phone to bring home the latest Transformer toy.

Excitement stole his appetite for breakfast.

Then the screech of brakes shattered the afternoon silence.

The antiseptic smell of the hospital hallway still haunted his memories.

Margaret Valentine's sharp nails dug into his tender arm.

The words "jinx" burned into his heart like a branding iron.

From that day on, he never called her "Mother" again.

Gregory Valentine monopolized all their mother's affection.

He and his sister grew like weeds, sheltered only by their grandmother's protection.

The detached "Mrs. Valentine" he used as an adult earned him nothing but her icy nod.

On her deathbed, his grandmother clutched his trembling hand. "Your father's accident... was murder."

Yellowed investigation notes piled up in his study night after night.

Vincent Langley's name kept resurfacing in key leads.

Moonlight now spilled through the floor-to-ceiling windows.

Adrian Valentine's knuckles turned white as he gripped the newly discovered evidence.

His father's drunken apology suddenly made sense.

"They'll pay in blood."

The whispered vow hung in the empty room.

The curtains billowed and fell in the night breeze.

——

Dawn filtered through the sheer curtains as Evelyn Roland struggled against a nightmare.

A shrill ringtone shredded the last remnants of sleep.

"This better be life-or-death."

Nathan Aldridge flinched at her tone.

"The Montreal Herbal Market just crashed!"

Evelyn forced her heavy eyelids open.

Outside, shadows of plane trees swayed in the morning light.

"The Langley family?"

"Prices hit the limit down at opening." Nathan's voice shook. "Every herbal dealer in Northam is begging for partnerships now."

Her fingers absently traced the quilt's edge.

The storm had arrived sooner than she'd anticipated.

"Proceed with the planned acquisitions."

Her own voice sounded eerily calm.

"The procurement team's already en route to Montreal." Nathan hesitated. "Maybe you should rest a bit longer?"

When the call ended,

the bedside clock read 06:17.
###Chapter 386

Dawn had barely broken when the herbal market erupted into chaos.

Prices of whitening ingredients like bletilla striata, pearl powder, and ginseng plummeted overnight.

A flood of herbs from Montreal saturated the market. Sterling Manor opened its supply channels, causing prices to halve instantly.

The oversupply crisis crushed the already struggling market.

The Macmillan family's warehouses held thousands of tons of herbs—their golden ticket for year-end profits. As Vienna's leading herbal supplier, they'd always reaped fortunes during winter.

But by morning, every merchant who'd placed premium orders demanded refunds.

Macmillan Group's stock nosedived.

Margaret Valentine and Eleanor Macmillan became trending targets of shareholders' fury.

Inside the Macmillan estate...

Harrison Macmillan nearly fainted reading the news.

The elder Macmillan had just woken when his son Harrison Jr.'s enraged shouts echoed from the dining room.

Eleanor remained oblivious, still plotting revenge against Evelyn.

"Father, Evelyn and Nathan's arrogance last night was unacceptable. Sterling Manor means nothing—we'll simply cut off their supply!"

The patriarch massaged his temples.

The memory of that doubled-price contract made his chest tighten.

Harrison Jr. slammed his palms on the table.

"While Evelyn hosted tea exhibitions and gifted million-dollar Da Hong Pao to secure partnerships?"

"Now Montreal's herbs are everywhere, and our stockpile is worthless!"

"Our shares will hit limit-down today—all thanks to you!"

His glare turned icy.

"Grandmother knew your first love's family had petty minds. Now your life's work is destroyed by this daughter-in-law."

The door crashed shut behind him.

Eleanor and the elder Macmillan exchanged stunned looks.

"Father... what bankruptcy is he talking about?"
###Chapter 387

The teacup slipped from Elder Li's grasp and shattered on the floor.

News of the Montreal Herbal Market's massive supply release tightened his chest.

His steward stumbled into the study, breathless. "Master, disaster strikes!"

Elder Li's brow furrowed.

The Li Corporation had weathered centuries of storms. What could mere price fluctuations do to them?

"Compose yourself!" he snapped.

The steward paled. "This is different! Our stock prices have plummeted. Montreal's herbs match our quality but cost only a third of ours!"

Elder Li shot to his feet.

"Our stockpiled herbs are now worthless!" The steward's voice trembled. "Suppliers are canceling orders and flocking to Montreal instead!"

Elder Li staggered backward.

Madam Li steadied him, lips quivering. "How did this happen?"

The steward wiped his brow. "Sterling Manor extended an olive branch first. After we refused, they turned to Montreal. Their bulk purchases created a surplus..."

"The perishable herbs have hit rock-bottom prices!"

Elder Li's legs gave out as he collapsed into his armchair.

Their warehouses overflowed with now-worthless inventory.

Plummeting stocks. Canceled contracts.

A century-old empire teetered on the brink.

"Father!" Madam Li stamped her foot in distress.

Elder Li recalled Nathan Aldridge's generous offer yesterday. Bitter regret twisted his gut.

Worse still, last night's public spectacle had broadcast their rift with Sterling Manor to the world.

"Master!" The steward gasped. "Notoginseng prices crashed from hundreds to mere dozens!"

Elder Li's face turned ashen.

Their stockpiled notoginseng had cost triple the current market rate.

"Ruined..." he whispered.

A legacy built over generations crumbled in a day.

The steward cried out again. "Sterling Manor purchased thirty thousand pounds in three hours! All shipped to Nine-City Alliance Pharmaceuticals!"

Darkness swallowed Elder Li's vision.
###Chapter 388

Old Mr. Macmillan lay on the hospital bed, his face as pale as parchment.

The butler's words echoed relentlessly in his mind.

Had they chosen to partner with Sterling Manor, the Macmillan family could have earned billions.

Now they'd not only missed the opportunity but were also mired in scandal.

Mrs. Macmillan knelt by the bedside, sobbing hysterically.

She knew full well—if the patriarch fell, her position in the family would crumble.

Last night's grand banquet had become the laughingstock of the entire business world.

Media outlets were plastered with reports of the Macmillan disgrace.

"That wretched Evelyn Roland!" Mrs. Macmillan spat through gritted teeth.

The butler calmly dialed emergency services.

The wail of sirens pierced the sky.

In Vincent Langley's office, red alerts flashed across the computer screen.

"Continue the acquisitions. Buy up everything available," he ordered into the phone.

His assistant hesitated. "Sir, what about Macmillan's Northern Division—"

"Leave that. Secure the core assets first."

At the same moment, Adrian Valentine studied stock market charts.

Nathan Aldridge's call came through.

"President Valentine, someone's competing for Northern Division shares."

Adrian's gaze turned icy. "Identify them."

"It's Horizon Tech."

Adrian's long fingers tapped the desk.

He'd always suspected Vincent Langley was more than he seemed.

"Expedite the process. We must secure Northern Division."

The call ended just as his office door burst open.

Mrs. Macmillan stormed in, fury radiating from her.

Victor Ashcroft followed helplessly. "Sir, I couldn't stop her—"

Adrian lifted his eyes, their chill palpable.

Mrs. Macmillan slammed her palms on the desk.

"Adrian Valentine! You must save the Macmillan family!"

Her shrill voice filled the room.

"If not for helping your mother, we wouldn't be in this mess!"

Adrian leaned back leisurely in his chair.

"Mind your tone, Mrs. Macmillan."
###Chapter 389

Adrian Valentine watched Mrs. Langley with icy disdain, recalling how she had humiliated Evelyn. His gaze darkened.

He rose slowly, a mocking smile playing on his lips.

"Mrs. Langley, I'm considering acquiring the Langley Group. The offer will be... fair."

Her face paled, fingers trembling around her phone.

"Have you lost your mind?"

She couldn't believe his audacity.

The call to Margaret Valentine went unanswered—her lifeline now useless.

Mrs. Langley's knuckles whitened.

The woman who had once schemed beside her now avoided her like the plague.

"After decades of friendship with your mother, this is how you repay me?"

Adrian scoffed, his eyes sharp as blades.

"Do you truly not understand the Langley Group's current position?"

He stepped closer, voice glacial.

"In three days, you'll learn what it means to be abandoned by all."

Mrs. Langley staggered back, finally grasping the gravity of her situation.

She still didn't realize—she was merely Margaret's pawn.

Adrian's motive was simple: justice for his wife.

At the Valentine mansion, Margaret trembled as she opened an envelope.

The contents made her legs give way, collapsing onto the sofa.

"How...?"

The paternity test struck her like a bomb.

Simultaneously, Eleanor Langley received identical documents.

Her nails dug into her palms as she stared at the results.

"Vincent Langley, you monster!"

Tears blurred her vision. Now she understood why Isabella was favored.

It had all been a lie.

In Regal Heights, Evelyn silently watched the surveillance feed.

Victoria Laurent frowned in confusion.

"Evelyn, these connections are... convoluted."

Evelyn shook her head, gaze profound.

"The daughter Eleanor seeks might be closer than we think."
###Chapter 390

Evelyn tapped her fingers lightly on the desk, brows slightly furrowed. "Could it be they don't know about their relationship?"

Victoria immediately shook her head. "Impossible. Eleanor clearly knows Isabella is her daughter. Otherwise, why would she defend Isabella at every turn against you?"

Evelyn's pupils constricted sharply, her voice tense. "Are you saying Eleanor knowingly let siblings be together?"

The question had haunted her all night.

Victoria sighed. "Unless your suspicion is correct—they're both unaware."

Evelyn fell into deep thought.

She had already delivered the two paternity test results to Eleanor and Margaret today. Now she waited for their reactions.

"No news from Margaret yet?"

Victoria glanced at her phone. "Zachary's keeping watch. Nothing so far."

Something felt off to Evelyn. Had Vincent and Margaret been entangled in their youth?

The thought of Adrian's father's mysterious death stirred more questions in her mind.

But the past was like smoke—impossible to grasp.

"Notify me immediately if there's any update." Evelyn stood. "Scarlett invited me shopping."

Victoria gave her a concerned look. "Don't waste tears on that scoundrel. Let them destroy each other."

A flicker passed through Evelyn's eyes. "I stopped caring long ago."

Before leaving, she visited the nursery to feed her twins.

Outside Scarlett's studio building, Evelyn dialed her friend. "I'm here. Come down."

A groan came through the phone. "Grace, my period just started. Bring me some pads, please?"

Evelyn exhaled in exasperation.

She turned into the nearby convenience store, heading straight for the feminine products aisle.

As she scanned her items at checkout, a familiar icy presence approached.

Her fingers stilled. From the corner of her eye, she saw Adrian buying bottled water at the next register.

She averted her gaze instantly, paid, and hurried out.

Adrian watched her retreating figure, frustration tightening his jaw. He loosened his tie irritably.

Now she couldn't even bear to look at him?

Evelyn quickened her pace toward the elevators. Only when certain Adrian hadn't followed did she relax slightly.

Memories of him with Isabella churned her stomach.

The elevator doors began closing—until a slender, masculine hand shot between them.

The doors slid open once more.
###Chapter 391

The elevator doors slid shut.

Evelyn's gaze locked onto those familiar slender fingers. Her pupils contracted sharply.

When the doors reopened, Adrian's imposing figure filled the doorway. His tailored suit and immaculate tie radiated an aura of icy detachment.

She instinctively shifted toward the corner.

Her nails dug into her palms as she stared at the floor.

"Running away?" Adrian's deep voice echoed in the confined space. "You weren't so timid before."

Evelyn's head snapped up, disgust flashing in her eyes. "You misunderstand, Mr. Valentine. I simply find your presence nauseating."

"Nauseating?" His laugh was cold. "You didn't seem sickened when you were flirting with other men behind my back."

Her chest rose and fell rapidly. She'd explained this countless times—now it just felt absurd.

The air grew thick with tension.

Adrian's eyes dropped to her shopping bag. A mocking smirk appeared. "Even changed your sanitary pad brand?"

Her knuckles whitened around the bag. "We've been divorced for two years, Adrian."

"And?"

"And I want you to stay away." Each word was deliberate. "The sight of you makes me physically ill."

His gaze turned glacial. "Then why don't you leave Vienna?"

The words stabbed like a blade. Evelyn drew a steadying breath. "You're the one who should disappear. I'm staying—to marry, have children, and live well."

"Marry?" He stepped closer abruptly. "Who would dare take you?"

The doors pinged open.

"Evelyn!" Sebastian stood outside with a warm smile. "I'm here for our shopping trip."

The ice in her expression melted instantly. "Sebastian."

His eyes flickered to Adrian, brows furrowing. He naturally took the bag from her hands. "Scarlett's waiting in the car."

Adrian watched their retreating figures, his expression darkening.
###Chapter 392

Adrian Valentine met his challenging gaze with a cold smirk.

Was Sebastian Orlando the man Evelyn Roland wanted to marry?

He'd investigated this man thoroughly.

Not an ordinary opponent.

His looks rivaled Adrian's own.

The power behind him was unfathomable.

"Fine. I could use someone to carry my bags." Evelyn walked out without glancing back.

Adrian pressed the elevator button, his gaze sharp as a blade on her retreating figure.

Sebastian smoothly placed a hand near Evelyn's waist.

Adrian's pupils constricted, forced to watch the elevator doors close between them.

Once out of Adrian's sight, Sebastian immediately withdrew his hand.

"Was he bothering you again?" His voice was low.

Evelyn shook her head. "Just ran into him at the supermarket."

Sebastian knew better but chose not to press.

A man like Adrian didn't deserve to stand beside her.

They'd just entered Scarlett Orlando's studio when Evelyn discreetly passed her a sanitary pad.

Scarlett emerged from the bathroom clutching her stomach. "Sebastian, take Evelyn shopping. I'm not feeling well."

Sebastian stiffened.

Couldn't this girl watch her words?

Evelyn's ears turned pink.

Scarlett successfully pushed them out the door.

The elevator opened to reveal Adrian rushing toward them.

Victor Ashcroft looked frantic. "Sir, Isabella Langley's been kidnapped!"

Adrian's brow furrowed. "Mobilize everyone. Find her immediately!"

His gaze brushed past Evelyn without recognition as he strode by.

A sharp pain pierced Evelyn's heart.

After two years, he could still panic for that woman.

Victor deliberately raised his voice. "Madam, the kidnappers have contacted Mr. Langley."

Evelyn's eyes gleamed.

Both Mrs. Langley and Mrs. Valentine knew the truth now.

This dog-eat-dog drama would be entertaining to watch.
###Chapter 393

Sebastian Orlando noticed Evelyn Roland's distracted gaze, his lips curving into a mysterious smile. "Evelyn, what's on your mind?"

She blinked back to reality, her eyes crinkling with warmth. "Sebastian, I was just thinking about what to buy while shopping later."

Truthfully, she lacked nothing. Sterling Manor had exclusive designers crafting custom outfits for her, with each season's collection handled by top-tier fashion houses.

Occasionally, she designed a few pieces herself—each one a unique masterpiece.

"I know you have everything." Sebastian's gaze softened with affection. "Now that the herb issue is resolved, what's next?"

This brilliant girl mastered everything with astonishing speed. But only he knew the relentless effort behind her achievements.

He felt unworthy in comparison.

"Come on, I'll take you somewhere." He took her hand, leading her toward the parking lot.

Evelyn scrolled through her phone. The news of Isabella Langley's kidnapping had already topped the trending list.

Comments flooded in:
～Our goddess must be safe! Mr. Valentine, go save her!
～Who dares lay a finger on our Isabella? What are the police doing?
～Oh my god! She just got nominated for Best Actress! "Phoenix Feather" made her a star overnight!

Fans eagerly anticipated a heroic rescue.

Evelyn smirked. How disappointed would they be when Isabella's true colors were exposed?

Just outside the company gates, they spotted Margaret Valentine blocking Adrian Valentine's path.

"Adrian! Isabella is your fiancée—you must save her!" Margaret's voice trembled with hysteria.

The moment she learned of her daughter's abduction, panic consumed her. The paternity test arrived that morning, and now this—it had to be the same culprit.

But she couldn't reveal the truth to Adrian. Isabella had to marry into the Valentine family!

Adrian's gaze turned glacial. "When Cassandra was kidnapped, you didn't seem nearly as concerned."

His own sister's peril had barely registered with Margaret. Yet now, she was frantic over an adopted daughter.

Margaret faltered, then snapped, "This is different! Isabella is your future wife! The whole world is watching!"

"The kidnappers haven't contacted me." His voice was arctic. "How exactly should I rescue her?"

Margaret's composure shattered. "Adrian Valentine! Don't forget how your father died! You're the murderer! Now you want Isabella dead too?"

"Why couldn't it have been you? These years have been hell! Finally, I have a perfect daughter-in-law, and you're determined to ruin it!"

Adrian's knuckles whitened.

He stared at her, his voice deadly quiet. "Did I really kill my father?"
###Chapter 394

Margaret Valentine's accusation froze the air.

"Wasn't it you who caused your father's death?" Her shrill voice shattered the silence. "You'll never understand the pain of losing a husband!"

Adrian Valentine's knuckles turned white from clenching.

Victor Ashcroft swiftly stepped between them. "Sir, Chairman Langley is on the line. The kidnappers haven't made any demands yet."

Adrian gave a cold nod.

Evelyn Roland felt an invisible hand squeeze her heart.

She noticed Adrian's unusually harsh tone toward Margaret. In three years of marriage, she'd never heard him call her "Mom."

That five-year-old boy had only wanted a birthday surprise.

Now he carried the burden of patricide.

Margaret's affair with Vincent Langley had long been an open secret.

Evelyn's phone vibrated.

[Sis, Margaret always knew Isabella was her biological daughter.]

The message made Evelyn's pupils constrict.

If Adrian wasn't her real son...

"Evelyn!" Margaret's screech cut through her thoughts.

Margaret staggered forward, hatred burning in her eyes.

Her raised hand never made contact. Sebastian Orlando kicked her squarely in the stomach.

Margaret collapsed to the floor with a pained groan.
###Chapter 395

Sebastian Orlando looked down at Margaret Valentine with icy disdain. "Who did you plan to hit, you vile hag?"

Margaret's wrist throbbed with pain, but his chilling glare silenced her cries.

She turned her sneer toward Evelyn Roland instead. "You little tramp. Bringing your lover to fight your battles? Do you really think the Orlandos would want trash like you?"

Evelyn traced her fingers lightly over her wristwatch. "How's your back holding up, Margaret? Must be exhausting servicing Vincent Langley every night."

Margaret's pupils constricted.

How did she know about Vincent?

"Lies!" Margaret's voice trembled. "The Macmillans aren't done with you yet. Harrison will make you pay!"

"You should worry about yourself." Evelyn smiled faintly. "After all, what happened back then—"

Margaret lunged, but Sebastian kicked her away.

"Touch her again," he ground his heel into her outstretched hand, "and I'll make you beg for death. I'm sure the tabloids would love to expose the scandals of Mrs. Langley."

Adrian Valentine watched coldly before suddenly gripping his mother's wrist. "What's your connection to Vincent Langley?"

"Nonsense!" Margaret shook him off. "Go save Isabella!"

In the parking lot, Evelyn clenched the steering wheel.

"Sebastian, Margaret's reaction was too extreme."

He fastened her seatbelt, his fingers brushing a stray lock of hair behind her ear. "Isabella being kidnapped works in our favor."

His voice softened. "Today, your only concern is picking out a tie for me."

Adrian's phone rang as his car sped through the streets. His grandmother's voice was sharp. "Did your mother provoke the Macmillans again?"

Meanwhile, Margaret crouched behind a tree, dialing Vincent's number. "Evelyn Roland has to die."

The sound of shattering porcelain came through the line. "She's always guarded..."

"Then we target Sebastian." Margaret's lips twisted into a grotesque smile as she watched their car disappear. "I hear Mrs. Orlando despises actresses."

###Chapter 396

Adrian Valentine's lips curled into a sardonic smile. "Grandmother's intelligence network is truly impressive."

"The news has spread everywhere. How could I not know? Your mother has finally met her downfall after all these years of arrogance. She's only been able to act so high and mighty because she bore two sons and that useless daughter."

"I've pondered this for years. Gregory doesn't resemble your father at all. Cassandra is far more beautiful than your mother ever was."

"You're the only one who truly takes after your father. Adrian, I'm telling you this because you've proven yourself capable."

A flicker of understanding passed through Adrian's eyes. The implication was crystal clear now.

He'd long suspected Cassandra wasn't Margaret's biological daughter.

He'd chosen silence. That woman was venomous and selfish.

The irony? She remained oblivious to the truth.

Margaret had deliberately raised her to be incompetent.

Beatrice Valentine's smile deepened. "I consulted a fortune teller. This time, I will have justice for my son."

Warmth spread through Adrian's chest. His grandmother had carried this burden alone for so long. "Let me handle this, Grandmother."

"No." Her tone turned razor-sharp.

"You can't do it, Adrian. You've fallen for Vincent Langley's daughter. Your emotions will cloud your judgment. Vincent worked with your father. I've been waiting for you to uncover the truth."

"Choose carefully. If you insist on marrying Isabella, I'll avenge your father myself. That's why I summoned you today."

Adrian's breath hitched. "You've been having me followed?"

"Hmph! My only purpose in life is to uncover how my son died. He was my pride and joy. I've always suspected Vincent, but he covers his tracks too well."

"That's why I didn't stop you from pursuing Isabella and driving Evelyn away. You never deserved someone as exceptional as her anyway."

Adrian remained silent.

"If you knew, why didn't you—"

"Warn you sooner?"

Ice glinted in Adrian's eyes.

"Exactly."

Beatrice gave a cold laugh. "Why would I interfere with the perfect opportunity to get close to Vincent? Making you suspect him, encouraging you to pursue Isabella—it was all part of my plan."

"Don't blame me, Adrian. Avenging your father gives my life meaning. I've known about Vincent and your mother's affair for years. They're the ones who killed your father."

"What?" Adrian's pupils constricted violently.

Now he understood why his grandmother had always claimed a Valentine was responsible, yet refused to name names.

She'd known all along.

Last year when Margaret framed Evelyn, Beatrice had seized the chance to transfer shares to him.

Every move had been calculated.

Adrian felt no resentment—only aching sorrow for his grandmother's decades of silent suffering.

"Your mother and Vincent were lovers in their youth. Our maid Martha witnessed their affair. Vincent had her killed."

"You were just a child then. I had to bide my time until you were old enough to seek justice for Martha."

"Even when your mother called you a curse, accused you of murder, I had to stand by. At least alive, you'd have your chance at vengeance."

"Choose wisely, Adrian. If you pick love, I'll deal with Vincent myself. Your hands need not be stained."

"Grandmother, I want to avenge Father myself."

His answer satisfied her.

"Good. Should you fail, I'll step in."

Even in her advanced years, Beatrice Valentine retained the ruthless decisiveness that had made her a formidable businesswoman in her prime.
###Chapter 397

Adrian's fingers went slack. His phone slipped onto the couch.

A bone-chilling cold seeped through his body as if he'd plunged into an ice cellar.

Grandmother had known the truth all along?

She'd simply set a trap, letting him uncover it himself.

Christian's incident, Isabella's rescue—were they all part of a scheme orchestrated by Margaret and Vincent?

Adrian's chest constricted with sudden suffocation.

The phone rang again. An unknown number.

"Hello?" He answered instantly.

"Adrian Valentine. Want to save Isabella? Bring your mother. Hudson Docks. One hour, or I send her to the afterlife."

Adrian's pupils contracted. "What does Isabella have to do with my mother?"

"Save your breath. No show in an hour means a corpse delivery."

"Harm one hair on her head, and I'll make you beg for death."

"Such passion? Wait till you see the real surprise."

The line went dead.

Adrian turned to Victor. "Fetch Margaret."

He dialed his mother's number, instructing her to wait without mentioning Isabella.

Margaret stood outside the corporate building, lips curling in triumph.

Her rebellious son was finally crawling back to apologize.

The wolf cub she'd raised would never escape her grasp.

If not for his business genius, she'd have—

Venom flashed in her eyes.

Who had taken Isabella?

As she pondered, Vincent and Eleanor appeared.

Margaret's expression darkened.

Their daughter was kidnapped, yet they wandered about leisurely?

Eleanor's eyes were red-rimmed. "Where's Adrian? Is he abandoning Isabella?"

Vincent studied Margaret.

He'd suspected his wife arranged the kidnapping, but her distress seemed genuine.

With the Academy Awards approaching, they couldn't afford to lose this pawn.

Margaret sneered. "You failed to guard your daughter, yet blame me?"

Her gaze burned at the sight of the couple standing side by side.

How dare these traitors show their faces?
###Chapter 398

Vincent Langley's face darkened as his gaze shifted between the two.

"Enough! This isn't the time for infighting. Finding Isabella is our priority."

He turned to his wife, noting the same anxiety in her expression. His suspicion deepened. Was she behind this? Only Isabella's safe return would reveal the truth.

A screech of brakes shattered the silence.

Adrian Valentine rolled down the car window, his voice icy. "Get in."

The three climbed into the vehicle, each lost in their own thoughts.

Vincent clenched his fists, his knuckles turning white. "Adrian, do you have news about Isabella?"

Adrian's lips curved into a cold smile. "Hudson Docks."

"They didn't contact you?"

Vincent's temple throbbed. "No."

He swore the kidnappers would pay.

Eleanor Langley calculated silently. She had considered abduction but ultimately lacked the nerve. She feared what Vincent might do to his own flesh and blood.

Victor Ashcroft watched Vincent through the rearview mirror, hatred burning in his eyes.

The car sped toward its destination at breakneck speed.

——

At the mall, Sebastian Orlando insisted on buying Evelyn Roland new clothes.

"Try these on," he demanded firmly.

Evelyn sighed and stepped into the fitting room.

Sebastian's phone rang, and he turned away to answer.

Sales associates bustled about their tasks.

Inside the fitting room, Evelyn had just picked up the garment when a strange fragrance filled her nostrils.

Her pupils constricted, but her body had already gone limp.

Darkness swallowed her vision as she collapsed.

Two figures in black emerged soundlessly and dragged her away.

——

The abandoned docks reeked of decay.

A sea breeze carried the stench of rot, making Margaret Valentine cover her nose in disgust.

"What a godforsaken place..."

Vincent scanned the area. "There are too many warehouses. How do we find her?"

Adrian checked his watch. "They said to come here."

His imposing figure stood out starkly in the dim light.

Vincent glared at him with envy. Why couldn't his own son command such presence?

Time ticked by.

Adrian stared at his phone screen, his frown deepening.
###Chapter 399

"They only gave this address. No specific warehouse location." Adrian Valentine stood in the icy wind, his black trench coat flapping violently. "My men are searching every building."

Margaret Valentine's eyes reddened, her voice choked with emotion. "Adrian, I knew you wouldn't abandon Isabella. Once she's safe, you two should marry."

She clutched her son's arm tightly, afraid he might change his mind.

Vincent Langley stood nearby, a calculating gleam flashing in his eyes. This marriage alliance needed to be finalized quickly—Adrian was a chess piece he couldn't afford to lose.

Adrian remained silent, his gaze fixed on the distance.

Eleanor Langley observed coldly, the ghost of a smirk playing on her lips. The more chaotic this farce became, the better.

The howling wind stretched each passing minute into an eternity.

"Still no news?" Margaret stamped her feet anxiously. "How can Isabella endure this freezing weather?"

Eleanor adjusted her shawl, her smile deepening. Seeing her enemies in distress brought her immense satisfaction.

"Call them again," Margaret urged.

Adrian dialed the number three times. No answer.

"They're not picking up." He pocketed his phone, brow furrowed.

Vincent clenched his fists, nails digging into his palms. Isabella was his carefully cultivated pawn—he couldn't let anything happen to her.

Suddenly, a phone ring shattered the silence.

"Warehouse No.4." Adrian's voice was low as he ended the call.

The group's expressions darkened instantly.

"We just came from there!" Vincent growled through gritted teeth. "They're toying with us!"

Margaret trembled with rage. "Who's behind this?"

They hurried back the way they'd come.

When the warehouse door burst open, a bone-chilling sea wind assaulted them.

Isabella dangled midair, crashing waves beneath her. The rope creaked ominously as it swayed in the wind.

"Adrian!" Her tear-streaked face was pale, voice hoarse from screaming.

The rope abruptly jerked upward, forcing her to bite her lip to stifle a scream. A cold warning hissed from the shadows: "Make another sound and you're going in."

Adrian stood framed in the doorway, his expression unreadable in the backlight.
###Chapter 400

Adrian Valentine stared coldly at Isabella Langley dangling mid-air, his gaze glacial.

Margaret Valentine stamped her foot anxiously, voice trembling. "Get her down now!"

She couldn't believe anyone would dare lay hands on a Valentine.

"Does it hurt to see your real daughter suffer?" A hoarse voice echoed from the shadows.

The room fell silent.

Adrian's brow furrowed.

Vincent Langley's face drained of color.

Eleanor Langley's purse hit the floor with a thud.

Margaret staggered back two steps, pale as death.

"No!" Isabella writhed in the ropes. "You're not my mother!"

Her desperate eyes locked on Adrian—the man she'd schemed to seduce was actually her brother?

"A paternity test will confirm it." The shadowed voice dripped sarcasm. "How revolting, Margaret, engineering your own children's marriage."

Margaret screamed hysterically. "Evelyn! This is your doing!"

Slap!

Eleanor struck Vincent across the face.

"You lied to me!" Her voice cracked. "You said her mother died years ago!"

Vincent's cheek swelled instantly.

Slap!

Another blow landed.

Eleanor's eyes burned crimson. "You filthy adulterers!"

The voice from the darkness fanned the flames. "Eleanor, they switched your real daughter at birth. They know where she is."

Eleanor yanked out her phone. "Vincent, I have the video evidence. Either reveal my daughter's whereabouts, or I'll destroy your reputation!"

Her finger hovered over the send button.

Margaret shot Adrian a panicked look.

Vincent's expression turned venomous. "Press send, and you'll never see your child again."

The air thickened with tension.
###Chapter 401

"If you want to tear off all pretenses, don't blame me for being ruthless." Vincent Langley's voice was icy as he cut her off. "Adrian's father was killed by—"

Before he could finish, Eleanor Langley's body stiffened and collapsed to the ground.

Adrian Valentine's gaze turned glacial, sharp as a blade as it locked onto Vincent. In that instant, he understood the truth Eleanor had been about to reveal before her death.

"Eleanor!" Vincent rushed forward, gathering his wife into his arms.

"Tsk, tsk. How ruthless of you, Chairman Langley." A mocking voice drifted from the shadows. "Even your own wife wasn't spared. We all know what she was about to say."

"Shut your mouth!" Vincent whirled around, veins bulging in fury. "Show yourself, you coward!"

"Guilty conscience?" The voice remained unhurried. "The Tang family massacre, Jonathan Savigny's 'accident'—did you really think you could bury the truth forever?"

Vincent's pupils constricted, sweat beading on his forehead.

"Lies!"

"Mrs. Valentine, wasn't it you who leaked Jonathan's itinerary back then?" The voice pressed on. "Did staging a car crash really put your mind at ease?"

"Enough!" Vincent roared, his face contorted with rage.

His frantic gaze snapped to Adrian, who was calmly picking up Eleanor's phone.

"Adrian, put that down!" Vincent's voice trembled.

Adrian methodically unlocked the screen, a cold smirk playing on his lips. "Mrs. Langley mentioned there was proof of your affair here."

The video began to play, the images painfully clear.

Margaret Valentine turned deathly pale, her entire body shaking.

"Wasn't my father's death supposed to be an accident?" Adrian asked softly, each word laced with venom.

"Adrian, let me explain—"

"Explain what?" Adrian suddenly laughed, the sound bordering on hysterical. "Decades' worth of footage needs an explanation?"

Margaret stared at him in despair. She knew it was over.

"This is a setup!" she shrieked. "Someone lured us here to turn us against each other!"

Adrian turned the phone screen toward her. "Then how do you explain these videos?"
###Chapter 402

Margaret Valentine staggered backward, her fingers trembling.

Her carefully woven lies had been mercilessly exposed in this moment.

"Adrian, all these years I've worked tirelessly to raise you and your sister..." Her voice shook. "What's wrong with finding companionship?"

"So you chose Vincent Langley?" Adrian's gaze was sharp as a blade. "And leaked my father's whereabouts?"

His fists clenched.

He had thought Vincent was the sole enemy—but there was a deeper conspiracy behind it all.

Margaret's face turned deathly pale. "Who's been feeding you these lies? I'm your mother!"

"Mother?" A cold laugh echoed from the shadows. "A mother who murdered her own husband?"

Margaret screamed uncontrollably. "Show yourself!"

Vincent's eyes darkened with malice. "Hiding like a coward? If you have proof, present it!"

"You destroyed the evidence long ago," the voice mocked. "But whether Adrian believes it—that's up to him."

The sea wind howled.

Adrian stared at Vincent. "You expect me to trust a murderer?"

"Bravo!" The mysterious figure suddenly laughed. "Adrian, here's a gift for you!"

The ceiling shattered with a deafening crash.

Two ropes slowly descended.

Evelyn Roland and Isabella Langley hung in midair, bound and gagged.

Adrian's pupils constricted violently.

A torrent of ice-cold water poured down.

Evelyn jolted awake.

Her wet hair clung to her face as she blinked in confusion.

Beneath her feet, the ocean waves churned violently.

"Isabella?" She turned to the woman bound beside her. "What's happening?"
###Chapter 403

Isabella's eyes were bloodshot, her nails digging deep into her palms.

Vincent Langley had actually killed Adrian's father.

Margaret Valentine had known her father in their youth.

The most absurd part? Margaret was her biological mother.

These truths carved into her heart like knives.

"Evelyn! This is all your doing!" Isabella shrieked hysterically.

Evelyn gave her a cold glance. "Psycho."

Dizzy, she leaned against the wall and closed her eyes.

The sedative hadn't fully worn off yet.

"Who are you calling a psycho?" Isabella trembled with rage.

Evelyn ignored her.

The former award-winning actress now looked like a disheveled madwoman.

"Accurate description," a mechanized voice suddenly remarked.

Evelyn whipped her head around.

The voice was distorted, impossible to identify as male or female.

"Why kidnap me?" She suppressed her anger.

Being suspended midair made her nauseous.

"To show you a good show," the voice taunted. "Look down."

Evelyn glanced below.

Adrian, Vincent, and Margaret were all there.

Eleanor Langley lay unconscious in Vincent's arms.

Evelyn's heart skipped a beat.

Wasn't this the cliché trope from soap operas?

Forcing the male lead to choose.

She'd just seen a similar short video days ago.

The male lead always picked his first love.

Evelyn briefly locked eyes with Adrian.

His lips pressed into a thin line—he clearly understood the kidnapper's intention.

"Adrian Valentine, choose one," the mechanical voice demanded coldly. "Whoever you pick, I'll spare."

Evelyn rolled her eyes.

Predictable.

She must have missed crucial plot points while unconscious.

Why was Eleanor unconscious?

Who kidnapped Isabella?

"Boring." Evelyn scoffed. "The whole world knows Adrian loves Isabella. Just throw me into the sea already."

"Hahaha—" The voice erupted into grating laughter.

Evelyn frowned. "Stop laughing. It's awful."

She mocked, "All this just to watch Adrian make a choice? How childish."
###Chapter 404

"Evelyn, you're underestimating yourself. To Adrian, you might mean far more than you think."

Evelyn scoffed, not even bothering to glance at Adrian.

Was he insane?

Playing such childish games?

"Adrian, choose. The one you don't pick gets thrown into the sea for the sharks."

The icy voice seemed to come from all directions.

Adrian's gaze flickered between Isabella and Evelyn, his Adam's apple bobbing with difficulty.

Isabella stomped her foot in frustration. "Adrian, have you forgotten who your true love is? You have to choose me!"

Margaret shrieked, "Adrian, Isabella is family! Why save that worthless Evelyn?"

"Shut up!" Adrian snapped. "Who's the real disgrace here? You had an affair with Vincent and bore his child, yet you dare speak?"

Evelyn arched a brow.

So Adrian knew the truth.

Too bad she'd missed the drama.

Margaret's face flushed crimson—that video was her greatest humiliation.

Evelyn had already accepted Adrian wouldn't choose her. She closed her eyes, waiting to be tossed into the sea.

Her guards were nearby. They wouldn't reveal themselves unless absolutely necessary.

That strange scent earlier...

A knockout fragrance potent enough to render someone unconscious instantly—only the Northern Capital had such formulas.

Who was truly behind this?

"Adrian, I've been terrified of water since childhood. Please, choose me! My fans are watching," Isabella pleaded, unable to meet his gaze.

The secret was out—her father had killed Adrian's.

With Margaret's scandal added to the mix, any chance between her and Adrian was over.

"Adrian, I'll count to three. If you don't choose, both go overboard!"

"One... Two—"

"I choose—"

"Isabella." The final words came in Adrian's voice—but it was Vincent who'd spoken.

Evelyn didn't catch the deception, believing Adrian had chosen Isabella.

Her heart wrenched violently.

Even expecting it didn't dull the pain.

Weightlessness seized her.

"No—Evelyn!" Adrian's scream tore through the air.

In his memory, Evelyn had never learned to swim.

As he lunged forward, another figure moved faster.

"Evelyn!"

Sebastian dove into the sea like an arrow loosed from its bow.

Isabella was lowered slowly, triumph written across her face.

Adrian had chosen her after all.

But when she saw Adrian's desperate stare fixed on the churning waters, her eyes darkened with venom.

He still cared for Evelyn.
###Chapter 405

In the icy seawater, Sebastian Orlando held Evelyn Roland tightly around the waist, swimming desperately toward shore.

Adrian Valentine stood on the deck, watching their entwined figures. His heart felt torn apart.

He whirled toward Vincent Langley, eyes blazing with fury.

Vincent adjusted his cuffs calmly. "Adrian, I could only save my daughter."

He signaled to Margaret Valentine. "Margaret, take Isabella. We're leaving."

Adrian turned away without another word.

As he reached the cabin door, Victor Ashcroft approached with a bound man in tow.

"Sir, this is the shooter. He used tranquilizer darts."

Adrian slowly turned, gaze sharp as a blade. "Vincent Langley, you killed my father. This blood feud won't end."

Vincent smiled serenely. "Careful with baseless accusations."

Adrian suddenly laughed. "No evidence? Even better. I'll make you wish for death."

A flicker of murderous intent crossed Vincent's eyes. "Don't let rumors destroy our bond."

"Bond?" Adrian sneered. "You slept with this woman and fathered Isabella. That's your gift to me?"

Isabella Langley paled.

Margaret shrieked hysterically. "Adrian! Must you destroy me?"

He looked at her with disgust. "You ruined my father, then tried to ruin me. Gregory isn't a Valentine. Isabella and I share blood, yet you pushed us together."

"Tonight, I'm cleaning house."

Margaret staggered back, face ashen.

She realized with horror—Adrian knew far more than she'd imagined.

"You...how can you not be my son?" she stammered.

Adrian yanked a hair from her head, then one from his own. "Run the paternity test."

Margaret collapsed, her decades-long scheme crumbling.

"How could you be so cruel?" she whispered hopelessly.

Adrian's gaze remained icy. "You kept grasping for power. Last time, you framed Evelyn. Grandmother knew everything—she just played along."

Margaret froze.

The old woman had been laughing at her all along.
###Chapter 406

Margaret Valentine's eyes turned icy as her nails dug deep into her palms.

The old fool had ruined her carefully laid plans.

Isabella Langley gazed tearfully at Adrian Valentine. "Adrian..."

"Shut up!" Adrian's face twisted in disgust. "Don't call me that."

Isabella paled. She'd known Margaret arranged this marriage precisely because they weren't blood-related.

She refused to give up. "Adrian, those are just rumors. How could my father possibly—"

Adrian's razor-sharp gaze sliced toward Vincent Langley. "Mr. Langley, how does it feel to scheme against the Valentines for years only to fail at the last moment?"

Vincent cradled his unconscious wife Eleanor, murky eyes boiling with murderous intent.

Everything had gone wrong. The plan was to control Adrian through marriage and then swallow the entire Valentine empire.

Now it was all over.

He forced a smile. "Adrian, you shouldn't make baseless accusations."

Isabella desperately grabbed Adrian's sleeve. "Adrian, I knew nothing about this. I truly love you—"

"Love?" Adrian sneered. "After what your father and Margaret did, you dare speak of love?"

Isabella whirled toward Margaret, eyes blazing. "You knew the truth and still tricked me into this marriage? I'll never acknowledge you as my mother!"

Margaret trembled. Was this the daughter she'd longed for all these years?

Isabella lunged at Vincent, hysterical. "Dad! How could you do this to Mom? She was so beautiful, so kind—"

Staggering back, she turned toward the exit.

"Isabella!" Margaret sobbed, chasing after her.

Isabella spun around, venom in her eyes. "Don't follow me! You destroyed everything!"

If she couldn't have Adrian, then Evelyn Roland wouldn't either.

She pulled out her phone and dialed Warren Garten's number.
###Chapter 407

"Inform the Lefèvre family that Evelyn Roland was responsible for Christian Lefèvre's death. Adrian Valentine wants to protect her? Wishful thinking."

Isabella Langley finally pieced everything together.

Adrian had likely known her father was the murderer all along. Getting close to her was just a ploy to extract the truth.

Their two years of so-called marital bliss had been nothing but a performance for outsiders.

He had never truly touched her.

The way Adrian had looked at Evelyn earlier—that unmistakable affection still lingering in his eyes—made Isabella realize she had been a complete fool.

Adrian had used her from the very beginning.

Her fists clenched, nails digging deep into her palms.

She wouldn’t let any of them get away with this.

Meanwhile.

Vincent Langley received a call—Dominic Lombardi had been arrested for sexually assaulting one of their artists.

Remembering the evidence Dominic held, Vincent's face darkened. He glared at Adrian, who lounged across from him with infuriating calm. "You did this?"

Adrian smirked, then turned to leave with Victor Ashcroft in tow.

His bodyguards released Vincent's men.

At the docks, Adrian watched from a distance as Sebastian Orlando carried Evelyn ashore.

The two collapsed onto the muddy beach, utterly exhausted.

Adrian stood frozen, his knuckles turning white.

"Sir, now is the perfect time to strike back," Victor murmured.

Adrian didn’t move.

The bitter wind howled around them.

Minutes later, a black car screeched to a halt.

Sebastian helped Evelyn inside, and they sped away.

Only then did Adrian return to the Valentine estate.

Cassandra Valentine, Gregory Valentine, and Margaret Valentine—who had rushed back—were all waiting for him.

Margaret eyed her adopted son with icy disdain, the air thick with tension.

"Adrian Valentine, what exactly are you trying to pull?" she snapped. "You’re not even a real Valentine."

If they were tearing off the masks, then let it be a fight to the death.

Adrian’s gaze turned glacial, like the abyss itself.

Margaret faltered under that piercing stare—sharp as a blade.

She forced herself to hold his gaze.

Gregory, still groggy from a hangover, perked up at the revelation.

"Mom, what did you say?" He jumped to his feet, grinning. "Does that mean I’m the sole heir now?"

Cassandra gasped, covering her mouth in shock.

Margaret shot her useless youngest son a withering look.

"Hahaha!" Gregory pointed at Adrian, laughing wildly. "How does it feel now? I’m the true Valentine heir!"

He turned eagerly to his mother. "Call Uncle and the others! I want to watch this impostor get thrown out myself!"
###Chapter 408

Margaret Valentine's temple throbbed as she glared at her worthless son.

Victor Ashcroft smirked, savoring Gregory Valentine's deranged expression. "Gregory, you don't even know whose blood runs in your veins."

Gregory froze, eyes bloodshot. "Victor! Who the hell do you think you are? This is Valentine family business!"

Victor remained silent.

He'd waited too long for this moment.

His icy gaze swept over Gabrielle Flores' meticulously maintained face.

"Gabrielle, why don't you tell this fool yourself?" Victor's voice dripped with venom. "Our CEO is the true Valentine heir."

Gabrielle's pupils constricted, nails digging into her palms.

"How dare you!" she shrieked. "You're just a servant!"

"Gabrielle, he has more right to stand here than you do." Beatrice Valentine entered slowly, leaning on her cane.

Martha Dimucci supported the elderly woman, who wore an elegant maroon cheongsam.

Adrian Valentine frowned, confusion flashing in his eyes as he studied Victor.

"Don't worry, CEO." Victor gave a bitter smile. "Madam kept me by your side to uncover the truth about the chairman's murder... and to avenge my mother."

Gabrielle trembled violently, her gaze locked on Victor's face.

Features began overlapping with a face from her memories.

"Housekeeper Tong's son..." she whispered.

A flicker of shock crossed Adrian's eyes.

Victor had always been flawless in his duties—except when it came to Evelyn Roland.

"You old hag!" Gabrielle screamed. "You can't just make baseless accusations!"

Beatrice settled into her chair with calm dignity.

"Evidence?" She stroked the jade bracelet on her wrist. "Of course I have some."

Cold sweat trickled down Gabrielle's back.

Beatrice lifted her gaze. "I knew this was a setup the day you carried Adrian through our doors."

"Zachary married you out of duty, yet you conspired with Vincent Langley to kill him."

"All these years I played deaf and dumb, waiting for Adrian to avenge his father himself."

Her quiet words struck like daggers.

Gabrielle's legs wobbled, but she forced a sneer. "Lies!"

"Every time Vincent visited, he'd go to the gazebo in the back garden." Beatrice said suddenly. "There's an old locust tree there—with your names carved into its trunk."

Gabrielle's face turned deathly pale.
###Chapter 409

Gu Manqi's nails dug deep into her palms as she clenched her fists.

For years, she had played the fool, enduring Margaret Valentine's tyranny—all for this moment.

Beatrice Valentine rose slowly, looking down at her with cold superiority.

"Do you know why you could never get Valentine Group shares?"

Gu Manqi's face turned deathly pale.

With a mocking smile, Beatrice pointed at Gregory Valentine.

"Do you know why he's such a failure?"

Gregory's head snapped up.

Then she gestured toward Cassandra Valentine.

"Do you know why she's just as useless?"

Cassandra trembled violently.

"Because..." Beatrice enunciated each word, "she isn't your daughter."

Cassandra staggered back, knocking over the coffee table.

"You're lying!" Gu Manqi's lips quivered.

Beatrice calmly produced a document.

"Paternity test results. Care to see?"

Gregory lunged forward and snatched the report.

"Impossible!" He stared at the conclusion in disbelief.

Beatrice regarded him with pity.

"You're not her biological son either."

Gregory froze as if struck by lightning.

"The best revenge..." Beatrice said leisurely, "isn't killing someone. It's making them watch everything they've built crumble to dust."

Gu Manqi's legs gave way, collapsing to the floor.

"Gregory's downfall..." Beatrice smiled faintly, "was orchestrated by me."

Gregory's eyes burned with fury.

"As for last night's incident..." Beatrice glanced toward the entrance, "the police are already waiting outside."

Gu Manqi screamed, "You framed him!"

Beatrice shook her head.

"I didn't force him to commit statutory rape."

Gregory suddenly sprang at Beatrice.

Adrian Valentine stepped forward instantly, kicking him to the ground.

"Get away!" Gregory shoved Gu Manqi's outstretched hand. "I refuse to acknowledge you as my mother!"

Gu Manqi sat motionless, her face ashen.

Outside, police sirens grew louder.
###Chapter 410

Margaret Valentine froze.

The disgust in her son's eyes chilled her to the bone.

The old lady's prophecy had finally come true.

Everything she'd schemed for had crumbled to dust.

Her own children disowned her.

Abandoned by all. Left with nothing.

This was worse than death.

She'd lived for only two things.

Reuniting with her daughter.

Making Gregory heir to the Valentine empire.

She'd clawed her way up for this.

Vincent Langley could discard her anytime.

She needed an insurance policy.

That man held her fate in his hands.

The true tragedy wasn't failure.

It was watching your dreams get snuffed out.

These two purposes had kept her breathing.

A pitiful existence indeed.

No one defied Vincent Langley.

The man was terrifying.

Gregory Valentine staggered to his feet.

"You made me a murderer's son."

Margaret's heart lurched.

Martha's death and the elder Valentine's demise—she was involved.

She thought she'd covered her tracks.

Never expected the truth to surface.

"Gregory—"

"Shut up!" Gregory's voice cracked like a whip. "If you have any conscience left, turn yourself in. Don't ruin my life."

Fallen from grace overnight.

The Valentine heir's golden halo—shattered.

Wealth and privilege—gone like smoke.

How could he not hate her?

Her son only cared about money and status.

Just like her younger self.

The resemblance left her speechless.

In her reckless youth, she'd roamed the streets.

Then she met Vincent Langley.

And foolishly gave herself to him.

Vincent was a notorious womanizer.

Only stopped after... certain incidents.

Her gaze snapped to the composed old woman.

"You vile crone! You poisoned my son's mind!"

"You turned him into this worthless shell!"

Beatrice Valentine remained serene.

"You plotted to kill my grandson."

"The more he excelled, the more your son faltered."

"Eventually, you couldn't bring yourself to eliminate him."

"Because only he could secure your luxury."

"Margaret, you're still an amateur at this game."

Beatrice's tone was icy.

She didn't even glance Margaret's way.

Murderous rage flashed in Margaret's eyes.

"I'll see you dead, you old hag!"

Adrian Valentine looked up coldly.

"Try it."

Margaret bared her teeth in a grotesque smile.

"I've got nothing left to lose."

Did they think they could cast her out?

Dream on.

Reinforcements were coming.

She'd prepared backup plans after the elder Valentine's death.

Beatrice's eyes narrowed.

So the mastermind would finally show himself.

She'd waited so long for this.

To expose them all.

"Victor, call the police in."

At Beatrice's command, Victor Ashcroft strode toward the exit.

Margaret panicked.

The message had been sent.

He should be here by now.

She couldn't let them arrest her child.

Even if Gregory denied her.

He was still her flesh and blood.

Victor had concrete evidence.

This time, even she wouldn't escape.
###Chapter 411 

A cunning glint flashed in Margaret's eyes as she grasped at her last lifeline. "Old Madam, if I'm taken away, Adrian will never learn the truth about his biological mother!"

Beatrice Valentine tapped her fingers lightly against the armrest with a cold laugh. "Does it matter? As long as she's alive, I'll tear this city apart to find her."

"Tracking your movements, investigating my son's past—there are always traces left behind. I've been searching all these years. Don't think you can threaten me with this."

Margaret's body stiffened, her nails digging deep into her palms. The old hag was far more formidable than she'd anticipated.

Was she truly about to fall here today?

Victor Ashcroft strode in with the police, handing over a file.

"This is surveillance footage from the night my mother was murdered. Mrs. Valentine bludgeoned her to death with a wooden rod before staging the car accident."

Margaret staggered back. "Lies! I only knocked her unconscious and left her there! What happened afterward had nothing to do with me!"

Her shrill screams tore through the room as if sheer volume could erase her crimes.

Ever since the Langley family's downfall, misfortune had dogged her steps like an inescapable net tightening around her.

The officer produced handcuffs. "Mrs. Valentine, please cooperate with our investigation."

Her face turned ashen. The day of reckoning had come too soon.

Beatrice suddenly turned to Victor. "What happened to that girl from last night?"

Victor's expression darkened. "The family withdrew their complaint. Called it a misunderstanding."

The old woman arched a disdainful brow. Those who refused justice deserved their suffering.

Gregory Valentine burst into laughter. "You thought you could frame me, old woman? Dream on!"

Margaret lifted her chin in defiance.

Then Beatrice dropped her bombshell. "Gregory isn't Vincent Langley's son."

"Of course he's not." Margaret's lips curled in triumph.

Did they really think she'd stake everything on one man?

Years ago, Vincent had abandoned her to marry Eleanor Langley. All she'd wanted was to secure her daughter's place in the Langley household, only to be deemed unworthy.

Then Vincent introduced her to Jonathan Savigny.

That man who made every socialite in Vienna swoon—far more captivating than Vincent ever was.

They hadn't killed Jonathan for his patents.

But because he'd discovered Adrian's true parentage.

"So that's how it was." Beatrice's laugh was icy. "My foolish son died because he uncovered the truth. Vincent laundered those patents overseas while you two snakes plotted your schemes. How very thorough."

Margaret's face drained of color.

Adrian's eyes burned with murderous intent.

All these years, Margaret had let him live consumed by guilt—believing he'd caused his father's death.

"So you pinned the blame on me," he said, each word dripping with frozen venom, "just to make me atone for your sins?"
###Chapter 412

Monica Valentine knew the game was over. She couldn't comprehend how her meticulously laid plans had collapsed at the final moment.

Adrian Valentine's bloodshot eyes bore into her, yet she twisted her lips into a grotesque smile.

"Adrian, your father died because of you," Monica shrieked. "If you hadn't been obsessed with uncovering your origins, he would still be alive! You—this unwanted bastard—are the real culprit!"

"How dare you!" Beatrice Valentine slammed her hand on the table as she rose.

Trembling with rage, she pointed at Monica. "You vile woman! You switched babies and forced a marriage, and now you have the audacity to distort the truth? What fault does my grandson bear? If not for your scheming with Vincent Langley, my son would have lived a happy life!"

A ruthless glint flashed in Beatrice's eyes. "Death would be too merciful for you. I'll make sure you rot in prison while watching your precious children's lives crumble."

"You tormented my grandson for over twenty years. Now it's your children's turn to suffer."

Monica whirled toward Gregory Valentine, desperation in her voice. "Gregory, remember—Isabella is your real sister! When your father comes for you, avenge me!"

Gregory scoffed. "Why should I? You dug your own grave. Lie in it."

Monica staggered as if struck by lightning, unable to believe the words from the son she had spoiled rotten.

Beatrice smirked coldly. "He inherited your selfish, heartless nature. When push comes to shove, he'll only save himself. Expecting him to avenge you? Maybe in your next life."

Suddenly, Mrs. Harrison stormed in. Beatrice signaled Victor to temporarily dismiss the officers.

"Monica!" Mrs. Harrison lunged at her, hysterical. "Because of you, the Harrisons are bankrupt! My husband divorced me!"

She slapped Monica hard across the face.

Monica stumbled back, now utterly defenseless.

Adrian's gaze flickered. It seemed his grandmother had orchestrated this final act.

But today's events couldn't have been Beatrice's doing—she adored Evelyn too much to ever let harm come to her.

Oblivious to the Valentines' tense atmosphere, Mrs. Harrison only had eyes for Monica.

The Harrisons were finished.
###Chapter 413 

The divorce papers slammed onto the coffee table with a sharp crack.

Mrs. Langley's lips curled into a cold smirk.

She had long grown weary of this marriage. The Langley family's crushing debts were no longer her burden to bear.

Her tender, devoted lover outside these walls was her true destiny.

"Madam Valentine." She smoothed a stray lock of hair, venom dripping from her gaze as she stared at Margaret Valentine. "Did you know? This vile woman not only seduced Vincent Langley back then, but also crawled into your third brother's son's bed. Gregory Valentine is the bastard child of their affair!"

"Shut your mouth!" Margaret shrieked, lunging forward with nails raking across Mrs. Langley's face.

The elderly matriarch's cane trembled slightly, yet her smile turned knowing. "So that's why. No wonder that girl withdrew the police report after filing it. My third brother must have intervened behind the scenes."

Cassandra Valentine staggered to her feet, vision blurred by tears.

"Margaret!" Her voice was raw. "I'm not your biological daughter, so you deliberately ruined me. Now tell me—who is my real mother?"

Margaret wiped the blood from her cheek, grinning viciously. "You'll never know, you little bastard."

"You monster!" Cassandra collapsed to her knees. "You destroyed my life! I curse you to suffer for eternity!"

Suddenly, everything became clear.

Isabella's excellence. Margaret's favoritism. The meticulously laid traps...

"You two planned this all along!" Cassandra laughed hysterically. "Making me humiliate Evelyn Roland, forcing me to befriend Isabella—it was all to pave the way for Isabella! Victor Ashcroft's incident, Julian Roscente's betrayal—all your schemes!"

Margaret looked down at her with icy disdain. "Blame your own stupidity."

Cassandra crumpled onto the carpet, tears soaking the fibers.

At last, she understood—she had been nothing but a pawn in their twisted game.

Margaret turned to the matriarch, her smile turning sinister. "Madam Valentine, haven't you noticed your health deteriorating lately?"

Adrian Valentine's pupils constricted. "What have you done to Grandmother?"
###Chapter 414

Beatrice Valentine snatched the toxicology report from the butler and flung it at Gabrielle Flores' feet.

Her eyebrow arched like a drawn sword. "This is your so-called 'tonic'? The kind that induces dementia?"

Gabrielle's pupils contracted violently, her trembling fingers hovering over the damning document.

The matriarch's laugh was glacial. "If not for Evelyn checking my vitals weekly, I'd be a vegetable by now."

She leaned forward, silver cane glinting. "I took the antidote before every dose. Didn't you notice the powder residue on the rim?"

Her gaze dropped to Gabrielle's waist. "The lumbar pain must be excruciating. At this rate, you'll be paralyzed within six months."

Gabrielle clutched her lower back, face draining of color.

"You poisoned me?" Her voice cracked.

"Don't flatter yourself." Beatrice scoffed. "Those are Vincent Langley's bedroom injuries. Pushing through recovery only made it worse."

Gabrielle's ears burned crimson, nails drawing blood from her palms.

Adrian Valentine's knuckles rapped a staccato rhythm against the leather armrest, his obsidian eyes darkening.

"Evelyn again!" Gabrielle shrieked suddenly. "Without her interference—"

Margaret Valentine took one look at the gathering storm and beat a hasty retreat.

Gregory Valentine, however, was practically bouncing. "Mother! The DNA test proves I'm Grandmother's true heir!"

Gabrielle shook with impotent rage.

"Even if you suspect me of killing Jonathan," she hissed through bared teeth, "where's your evidence?"

Adrian rose like gathering thunder, his shadow swallowing her whole. "Since when do I need evidence?"

The cane thumped against marble. "Attempted murder carries a five-year sentence. Though..." Beatrice's gaze lingered on Gabrielle's deteriorating condition.

"You decrepit hag!" Gabrielle lunged, only to be wrestled down by security.

As police officers entered, Gregory crowed, "This isn't over, Adrian!"

Cassandra Valentine collapsed at Beatrice's feet. "Grandmother, my birth parents—"

The old woman sighed, pressing a key into her palm. "The penthouse is yours."

Three kowtows later, Cassandra stumbled into the night. The wind snatched at her coat like a severed kite string.
###Chapter 415

The living room fell into dead silence.

Adrian Valentine stared at his grandmother's aged face. "The incident at the docks—was that your doing too?"

The elderly woman rose with the support of her cane, her gaze sweeping over the estate that held half a lifetime of memories.

"This house is tainted. Sell it."

A flicker of relief passed through her clouded eyes.

Adrian's throat moved. "I have a villa in the southern district—"

"Unnecessary." She waved a dismissive hand. "Where I live now, I can see your father's grave just by opening the window."

Evelyn Roland had just stepped into Regal Heights when her phone lit up with a report from Zachary.

Her fingers glided over the screen, her gaze sharpening.

The Valentine family's drama was even more riveting than she'd anticipated.

Victoria Laurent emerged from the kitchen with a bowl of medicine. She paused when she saw Evelyn lost in thought.

"Miss, it's time for your medicine."

Evelyn instinctively recoiled. "I just remembered there's a document at the office—"

Victoria seized her wrist. "Even Mr. Roscente drank his medicine obediently after falling into the water. Do I need to feed you myself?"

A notification suddenly popped up on her phone.

#Langley Group Assistant Dominic Lombardi Pleads Guilty#

Evelyn's eyes turned icy as they fixed on those words.

"This scent..." she murmured. "It's a specialty from Montreal."

Hurried footsteps echoed from outside.

"Miss!" Sophia Blanchet burst in, breathless. "Something major just happened!"
###Chapter 416

Sophia Blanchet burst into the room like a whirlwind.

Evelyn Roland looked up to see the girl she hadn't met in over a year. The youthful innocence had faded from Sophia's features, replaced by a newfound maturity.

"Sis!" Sophia rushed forward and wrapped her in a crushing embrace.

Evelyn winced at the tight grip but couldn't suppress a smile. "Sophia, you've worked hard this past year."

Sophia released her and swiftly shrugged off her backpack. She'd spent the last twelve months abroad, digging into Isabella Langley's past.

"Look at this." Sophia pulled out a stack of documents. "You and Isabella weren't switched at birth. Vincent Langley orchestrated the whole thing. Isabella grew up overseas and only returned for elementary school."

Evelyn took the papers, her brow furrowing.

"There's more." Sophia winked mysteriously. "Guess who Isabella's ex-boyfriend is?"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Ex-boyfriend?"

"Yep." Sophia produced several photos. "Christian Lefèvre."

Evelyn's pupils constricted. "Christian Lefèvre?"

"Correct." Sophia lowered her voice. "I found evidence suggesting Isabella and Adrian Valentine conspired to set the fire that nearly killed him."

Evelyn's fingers trembled. Now she understood why Christian had worn that bitter smile before losing consciousness.

Her chest tightened with fury. Three years of relentless effort, countless rare herbs—all to save a man who'd thrown his life away for that woman.

"Sophia, rest first." Evelyn grabbed the photos and turned to leave.

Victoria Laurent's voice rang from the kitchen. "Where do you think you're going? Drink your medicine first!"

Evelyn froze mid-step.

Victoria emerged carrying a steaming bowl of dark brown liquid.

Evelyn instinctively recoiled. "Do I have to?"

"No exceptions." Victoria's expression was stern. "You'll regret it when the fever returns."

Pinching her nose, Evelyn downed the bitter concoction, grimacing at the taste.

"Here." Sophia offered a piece of candied winter melon. "Your favorite."

Evelyn popped the sweet into her mouth, letting the sugary flavor neutralize the bitterness. As a child, she'd mistaken the translucent treats for fatty pork, salivating over them.

"I'm leaving." Evelyn grabbed her purse.

Sophia slung her backpack over her shoulders. "I'm coming with you."

"Aren't you tired?"

"Slept on the plane." Sophia looked refreshed.

They hurried out the door. Evelyn had tracked Adrian and Isabella to a private club for their secret meeting.
###Chapter 417

Inside the private lounge.

The crystal chandelier cast a cold glow as Adrian Valentine tapped the table with his slender fingers.

Isabella Langley gazed at him with infatuation.

"Adrian, is there really no chance for us?"

His lips curled into a mocking smile. "Miss Langley, time to wake up from your fantasy."

The icy contempt in his eyes made her shiver.

"We're not blood-related! My father's actions have nothing to do with me!"

Adrian's fingers stilled.

"That's your problem."

Isabella clenched and unclenched her fists. "Can't you let go of vengeance? Isn't our love enough?"

A low chuckle escaped him.

"Your father murdered mine, and you expect me to forget?"

Tears welled in her eyes. "But I love you!"

He flung his phone before her.

"Love?" His voice dripped with disdain. "See how well you entertained your driver."

Obscene sounds erupted from the device.

Isabella turned deathly pale. "This is a setup! It must be Evelyn!"

Adrian's face twisted in disgust.

"Your driver had a recording fetish."

The revelation struck her like lightning.

She suddenly remembered the earlier blackmail.

"He forced me!"

Adrian stood, adjusting his cuffs.

"Not my concern."

Her eyes darkened with malice.

"Then I'll tell the Lefèvres that Evelyn killed Christian!"

Murderous intent radiated from Adrian instantly.

Meanwhile.

At the club entrance.

A noblewoman blocked Evelyn's path.

"You're Evelyn Roland?"

Evelyn narrowed her eyes. "Yes."

The woman raised her hand to strike.

Sophia Blanchet seized her wrist like lightning.

"Looking to die?" Sophia's gaze turned glacial.

Tears streamed down the woman's face. "My son merely spoke against you, and you killed him?"

Evelyn's pupils contracted.

"Who are you?"

"Christian Lefèvre's mother!" the woman shrieked. "Murderer!"

Evelyn's expression frosted over.

"You claim I killed him?"

"Someone sent me proof!" Madame Lefèvre screamed hysterically. "You set that fire!"
###Chapter 418

"Bullshit! My sister would never kill over mere words. The real murderer is still out there. We're here to uncover the truth."

Sophia Blanchet hadn't expected the other party to strike first.

Now they were smearing her sister as a killer.

Evelyn Roland watched Mrs. Lefèvre's devastated expression. As a mother herself, she understood that pain.

"Mrs. Lefèvre, do you honestly believe I'd kill for such a petty reason? The person who sent you that evidence—did they truly want to reveal the truth? Or were they using you as their weapon?"

Mrs. Lefèvre froze.

That person had indeed promised revenge if Evelyn died.

"Then prove it wasn't you."

Evelyn clenched her fists. She had children too. Anyone who harmed them would face her wrath.

"I have evidence. Give me three days, Mrs. Lefèvre. Unless you want the Lefèvre family to fall next. First the Ashcrofts, then the Roscentes—who stands to gain from all this? You know the answer."

Mrs. Lefèvre paled.

A sudden realization struck her. She rushed toward the door, forgetting her purse.

Then she hesitated.

Something about Evelyn's words nagged at her.

But finding Julian Roscente took priority now.

If the Lefèvres were targeted, that woman's son would benefit most.

She'd already lost one child. She couldn't lose her daughter too.

Evelyn and Sophia headed straight for the penthouse.

As the door opened, Adrian Valentine was leaving.

The man looked as striking as ever, his peach-blossom eyes icy despite their charm.

Seeing Evelyn, he stiffened.

Before he could speak, a slap cracked across his face.

Isabella Langley gasped.

Was this woman insane?

Then Evelyn turned and struck Isabella too.

"Evelyn! How dare you hit me?" Isabella shrieked, clutching her cheek.

Evelyn smirked. "You deserve it, both of you. Adrian, I should've let you burn in that fire."

Adrian's pupils contracted.

Isabella's face drained of color.

Their secret was out.
###Chapter 419

"Evelyn, what do you mean? You were the one who saved me that day?" Adrian's voice trembled, his eyes swirling with complex emotions.

Evelyn stared at him coldly. "Who else? Did you really think Isabella could carry you out of a burning building with that frail frame of hers?"

She flung a stack of photos and documents onto the table.

"See for yourself. Isabella and Christian had been dating for a year. That day, you were supposed to meet Christian at Nata Tower. I wanted to surprise you."

"The moment I arrived, the building was already on fire. I rushed in and pulled you out. By the time I went back for Christian, you were gone."

She pointed to a surveillance still. "This shows Isabella taking you away. You two had planned Christian's murder together."

Evelyn turned to Isabella, her gaze icy. "Christian gave you his heart. Even his business trips were just excuses to see you."

"One was his girlfriend, the other his closest friend. Yet you both conspired to kill him. And now you dare meet here in secret? Disgusting."

"To pin the blame on me—how much lower can you sink?"

Her chest heaved violently, her fingertips trembling slightly.

Adrian picked up the photos with shaking hands. In one, Isabella nestled in Christian's arms, both smiling sweetly. Another showed them at a gala abroad.

"How...?" He had seen Evelyn set the fire with his own eyes.

Isabella paled. Where had Evelyn gotten these?

Evelyn read her thoughts. "Isabella, we were never switched at birth. You grew up overseas. You know that city inside out."

"You used my name to lure Christian there but met him yourself. This was your plan from the start."

"No wonder the Lefèvres insisted I killed Christian. You framed me first to cover your tracks."

Adrian felt as if struck by lightning. From the very beginning, Isabella had been manipulating him.

She had even outmaneuvered Evelyn.

When he learned someone in the Valentine family wanted Evelyn dead, and discovered Isabella was Vincent Langley's daughter—combined with witnessing Evelyn set the fire—he had pretended to fall for Isabella to drive Evelyn away.

His grandmother was aging. Uncovering his father's killer couldn't wait.

But today's revelations shattered his plans.

He never wanted Evelyn dragged into the Valentine family's quagmire.

He had tried to outplay Isabella, only to be outplayed himself.

And in the end, his wife paid the price.

Isabella spat blood, her voice venomous. "Evelyn, you started that fire! Adrian and I saw it with our own eyes—you're the murderer!"

Slap!

Evelyn struck her again.

"Ah!" Isabella cried out, nearly toppling from her chair.

Evelyn smirked. "Isabella. Adrian. I have a special gift prepared for you both."

As she reached the door, several police officers blocked her path.

The lead detective bore a striking resemblance to Christian—his half-brother.

"Evelyn Roland?" He flashed his badge. "We need you to come with us."
###Chapter 420

Evelyn narrowed her eyes at the police officers before her.

She turned to Isabella, who wore a triumphant smirk. The gleam in Isabella's eyes seemed to say: Do you like my gift, Evelyn?

If she couldn't have Adrian, then neither could Evelyn.

Adrian stepped forward, blocking the officers. "What business do you have with my wife?"

Evelyn shot him a cold glance. He'd refused to acknowledge her as his wife before—now the word rolled off his tongue so easily.

Isabella stood frozen in the hospital room, as if struck by lightning. Her gaze burned into Adrian's back, brimming with hatred.

She should have known Adrian was only using her. Yet she'd foolishly believed he loved her.

Vincent arched a brow at Adrian. "Mr. Valentine, did I hear correctly? You're calling Evelyn your wife?"

Before Adrian could respond, Evelyn cut in. "Ignore him. His fiancée is lying in that hospital bed. He must be confused."

Adrian's expression darkened.

Vincent chuckled. "I heard the Valentine family has been through quite some turmoil lately. The stress must be getting to you."

Evelyn nodded. "Clearly."

Adrian met her gaze briefly before lowering his eyes in silence.

Evelyn turned to Sophia. "Come for me in two days."

Sophia gave a knowing nod. "Take care, sis."

To the officers, Evelyn said, "I'll go with you."

Only if she was arrested would Isabella let her guard down.

Adrian frowned. "You're really going with them?"

Evelyn scoffed. "Isn't this what you and Isabella wanted? Why pretend to care now?"

"That's not what I meant."

"Then what did you mean? You schemed to frame me, and now you've succeeded. Shouldn't you be celebrating?"

Without another glance, Evelyn walked away.

Adrian stood rooted in place, watching as she was led off.

Sophia shook her fist at him. "Adrian Valentine, watch your mouth. My sister is not your wife—Isabella is. When Evelyn was at her lowest, you were off gallivanting with that woman. Sebastian Orlando is the only one worthy of being her husband. You're nothing!"

Adrian grabbed her arm. "What did you just say? When was she at her lowest?"

"Your wife? Are you insane? The whole world knows Isabella is your wife. You two deserve each other—stay the hell away from my sister!"

His gaze turned stormy, but he could only watch as Sophia stormed off.
###Chapter 421

Adrian Valentine dialed Victor Ashcroft's number.

The call connected instantly.

"Bring two men," Adrian's voice was dangerously low.

Within minutes, Victor arrived with two bodyguards in tow.

Isabella Langley tried to leave but collided with Adrian's group.

"Adrian, what's the meaning of this?" She took a wary step back.

Adrian gave Victor a silent signal.

"Pick up those photos. Make her see clearly." His tone could freeze hell.

Victor bent to retrieve the pictures. His pupils constricted violently.

"Christian Lefèvre?" He looked up, stunned. "Isabella, what's your connection to him?"

The intimate poses in the photos burned Victor's retinas.

A realization struck him. "Wait—Christian's mysterious girlfriend abroad..."

Adrian stiffened as if an invisible hand crushed his heart.

Isabella bit her lower lip raw.

She couldn't confess. Admitting this would validate Evelyn's accusations.

"I don't understand," she turned away.

Christian had loved her deeply. Pity he lacked Adrian's ruthless ambition.

His weakness was his own undoing.

Only a man like Adrian deserved her.

Now everything lay in ruins.

Destroyed by her own parents.

Adrian advanced, his gaze sharper than daggers.

"Last chance, Isabella." Each syllable dripped ice. "What was your relationship with Christian? How did he die?"

Trembling under his intensity, tears spilled down her cheeks.

If he wanted the truth, she'd make him suffer eternally.

"Heh..." Her swollen face twisted into a grotesque smile.

"Adrian, you killed Christian! Evelyn's the murderer!" She shrieked hysterically. "The verdict drops soon. If you truly want justice, tell the Lefèvres the truth!"

"You're divorcing Evelyn to save your own skin, aren't you?"

Murderous intent swirled in Adrian's eyes.

Victor stared at his friend in shock.

Now he understood why Adrian had him investigate Christian's death.

"Isabella," Victor interjected coldly, "I've uncovered some leads."

He locked onto her evasive gaze. "Christian did have a girlfriend in Eastalia. Bought her an apartment. Which now belongs to you, correct?"

Isabella's face drained of color.

She never anticipated Victor's investigation would go this far.
###Chapter 422

The phone vibrated.

Adrian Valentine received a photo.

The woman in the picture was Isabella Langley.

His fingertips turned ice cold.

He handed the phone to Isabella.

His voice trembled slightly. "Isabella, this was sent by Mr. Lefèvre's friend. You were Christian Lefèvre's girlfriend."

Nathan Aldridge's gaze fell on the photo.

A murderous aura erupted around him.

Isabella clenched her fists.

That bitch Evelyn Roland just wouldn't stay dead.

Her father should have strangled her years ago.

She sneered at Nathan. "Nathan, you're the real fool here, dancing to my tune all this time."

"I spared your dignity by not mentioning Christian was my ex."

"You thought I was hiding it? I was protecting you!"

Her voice grew hysterical. "Evelyn detonated explosives that nearly killed you all! Christian really died!"

"I kept your secrets, and this is how you repay me?"

Nathan's eyes turned glacial.

He stepped forward abruptly. "You orchestrated everything."

Isabella's pupils constricted.

Prove it.

Nathan saw right through her.

Isabella decided to lay all cards on the table. "You only got close to me to investigate your father's death, didn't you?"

"You haven't touched me in two years. Spare me the act."

"Evelyn abandoned you long ago!"

CRASH—

The coffee table overturned.

A glass shattered at Isabella's feet.

Victor Ashcroft broke out in cold sweat.

Nathan hadn't lost control like this in years.

"Let her go." Nathan's voice dripped with venom. "The Academy Awards are tomorrow. Don't jeopardize company partnerships."

Madness flashed in Isabella's eyes. "Nathan, you still care about me, don't you?"

Nathan's lips curled into a chilling smile.

Tomorrow, he'd make her wish for death.

The elevator doors opened.

Victor spotted a pool of blood on the floor.

Nathan's leather shoes were soaked through with crimson.

"Sir, we need to get you to a hospital!"

Nathan ignored him. "Investigate Isabella's connection to Vincent Kemnis."

Victor hesitated. "What about Madam Roland..."

Nathan closed his eyes briefly.

Gregory Valentine was still watching like a vulture.

It wasn't time yet.

The elevator doors closed.

Blood snaked across the metal floor like a serpent.
###Chapter 423

Adrian Valentine's stern expression remained unyielding. "Unnecessary."

Victor Ashcroft stared at his bloodstained oxfords, brows furrowed.

The man was stubborn as a mule.

A sudden idea struck him.

"Sir, if you become crippled, Madam will dislike you even more."

A flicker passed through Adrian's eyes. His gaze dropped to the blood seeping through his leather shoes.

This was the punishment he deserved.

"To the hospital." He couldn't... risk his wife's disdain again.

Victor exhaled in relief. Invoking Madam always worked.

"Also, keep investigating the mastermind behind Isabella Langley's kidnapping at the beach and the attack on my wife."

He'd suspected the old matriarch, but it wasn't her.

The perpetrator had disrupted the entire chessboard with one move.

Victor was already on it, though leads were scarce.

The elevator doors opened. Victor drove Adrian to the nearest Sterling Manor Hospital.

Gabrielle Flores happened to be bringing little Felicia for her vaccination.

Their paths crossed unexpectedly in the elevator.

Gabrielle's nose twitched at the metallic scent. She shot a disgusted look at Adrian's bloodied shoes.

But the toddler in her arms stretched tiny hands toward him excitedly.

"Up... up..." The single syllable dripped with baby sweetness.

Adrian froze. He hadn't expected to encounter this little one.

"Felicia." He grasped her pudgy fingers and lifted her gently.

Gabrielle stamped her foot. "Felicia Roland! I raise you every day, yet you prefer a stranger?"

Her eyes reddened instantly.

Adrian's gaze sharpened. "Her name is Felicia Roland?"

Gabrielle paled, realizing her slip.

"My husband's surname is Roland." She snatched the child back coldly, hurrying out as the doors opened.

Felicia peered over Gabrielle's shoulder, arms still reaching. A sudden hollowness gripped Adrian's chest.

This child inexplicably softened him every time.

Victor gasped. "Sir, that girl resembles you remarkably."

Adrian scowled. "Nonsense."

He was a Valentine!

Yet Felicia's appearance had undeniably lifted his spirits.

Victor rubbed his nose. He wasn't wrong.

"We're here."

He moved to assist, but Adrian brushed him off.

Victor: "..."

He'd just changed into this suit.

When the doctor instructed Adrian to remove his shoes, the room collectively gasped.

White socks were saturated crimson, fresh blood still oozing.

Victor winced in sympathy.

The physician regarded Adrian like some mythical creature.

Was the man forged from steel?
###Chapter 424

Victor knelt on one knee, gently removing the white socks from Adrian's feet.

Three toenails had been torn off. The wound on his big toe still oozed blood.

"Jesus—"

Victor sucked in a sharp breath just looking at it. The pain seemed to radiate through his own body.

The doctor gave Adrian an impressed glance before picking up the antiseptic to clean the wounds.

As the three nails were fully removed, Victor turned away from the gruesome sight to fetch slippers.

"Wear these and rest. Change the dressing every three days," the doctor said after bandaging the injuries. "Now go next door for an IV."

Adrian's brow furrowed. "Just prescribe medication."

The doctor frowned. "You need a tetanus shot."

"Medication." Adrian's tone brooked no argument.

With a sigh, the doctor scribbled a prescription. "Take this three times daily. Follow up in three days."

Victor returned just then, placing the slippers by Adrian's feet.

He took the medicine bag and helped Adrian leave the antiseptic-smelling hospital.

Victor hated hospitals. As a child, his mother had borrowed money from relatives to pay for his treatments—only to face their scorn.

Inside the car, Adrian's hoarse voice broke the silence. "Any news of her?"

Victor glanced at him through the rearview mirror. "Sir, I only went to buy slippers."

What could he possibly uncover in that short time?

"But Warren sent word—Vincent pinned everything on Dominic. Dominic might get the death penalty."

Adrian smirked. "He thinks he'll walk away unscathed?"

"Release the evidence of his bribery with Mr. Yu."

Victor tightened his grip on the steering wheel. "Understood."

"Wait until the day after tomorrow." Adrian narrowed his eyes. "Tomorrow, leak Isabella and Warren's affair first."

Victor's hands jerked.

This would only deepen the misunderstanding.

They'd used Isabella to investigate his father's old case. Now Evelyn was convinced Adrian had conspired with Isabella to kill Christian.

"Sir, about Evelyn—"

Adrian closed his eyes, his Adam's apple bobbing.

He hadn't believed her when it mattered most.

He didn't deserve her.

"Hire the best lawyer," he said, voice trembling slightly.

Victor hesitated.

He'd already taken care of that long ago.
###Chapter 425

Isabella dragged her exhausted body back to the mansion.

Vincent and Eleanor sat on the living room sofa.

The anesthesia in Eleanor's system had worn off, but Vincent had given her special medication. She could barely walk, unable to speak or care for herself. Even eating required assistance from the maid.

The ruby necklace had long been reclaimed by Isabella, now securely locked in her bedroom safe.

Since this mother refused to acknowledge her, Isabella wouldn't let her have anything.

Eleanor lowered her eyes silently as Isabella entered.

Isabella walked straight to Vincent and sat beside him. "Dad, Adrian knows everything. He's uncovered all our secrets. The only thing he doesn't know is that Christian's death was planned by me, Mom, and Margaret."

"He still believes Evelyn is the killer, yet he hasn't exposed us."

Vincent narrowed his eyes, his expression calculating.

He rested his hands on the armrests, radiating intimidation.

With a cold smirk, he turned to his daughter. "Since it wasn't revealed back then, let's expose Evelyn as Christian's murderer now. We'll take control of the Lefèvre family while we're at it."

"That bastard Vincent Kemnis has some skills, but he's ultimately insignificant."

A murderous glint flashed in Isabella's eyes. "Dad, if you'd told me the truth earlier, I wouldn't have chosen Adrian. Someone like Sebastian Cortez would have been more suitable for me. We wouldn't have failed so spectacularly. I'm so disappointed in you. How could you get involved with a vulgar woman like Margaret—"

She abruptly stopped.

After all, she herself had crawled out of that vulgar woman's womb.

Eleanor shot Isabella a mocking glance.

Both mother and daughter were disasters.

Enraged by the look, Isabella suddenly stood and kicked Eleanor in the abdomen.

Eleanor curled up in pain, gasping for breath.

Vincent exploded with fury, leaping to his feet. "Isabella! She may not be your birth mother, but she's Harrison's mother and my wife! Touch her again, and I won't be merciful!"

Isabella sneered. "I genuinely treated her as my mother, yet she mocked me. Dad, do you know how much I loved this mother? Beautiful and capable. It's all your fault for revealing the truth. Now Mom and I can never go back to how we were."

Isabella clutched her head in agony. Her complex personality contained both kindness and darkness.

She had once been so happy to have such a perfect mother.

Suddenly, Isabella threw herself into Eleanor's arms, sobbing. "Mom, why aren't you my real mother? I loved you so much."

She abruptly pulled back, gripping Eleanor's shoulders fiercely. "Mom, be my mother alone from now on, okay? Don't look for your real daughter. I'll take good care of you."

Eleanor stared coldly at the deranged Isabella. But to survive and see her daughter again, she had to endure the humiliation.

With tears in her eyes, she nodded. She knew Isabella's methods well—killing without bloodshed was her specialty.

Isabella beamed with joy. "Thank you, Mom! Only this way can your real daughter grow up safely."

Eleanor's heart lurched. Did Isabella already know who her daughter was?

Vincent seized the opportunity. Remembering he needed Eleanor's cooperation tomorrow, his tone softened. "Eleanor, as long as you behave and never mention that matter again, I promise your daughter's safety. Take good care of Isabella from now on, and I'll give you the antidote."

Eleanor stared at this hypocritical man, her stomach churning.

She knew Vincent had some genuine affection for her—after all, her face brought him prestige.

Thinking of tomorrow's award ceremony where her mother's presence was required, Isabella also coaxed gently. "Mom, if you agree, I promise your daughter will be safe. Just nod if you're willing."

###Chapter 426 

Eleanor Langley nodded slowly. She was willing to pay any price to find her biological daughter.

Adrian Valentine had already uncovered the truth. The murderer who killed his father was none other than Vincent Langley.

Yet Vincent remained unshaken.

Dominic Lombardi would take the fall for everything.

The old case left no evidence behind. Adrian had no way to touch Vincent.

Reporting to the police was useless, but she knew Adrian wouldn’t let this go.

She only needed to wait patiently. One day, she would reunite with her daughter.

Seeing her hesitation, Vincent quickly handed her the antidote.

After taking it, he spoke solemnly, "Eleanor, even if you won’t consider me, think of our son. He’s returning home soon. Do you want him to come back to nothing?"

Eleanor scoffed inwardly.

Did he really think he only had one son?

Vincent had sowed his wild oats in his youth, especially with that influential man’s daughter. If that connection were acknowledged, Vincent’s status would skyrocket.

Their son had a bright future ahead.

As for Isabella, that madwoman—her fate was already sealed.

"For our son’s sake, I won’t say anything. That day… I was just too angry about you and Margaret—"

She trailed off.

Right now, protecting their son was all that mattered.

If Adrian moved against Vincent, she and their son would suffer too.

"But Adrian already knows. You’d better be careful."

She deliberately glanced at Isabella. "Darling, you didn’t say anything reckless in front of Adrian, did you?"

A man like Vincent could kill even his own family.

Isabella had to die.

Vincent’s cold gaze fixed on Isabella.

She shook her head frantically. "Mother, I didn’t say a word."

Eleanor was surprised.

Vincent relaxed slightly. "If Adrian won’t side with us, he’s the enemy."

He warned Isabella, "Stay away from him from now on!"

The truth cut like a knife. Isabella’s eyes burned with unshed tears.

So Adrian had been using her all along.

She had schemed against him, but he had outmaneuvered her.

Thinking of Christian Lefèvre, Isabella stood and headed upstairs.

She’d already given all the evidence to Vincent Kemnis. If he couldn’t even handle Evelyn Roland, he didn’t deserve the Lefèvre inheritance.

Eleanor watched her leave before murmuring, "Control your daughter. Don’t let her drag my son down."

In this house, she trusted no one.

When interests were at stake, true colors showed.

Once, she had treated Isabella as her own. Now she saw the girl’s true nature—

Even more ruthless than herself.

Vincent patted her shoulder. "Don’t worry. I won’t let her cause more trouble."

His daughter’s actions could ruin him too.
###Chapter 427

Eleanor Langley looked down at Vincent Langley with years of suppressed hatred burning in her eyes.

"For our son, I've endured all these years—even swallowed the fact that you switched our daughter at birth." Her nails dug deep into her palms.

"But Isabella has gone too far this time. If she dares to ruin you and our son, don't blame me for tearing off the mask."

She turned and climbed the stairs, her back rigid with resolve.

Vincent narrowed his eyes. With the election looming, he had no energy to pacify this hysterical woman.

She wouldn't dare make waves—not when their son's future was at stake.

A pity about Mandy Gu. His throat tightened at the thought of the woman who had been so pliant, so obedient in his bed.

A caged songbird he'd kept for years.

Too bad she'd hatched a bastard.

Traitors deserved death.

But this worked out perfectly. Mandy would make an excellent scapegoat. He trusted no one—only the leverage he held over them.

He smirked and dialed his lawyer. Adrian wanted the culprit? Fine. He'd hand over Mandy.

......

The Roscente mansion blazed with light.

Margaret Lefèvre clutched a handkerchief, her face ashen after hearing Julian's analysis.

"So... my son was used as a pawn?" Her voice trembled.

Julian sat in his wheelchair, vacant eyes fixed on nothing. Years ago, he and his circle had sneered at Evelyn, deeming her unworthy of Adrian.

And now?

Isabella had nearly cost him his life.

"From the Ashcrofts to the Roscentes, the mastermind is the same." Julian tapped the coffee table. "Isabella's playing puppet master."

Margaret shot to her feet, her handbag tumbling to the floor. Suddenly, her husband's abrupt decision to let his bastard son take over the case made sense.

"That bitch!" She ground her teeth. "My son's barely cold in his grave, and they—"

Madame Roscente steadied her. "You must act fast. That illegitimate son is waiting to steal your place."

Margaret's vision darkened. Grief had blinded her for two years, allowing that bastard Vincent Kemnis to slip through the cracks.

......

Gabrielle gently closed the nursery door.

She stormed into the basement and kicked the man lying unconscious on the medical bed.

"Christian Lefèvre!" Her eyes burned as she hissed, "How long will you keep sleeping? Your mother's being pushed aside by your bastard brother!"

The heart monitor spiked violently.
###Chapter 428

Gabrielle Flores clenched her chest in frustration.

She yanked the blanket off Christian and shoved her phone in his face.

"See this? Surveillance footage of Isabella Langley testifying against my sister in court!"

"She kept claiming you were dead, but my sister saved your life!"

Gabrielle jabbed the screen with a snarl.

"Three years playing dead. Do you have any idea how much chaos you've caused?"

"Isabella and your dear friend Adrian Valentine are teaming up to destroy my sister!"

She leaned down, her breath hot against his ear.

"Your mother visited last week. She collapsed sobbing in the hallway."

"Your father brought his bastard son here, threatening to pull your life support."

A cold laugh escaped her lips.

"Should I do it for them right now?"

Her fingers hovered over the ventilator tube.

The underground lab was deathly silent.

Gabrielle's hand froze mid-air before slamming onto the bed rail.

"Pathetic!"

She turned to leave but whirled back abruptly.

"Christian Lefèvre, listen carefully."

"If my sister gets convicted tomorrow..."

Her words dripped with venom.

"...I'll make sure you never wake up."

The flashlight beam swept across Christian's pallid face.

Gabrielle stormed out, the door crashing shut behind her.

A single tear traced the unconscious man's temple.

......

Top floor of Lunaris Group headquarters.

Sebastian Orlando slid a dossier across the desk to Sophia Blanchet.

"New evidence proving Isabella perjured herself."

Sophia flipped through pages rapidly. "Not enough. We need irrefutable proof."

"What about Christian—"

Sebastian shook his head. "Too risky right now."

Storm clouds loomed over the cityscape beyond the floor-to-ceiling windows.

Meanwhile...

Valentine Mansion.

Victor Ashcroft burst into the study where Adrian Valentine stared blankly at a wedding portrait.

"Sir, emergency!"

Adrian didn't look up. "Vincent Langley made another move?"

"Manqi confessed!" Victor panted. "She's taking full blame for the twenty-year-old case!"

Adrian finally lifted his gaze.

Bloodshot eyes gleamed under the lamplight.

"Should've seen this coming."

His lips twisted into a mirthless smile.

"That old fox Vincent..."

Victor stomped in agitation. "The trial starts tomorrow! What about Madam?"

Adrian rose slowly.

"Get the car ready."

"We're going to the prison."
###Chapter 429 

Adrian Valentine's slender fingers tapped rhythmically on the desk, his gaze sharp as a blade. "She refuses to see me?"

Victor Ashcroft wiped the fine beads of sweat from his forehead. "Sir, you and Mrs. Valentine have already—"

"Divorced?" Adrian cut him off with a cold laugh. "Who told you that?"

Victor's pupils constricted sharply.

"But the divorce certificate—"

"Fake." The word slipped from Adrian's thin lips.

Victor nearly bit his tongue.

His boss never played by the rules.

"Mrs. Valentine agreed to meet," Victor forced out. "But you should probably explain—"

Adrian stood, his black trench coat gleaming under the harsh lights. "She won't believe me."

Forty minutes later.

The fluorescent lights in the interrogation room stung Evelyn Roland's eyes.

She watched Adrian's slight limp with a mocking curl of her lips. "Here to seek justice for Isabella?"

Adrian sat across from her, his gaze burning. "I did see you set that fire."

Evelyn's fingers twitched.

"So you and Isabella set me up?" Her voice turned icy. "Just to force the divorce?"

Adrian's Adam's apple bobbed. "No—"

"Then why?" Evelyn slammed her palms on the table as she stood. "Wasn't losing everything enough? Do you need me dead too?"

Tear tracks glistened on her pale face under the lights.

Adrian's heart twisted violently.

He reached to wipe her tears—only to have his hand slapped away.

"Don't touch me!" Evelyn took two steps back. "We were over the moment you chose to believe Isabella."

Adrian's hand froze midair.

"That fire..." His voice turned hoarse. "I'll prove it to you."

Evelyn turned with a bitter laugh. "Don't bother."

The metal door clanged shut behind her.

Adrian stared at her retreating figure, his eyes darkening.

Victor entered cautiously. "Sir—"

"Investigate Isabella." Adrian bit out each word. "Start from three years ago."

Outside, the storm raged on.
###Chapter 430

Adrian Valentine swallowed hard under Evelyn Roland's mocking gaze.

Every explanation stuck in his throat.

He knew she wouldn't believe him.

She was convinced he had conspired with Isabella Langley to kill Christian Lefèvre.

"I never knew Christian was Isabella's boyfriend," Adrian rasped. "All I saw was you lighting the fire before the explosion happened."

"I was injured and unconscious. When I woke up, Christian was already..." He paused. "And you were unharmed."

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly.

So his insistence on divorce wasn't just because of Isabella—he had witnessed her "committing murder."

"Finished?" She lifted her eyes. "You can leave now."

Her heart had turned to ice.

No explanation would matter anymore.

"Darling, the fire was Isabella's doing." Adrian suddenly stood up, his usual careless demeanor returning. "I'll get you out of here."

Evelyn scoffed. "Don't bother. The moment I'm free, you and Isabella will be my first lawsuit."

"You hate me that much?" He narrowed his eyes.

"I loved you once." Her voice was light. "On the day we divorced, I saw the two of you in the office—"

"I never touched her!" Adrian cut in sharply.

He immediately regretted it.

Evelyn didn't even spare him a glance. "Too cowardly to admit it, Mr. Valentine?"

"We're over." She turned away. "Don't come near me again."

The door slammed shut.

A cold smile curved Evelyn's lips.

Adrian claimed he saw her light the fire?

But by the time she arrived, the flames were already out of control.

Who had he really seen?

The evidence Vincent Kemnis held was likely this very "eyewitness testimony."

Isabella had played her cards brilliantly.

Two men dancing to her tune—

One adored her beyond reason.

The other died for her.

Evelyn closed her eyes.

Three days would be enough for Sophia Blanchet to uncover the truth.

......

Inside the black sedan.

Victor Ashcroft asked cautiously, "Did Mrs. Roland—"

"Doesn't believe me." Adrian massaged his temples.

Victor barely suppressed an eye roll.

Wasn't that obvious?

"To the Lefèvre residence." Adrian suddenly ordered.

The car turned and vanished into the night.

###Chapter 431

Warren Garten was dragged into the dim basement by two black-suited bodyguards.

The damp air carried a faint metallic scent of blood.

Isabella Langley lounged lazily on the leather sofa, her slip dress accentuating every curve.

A slender cigarette dangled between her fingers as she watched him through the haze with venomous eyes.

"Kneel." A bodyguard kicked the back of Warren's knees.

He grunted as his knees hit the cold marble floor.

Isabella rose slowly, her stilettos clicking sharply against the stone.

Slap!

Her palm cracked across Warren's face.

"Bella—"

"Silence!" Her voice turned shrill. "Who gave you permission to film those videos?"

Beads of sweat formed on Warren's forehead.

He knew exactly what Isabella was capable of.

"I missed you too much..." His voice trembled. "They were locked in my safe..."

Isabella smirked before delivering another stinging slap.

Blood trickled from the corner of Warren's mouth.

"Then explain how Adrian Valentine got his hands on them." She gripped his chin. "You've ruined me."

Warren suddenly smiled—a broken, desperate thing.

"If beating me helps, I'll gladly take it."

Her fingers twitched against his jaw.

She'd always been weak to this act.

The bodyguards discreetly exited.

Isabella traced the angry red mark on Warren's cheek.

"Does it hurt?"

He caught her hand and pressed it to his chest.

"Not as much as this does."

Her gaze darkened with something primal.

She needed release.

...

The next evening, spotlights crisscrossed the Golden Phoenix Awards ceremony.

This year's Best Actress race was particularly fierce.

The nominees list prominently featured Isabella Langley and Scarlett Orlando.

Scarlett claimed the trophy for her period drama Splendid Weave.

While Isabella—only two years into her career—had secured a nomination.

Industry insiders whispered about the strings pulled behind the scenes.

Vincent Langley had poured fortunes into paving his daughter's path.

With the Valentine Group's discreet maneuvering.

Every scandal about Isabella had been buried without a trace.

On the red carpet, Isabella dazzled in haute couture, outshining every star.

No one suspected last night's basement frenzy.

Or noticed the faint bruises peeking above her collar.

###Chapter 432

The entertainment industry's grandest gala was being broadcast live under a sky full of twinkling stars.

The banquet hall glittered with celebrities, each meticulously styled under the flashing camera lights.

Evelyn Roland remained confined near the greenroom, watching Isabella Langley's award acceptance through the wall-mounted television screen.

Scarlett Orlando claimed the Best Actress trophy once again, and Evelyn felt genuine happiness for her friend.

But the night's real drama was just beginning.

As Isabella stood bathed in the spotlight, no one suspected she was moments away from her life's greatest upheaval.

The live stream's comment section erupted.

[Isabella's look tonight is divine! That gown makes her look like an actual goddess!]

[Drop the dress link! I need it NOW!]

Scarlett's fans quickly retaliated.

[How does a gold-digging hack like Isabella deserve this? Scarlett's the real talent here!]

[Word is Isabella uses stand-ins for every scene and can't even memorize lines. And she wins awards for this?]

Onstage, Isabella cradled her trophy with a radiant smile.

She smirked inwardly—her father's bribes had paid off spectacularly.

Scarlett watched coldly from the audience before turning to the white-suited man beside her.

Lucien Valentine looked devastatingly handsome in his ivory tuxedo.

"Justice arrives tonight," Scarlett murmured.

Lucien's icy gaze remained fixed on Isabella.

"Let the world see her for what she truly is."

As the host announced the classic film retrospective segment, the giant screen flickered to life—and gasps filled the room.

The speakers pulsed with unmistakable moans.

"Warren...harder..."

"Adrian Valentine could never satisfy you like this, could he?"

Dead silence.

Scarlett and Lucien exchanged stunned glances.

This wasn't the evidence they'd prepared.

The live stream exploded.

[NUCLEAR TEA! Isabella's cheating!]

[Adrian got played!]

[Hollywood's messiest scandal yet!]

The bombshells kept coming.

The screen now showed a diamond-ringed hand sliding a card across a table.

"Take this. Lucien's car will pass here at..."

Isabella's voice rang out crystal clear.

The audience erupted.

A sea of shocked expressions spread through the star-studded crowd.

Onstage, Isabella stood frozen—her face drained of all color.

###Chapter 433

Lucien Valentine's fans were seething with rage.

[The truth about our idol's car accident is finally out! Isabella Langley must pay for her crimes!]

[If anything happens to Lucien, I'll be the first to make Isabella suffer!]

[Isabella Langley should be banned from the entertainment industry! A viper like her doesn't deserve to be a celebrity!]

The comment section exploded.

"Her messy personal life was bad enough, but hiring a hitman? Unforgivable!"

"Hasn't she done enough harm? Didn't she put Cassandra Valentine in the hospital?"

"She thinks she can get away with anything because of her father and fiancé."

"Someone like her should've been blacklisted years ago!"

Public opinion turned overwhelmingly against Isabella.

Her face drained of color as she trembled uncontrollably.

She couldn’t believe her secrets had been exposed.

"This can't be real... It's all lies! You're framing me!"

Hysterically, she pointed at Scarlett Orlando and Lucien Valentine.

"It's you two! You're behind this!"

Lucien stepped forward, his gaze icy.

"So my accident was your doing—just to steal my project?"

His words ignited the room.

Isabella's mask shattered, her face twisting with rage.

"Why didn't you just die, Lucien? Why come back to ruin me?"

She turned to Scarlett, venom dripping from her glare.

"And you—you're just as vile as Evelyn Roland! I won’t let either of you get away with this!"

Realizing her career was over, she shoved through the crowd and fled.

Reporters chased after her.

Warren Garten's car idled at the entrance.

Isabella scrambled inside, only to see Adrian Valentine and Victor Ashcroft emerging through the window.

Adrian smirked at her, and in that moment, she understood everything.

The reporters spotted Adrian and swarmed him.

"Mr. Valentine, what's your response to Isabella's infidelity?"

He arched a brow. "When did I ever confirm she was my girlfriend?"

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

He continued, "The engagement was entirely fabricated by her and my adoptive mother."

"While we're at it—my adoptive mother has been arrested for my father's murder."

"And Isabella? She's her biological daughter."

His statement sealed Isabella's fate.

She collapsed against the seat, as if struck by lightning.

The reporters buzzed with excitement, but Adrian was already walking away with Victor.
###Chapter 434

Evelyn watched Adrian's retreating figure with a cold smirk.

The man didn't even have the courage to acknowledge their relationship.

She must have been blind back then.

At least she'd cut her losses in time. Being single suited her far better now.

"Ahhh—" Isabella's piercing scream erupted from the live broadcast.

Lucien's fans waved their support banners wildly as they pelted her with rotten eggs and cola.

Her meticulously styled hair dripped with egg yolk. The expensive gown was soaked in sticky soda.

A surge of satisfaction washed over Evelyn.

This woman who'd schemed against her so many times was finally getting her comeuppance.

Isabella shrieked as Eleanor shielded her into a waiting car.

The vehicle sped away from the furious mob, leaving the chaotic scene behind.

Lucien's fans were notorious for their relentless fervor.

The award-winning actor never relied on scandals or publicity stunts—his talent spoke for itself.

Evelyn's brow furrowed.

Where were the police?

She'd specifically arranged for Isabella's arrest.

Had the woman actually escaped?

Still, she'd done what needed to be done.

Christian's true identity must be exposed by now.

Sophia would handle the aftermath.

Tonight would be spent in a detention cell.

Oddly, Evelyn welcomed the solitude. A good night's sleep sounded perfect.

......

Adrian stormed into Horizon Tech with Victor close behind.

Nathan and Sophia were deep in emergency discussions about securing Evelyn's release.

"Let me post bail," Nathan said anxiously, wringing his hands. "We can't leave the boss suffering in there."

Sophia shook her head. "She specifically said she wants to stay all three days."

Nathan's eyes widened. "Who actually enjoys jail time?"

Their boss always had to be unconventional.

"What's wrong with her own damn bed?" he muttered in confusion.

Sophia shrugged. "Since when does she need reasons for her decisions?"

Suddenly, Nathan snapped his fingers. "I get it now!"

"Get what?" Sophia raised an eyebrow.

"She's hiding from the drama." Nathan slapped his thigh. "With Isabella and Adrian's scandal blowing up everywhere, jail's the only place she can sleep peacefully."

Sophia: "......"

###Chapter 435

Nathan Aldridge tapped the table lightly with his fingers. "Her favorite saying—don't waste emotions on meaningless things. Right now, I bet she'd rather lock herself in the lab for days."

Sophia Blanchet scoffed. "Since when do you know my sister so well? I've already leaked the news to the Lefèvres. Isabella Langley was Christian Lefèvre's girlfriend. His death is tied to her and Adrian Valentine. But the Lefèvre patriarch cowered the moment he heard Adrian's name. Too scared to avenge his own son?"

She slammed her palm on the table. "Every piece of evidence I found points to those two snakes! Surveillance shows Isabella fled with Adrian, leaving my sister behind to handle the mess. Disgusting!"

Her cheeks flushed with anger. Nathan wisely stayed silent.

Bang—

The door was kicked open.

Backlit by the hallway light, Adrian Valentine strode in. His black trench coat accentuated his tall frame, each step radiating dominance.

Nathan instantly shed his casual demeanor, his gaze sharp as a blade. "To what do we owe this unexpected visit, Mr. Valentine?"

Adrian took a seat without invitation, interlacing his long fingers. "I didn't kill Christian Lefèvre."

Sophia sneered. "Empty words mean nothing. The footage shows you and Isabella were both at the scene!"

"We saw Evelyn Roland light the fire," Adrian said, his piercing gaze unwavering. "I'm here for answers."

Sophia's fingers twitched.

Nathan shot to his feet. "Bullshit! The surveillance proves you two entered two minutes earlier. By the time Evelyn arrived, the fire had already started. At least come up with a believable lie!"

His fists clenched audibly. "If it weren't for the children, you'd be in a hospital bed right now."

Adrian remained unruffled. "The Lefèvres have clear footage of Evelyn igniting the flames."

"You son of a—" Nathan lunged forward.

Adrian calmly adjusted his cufflinks. "From the day we married, she became Mrs. Valentine. Do you have an issue with that title?"

Sophia let out a bitter laugh. "Suffering from amnesia, Mr. Valentine? All of Vienna knows your precious darling is Isabella."

The air turned glacial.

Adrian's eyes darkened. "I'll handle this matter."

A cool voice cut through from the doorway. "No need to trouble yourself, Mr. Valentine."

Sebastian Orlando leaned against the frame, his white coat still stained with blood.

###Chapter 436

Adrian Valentine's eyes turned glacial as he recognized the newcomer.

Sebastian Orlando strode into the office with effortless grace, every movement exuding the refinement of old money.

He took the seat across from Adrian, his gaze calm as still water.

Both men radiated untamed arrogance. Adrian's smile held a razor's edge of disdain.

Sebastian appeared more overtly flamboyant, yet closer inspection revealed an undercurrent of scholarly poise.

Sophia Blanchet immediately rose to prepare coffee for Sebastian—a deliberate snub meant for Adrian.

Adrian barely glanced at the petty display, his spine straightening as regal authority emanated from his posture. He stood slowly, locking eyes with Sebastian. "Mr. Orlando, my wife's affairs are none of your concern."

Murderous intent flashed in Sebastian's peach-blossom eyes.

"I don't interfere with rescue missions, Mr. Valentine. But your wife Isabella was just humiliated. If you wanted to save her, you should've acted sooner." His voice dripped with sarcasm.

Tension crackled through the office.

Nathan Aldridge and Sophia Blanchet shivered under the oppressive atmosphere. The clash between these two titans was terrifying.

Nathan gritted his teeth. Why did he feel more agitated than the actual parties involved?

Adrian's cold laugh carried a dangerous allure. He dismissed Sebastian's provocation with icy indifference.

As he left, he calculated—Victor Ashcroft should have succeeded by now.

Sebastian watched Adrian's retreating figure, pensive. Why this sudden interest in Isabella's predicament?

Turning back, he resumed discussing bail procedures with Nathan.

In the lab, Gabrielle Flores continued berating Christian Lefèvre, vowing to "wake him up" within three days.

By the time Adrian reached the building's exit, Victor stood waiting beside the car.

"Did you get it?" Adrian quickened his pace.

His earlier diversion had allowed Victor to infiltrate Sophia's computer for evidence.

Victor nodded. Another masterstroke from the CEO.

But one question lingered. "Sir, why did Mrs. Valentine refuse bail?"

Adrian's lips pressed into a thin line at the memory. "We move tonight. Expose Vincent Langley's bribery scandal—keep him too busy to target my wife."

Victor handed over an encrypted drive.

Adrian accepted it, leaning back with lethal calm. Ice glinted in his eyes.

"To the office."

The engine roared to life at Victor's command.

###Chapter 437

Eleanor Langley tightly gripped her daughter's arm as she escorted Isabella Langley back to their family mansion.

Termination notices flooded in from major brands, voiding all of Isabella's endorsement contracts.

Vincent Langley shattered his phone against the wall after receiving the final cancellation call. His massive investments in his daughter's career had been destroyed by a mere chauffeur.

He refused to let his carefully cultivated heir fall from grace.

The PR team scrambled to contain the scandal, but Isabella's disgrace had already spread like wildfire across the city.

As Vincent seethed with rage, Eleanor entered the living room with Isabella and Warren Garten.

Vincent swung his fist at Warren the moment he saw him.

"Father!" Isabella stepped between them. "I have a solution to salvage this—and turn it to our advantage."

Warren dropped to his knees, his burning gaze shifting from Isabella to Vincent. "Mr. Langley, my feelings for Isabella are genuine. A marriage announcement would silence all rumors."

"Adrian Valentine has publicly denied any relationship with Isabella, claiming it was all Margaret Valentine's publicity stunt. Our engagement would rewrite the narrative."

"As for Lucien Valentine, the video only shows Isabella's hands. Without concrete evidence, we can easily pin this on someone else."

Eleanor chimed in, "Vincent, this is our best option. Warren has been with Isabella for years—he's loyal. This could elevate her career while resolving the crisis."

Isabella's eyes flashed with venom. "That hypocrite Adrian claimed to love me, yet abandoned me when I needed him most. Father, I will make him pay."

Vincent weighed his options. This was their only viable path forward. He wouldn't let decades of planning go to waste.

"Go change your clothes!" Vincent glared at his disheveled daughter. "I'll send the stylist up. You'll take engagement photos for the official announcement."

"I'll handle Lucien Valentine." Vincent's voice turned icy. "A mere actor dares challenge me?"

Isabella headed upstairs. Suddenly, Vincent drove his fist into Warren's face.

Warren took the blow without flinching, secretly triumphant. His carefully preserved video had worked better than expected.

"Chairman," Warren wiped blood from his lips, "I'm more suited to Isabella than Adrian ever was. For your empire, I'll be your sharpest blade."

"You've seen my capabilities. Given the chance, I'll help you claim that throne."

The words struck Vincent's ambition. He studied Warren—this young man possessed far more ruthlessness than Adrian.

"Fine." Vincent finally relented. "After the photoshoot, you'll deal with Lucien immediately."

###Chapter 438

A bombshell news story exploded across the internet.

Isabella Langley held an emergency press conference.

Under the flashing cameras, her makeup was flawless but her eyes brimmed with tears. She bowed deeply to the cameras. "I owe everyone an apology."

Her voice trembled as she explained, "My relationship with Adrian Valentine was purely a business arrangement. The man who's truly been by my side all these years is Warren Garten—the one in the video."

"As for the Lucien Valentine case, the police have already caught the real culprit. That woman who sounded like me was actually his obsessive stalker."

Isabella bowed again, tears streaming down her face.

Beside her, Warren stood tall in his tailored suit, gently wiping her tears away.

[Oh my God! Isabella was framed!]
[Warren is so handsome. Now that's true love.]
[Faking a relationship is just disgusting.]

Public opinion shifted once again.

At Regal Heights, Scarlett Orlando threw her phone in fury.

"Is this woman unkillable?"

Victoria Laurent handed her a cup of floral tea. "That's just how showbiz works. This stunt with Adrian and Isabella just catapulted her to A-list status."

Scarlett scoffed. "She'll do anything for fame."

Her greater concern was Evelyn Roland, locked away in detention.

Inside the detention center, Evelyn lay on the hard cot, scrolling through her phone.

Watching Isabella's tearful confession, she let out a derisive laugh.

"Darling."

Evelyn bolted upright.

Outside the iron bars, Adrian stood in his signature white attire, smiling tenderly.

A police officer unlocked the cell door.

Victor Ashcroft entered, arms laden with thick blankets.
###Chapter 439

Evelyn remained silent.

She came here for quiet contemplation.

Not for a vacation.

Victor entered carrying a plush down comforter, wearing an ingratiating smile. "Madam, the bed is too hard. I brought you an extra blanket."

He hesitated before adding, "This was my own initiative. Mr. Valentine had nothing to do with it."

Evelyn glanced at the bare wooden bed and gave a slight nod.

Her body ached from the uncomfortable surface.

"Thank you," she said flatly.

Victor's eyes brightened.

Leaning against the wall, Evelyn looked breathtakingly beautiful. Her half-lidded peach blossom eyes held a mesmerizing allure.

"You're too kind, Madam. You've helped me far more than this in the past."

The corner of Evelyn's lips lifted slightly before she fell silent again.

Adrian shot Victor a cold glare sharp enough to cut glass.

Victor stiffened.

What had he done to earn the boss's ire this time?

He tactfully retreated, closing the door behind him.

Adrian meticulously smoothed out the bedding before sitting beside Evelyn.

"Shall we talk?" His voice was low.

Evelyn remained against the wall, her lazy posture unable to conceal her innate nobility.

"About what?"

Adrian's Adam's apple bobbed.

He took a deep breath. "The divorce—first to protect you, second to investigate my father's death."

"Isabella is Vincent's daughter. I only got close to her for the case. Nothing happened between us. What you saw that day was an act."

Evelyn's expression remained placid.

She had already deduced as much.

"Does saying this now change anything?" She laughed softly. "You chose the most painful method."

Adrian's heart clenched.

Her calmness terrified him.

"You always think you're protecting me." Evelyn lifted her gaze. "But you never asked what I needed."

"To you, I'll always be the weakling who needs saving—a disposable accessory you can discard and reclaim at will."

Each word pierced the most hidden corners of his heart.

Adrian's face paled. "Is that really how you see me?"

###Chapter 440

Evelyn's gaze rested on the distant lake, her voice eerily calm. "Adrian, this is how you see me. Eyes never lie. Love is instinct, not faith. What you call trust is just disappointment in disguise."

"I gave you my whole heart once."

"A few photos were enough to convince you I betrayed you with Alexander. But Adrian, he was the brother I grew up with."

"His death is connected to Vincent. I have to uncover the truth."

"You brought me joy, then the deepest pain. Without status, I was just a plaything to you—here when summoned, gone when dismissed."

"I only cared about your feelings when we were together. Never minded what your friends thought of me. Those years, I shut everyone out except you."

"You came into my life the year after Alexander died. Your companionship helped me heal. For that, I'll always be grateful."

"I was seventeen when he left. The pain of losing someone who cherished me—you'll never understand."

"I didn't know Vincent was the killer when he came for me."

"The truth surfaced slowly. Isabella's appearance raised my suspicions."

"Let the past stay buried. Between us, it's long over. Your reasons mean nothing now."

"Dead feelings need no explanation."

Evelyn finally turned to Adrian.

That tranquil stare sent a tremor through him. Only a heart turned to stone could face old wounds with such detachment.

He seized her hand desperately. "Can't we try again?"

Words were pointless. She knew better than anyone.

Evelyn withdrew her hand gently, eyes like still water. "My heart died with our divorce. Let's wish each other peace."

She lay down to rest. Adrian recognized this annual melancholy.

Watching her closed eyelids, her face remained vivid in his memory. A storm of longing churned within him, but he left without disturbing her.

"Rest well. I'll visit tomorrow." He hurried out before she could refuse.

Outside, Victor took one look at his boss's stormy expression and knew the outcome.

Tsk. Too little, too late.

"Mr. Valentine," Victor sighed. "You can't fake love or play with hearts."

Adrian's icy glare silenced him. Victor pretended sudden interest in the skyline. Just friendly advice.

"Any leads on my wife's kidnappers?" Adrian snapped.

Victor shook his head frantically. Not another word—this man never forgot a slight.

"Mr. Orlando, your sister hasn't eaten. Please persuade her."

Adrian turned to see Sophia and Sebastian approaching. His frown deepened. What was he doing here?

Sebastian paused. "Didn't dinner get delivered? Evelyn refused it?"

Sophia looked troubled. "Tomorrow's Alexander's death anniversary. She barely eats this time every year."

The world outside was too loud. This lakeside retreat was her sanctuary.

Alexander's belongings slipped from his grasp, his face draining of color.
###Chapter 441

Sophia Blanchet bent down to pick up the scattered items.

Sebastian Orlando stood pale, his gaze unfocused.

"Mr. Orlando?" Sophia called tentatively.

Sebastian mechanically took the things from her hands. "Go back first."

Sophia pointed to the car parked nearby. "I'll stay tonight in case Evelyn is in danger."

Sebastian ignored her, carrying the bag inside. After just a few steps, he collided with Adrian Valentine.

"Adrian Valentine!" Sebastian's fury erupted instantly. "Evelyn doesn't want to see you!"

Adrian leaned lazily against the doorframe. "I'm here to see my wife. Do I need your permission?"

His tall figure blocked the path, radiating an unapproachable aura.

Sebastion threw the bag down and grabbed Adrian's collar. "Stay away from her! Or I'll make sure the Valentine Group disappears from Vienna!"

Adrian easily pried his fingers loose. "You're the one who should keep your distance."

"You dare talk about distance?" Sebastian sneered. "You hurt her the most!"

Adrian's pupils constricted sharply.

Without another word, Sebastian picked up the bag and strode into the police station.

Adrian straightened his collar and turned to Victor Ashcroft. "Go back first."

Victor shook his head. "I'll stay."

Adrian didn't insist, his gaze fixed on the police station doors. He knew tomorrow was Alexander Durand's death anniversary.

Sophia stood not far away, her phone screen illuminating the whitewashing news about Isabella Langley. She narrowed her eyes, scrolling through the flood of paid comments.

The silence from the Lefèvre family told her everything. Yesterday's visit had made it clear.

Inside the station, Sebastian called softly, "Evelyn, I'm here."
###Chapter 442

Sebastian Orlando pushed open the door to find Evelyn Roland curled up in the corner.

"Sebastian?" She looked up, surprise flickering in her eyes.

He lifted a takeout container. "Heard someone's on a hunger strike?"

Evelyn forced a smile. "I'm not hungry."

"Liar." Sebastian crouched before her. "Your right fingertips tremble when you lie."

Her fingers curled into fists.

A guard unlocked the iron gate as Sebastian entered with armfuls of bags.

"Did you raid the entire convenience store?" Evelyn eyed the array of food.

He arched a brow. "This is how an Orlando heir rolls. Understand?"

A genuine laugh escaped her lips.

Unwrapping the packaging, he slid steaming shrimp balls toward her. "Alexander used to say you hate wasting food."

Her hand froze mid-air.

"If he saw you like this—" Sebastian suddenly gripped her chin, "—it would break his heart."

Tears splashed onto the container.

"He promised to bring back diamonds..." Her voice cracked. "Liar."

Sebastian crushed her against his chest. Her tears soaked through his shirt.

"Shh..." His palm smoothed circles on her back. "I'm here."

The faint scent of cedar enveloped her—for a disorienting moment, she thought it was him.

Sebastian pressed a secret kiss to her hair.

"Eat." He thrust the container forward, leaving no room for refusal.

Evelyn took the chopsticks, chewing mechanically.

"Alexander always said—" Sebastian chuckled suddenly, "—you eat like a chipmunk."

She choked on her food.

"What else did he tell you?"

"Plenty." His gaze softened. "Like your fear of the dark, hatred of celery, that collection of three cabinets filled with snow globes..."

Her chopsticks hovered.

Dust-covered memories resurrected—New Year celebrations where elite families' children gathered in the old mansion's courtyard. Alexander Durand teasing her relentlessly while Sebastian read under the maple tree.

"So you both remembered..." she whispered.

Sebastian wiped a grain of rice from her lip. "Some people are impossible to forget."

Moonlight streamed through the window, illuminating their intertwined shadows.
###Chapter 443
"Mmm."

The tension in Evelyn's brow gradually eased. The scene of them sharing dinner was heartwarmingly tender.

Suddenly, Evelyn picked out a piece of fatty meat from her bowl.

Sebastian glanced at it and blurted out, "Evelyn, what's wrong with a little fat? Look how thin you are—a strong breeze could knock you over. This won't make you sick or gain weight. Eat it. Don't waste food."

Evelyn's chopsticks paused.

That tone, those words—they were identical to Alexander's.

Why did she keep having these illusions?

She looked up at Sebastian's profile as he focused on his meal and shook her head slightly.

Nearby, Adrian watched the scene with cold eyes, his knuckles turning white.

She had let Sebastian hold her.

His gaze darkened as he stared at the two laughing together in the dining room.

After dinner, Sebastian efficiently cleared the table and neatly folded the laundry.

"Evelyn, I'll pick you up tomorrow."

She shook her head. "Not yet. Isabella will make a move soon. Keep a close eye on the Lefèvre family. Christian's mother has no real power, and his sister is still too young. Right now, Vincent is in control. I suspect the evidence he has came from Isabella. They must be colluding."

Of course, she hadn't ruled out Adrian either.

Sebastian gently patted her shoulder. "Evelyn, I've already stationed people there. Get some rest. Don't overthink it."

She gave a small nod.

As soon as Sebastian stepped outside, he ran into Adrian, who had been waiting.

The two men locked eyes, tension crackling between them.

"Adrian, you and Isabella gave Vincent that arson footage to pin murder on Evelyn?" Sebastian's voice was icy with lethal intent. "Then I'll make sure you both pay with your lives."

Adrian frowned.

The murderous aura radiating from the other man was palpable.

"This has nothing to do with me. I told you—I'll save my own wife. I don't need your help."

Sebastian laughed, loud and mocking.

"Adrian, stop lying to yourself. I watched Evelyn grow up. I know her better than anyone. Once she decides she's done loving you, she'll never look back."

"Years ago, she married you in secret, forcing everyone to accept it. No one said a word then."

"But after how you've treated her now, you think you can just pick up where you left off? You're delusional."

With Adrian's face drained of color, Sebastian strode away.

Adrian felt as if he'd been plunged into an icy abyss.

He clenched his fists, the reality of Evelyn's resolve and indifference hitting him hard.

Those eyes that had once been filled with love now held nothing but calm detachment when they looked at him.

A wave of panic surged through him.

At the thought of Isabella, a ruthless glint flashed in his eyes.

When he returned to his car, Victor was crouched by the roadside, shoveling noodles into his mouth.

Spotting Adrian, he scrambled to his feet like an overworked employee.

Adrian's voice was frigid. "Release the evidence of Vincent's bribery."

Without another word, he got into the car and dialed Nathan's number.

Victor hastily finished his noodles and rushed off to arrange it.

Meanwhile, at the Langley mansion, Vincent was drinking merrily with Warren.

After several rounds, he staggered back to his room, drunk.

Eleanor was changing into her nightgown, her graceful figure partially visible.

Vincent's interest stirred, and after their intimacy, he fell asleep instantly.

But Eleanor tossed and turned, unable to sleep.

Her thoughts kept returning to the daughter she had lost years ago.

A news alert suddenly popped up on her phone.

When she opened it, her face paled in horror.

She shook her husband violently. "Vincent! Wake up! Something terrible has happened!"
###Chapter 444

Vincent Langley was sound asleep when Eleanor Langley's voice jolted him awake.

He rolled over with irritation, turning his back to his wife.

If it weren't about their son's future, she wouldn't bother with this mess.

She'd have peace if Vincent ended up in prison.

"Vincent! Wake up! It's an emergency!"

Eleanor's shout echoed through the bedroom.

Vincent bolted upright, his gaze dazed.

Recognizing his wife, his expression darkened. "What madness is this in the middle of the night?"

"My madness?" Eleanor scoffed. "Your bribery scandal with Mr. Yu has been exposed!"

Vincent snapped awake instantly.

His hands trembled as he took the phone, watching the viral video spreading online.

Thud!

He hurled the phone to the floor with brutal force.

All his careful planning, so close to success.

He should have been elected last year if not for the sabotage.

He'd suspected Adrian Valentine, but they had no direct conflict.

Vincent dressed hastily and stormed out of the room.

Eleanor picked up the phone—the screen was cracked but still functional.

She dialed Jonathan Savigny.

"Any news about our daughter?"

"Still searching," Jonathan replied gently. "I'll notify you the moment I hear anything."

After hanging up, Eleanor leaned against the headboard and scrolled through the news.

A headline flashed—Mr. Yu had been arrested.

But the report made no mention of the bribe money.

She smirked.

Someone was determined to ruin Vincent completely.
###Chapter 445

Isabella threw open the door, her fingers digging into the doorframe.

"Mom, Dad's been taken!" Her voice trembled.

Eleanor's teacup shattered on the floor, tea splashing across the tiles.

"So soon?"

"The police were waiting outside. They stormed in right after the news broke." Isabella's face was ghostly pale. "What do we do now?"

Eleanor clenched her fists, nails biting into her palms.

She knew Vincent couldn't escape this time.

"Only one path left." Her voice was hoarse.

Isabella grabbed her arm. "What is it?"

"He always has a backup plan." Eleanor's eyes darkened. "This time, he's on his own."

It meant returning to those suffocating days of darkness.

No. She refused.

Not after pouring her life into this for over a decade.

Isabella stumbled back, hitting the dresser.

"Mom, please save Dad!" Her voice rose to a shriek. "We're nothing without him!"

Eleanor suppressed her irritation at her daughter's twisted expression.

"My connections can't touch this." She gripped Isabella's shoulders. "Your father must have made arrangements."

Isabella suddenly shoved her away.

"Or you just don't want to help!" she screamed hysterically.

Eleanor's pupils contracted, fearing one of her episodes.

"Get ahold of yourself!" she snapped. "Your father's more cunning than you think."

Across Red Rain Bridge, Sebastian stood silently behind glass walls.

A black-clad man materialized behind him.

"Sir, Vincent Langley's convoy has arrived."

Sebastian tapped the glass with his fingers, his sharp profile reflected in the surface.

"Proceed as planned." His tone was calm.

The man bowed and retreated.

Sebastian studied his own reflection, his gaze softening.

"Evelyn, it'll all be over soon," he murmured.

Bitterness rose in his throat. His heart constricted as if squeezed by an invisible hand.

If not for Vincent Langley...

A distant explosion suddenly lit up the sky with flames.

Sebastian's lips curved into a cold smile.

"Still playing the same old tricks."
###Chapter 446

The Imperial Bridge blazed with fire.

Sirens pierced through the night sky.

The police car carrying Vincent Langley was crushed beyond recognition.

Blood trickled down his forehead, but he ignored the pain, scanning his surroundings urgently.

The plan was supposed to involve the car plunging into the river—his perfect escape.

But the situation had veered wildly off course.

Three officers lay unconscious.

Vincent kicked open the mangled door.

A familiar figure emerged through the smoke.

"Boss, someone interfered," the middle-aged man whispered. "The plan failed."

Vincent's gaze darkened as he stared at the wreckage.

"Execute Plan B," he said coldly. "Leave no survivors."

The bridge plunged into darkness.

The two men vanished into the night.

Three minutes later.

A deafening explosion rocked the air.

Blue flames slithered like venomous snakes.

Sebastian Orlando watched from above.

He immediately dialed a number.

"Vincent's escaping," he said sharply. "Send rescue teams now. It's a hormonal explosive—use the fire extinguishers in the trunk."

"Understood, sir. Our men are already in position."

Sebastian ended the call.

A dangerous smirk curved his lips.

"Trying to vanish into thin air?" He turned and strode away. "You won't get far."

At the same moment.

Breaking news of the explosion flooded the internet.

Eleanor Langley stared at the television screen.

"Your father got out," she said with a twisted smile. "He'll come for us soon."

Isabella Langley watched the inferno.

"That fire..."

"Relax," Eleanor said coldly. "He won't die."

Secretly, she prayed Vincent would perish in the flames.

Then she'd finally be free.

"Twenty years ago, he escaped just like this," Eleanor murmured. "A new face, a new name..."

A flicker of hope crossed Isabella's eyes.

She didn't notice the explosives looked familiar.

Outside the police station.

Adrian Valentine gripped his phone.

His knuckles turned white.

"Victor," he said, voice trembling. "Christian Lefèvre was murdered by Isabella."
###Chapter 447

Victor dozed off in the passenger seat when Adrian's icy voice jolted him awake.

"Sir?" He straightened abruptly.

Adrian's murderous gaze remained fixed on the surveillance feed. "The explosion at Vienna Bridge—identical to Christian's crime scene."

He pulled up two photos side by side.

"That blue flame comes from specialized chemical accelerants. The color persists day or night."

Victor's breath hitched as he compared the images.

Adrian immediately dialed Nathan.

Amid chaotic background noise, Nathan erupted after hearing the analysis.

"That bastard Vincent! Three patrol cars obliterated. The dying driver named him."

"He fled." Adrian's voice could freeze hell. "This compound detonates on air contact—just like Christian's case."

"Check for sesame oil at the scene."

Nathan's tone sharpened. "Present."

Adrian squeezed his eyes shut in anguish.

Now he understood the truth behind that explosion years ago.

"Christian's site had the same odor... It triggers immediate combustion."

He'd watched Evelyn light the match but couldn't stop her.

The blast came too fast.

All evidence pointed to her, yet he never questioned the discrepancies.

Nathan growled, "I'm mobilizing teams to hunt Vincent down."

The call ended, leaving suffocating silence in the car.

Adrian slumped against the seat, radiating lethal fury.

Victor wisely kept quiet.

The rearview mirror reflected Adrian's face—darker than the receding night.

His clenched fists showed bulging veins.

All these years, Isabella had played him like a puppet.

He'd pushed away the woman he loved most.

Regret coiled around his heart like a venomous serpent.

At dawn, Sophia appeared outside the detention center with a food container.

Adrian shoved the car door open.

"Give it to me." His raspy hand reached out.

Sophia startled at his haggard appearance.

"What do you think you're doing?" She retreated warily.

Adrian's voice scraped raw. "I'm bringing breakfast to my wife."

"Like hell you are." Sophia's eyes flashed with outrage.
###Chapter 448

Adrian Valentine ignored Sophia Blanchet's furious glare. He snatched the breakfast bag from her hands and strode into the hospital room without a word.

Sophia stamped her foot in frustration.

The man was utterly unreasonable.

As she moved to confront him, Victor Ashcroft quickly intercepted her. "Don't be upset, Miss Blanchet. Let me treat you to breakfast—freshly bought soy milk and fried dough sticks."

Sophia gave the plastic bag in his hand a disdainful glance before turning away coldly.

Victor scratched his head in confusion.

The soy milk smelled perfectly fine to him.

Evelyn Roland lay awake in bed, her thoughts drifting lazily.

Memories of Falcon Training Camp with Alexander Durand surfaced in her mind—their grueling drills, shared missions, every moment vivid as yesterday.

Before eighteen, they'd competed relentlessly in training.

After eighteen, they'd pursued separate dreams.

She remembered his radiant smile when he left, promising to find her the world's most exquisite diamond.

"Wait for me, Evelyn."

"Eat well. Skip the fatty meat—have more fish and chicken instead."

His唠叨 voice seemed to echo in her ears even now.

Her eyes grew moist.

How she longed to hear his唠叨 just once more.

Sebastian Orlando had told her Alexander wanted her to be happy.

She wiped her tears and took a deep breath.

As she sat up, a shadow fell across the bed.

Adrian stood there, his face haggard with dark circles under his eyes—as if he hadn't slept all night.

"Why are you here?" Her tone was flat.

He pulled up a chair. "To have breakfast with you."

"Your presence ruins my appetite."

His hands paused over the food containers. "But you'd eat happily with Sebastian Orlando?"

She couldn't be bothered to explain. "You're not even in the same league as him."

The barb struck true.

Adrian's chest tightened as he noticed her reddened eyes. She was grieving for Alexander.

The realization made jealousy claw at his insides.

Evelyn slipped on her slippers and headed to the bathroom.

When she returned, Adrian remained stubbornly present.

The table now overflowed with food—Victoria Laurent's homemade banana pancakes exuded sweetness, while snowflake steak still steamed on its plate.

That was Adrian—relentless once he set his mind to something.

But she'd outgrown reckless passion long ago.

Responsibilities leave no room for caprice.

###Chapter 449 

Evelyn frowned at the breakfast spread on the table. "How did you get these?"

Adrian lounged back in his chair with a lazy smirk. "Intercepted them on the way."

He casually handed her a pair of chopsticks.

She took them, deciding to eat before the interrogation. Adrian's presence didn't matter—her health came first. She wondered if Sophia and Ethan had slept well last night.

This was a good time to wean Sophia off breastfeeding. Her milk supply was dwindling, and delaying would only make it harder. She didn't subscribe to Gabrielle's parenting theories—Ethan would start training at three. Sophia could wait until five or be homeschooled.

She bit into a banana pancake. The crust was crisp, the filling sweet with a hint of fruit. The pineapple pancake beside it was perfectly baked—sweet but not cloying.

Adrian took a bite and brightened. These delicate pastries weren't available commercially. His gaze lingered on Evelyn's serene profile, his lips curving unconsciously.

Sophia Blanchet treated her with utmost respect. His ex-wife clearly had hidden depths. What was her real identity? Her combat skills and marksmanship intrigued him, making him want to rediscover her.

He pushed the steak from his plate into her bowl.

Evelyn eyed the meat and smiled faintly. "I never thought we'd sit together so peacefully after the divorce. Seems we've both moved on."

Only true indifference made one immune to the other's actions.

Adrian ate in silence. If he angered her, she'd skip meals again. She was still too thin, yet breathtakingly beautiful.

They finished breakfast quietly. Having skipped dinner, Adrian devoured Evelyn's leftovers.

The meal was excellent. It had been ages since he'd enjoyed such satisfying food—especially with his ex-wife.

Evelyn knew instantly he hadn't eaten last night. The man never took care of himself. Before marriage, he'd scraped by with takeout. After, unless traveling, he'd always come home for dinner—then proceeded to his favorite post-meal activity: her.

Adrian packed the containers. With thirty minutes until the interrogation, his expression turned serious.

"There was a crash and explosion at Red Rain Bridge last night. Vincent might have escaped."

With Nathan Aldridge silent, Vincent's escape was almost certain.

Evelyn's brow furrowed, unsurprised. "Vincent's cunning. He'd find a way to vanish and resurface under a new identity."

Adrian studied her intently. "He knows who you really are. Don't you want to find your birth parents?"

He hadn't planned to broach this yet, wanting to investigate first.

At the mention of her parents, a flicker of curiosity crossed Evelyn's eyes. "Vincent won't reveal anything easily. I've searched for years—no leads. The secret's well-guarded. But he's not the only one who knows. Isabella and Eleanor do too."

"We'll discuss this later. Focus on the immediate issue."

Though lacking proof, her instincts said Isabella and Eleanor held answers—especially Isabella, whose gaze always brimmed with possessiveness.

Adrian exhaled. "Isabella will be brought in for questioning today. I'll be there. The fire at Red Rain Bridge last night—the flames matched those at Christian Lefèvre's scene."

Evelyn smirked coldly. "Adrian, you once loved her desperately. Now you abandon her in crisis?"
###Chapter 450

Adrian Valentine's brow furrowed. "Must you be like this?"

Evelyn Roland lifted her gaze. "Like what?"

His dark eyes studied her for a long moment. This misunderstanding was of his own making. "I never had feelings for Isabella."

A mocking smile curved Evelyn's lips. "What does that have to do with me?"

"Everything." Adrian stepped closer. "You're my wife. I was wrong about Christian Lefèvre."

No matter the danger ahead, he wouldn't let go this time.

Two years of laying low had given him the power to protect her.

The empire he'd built in secret was formidable now.

Even if time rewound, he'd make the same choice. Back then, he'd been too weak to uncover the mastermind.

Vincent Langley and Eleanor Langley would stop at nothing to force their daughter into the Valentine family—with Evelyn as their target.

He'd rather bear the scorn than see her in harm's way.

Evelyn laughed bitterly. "Whether it's a misunderstanding hardly matters now—"

"I'm meeting Judge Song. Rest a while longer." Adrian cut her off, unwilling to hear her finality.

As the door closed, his gaze lingered on her.

Evelyn stared at the shut door. After two years, this man remained as domineering as ever.

The entanglement exhausted her. If they were divorced, why couldn't they just move on?

Once, she thought she couldn't live without him. Now she knew—no one was truly indispensable.

At nine sharp, the courtroom blazed with light.

Sebastian Orlando and Adrian arrived with their elite legal teams.

Vincent Kemnis arrived late, carrying crucial evidence.

Judge Song returned grim-faced. Vincent Langley had vanished—no body found at the scene.

The fire had been extinguished quickly. Only the truck driver perished; the rest escaped with minor injuries.

A clear case of a staged disappearance.

Isabella's venomous gaze flickered between Evelyn and Adrian. "Shouldn't Mr. Valentine be investigated too? He was at the scene."

Adrian didn't grace her with a glance.

Isabella clenched her fists, shooting Evelyn a look laced with poison. The evidence in her hands would ruin this woman.

Judge Song's gavel struck.

Vincent played surveillance footage showing someone igniting flammable materials before the explosion—a figure resembling Evelyn.

Evelyn's lawyer immediately countered, presenting proof that her rescue timeline didn't match the arson. He pointed out Isabella had been the first on scene, where she'd argued violently with Christian.

The footage clearly showed Isabella's contorted face—though there was no audio.

"Note the defendant's attire versus Ms. Langley's." The lawyer zoomed in. "Both wore black, but Ms. Langley's physique is more distinctive."

Isabella paled. This evidence should have been destroyed—how?

"Ms. Langley, answer the question." Judge Song's voice was stern.

Adrian stared at the screen. He'd been so focused on the face that he'd missed the posture. Evelyn's straight spine was something Isabella could never replicate.

In the defendant's seat, Evelyn sat composed, as if the trial had nothing to do with her.

Isabella's excuses grew increasingly feeble.

Then Vincent played his trump card—Christian's final call log.

Evelyn's number flashed on the screen.
###Chapter 451 

The interrogation room was thick with tension.

Evelyn Roland tapped her fingers lightly on the table, her sharp gaze sweeping over Vincent Kemnis. "Are you certain this is Christian Lefèvre's phone?"

Vincent toyed with the device, a smirk playing on his lips. "My brother's belongings are none of your concern."

"Is that so?" Evelyn's lips curled into a cold smile as she signaled her lawyer.

The lawyer immediately pulled up surveillance footage. On the screen, Isabella Langley whispered to Vincent, "I know you're the Lefèvres' illegitimate son... Evelyn is the real killer..."

Online outrage had erupted, with #EvelynRolandMurderer trending at the top of social media.

The lab reeked of antiseptic.

Gabrielle Flores' hand trembled slightly as she held a silver needle. "Christian Lefèvre, if you don't wake up now, I swear I'll throw you to the dogs!"

She jabbed the needle down with force. "Three years! I've treated you for three years! Do you have any idea how expensive those herbs were?"

The needle glinted coldly under the harsh lights.

"My sister's sentencing is today..." Gabrielle's voice cracked. "If you don't wake up now..."

The moment the needle pierced the acupuncture point, the man on the bed suddenly opened his eyes.

Gabrielle stumbled back in shock, the needle clattering to the floor.

"I—I'm sorry!" she stammered, flustered. "I didn't mean to—"

Christian strained to move his eyes. This girl had been chattering in his ear nonstop—he'd been wanting to wake up for ages.

"It's... fine," he rasped.

Gabrielle suddenly sprang up. "It worked!" She dashed to the fridge for an injection. "I'll administer this right away!"

Watching her excited retreat, Christian's lips twitched into an unconscious smile.

Back in the interrogation room, tensions flared.

Isabella lifted her chin triumphantly. "Just confess, Evelyn!"

The prosecutor rapped his gavel. "The evidence clearly indicates—"

The door burst open with a crash.

A cool voice cut through the chaos. "Evelyn didn't try to kill me."

Every head whipped around in shock.

Christian Lefèvre stood in the doorway, leaning heavily on a cane, his face pale but his gaze piercing. Gabrielle supported him, winking at Evelyn.

Isabella's face drained of color. Her water glass slipped from her fingers and shattered on the floor.
###Chapter 452

The screech of wheelchair wheels against the floor cut through the silence.

Adrian Valentine and Isabella Langley turned simultaneously, their pupils contracting in shock.

Gabrielle Flores pushed Christian Lefèvre into the room. The man's face was deathly pale, his legs limp against the footrests.

"Awake?" Evelyn Roland arched a brow, her tone as casual as discussing the weather.

Vincent Kemnis's documents slipped from his fingers and hit the ground with a thud.

"Christian..." Adrian's voice trembled, his hands clenching unconsciously.

Christian's gaze slid past him, landing on Evelyn. "I'm sorry."

Evelyn smirked. "Gabrielle suffered the most. Three years. Over a thousand days and nights."

The man in the wheelchair lowered his lashes.

"Living is so exhausting," she mocked his past words. "Is this all you've got?"

Nathan Aldridge tapped the table. "Mr. Lefèvre, please cooperate with the investigation."

Isabella suddenly shrieked, "Impossible! You were supposed to—"

"Supposed to be dead?" Christian's lips curled into a sardonic smile.

When Gabrielle whispered in his ear, he nearly blacked out again. Three years had changed everything beyond recognition.

Isabella's nails dug into her palms. She had calculated every move, except this man's awakening.

"Isabella Langley is the murderer," Christian stated, locking eyes with the judge's bench. "That day at Nata Tower..."

His voice was a scalpel, methodically dissecting the past.

"She wore a lifelike mask and set the fire herself."

Adrian whipped his head toward Isabella.

The woman's flawless makeup began to crack, her eyes drowning in bottomless terror.
###Chapter 453 

"There was another accomplice." Christian Lefèvre's voice was hoarse. "A man with a clover tattoo on the back of his neck."

"He controlled the projector to make Adrian Valentine see Isabella Langley impersonating Evelyn Roland setting the fire."

"After Isabella knocked me out with a baseball bat, I fought to stay conscious. I saw Adrian walk in. I saw him witness that carefully staged deception."

"The real arsonist was the tattooed man. The explosion came too fast. I barely stayed awake. Later, Evelyn arrived and rescued Adrian. That murder attempt put me in a coma for three years."

Isabella suddenly shrieked, "Christian! You're lying! It was Evelyn who tried to kill you!"

Her face twisted as she hysterically shook the railing. "You loved me so much. How could you frame me? Take it back!"

Christian turned away in disgust. Back then, he'd been fooled by Isabella's sweet lies, even defended her. He never knew the truth about her relationship with Evelyn.

"I'm telling the truth," Christian sneered.

Murderous intent flashed in Isabella's eyes. She hadn't expected this useless man to still be alive.

"Ah—" She let out a piercing scream before turning tearful eyes to Adrian. "Adrian, please believe me..."

Her voice trembled. "Evelyn did it. Won't you testify for me?"

Adrian finally snapped out of his daze. So Isabella had been the mastermind behind the explosion three years ago.

Evelyn suddenly understood everything. Isabella's elaborate scheme to kill her must be connected to her true origins.

Just as this thought crossed her mind, a guard rushed in. "Captain Laurent, someone's here to confess."

"He claims he's the real culprit who tried to kill Christian Lefèvre years ago."

Christian frowned. "If it's the tattooed man, then yes, he lit the fire. But Isabella was the mastermind. I heard her planning it myself."

A flicker of hope appeared in Isabella's eyes. Had her father or Warren Garten sent this person?

Her lawyer immediately objected. "Uncorroborated testimony is unreliable."

"I'm the eyewitness!" Christian slammed the table. "Isn't the victim's account enough?"

Isabella suddenly turned to the jury, tears welling up. "He's doing this because I rejected his proposal..."

"How can someone who was comatose for three years have reliable memories? This is clearly a setup!"
###Chapter 454

Christian's knuckles turned white as he clenched his fists.

He had witnessed Isabella's crimes with his own eyes, yet she walked free without consequences.

Nathan's phone screen lit up. His expression darkened as he read the message.

The order from above was clear: release Isabella immediately.

The interrogation room door swung open. Isabella strode out with her chin held high.

"Surprised?" She smirked at Christian, her voice dripping with malice. "I told you I'd get out."

Warren leaned against a luxury car nearby. He pulled Isabella into a possessive embrace.

Right in front of everyone, he crushed his lips against hers in a vulgar display.

Adrian turned away in disgust.

Christian's eyes burned with fury, but he forced himself to remain still.

Isabella tossed her hair, venom gleaming in her gaze. "Evelyn, you ruined my life. You'll pay for this."

With that final threat, she slid into the car and sped away.

Evelyn watched the scene unfold with detached calm, as if observing a farce.

"Christian, you should go home," she said quietly.

He glanced down at his wheelchair with a bitter smile. "My legs haven't fully recovered yet."

Gabrielle cut in impatiently. "Stop pretending. You've been able to walk for weeks."

She shoved a large bag of medication into his arms.

"Take these on schedule. And keep them away from your brother."

Christian froze. "My brother?"

Gabrielle rolled her eyes. "Just be careful."

As Evelyn turned to leave, Christian called out desperately.

"Evelyn... can I still visit you?"

She didn't look back. "That won't be necessary."

Gabrielle caught up to her sister, muttering under her breath. "Finally got rid of that nuisance."

Christian watched their retreating figures, his expression growing shadowed.

He absently touched the medicine bag, lost in thought.

In the distance, a black sedan approached slowly.

The window rolled down, revealing the cold, calculating face of the Lefèvre family's eldest son.
###Chapter 455

The cautionary tale of Julian Roscente still fresh in her mind, Evelyn refused to put her sister in an awkward position.

Christian Lefèvre broke into a radiant smile. "Alright!"

"Christian! My Christian!" Mrs. Lefèvre stumbled forward and wrapped her arms around her son, weeping uncontrollably.

Her son was alive. Standing right before her eyes.

All these years, she had remained oblivious.

Christian turned pale from the crushing embrace but forced a smile. "Mom, I just woke up. Everything hurts. You're holding me too tight."

Mrs. Lefèvre immediately loosened her grip.

Her heart ached at the sight of his gaunt face.

She turned to Evelyn, eyes brimming with gratitude. "Ms. Roland, thank you for saving my son. I was a fool before, saying all those terrible things—"

Evelyn shook her head faintly. "It's only natural."

"If you hadn't opened my eyes, I would've made an irreparable mistake." Mrs. Lefèvre wiped her tears.

Evelyn remained silent.

After profuse thanks, Mrs. Lefèvre wheeled the chair away.

Gabrielle watched their retreating figures with a pang of loss. "Sis, I complained about taking care of him, but now that he's leaving, I feel reluctant."

Evelyn flicked her forehead. "Three years of caretaking and you grew attached?"

Sunlight illuminated her exquisite features.

Adrian Valentine observed from afar, his heart stirring.

Gabrielle suddenly stamped her foot. "Oh! Sis, wait for me!" She turned and dashed back toward the police station.

The street stood empty, leaving just the two of them.

Adrian stepped forward. "Why didn't you tell me Christian was alive?"

Evelyn turned slightly, studying his haggard profile. Time had carved maturity into his face, but his essence remained unchanged. "Ask Christian. You'll believe his words more."

She turned to leave.

"Wife!" Adrian grabbed her wrist. "I wronged you."

Evelyn's gaze was calm as still water.

"Isabella schemed relentlessly, but you were the blind one. I don't hate you because—" She paused. "Compared to endless forgiveness, indifference is true liberation."

The words surprised even herself.

Why say more? She should've just walked away.

Adrian's heart twisted in agony. Was she so stingy as to withhold even hatred?

He abruptly pulled her into his arms.

Evelyn stiffened, her eyes turning icy.

But then his trembling voice whispered in her ear. "I'm sorry... I blamed you without knowing anything..."

The warmth of his embrace felt achingly familiar.

Her lashes fluttered briefly before she decisively stepped back. "Ignorance is bliss. You live an easy life."
###Chapter 456

Adrian Valentine's arms suddenly felt empty, as if a piece of his heart had been carved out. His fingers clenched at his sides, knuckles turning white, barely restraining the urge to pull her back.

Evelyn Roland remained as composed as ever, her expression mirroring the detachment of their first meeting. Her eyes held nothing—no trace of emotion, as if the entire world meant nothing to her.

Every encounter since their divorce had been filled with her furious outbursts. But this eerie calm sent a chill down Adrian's spine.

"Wife," his voice was rough with emotion. "I won't give up on you."

Evelyn met his gaze, her heart betraying her with an involuntary tremor. Pressing her lips together, she spotted Sophia Blanchet's approaching car and turned away without another word.

Adrian stood rooted in place, watching her leave. No one knew Evelyn better than he did—except for the secrets she deliberately kept from him.

"Chu Chu" was what Sebastian Orlando called her. But "wife" would always belong to Adrian alone.

A wicked smirk curled his lips as he dialed Victor Ashcroft's number. Once in his car, he headed straight for the Lefèvre estate.

The Lefèvre mansion wasn't far from the Valentine residence, its windows blazing with light. Leonard Lefèvre had been caught off guard by Christian Lefèvre's miraculous return. His plans to legitimize Vincent Kemnis had been abruptly derailed.

"Christian, I thought you were gone for good," Leonard stammered. "That's why I brought your brother home."

Christian sneered. "Of course. He is your son, after all."

Sophia Lefèvre's eyes flashed with long-suppressed hatred. She had endured enough.

"Let's divorce." She slammed the papers onto the coffee table. "Go be with that woman."

Leonard's face darkened with rage. "Sophia! There's no divorce in my life—only death! Haven't we coexisted peacefully all these years?"

"Peacefully?" Sophia let out a bitter laugh. "My silence gave you the wrong impression."

Her voice trembled. "If not for the children, I would have left long ago. You ruined my life—marrying me for your career, using the Lefèvre name, then trying to discard me?"

Leonard froze. The woman before him still carried herself with grace and dignity, while the one he truly loved had nothing but gentleness to offer.

Years ago, when his company teetered on the brink of collapse, it was the Lefèvre alliance that saved him. And all this time, he had shamelessly reaped the benefits of both worlds.
###Chapter 457

Sophia Lefèvre stared coldly at him, her fingertips lightly tapping the desk.

"Leonard, I've kept records of every cent you've embezzled from my company over the years." Her voice was eerily calm. "Shall I calculate how many years that would land you in prison?"

Leonard's face turned deathly pale.

His gaze instinctively darted to their son sitting on the couch, only to find Christian Lefèvre watching him with unfamiliar eyes.

"Don't spout nonsense in front of our child," Leonard forced out with false bravado.

Sophia suddenly smiled.

Slowly, she pulled a stack of documents from her bag and slammed them onto the table.

"Look. These are all the properties and cars you bought for Vanessa, along with tuition bills for your illegitimate child." Her finger landed on the final page. "And the best part—last month, you used company funds to purchase her a villa."

Leonard shot to his feet.

"Sign." Sophia pushed a pen toward him. "Or these will be delivered to the IRS and prosecutor's office tomorrow."

For the first time, Leonard truly studied the woman he'd shared a bed with for twenty years.

The emerald cheongsam she wore made her skin glow like snow. Time had been kind to her, leaving barely a trace of wrinkles at her eyes.

And Vanessa...

The image of that woman who always whined for money flashed through his mind, leaving him momentarily dazed.

"Sophia, Christian just got out of the hospital. We should—"

Click.

Sophia dialed the police without hesitation.

Leonard lunged for the phone, but Christian blocked him.

"Father." Christian's voice was glacial. "On the day of the fire, I saw Aunt Vanessa and Isabella at the café."

The words detonated like a bomb in the living room.

Sophia's pupils constricted, her fingers gripping the table edge until her knuckles turned white.

"Lies!" Leonard roared.

Christian smirked. "Shall I pull up the security footage?"

He turned to his mother. "Mom, divorce him. You've suffered enough."

Sophia's eyes reddened, but she stubbornly lifted her chin.

Leonard took in his son's icy expression and realization dawned.

"You... planned this together?"

Christian gently clasped his mother's trembling hand.

"Father, don't forget—Mom's company bears the Lefèvre name, not yours." His lips curved. "That money will keep you and Vanessa comfortable in prison for the rest of your lives."

The pen gleamed coldly under the light.

Leonard's hands began to shake.
###Chapter 458

"Leonard Lefèvre, what gives you the right to force me into divorce?" Sophia Lefèvre slammed the table, her face pale with fury.

Christian Lefèvre remained motionless in his wheelchair, his lips curling into a cold smile.

"You ignored Mother for years, and now you pretend to care?"

Sophia stood beside her son, her fingers trembling slightly.

"Leonard, our marriage has been dead for a long time."

Leonard whipped his head around, panic flickering in his eyes.

"The company is barely surviving thanks to the Sophia family. Did you think I wouldn't find out?" Christian's voice was icy. "Sign today, or face a court summons tomorrow."

A cold sweat broke out on Leonard's forehead.

"Every villa and sports car you bought for Vanessa—they're all marital assets." Christian enunciated each word. "My lawyers will recover every cent."

Sophia gently squeezed her son's shoulder.

"We only want Christian and my company. You can keep the rest."

Leonard stared at the divorce papers, his hands shaking.

"You're really going this far?"

Sophia suddenly laughed, though her eyes remained frozen.

"Did you think about cruelty when you fathered a child behind my back?"

Leonard fell silent.

Christian turned his wheelchair away.

"Sign it. Don't make me lose what little respect I have left for you."

Leonard collapsed into his chair and scrawled his signature with violent force.

"You'll regret this!"

Sophia gathered the documents and pushed Christian out without looking back.

In the hallway, Leonard nearly collided with Adrian Valentine ascending the stairs.

They passed each other without acknowledgment.

Back in the room, Sophia finally broke down in tears.

"Christian, I'm so sorry..."

Christian clasped his mother's trembling hand.

"Mom, I've wanted you to leave him for years."

Sophia gazed at her son through blurred vision.

"That house was never our home."

Outside, the setting sun stretched their shadows long across the floor.
###Chapter 459

"Mom, he only married you for Grandma's influence." Christian Lefèvre squeezed his mother's hand. "You're still young. Don't waste your life on someone like him."

Sophia Lefèvre's fingers trembled. "Then what about you? How did Adrian Valentine's fiancée become your girlfriend? Why didn't you tell me about something this important? You almost—"

Her voice broke, eyes reddening.

Christian gave a bitter smile. "Isabella Langley is Vincent Langley's daughter. Both Adrian and I fell into her trap. I only saw the full picture after waking up yesterday."

His voice tightened. "Mom, be careful around Isabella. I nearly made you bury your own son."

"I'll be cautious." Sophia wiped her tears. "I've been preparing for divorce these past months. Your father has been abusing his power for years. Without the Lefèvre family backing him, he'll get what's coming."

Her lips curled coldly. "That spendthrift Vanessa Kalmien knows nothing about managing a household. Leonard's company is already crumbling. It'll go bankrupt within a month."

Christian's heart clenched. "Mom, you've suffered all these years."

"Having you and your sister makes it bearable." Sophia gently touched her son's gaunt face. "When you recover, the company will be yours."

"I won't let you down." Christian's gaze hardened. A man who's stared death in the face doesn't repeat mistakes.

Sophia suddenly remembered something. "Contact Evelyn Roland tomorrow. I want to thank her in person."

At the mention of the frosty-eyed woman, admiration flickered in her eyes. Adrian truly didn't deserve her.

"Alright." Christian reached for his phone, then froze. "Mom... I don't have her contact information."

"What?" Sophia stared in disbelief. "You stayed at her home. How could you not—"
###Chapter 460

Christian lowered his lashes apologetically. "Mom, I'll reschedule with her next time we meet."

Sophia sighed softly. For now, this was the only option.

She rose to fetch water downstairs and was surprised to find Adrian standing in the living room.

"Adrian?" Sophia blinked in momentary surprise before regaining her composure. She knew he wasn't entirely to blame.

Years of friendship between their families kept her tone as warm as ever.

"Auntie, I came to see Christian." Adrian's voice was cool, though the shadows in his brow had lightened slightly.

Sophia gestured upstairs. "He's resting in his room. Go on up."

Tactfully giving them space, she instructed Victor to prepare tea before grabbing her car keys to leave.

Adrian had always been steady. Surely they could clear the air between them.

"Victor, you know where the kitchen is. Bring the tea up when it's ready." Sophia tied her scarf. "I have some errands to run."

Victor smiled. "Don't worry, Auntie."

The living room fell quiet.

After delivering the tea, Victor quietly shut the bedroom door behind him.

Inside, the two men sat facing each other in heavy silence.

Finally, Adrian spoke. "Christian, I'm sorry."

His Adam's apple bobbed. "I almost got you killed."

Christian's laugh was icy, his gaze sharp as blades. Adrian hadn't known—they'd both been pawns in Isabella's game.

"You know," Christian tapped his wheelchair armrest, "that video had no audio. But I heard every vicious word."

Suddenly he smiled. "Yet now, I should thank this ordeal."

"At least it woke me up. No more drifting through life." He looked out the window. "I'll stand again—to protect those who matter."

"Lastly," he met Adrian's eyes directly, "I wish you and her a lifetime of happiness."

Adrian's brow furrowed. "I only got close to her to investigate my father's death."

"Vincent Langley was the killer." His voice turned grim. "How could I ever be with her?"

Christian froze. This truth was news to him.

So Adrian had his reasons too. So the Langley father-daughter pair was truly monstrous.

"How did Mrs. Valentine know Vincent Langley?" Christian recalled the grisly scene of Adrian's father's death—and the revelation that Adrian wasn't his biological son.

Adrian's eyes darkened. "Overheard their phone call and followed the trail."

Christian shook his head with a self-mocking chuckle. "To think we were both played by the same woman."

He exhaled deeply. "Since we've cleared the air, brothers we remain."

Having brushed death, many things no longer seemed important.

The tension in Adrian's shoulders eased at last. "How's the leg?"

"Fine." Christian patted his knee. "Evelyn's skills are remarkable. Just needs time to heal."

He could walk haltingly now, though unsteadily.

Abruptly Adrian asked, "Have you seen my wife since waking?"

He'd overheard the mother-son conversation but clung to a sliver of hope.

After scouring all of Vienna, Evelyn's disappearance remained a mystery he couldn't unravel.
###Chapter 461

Christian Lefèvre leaned against the hospital bed, his gaze distant. "Nothing? I woke up in a top-tier research facility. That girl Gabrielle scolded me mercilessly when she discharged me."

He gave a bitter smile. "I've been conscious these past two years. Just... couldn't wake up."

More accurately, he hadn't wanted to face what he'd heard. Looking back now, it was absurd that Isabella's words had kept him comatose for three years.

"Glad you're awake." Adrian Valentine's voice was low. Seeing his friend recovered eased some of the guilt weighing on him.

Christian flexed his arm. "Two months of rest, then back to work. Gabrielle took excellent care of me."

Adrian gave a faint hum of acknowledgment.

Being alive was what mattered.

"You and Evelyn... really divorced?" Christian finally asked.

Adrian stood, his gaze unfathomable. "She will always be my wife."

With that, he turned and left.

Christian watched his retreating figure, then suddenly called out, "If Isabella truly feels nothing, I won't let her off."

Adrian paused mid-step. "Neither will I. Be careful—she has powerful backers. That man with the clover tattoo nearly killed Julian Roscente."

Christian's pupils constricted. "Why target our four families? What does she want?"

"Vincent Langley wants the presidency. Isabella wants to rule the Nine-City Alliance." Adrian's tone was glacial.

Understanding dawned on Christian.

This time, Adrian didn't linger.

Three days later.

Evelyn Roland finally felt fully rested.

The cosmetic ingredients were prepped.

The Lee family had collapsed entirely during the turmoil, with the patriarch now in ICU from the shock.

Isabella remained eerily quiet, though Vincent Langley was still missing.

"Sis, launching Botanica this year?" Nathan Aldridge gaped.

Evelyn massaged her temples. "Other projects continue as planned. I'm meeting Scarlett for a haircut today."

Nathan groaned. Being CEO was torture—but the salary kept him trudging to the office.

After ensuring her children were asleep, Evelyn had Sophia Blanchet drive her.

At Scarlett Orlando's company building, she was about to call when she spotted Cassandra Valentine being forcibly taken by two strangers.

Evelyn's eyes sharpened. After whispering instructions to Sophia, she stealthily followed.
###Chapter 462

Sophia Blanchet's knuckles turned white as she gripped her phone. She stood by the car, eyes locked on the building across the street.

The call connected. Scarlett Orlando's voice came through. "What's wrong?"

"Come down," Sophia said tersely. "Evelyn followed Cassandra into that building."

She hung up, her pulse quickening. Instinct told her something was off.

The basement lights glared harshly.

Evelyn Roland trailed behind Cassandra Valentine through the dim corridor, the air thick with mildew. She frowned. "Why are we here?"

Cassandra remained silent.

At the end, a small door swung open. Isabella Langley sat poised on a black leather chair, crimson lips curving.

"Welcome," she said, lightly clapping.

Cassandra's pupils constricted. "You!"

Isabella rose, her heels clicking sharply against the floor. She circled Cassandra like a predator admiring its prey.

"Want the truth?" Isabella chuckled. "Too bad. You'll never get it."

Evelyn took half a step back, her spine pressing against the cold wall.

"How does it feel," Isabella whispered suddenly in Cassandra's ear, "to be swapped at birth? To be despised by your own mother?"

Cassandra trembled violently. "What do you know?"

Isabella threw her head back and laughed, the sound echoing off the walls. She seized Cassandra's chin. "You're just a discarded pawn!"

Evelyn saw the flash of anguish in Cassandra's eyes.

"Does Julian know who you really are?" Cassandra gritted out.

Isabella released her, wiping her fingers with disgust. "Worry about yourself first."

She jerked her chin toward two burly men by the door. "They can have you."

Cassandra paled.

Evelyn lunged forward. "Stop!"

Isabella arched a brow. "Almost forgot about you." Her lips parted. "Take care of them both."

The men advanced. Evelyn's hand slid toward the pepper spray in her pocket.

Cassandra suddenly grabbed Isabella's wrist. "Who is my real mother?"

Isabella shoved her away. "Ask the devil in hell!"

Footsteps pounded outside. Sophia burst in with security guards.

"The police are on their way!" she barked.

Isabella's face twisted.

Cassandra collapsed to the floor, silent tears streaming down her face.
###Chapter 463

Cassandra Valentine trembled as she was backed into a corner.

Isabella Langley stood before her, eyes glacial with menace.

"The Valentines have abandoned you." Isabella's lips curled into a cruel smirk. "Even your brothers won't lift a finger."

Cassandra bit her lip, hatred burning in her gaze. "You'll pay for this, Isabella!"

Isabella threw her head back with a shrill, piercing laugh.

Nearby, Evelyn Roland watched in horror. The woman was utterly unhinged.

The laughter stopped abruptly.

Isabella loomed over the shivering Cassandra. "Pathetic. You obeyed my every command like a trained dog."

"That's how I seized the Ashcroft fortune." Pride flashed in her eyes. "Julian Roscente was even more gullible—handed over half his empire."

She leaned closer, whispering, "Those counterfeit antiques? All my doing."

"Christian Lefèvre was the most amusing." Her voice dripped with scorn. "One mention of Adrian Valentine, and he collapsed in rage."

"Worthless trash." Her face twisted with malice. "Just like you. Time to disappear."

Cassandra recoiled. "Please... tell me who my mother is!"

"Never!" Isabella snarled. "Die with that regret!"

A sharp slap cracked across Cassandra's face.

"I despise your pretty face." Isabella's teeth clenched. "How dare you outshine me?"

She turned to the guards. "This is our territory. Have your fun."

Cassandra's hope shattered as Isabella strode away.

She tried to flee, but a guard yanked her back.

"Easy there, sweetheart." His leer raked over her.

Another guard licked his lips. "I'll go first. Stand watch outside."

"Please..." Her voice broke.

The sickening rip of torn fabric echoed through the empty warehouse.
###Chapter 464

Cassandra Valentine screamed in terror as she stumbled backward.

The man's greasy face loomed closer, his breath reeking of alcohol and cigarettes.

"You think you're too good for us?" The thug behind her dug his fingers into her shoulders. "There's no escape now."

Her entire body trembled. "I-I have money... Eight million in my account..."

Jack Lombardi smirked and slapped her across the face.

Darkness flashed before her eyes. A high-pitched ringing filled her ears.

She collapsed to the floor, vision blurring.

"This one's feisty." The man unbuckled his belt with eager hands.

Just as he lunged forward, the door burst open.

Through her daze, Cassandra saw a slender figure standing in the doorway.

Evelyn Roland.

The same woman she had tormented for years.

"Another pretty face?" Jack's eyes lit up with interest.

Cassandra mustered the last of her strength. "Evelyn... help me..."

Evelyn's gaze was icy as she took in the scene.

Though she despised Cassandra, Isabella's methods disgusted her more.

When one of the men reached for her, she drove her knee upward.

"Ahhh!" He crumpled to the ground, clutching himself.

Jack's expression darkened. He seized Cassandra by the throat. "Stay back!"

Evelyn advanced without hesitation.

"You asked for this!" Jack suddenly brandished a switchblade.

The blade glinted in the light.

Evelyn prepared to dodge—only to be pulled into a firm embrace from behind.

The familiar scent of cedarwood made her stiffen.

Adrian Valentine shielded her in his arms, his gaze sharp as steel.

Evelyn scowled up at him. "I didn't need your help."
###Chapter 465

Adrian Valentine frowned slightly, his gaze locked onto her face. "Are you alright, darling?"

Evelyn Roland swept a cold glance over his bleeding arm before sharply looking away.

She spun around, her piercing stare fixed on Jack Lombardi.

With a swift kick, her hands clamped around his wrists like steel traps. A sharp crack of bone displacement echoed as the man cried out in pain.

The dagger clattered to the ground.

A glint of ice flashed in Evelyn's eyes as she delivered a precise chop to the back of his neck. The man collapsed, the entire confrontation over in three seconds.

Adrian's pupils constricted, stunned by her ruthless efficiency.

"Thank you for the rescue today, Mr. Valentine." Evelyn removed her coat and draped it over Cassandra Valentine. "I owe you one. Within reason, you may call in this favor."

Supporting Cassandra, she turned and walked away, her back unyielding.

Adrian stared at the blood trailing down his arm, yet a faint smile curved his lips. Even the coldest ice could be melted with patience.

His expression darkened as he glanced at the unconscious assailant. Isabella Langley's methods were filthier than he'd imagined.

Earlier, he'd spotted Sophia Blanchet downstairs, her face pale with panic. After pressing her for answers, he'd learned Evelyn had gone after the attacker alone. Thank God he'd arrived in time.

He dialed Julian Roscente's number, gave brief instructions, then pressed a hand to his wound and left.

Outside the mall fitting room, Cassandra emerged in a pink casual outfit. Evelyn had already paid, her posture straight as a pine.

Cassandra clenched the fabric of her shirt. In the past, when she'd hurled insults, Evelyn hadn't even spared her a glance. Not out of tolerance—but because she wasn't worth the anger.

"Evelyn." Her voice trembled.

Evelyn turned, her gaze steady. "Let's talk at the café."

By the floor-to-ceiling windows, two steaming drinks sat between them. Cassandra stirred her coffee. "Thank you for saving me. About before—"

"Why is Isabella targeting you?" Evelyn cut in. "Haven't you noticed you look almost identical to Eleanor Langley?"

The spoon clattered into the cup.

"You're Eleanor's biological daughter, but Vincent Langley isn't your father." Evelyn pushed the milk toward her. "They've been threatening your brother to control her all these years—"

Cassandra's face drained of color.

"That's all I'll say." Evelyn stood. "Isabella won't stop. Be careful."

As the glass door swung shut, Cassandra suddenly bolted after her.
###Chapter 466

Evelyn Roland stopped walking and turned to face Cassandra Valentine who had caught up with her.

"Something else?" Her voice was icy.

Cassandra clenched the hem of her dress. "Is Eleanor Langley really looking for me?"

Hope flickered in her eyes, desperate for confirmation of that maternal love.

Evelyn nodded. "She is. But she can't make it public. Isabella Langley threatened her to keep playing the role of mother."

After a pause, she added, "Your mother and Vincent Langley have a son abroad. For his sake, she had to compromise."

Eleanor Langley's origins remained a mystery. She wasn't from this country—even her surname had been changed later. Evelyn had checked the records but found no trace of her original nationality.

Even approaching middle age, Eleanor's beauty was breathtaking. Her grace outshone women half her age.

Understanding flashed in Cassandra's eyes. "Thank you."

Evelyn studied her, recalling how the Valentine family had deliberately neglected her upbringing. Isabella's cruelty was innate, while Cassandra had been systematically crippled.

"Be careful." Evelyn turned away. "You won't always be this lucky."

Cassandra stood rooted to the spot, a cold glint surfacing in her gaze.

Isabella Langley, you will pay for this.

Adrian Valentine's office.

Fresh bandages covered the wound on his arm as he sorted through documents. The memory of Evelyn's indifferent stare sent a dull ache through his chest.

A knock sounded at the door.

"Mr. Valentine, Cassandra is here to see you." Victor Ashcroft entered.

Adrian's brow furrowed. "Not interested."

"Brother!" Cassandra barged in anyway, dropping to her knees. "Please help me. Isabella is trying to kill me."

Victor suppressed a shudder, recalling the near-fatal incident he'd just heard about.

"Why should I?" Adrian's laugh was bitter. "You tried to kill me once too."

Cassandra gave a pained smile. "Melanie Evans manipulated me. I didn't know the truth back then—"

"You're just as vile as Melanie." Adrian cut her off.

Cassandra collapsed onto the floor.

Years ago, Melanie had plotted to eliminate Adrian and used her to tamper with the brakes. She'd thought it was just a prank—never suspecting the truth.

After the crash, Adrian traced it back to her and had treated her with contempt ever since. He'd known for years that Melanie wasn't his birth mother, enduring the charade only to uncover the truth behind his father's death.

This man was terrifying—even his feigned affection for Isabella had been utterly convincing.

"I'm sorry..." Her voice shook. "But after hearing this, you'll help me."

Adrian narrowed his eyes. "Talk."
###Chapter 467

Adrian Valentine's slender fingers tapped lightly on the desk as he considered Cassandra's request.

His gaze darkened, recalling Eleanor Langley's knowledge of Evelyn Roland's origins.

"Victor," he said coldly, "Agree to her terms. Contact Nathan Aldridge."

Victor Ashcroft raised an eyebrow. Had Cassandra finally seen reason?

The video footage of Isabella Langley's face—an uncanny replica of Eleanor's delicate features—made everything painfully clear.

......

Isabella hummed a tune as she entered the Langley mansion.

Eleanor sat in the living room reviewing documents, her brow furrowed.

A sinister smile curled Isabella's lips.

Once that wretched girl was completely destroyed, Eleanor would have no choice but to rely on her.

"Mother," she asked sweetly, "Any news from Father?"

Eleanor massaged her temples. "He disappeared after the company was seized."

Isabella's chest tightened.

Eagerly, she pulled out her phone to check Cassandra's downfall.

A news alert flashed across the screen:

"Female Corpse Found in Lynch Tower—Suspected Sexual Assault Homicide."

The bloodied face in the photo was unmistakably Cassandra's.

The phone clattered to the floor.

Eleanor picked it up, her pupils contracting in shock.

That pitiful girl they'd met at the gala... dead?

A sharp pain lanced through her heart.

......

At the salon, Evelyn scrolled through her phone while Scarlett Orlando received a treatment.

Seeing the headline, Evelyn's lips curved upward.

Cassandra had gone to Adrian after all.

With a tap, she anonymously sent a video.

"Mrs. Langley, have you never questioned Cassandra's true parentage?"

"Pity your adopted daughter struck first."

As the caption delivered, Evelyn sipped her black tea.

Sunlight streamed through the windows.

Meanwhile, at the Langley estate, Eleanor trembled violently as the video played.

Isabella's vicious sneer and Cassandra's desperate screams stabbed into her heart like daggers.

The final message burned into her vision:

"Your real daughter died by your adopted one's hand."
###Chapter 468

Eleanor Langley's phone clattered to the floor.

"Mom, what's wrong?" Isabella Langley frowned.

Had she seen the news too?

Eleanor stared at her, chest heaving violently. How could she have been so blind? Both daughters might have been switched.

Vincent Langley excelled at such tricks—hiding danger in plain sight. Blinded by maternal love, she'd let her real daughter die.

"Mom, what happened? Any news about Dad?" Isabella didn't even consider Cassandra Valentine.

Eleanor's heart twisted like a knife, forced to watch her enemy gloat.

Suppressing hatred, she shook her head. "Nothing. Haven't you seen the news? Adrian Valentine's sister died. Such a pity."

Isabella relaxed with a cold snort. "She had it coming. That stray nobody was raised to be useless. Death's a mercy."

She turned upstairs.

Eleanor's gaze burned into her retreating back, murder swirling in her eyes.

Stray? She was the stray! Her daughter was the true heiress.

That viper Margaret Blanchet—she'd underestimated her cruelty.

Isabella Langley, you'll pay in blood!

Eleanor grabbed car keys and bolted out. She had to see her daughter one last time.

As her car turned from the gate, another vehicle barreled toward her.

Crash!

The airbag deployed. Eleanor's skull slammed against the headrest. Through blurred vision, she saw Jonathan Savigny's panicked face.

A tear slid down her cheek.

Daughter... can't I even say goodbye?

"Eleanor!" Jonathan carried her into the ambulance.

News of Cassandra Valentine's death spread rapidly through elite circles.

Evelyn Roland studied Scarlett Orlando's newly cropped hair—the sharp cut accentuating her striking features.

"Such a drastic chop. Your agent approved?"

Scarlett tossed her head. "She's lost that privilege." Grabbing her phone, she gasped. "God! Cassandra Valentine's dead?"

Evelyn's eyes narrowed. With Cassandra gone, Isabella would drop her guard. And Eleanor would strike.

Isabella's acquittal clearly meant authorities wanted bigger prey.

"Hmm." Evelyn changed subjects. "Dinner plans? I'm free tonight."

Scarlett brightened. "Sebastian's swamped—perfect timing for girls' night!"
###Chapter 469

Evelyn's lips curved slightly, a mischievous glint flashing in her eyes. She was indeed considering playing matchmaker between Scarlett and Sebastian.

"What would you like to eat?" Evelyn unlocked her phone screen.

"Noble Fin's signature spicy fish! We'll make it just in time for dinner service." Scarlett swiftly put on her sunglasses. She had turned down all film offers recently, determined to take a proper break.

She linked arms with Evelyn affectionately. "Evelyn, I'm taking a year off from acting. Last year's drama paid enough to last me years—perfect timing to spend with you."

Evelyn arched a brow. "I'll be swamped after the new year. Only free until then."

"No problem!" Scarlett beamed. "I'll tag along during your work hours. Great chance to learn some business skills. Last year's filming schedule was brutal—this year, I'm making up for lost gym time."

"As you wish." Evelyn chuckled. The Orlando heiress certainly didn’t need to worry about money.

Unlike her, with her aging grandfather and the weight of the Roland Group resting on her and her brother’s shoulders.

They drove to the restaurant. On the way, Evelyn called Gabrielle to confirm the children were behaving. The failed weaning plan frustrated her, and she hurried to find a private space to express milk upon arrival.

She told Scarlett to go ahead to their private dining room.

Meanwhile, Victor gestured toward the restaurant's sign. "Mr. Valentine, our partners specifically chose this place. Their fish are caught and prepared fresh."

Adrian gave an absent nod. But as he stepped into the lobby, a familiar silhouette made his pupils constrict.

"Go ahead without me." He tossed the words over his shoulder and followed her.

Evelyn was in the lounge, expressing milk. She bit her lip, silently cursing Gabrielle—whatever she’d eaten had left her uncomfortably engorged.

Just as she fumbled, the door suddenly swung open.

Evelyn jerked her head up, one hand still pressed to her chest. She yanked her blouse down and glared at the intruder.

Adrian, unusually dressed in casual white, exuded a lazy, roguish charm.

"Ever heard of knocking?" she snapped.

But his gaze lingered where hers had just been. He’d noticed her fuller figure earlier—now he understood why.

"Uncomfortable?" He strode closer, studying her flushed cheeks like a kitten caught stealing cream.
###Chapter 470

Evelyn's cheeks flushed crimson. She averted Adrian's intense gaze, her fingers nervously twisting the hem of her blouse.

"Mr. Valentine, you should knock before entering." Her voice trembled. "Where are your manners?"

Adrian leaned against the doorframe, a smirk playing on his lips. He slowly unbuttoned his suit jacket, his eyes never leaving her.

"Darling, when did I ever knock during our marriage?" His deep voice held a teasing lilt. "Changing clothes, taking showers—I always walked right in."

Evelyn's chest heaved with anger. The man's audacity was infuriating.

"We've been divorced for three years!" She gritted her teeth. "Adrian Valentine, have some decency!"

His smile froze. Memories flooded back—the painful decision to push her away for her own protection. The wounds still felt fresh.

"I'm sorry." His voice turned hoarse. "Back then—"

"Sorry doesn't fix anything." Evelyn's icy glare cut him off. "Don't show up unannounced again."

Adrian stepped closer suddenly. A sweet, milky fragrance tickled his nose. He frowned, perplexed.

"What's that scent?" He leaned toward her collar. "It's... intoxicating."

Evelyn scrambled backward, hiding her hands behind her back. A small damp patch stained her white blouse.

"I spilled some milk." She forced composure into her voice. "Just an accident."

Adrian's gaze dropped to her concealed hands. With lightning reflexes, he snatched the pink cup she'd been hiding.

"Hey!" Evelyn gasped.

Adrian tipped his head back and drained the remaining liquid. He licked his lips, savoring the taste.

"Not bad." He shook the empty cup. "Got any more?"

Evelyn's vision darkened. That had been her freshly expressed breast milk.
###Chapter 471

Evelyn's eyes widened in shock.

Adrian had just stolen the children's milk.

He tilted his head back and drank it in one gulp, his Adam's apple bobbing as the rich aroma filled the air.

"Interesting flavor," he murmured, licking his lips with obvious satisfaction.

Evelyn's jaw dropped.

"You..." Her voice trembled. "You liked it?"

Adrian arched a brow. "Is there a problem?"

She swallowed hard.

That was breast milk!

She had carefully curated her diet to ensure the milk was nutrient-rich, naturally sweet.

Sophia nursed for hours every night, and Ethan, though less demanding, still relied on it.

"You... can drink it," she managed, her expression conflicted.

Adrian shook the empty cup. "Got more?"

Evelyn took two steps back.

She did, but she'd have to express it fresh.

"Selfish," he scoffed.

She was too furious to speak.

She pumped diligently every day just to keep up with the twins' needs.

Those little connoisseurs refused formula outright—only her milk would do.

Gabrielle had been stuffing her with supplements, resulting in an oversupply even the twins couldn't finish.

"Give that back!" She lunged for the cup.

Adrian dodged effortlessly, eyeing the last few drops.

"We used to share glasses," he teased, his smile suggestive.

Evelyn's temper flared.

No wonder Sophia kept trying to lift her shirt!

"Adrian!" She gritted her teeth. "That was then. This is now!"

She drew a sharp breath.

"We're nothing to each other anymore. Stay out of my life!"

With that, she turned on her heel and left.

Once, he had been her only light.

Then, at her happiest moment, he had snuffed it out himself.

Adrian watched her retreating figure, his gaze unreadable.

"Strangers?" He chuckled darkly. "Then let's get acquainted again."

Evelyn stormed back into the private dining room and slammed the bottle onto the table.

"What happened?" Scarlett startled.

"Ran into Adrian." Evelyn seethed. "He drank all the milk I pumped!"

Scarlett spat out her water.

"He drank breast milk?!" Her voice hit an octave higher. "He knew what it was, right?"

Evelyn massaged her temples. "He said it tasted good."

Scarlett's face went blank with disbelief.
###Chapter 472

Evelyn shook her head. "He didn't notice at all. He even complimented the taste and asked for a second cup."

Scarlett burst into laughter, slapping the table in amusement.

"Oh my god, Adrian is absolutely ridiculous!" She doubled over, tears forming at the corners of her eyes.

Evelyn sighed. "Is it really that funny?"

Wiping her tears, Scarlett gasped, "Of course! The mighty CEO of Valentine Group stealing his own child's milk!"

And he actually wanted more.

Evelyn remained silent.

She picked up a piece of steamed sea bass. Tonight's seafood feast was lavish, complete with her favorite sashimi.

Scarlett was already devouring the spicy fish.

"Evelyn, actually—"

"Let's eat first." Evelyn cut her off, unwilling to continue the topic.

Between her and Adrian, it was time to draw the line.

"Once the children turn three, I'll take them to Falcon Training Camp for a while."

She stated it plainly.

"I'll go too! Perfect timing for my new role's physical prep." Scarlett's eyes lit up. "Training with you always motivates me."

Evelyn smirked. "Just don't complain about the pain."

"But isn't it too harsh for them at such a young age?" Scarlett frowned, concerned.

Raised in privilege, she couldn't fathom that Evelyn had begun heir training at three.

"Tristan is the heir. This is necessary." Evelyn's tone was firm. "I'll be with them often."

Scarlett fell silent. She understood the weight of an heir's duty.

After dinner, Scarlett groaned, rubbing her stomach. "I'm stuffed."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Serves you right for overeating. Let's walk back."

"Can I stay at your place for a few days?" Scarlett blinked hopefully.

"Suit yourself." Evelyn chuckled. "When I'm away, you can visit your brother across the street."

Laughing, they left the restaurant, unaware of Adrian watching from the shadows.

At the mention of "across the street," his eyes turned icy.

After all this time searching, she had been living right opposite Sebastian.
###Chapter 473

"The contract is signed, Mr. Valentine." Victor Ashcroft handed over the documents respectfully.

Adrian Valentine gave a slight nod.

Victor suddenly lowered his voice. "It's Ms. Roland."

The corner of Adrian's lips lifted almost imperceptibly.

The black Maybach started smoothly, maintaining a safe distance behind Evelyn Roland.

Scarlett Orlando was wrapped in an oversized trench coat, her face mostly hidden behind sunglasses.

Victor couldn't help muttering, "Strange. Where exactly does Ms. Roland live?"

Adrian's gaze remained fixed on that slender figure.

Evelyn was strolling down the street with Scarlett.

A heated argument suddenly erupted from around the corner.

"Daniel! Let me go!" Natalie Lowell's voice trembled.

Daniel Sherwood gripped her wrist tightly. "Natalie, let's get back together."

Natalie's face was flushed, her steps unsteady. "Did you drug me?"

A triumphant smile spread across Daniel's face. "The hotel is just ahead."

As Evelyn moved to intervene, a dark figure flashed past.

Nathan Aldridge punched Daniel to the ground.

"Mr. Aldridge?" Evelyn stared in shock at the man who had appeared out of nowhere.

Daniel clutched his bleeding nose. "This is between husband and wife!"

Nathan sneered. "Drugging someone?" He kicked Daniel again.

Natalie stumbled into Nathan's arms.

"Take me away..." Her scorching breath brushed against his neck.

Her fingers crumpled his shirt, leaving behind smudges of lipstick.

Evelyn and Scarlett exchanged glances.

Inside the Maybach, Adrian's eyes darkened.

###Chapter 474

Nathan's eyes darkened, a meaningful smile playing at the corners of his lips. Natalie's cheeks flushed pink, her gaze shimmering like rippling spring water.

His Adam's apple bobbed as heat surged through him. His fingers unconsciously tightened, then slowly relaxed.

"Miss Lowell." His voice came out husky. "Do you recognize who I am?"

Though her consciousness blurred, Natalie still recognized the man before her. Her fingers clutched his collar as she murmured weakly, "Mr. Aldridge... take me away..."

She squirmed restlessly, her dress slipping slightly to reveal a sliver of pale skin glowing enticingly under the lights.

Nathan's gaze deepened. Leaning close, he whispered against her ear, "As you wish."

His warm breath brushed her earlobe, sending shivers through her body. She clung to him like a lifeline.

Daniel scrambled to his feet, about to curse, when bodyguards immediately pinned him down. Without sparing him a glance, Nathan carried Natalie straight to the black Maybach parked nearby.

Evelyn and Scarlett stared in stunned silence.

"Just like that?" Scarlett finally managed. "He took her away?"

Evelyn frowned. The drug Natalie had been given was no ordinary substance—taking her to a hospital might only make things worse. Thinking of the fiercely protective head of the Lowell family, she couldn't help but worry for Nathan.

"Scarlett, do you think Nathan..." Scarlett's eyes sparkled. "Those moves earlier were so dashing!"

Evelyn chuckled. "A man his age should settle down." She winked. "I promised him a villa at Palais de Beauté when he gets married."

"Palais de Beauté?!" Scarlett gasped. "The lake views there are breathtaking!"

"Like it?" Evelyn pinched her cheek playfully. "When you get married, I'll let you stay in half of it."

Scarlett nuzzled her shoulder with a grin. "Love you the most!"

"Don't." Evelyn feigned disgust. "My preferences are strictly conventional."

Scarlett's smile faded. "What's so great about men anyway..."

Evelyn caught the shift immediately. "You and my brother—"

"Don't be ridiculous!" Scarlett cut her off sharply. "I'd rather have you as my sister-in-law!"

The reaction was too telling. Evelyn sighed softly. "He just... has his reservations."

Scarlett turned away. Moonlight caught the glimmer of tears at the corners of her eyes.

"Let's go." She rubbed her eyes. "I'm tired."

The night breeze brushed past as Evelyn watched her friend's slender, solitary figure. A pang of sorrow tightened her chest.
###Chapter 475

Adrian Valentine sat in his car, his gaze locked onto Evelyn Roland in the distance.

She stood by the roadside with Scarlett Orlando, laughing under the sunlight. Her radiant smile struck his heart like a sharp blade.

Sebastian Cortez's car soon arrived, and the two women got in before driving away.

"Follow them," Adrian ordered, his voice low.

Victor Ashcroft tightened his grip on the steering wheel. "Sir, Sebastian's driving skills are unmatched. I've lost him multiple times already."

Not just Sebastian—even Sophia Blanchet could easily shake him off. Everyone from Sterling Manor was a master at evasion.

True to form, a truck abruptly cut into their lane. By the time they maneuvered around it, their target had vanished without a trace.

Adrian's expression darkened. "This happens every time?"

"Yes, sir." Victor wiped the sweat from his brow.

Back at the Bamboo Whisper Villa, Adrian stood in the foyer, staring into the pitch-black living room.

He flicked the light switch. Harsh brightness flooded the space, but it couldn't dispel the hollowness inside him.

His eyes drifted toward the kitchen. There used to be a small nightlight there, with Evelyn always preparing warm midnight snacks for him.

Now, only cold countertops remained.

He collapsed onto the sofa, sinking into the plush cushions. The soft glow of the living room lights draped over him like a thin veil, accentuating his loneliness.

Longing crashed over him like tidal waves. He missed Evelyn's warm embrace, the faint scent of gardenias clinging to her skin.

The happiness he had destroyed with his own hands had become his cruelest punishment.

For three years, every night was torment. Her smiling face haunted his dreams, only to leave him with an empty bed upon waking.

His fists clenched, nails digging into his palms. Revenge wasn't complete yet, but he couldn't wait any longer.

He just wanted to return to her side—even if only to watch from afar.

Cold water cascaded over his head, failing to numb the pain in his chest. Adrian stood under the shower, letting the icy streams scour his body.

......

Morning sunlight filtered through the hospital curtains.

Eleanor Langley suddenly sat up in bed, her eyes darting around before she lunged at Jonathan Savigny with a hysterical scream. "Why did you crash into my car? I never got to see my daughter one last time!"
###Chapter 476

Jonathan Savigny held Eleanor Langley's trembling shoulders tightly. "Eleanor, you were driving too fast. I couldn't avoid you in time."

Her fists pounded against his chest, tears soaking through his shirt.

"This is all your fault!" Her voice was hoarse. "I finally found my biological daughter, but I didn't even get to see her one last time!"

His fingers brushed through her disheveled hair.

His voice trembled. "I only came looking for you after seeing the news. Cassandra Valentine might really be your daughter."

Eleanor jerked her head up, tears still clinging to her lashes.

"She was already cremated?" Her nails dug into her palms.

Jonathan nodded. "Adrian Valentine handled it. He wanted to give his sister a proper farewell."

Autumn wind rattled the window, carrying fallen leaves.

Eleanor shivered violently. Jonathan immediately stood to close the window.

Her gaze burned into the white hospital sheets, hatred flaring in her eyes.

"Isabella Langley will pay for this."

Sophia Blanchet hid around the corner of the hallway, her phone camera aimed at the hospital room.

She clicked her tongue and shook her head, quickly texting Evelyn Roland: "Eleanor is having an affair with her assistant. I'm going to plant surveillance at Isabella's place."

Evelyn was nursing little Sophia Roland when her phone screen lit up.

Ethan Roland sat obediently in his high chair, his cheeks smeared with carrot puree.

"Mommy." Sophia suddenly tugged at Evelyn's collar.

Gabrielle Flores laughed as she carried a bowl of soup. "Breast milk is the best nutrition. You should keep it up for another six months."

Evelyn's ears turned red.

The embarrassing moment from yesterday flashed in her mind—when she'd nearly been caught nursing by the baby's father.

"About weaning..."

Gabrielle blinked. "Let's wait until after autumn."

Sophia had already latched on with practiced ease. Evelyn sighed in resignation.
###Chapter 477

"Ma...mama..." Little Sophia tugged at her collar with tiny hands, her eyes brimming with tears.

Her rosy lips quivered, on the verge of crying.

Evelyn set down her chopsticks and carried her daughter to the sofa to nurse.

A sudden thought struck her. "Where's Scarlett?"

Gabrielle was playing with her grandson. "She said she's going to watch a play."

"A play?" Evelyn arched an eyebrow.

"Something about Nathan's performance. She left early this morning." Gabrielle smiled knowingly.

Evelyn understood instantly.

That girl actually went to spy on Nathan and Natalie?

Natalie woke to sunlight streaming through the curtains.

She tried to turn over, but her body ached as if she'd been run over.

Memories of last night flooded back.

She bolted upright, scanning the room.

A hotel suite.

She had really slept with Nathan...

A bitter smile tugged at Natalie's lips.

Men were all the same.

The sound of running water came from the bathroom.

She looked down at the marks scattered across her skin and shook her head with a wry laugh.

A neatly folded set of fresh clothes lay on the bedside table.

At least Nathan was considerate.

Gritting her teeth, she dressed her sore body.

Her legs gave out the moment she stood, sending her crashing to her knees.

That man had too much stamina.

One last glance at the blurred silhouette behind the frosted glass, and Natalie clenched her jaw as she left the room.

Scarlett crouched in the café across from the hotel.

She chewed on her straw, eyes locked on the revolving door.

"Cough—!"

When she saw Natalie emerge, hand pressed to her lower back, she nearly choked on a tapioca pearl.

"Nathan, you sly dog!"

Fumbling, she yanked out her phone.

"Victoria! Breaking news!" she shrieked as soon as the call connected. "Nathan actually slept with Natalie!"

Evelyn patted Sophia's back to burp her. "You're at the hotel?"

"Of course!" Scarlett waved her arms excitedly. "I just saw Natalie walking out holding her waist! Who knew that pretty boy Nathan had it in him?"
###Chapter 478

Evelyn raised an eyebrow. "You actually staked out the hotel? Scarlett, you're unbelievable!"

"Pfft."
Scarlett scoffed. "Why would I stalk them? I just drove my sports car over to watch the drama unfold. Best entertainment ever."

"Just saw Natalie limping out of the hotel. Can you imagine how wild last night must've been? Hahaha..."

Evelyn massaged her temples. No wonder the girl had disappeared this morning—she'd gone to indulge in gossip. How bored was she?

Rich people's problems really just boiled down to finding amusement.

"Hey, it's been years since our families had a proper celebration. Think Nathan might pull a shotgun wedding?" Scarlett suddenly mused.

Evelyn sighed. "I wish they'd settle down already. They're all at that age, still single. As their older sister, it's frustrating."

They'd grown up together, and Evelyn genuinely wanted them to find happiness.

"Why the rush? When fate comes knocking, you'll have your hands full. There are several of them—plenty to keep you busy." Scarlett took a leisurely bite of her savory pancake.

With no work commitments lately, she'd even sent her manager on vacation. Dieting could wait.

Evelyn shook her head. "Enough chitchat. I need to feed Sophia."

Scarlett grinned. "Go ahead. I'll keep enjoying my drama."

The moment she hung up, Scarlett spotted Nathan exiting the hotel. His thunderous expression made her retract her hand from the car door.

Huh? That wasn't right.
She'd never seen him look so furious before.

Whatever. Spoiled gossip wasn't worth it. Time to go home and nap.
Scarlett summoned her driver and made a quick escape.

Nathan was seething.
He'd stepped out of the shower to find Natalie gone.

After initiating everything last night, she'd slipped away while he was showering?
He'd see how far she could run.

Yanking at his tie in irritation, Nathan cursed himself for agreeing to her absurd request.

It wasn't their first meeting, yet when he saw her ex-husband drugging her drink last night—and her blindly drinking it—
Something inside him snapped.

His assistant nervously pulled up the car. "To the office," Nathan ordered coldly.

...

Evelyn didn't interfere with Nathan's affairs.
She never meddled in her siblings' love lives.

After eighteen, they had their freedom—her only rule was to never expose her true identity.

"Sophia, time to eat."
Evelyn reached for her daughter.

The little girl clung to her collar, still wanting to nurse.

Evelyn gently pinched her nose. "Ouch..."
Sophia whined in protest.

"You know it hurts? No more nursing starting today. Mommy's in pain too."
###Chapter 479

Felicia understood her mother's words immediately and burst into loud, dramatic sobs.

Evelyn Roland: "..."

How could this child cry so much?

If she's like this now, she'll probably cry herself unconscious when she's older.

"Evelyn, how could you bully your own daughter?" Gabrielle Flores said disapprovingly as she walked over and scooped Felicia into her arms.

Evelyn didn't bother explaining. She straightened her collar. "I'm going to the office today."

Gabrielle rocked the crying child gently. "Fine. I'll bring them by for their noon feeding."

"Gabrielle..."

"Evelyn, just one more year. Please?"

Evelyn fell silent. She could never win an argument with her sister.

"Take Felicia for breakfast." Evelyn stroked her daughter's tear-streaked cheek.

She leaned down to kiss her son. "Be good, Tristan. Mommy's going to work."

Tristan kept his head down, his small fingers clutching the hem of her blazer.

Evelyn's heart softened. For a moment, she almost stayed.

After finally soothing her son, Evelyn left with Sophia Blanchet.

Zachary Deross had been waiting by the car.

Once inside, Evelyn said, "To the office."

"Of course." Zachary started the engine.

As Evelyn fastened her seatbelt, her phone rang.

"Yes?"

"Darling, Grandmother collapsed. She's at the hospital now and wants to see you." Adrian Valentine's voice was heavy with exhaustion.

Evelyn instinctively wanted to refuse. But remembering the old woman's kindness, she asked, "Which hospital?"

"Mine. Top floor." His tone softened.

"Understood."

After hanging up, Evelyn changed the destination. "Valentine Medical Center."

Zachary frowned but complied. "Very well."

Thirty minutes later, the car arrived.

Evelyn took the elevator alone.

The doors opened to reveal Adrian waiting in the hallway.

Dressed in a black leather jacket with dark circles under his eyes, he still exuded aristocratic elegance.

Seeing Evelyn in her tailored pink suit—sharp yet refined—he smiled. "Darling."

She ignored the endearment. "Where's Grandmother?"

Her voice was glacial.

Adrian's fingers twitched. "This way."

Beatrice Valentine's room was at the end of the corridor.

The elderly woman smiled weakly when Evelyn entered. "You came, my dear."

Evelyn took her frail hand. "Grandmother, what's wrong?"
###Chapter 480

Beatrice Valentine gazed at Evelyn Roland with grandmotherly affection, the corners of her eyes crinkling with warmth.

"I'm so happy you came to visit this old woman."

She gently patted Evelyn's hand.

"You look much better since leaving that foolish grandson of mine. More vibrant. A woman should live for herself."

A sigh escaped Beatrice's lips as wisdom flickered in her aged eyes.

Evelyn smiled softly. She knew the elder had always been perceptive.

"Don't worry, Grandmother. I'm doing well now."

Her voice carried the calm of still waters, three years having smoothed away old wounds.

Beatrice glanced at her grandson standing by the window.

Adrian Valentine remained silent, his gaze never leaving Evelyn.

"Ah!" Beatrice sighed again.

She remembered asking three years ago if he'd regret his choice. His answer had been resolute.

Now he alone must swallow this bitter fruit.

"Evelyn, where are you living now? I know you left with nothing—"

Evelyn interrupted gently, "I have my own place. Please don't concern yourself."

Beatrice's expression turned grave.

"Child, at my age, Adrian is my greatest worry. These years seeking vengeance for his father have cost him too much."

She clasped Evelyn's hand tightly.

"I don't expect forgiveness. But you deserve the truth. The divorce was to protect you. Someone meant you harm—"

Adrian's brow furrowed. Why was his grandmother revealing this now?

Evelyn withdrew her hand. "Let the past stay in the past."

Her eyes held steady certainty.

"Mr. Valentine and I are finished. You've always understood things clearly."

Adrian's face darkened instantly, fists clenching at his sides.

Pain flashed in Beatrice's eyes.

Three years. She'd thought the truth would surface in two.

"Reclaiming your heart now would be harder than scaling heaven."

A bitter smile touched her lips. "This is my fault."

"Grandmother." Adrian's voice was low. "The blame is mine alone. But I regret nothing."

Beatrice studied her grandson before sighing helplessly.

Suddenly she shifted topics. "How is your grandfather's health?"

Evelyn's head snapped up, shock widening her eyes.

"You...know my grandfather?"

Beatrice nodded. "Frederick Roland and I are acquainted."

Adrian's pupils constricted. Evelyn had never mentioned family.

Evelyn remained cautiously silent.

"Don't worry," Beatrice soothed. "I mean no harm."

"He's currently at the Red Sea. Returning soon." Evelyn answered quietly.

Beatrice stiffened. "The Red Sea?"

Her fingers absently traced her teacup's rim as her gaze drifted into memory.
###Chapter 481

"He visits that place every year. Someone important to him is there." Evelyn Roland explained softly.

Beatrice Valentine's eyes flickered with recognition. An old flame?

He still remembered?

She gazed at Evelyn with grandmotherly affection. "Evelyn, I truly adore you."

Evelyn casually took her pulse. The elderly woman had been sustained by vengeance for her son's death, maintaining decent health through sheer willpower.

Now that the matter concerning Adrian's father was settled, that driving force had dissipated. Her vitality had visibly declined.

The weak pulse confirmed Evelyn's fears. Beatrice seemed to have lost the will to live.

Evelyn's heart clenched. "Grandmother, you must take care of yourself. You haven't seen Adrian settle down yet, nor held your great-grandchild. You just said living is what matters most."

Beatrice smiled faintly. "I've lived long enough. Only you children worry me now."

She didn't elaborate, fearing to burden Evelyn with excessive sentimentality.

Evelyn gripped her hand tighter. Only Adrian could motivate Beatrice now.

"Grandmother, Adrian still faces many dangers. Will you abandon him?"

"Those threats can't touch him anymore."

Beatrice lowered her eyes, shadows crossing her face. She'd known wealth and privilege, experienced true love in her lifetime.

With a devoted father and filial son, she should have no regrets.

Yet her only child had died young, leaving only her grandson behind.

Seeing Beatrice sink deeper into melancholy, Evelyn grew anxious. Treating elderly patients who'd given up on life was notoriously difficult.

"Grandmother." Evelyn understood Beatrice had resisted waking after fainting the previous night.

Beatrice opened her eyes slowly, their usual sharpness clouded over.

The sight pierced Evelyn's heart.

"Evelyn, promise you'll take care of yourself." Suddenly, Beatrice seemed slightly more alert, her gaze clearing momentarily.

"Grandmother, you haven't seen me find happiness yet. Didn't you say I was like your own granddaughter?" Evelyn kept her tone light, refusing to let Beatrice surrender.

"Indeed, I've always considered you family, but..." Beatrice sighed heavily. "I have no unfinished business left."

Her grandson had grown into a capable man. Her sole regret was his divorce from Evelyn.

"Grandmother, don't you want to witness our happiness? We haven't even had our wedding yet. You can't leave like this."

Adrian finally spoke up. Having been protected by Beatrice since childhood, he couldn't accept her slipping away like this.

He'd anticipated this moment—once his father's death was avenged, Beatrice would lose her reason to keep fighting. When his grandfather passed, she'd wanted to follow him then, only staying for revenge.

Evelyn shot him a silent look. How could he say such things?

She hadn't agreed to reconcile.

She still had her own path to walk.

Beatrice's eyes suddenly brightened, darting between Evelyn and Adrian. She genuinely wished they'd reunite—for the Valentine family's stability.

And Evelyn had always been her ideal granddaughter-in-law.

The thought energized Beatrice visibly. She grasped Evelyn's hand urgently. "Evelyn, have you truly forgiven this foolish boy?"
###Chapter 482

Evelyn shot a cold glance at the elderly woman before turning her gaze to Adrian.

She would never forgive him.

No matter what excuses he had, she was the one who suffered. No one understood that heart-wrenching pain better than her.

Adrian met her accusatory stare, the corner of his lips quirking up. "Darling, there's something you should know. We never actually got divorced."

Evelyn shot to her feet, the chair screeching against the floor. "Adrian, what the hell do you mean?"

Seeing her furious reaction actually eased the tension in his chest.

The way she had been laughing with Sebastian earlier nearly made him crush his wineglass.

"Have you ever heard of a couple getting their divorce certificate on the same day?"

Evelyn froze. It was her first divorce—how would she know the legal intricacies?

They had followed the proper procedures. How could it not be finalized?

"Stop lying. I have the divorce papers right here." She clenched her fists.

The elderly woman's eyes lit up, her wrinkles smoothing with delight.

Still married? That meant her dream of holding a great-grandchild might come true after all.

"Dear, there's a mandatory one-month cooling-off period for divorces now. It can't be done in a single day," the old woman added cheerfully, twisting the knife.

Evelyn fell silent.

That day, she had been in too much pain after being shot to think clearly.

She took the divorce papers and left without another thought.

She spent a month recovering alone at Regal Heights, barely pulling herself together.

And now she was being told it was all a lie?

"Adrian!" Her voice trembled with fury. "You even lied about the divorce?"

Adrian lowered his gaze. "Darling, I couldn't let you go."

"You couldn't? Well, I can! I'm going to the civil affairs office to check right now!"

Evelyn slammed a bottle of medicine on the table and stormed out without looking back.

The old woman sighed, shaking her head. "You had a good thing, and you ruined it. When I asked if you'd regret it, you were so stubborn."

Adrian stared at the doorway, his expression unreadable.

"Grandmother, the Valentines are too dangerous for her. I didn't even dare to make our relationship public—how could I protect her?"

He paused, his voice dropping lower. "I'll win her back. Focus on recovering. Who knows? You might be holding a great-grandchild by next year."

The thought of a chubby little bundle made the old woman beam with joy.
###Chapter 483

Beatrice Valentine leaned against the soft pillows, her fingers tracing the rim of her teacup. "Our family hasn't celebrated anything in a long time. Holding a great-grandchild before I close my eyes would make this old woman's life complete." She paused, giving Adrian Valentine a meaningful look. "But you'll need to step up your efforts."

Adrian frowned.

"The Evelyn Roland of today isn't someone you can win back so easily." Beatrice sighed. "You didn't cherish her when she was by your side. Now you want to fix things? It's harder than reaching the heavens. With your current status, you might not even be worthy of her anymore."

Adrian's head snapped up. "Grandmother, you mentioned Evelyn's grandfather just now... Wasn't she an orphan?"

Beatrice shifted, her aged bones creaking faintly. "You..." She pointed at him in exasperation. "You claim to love her, yet you never even bothered to learn her true background. If that isn't disdain, what is?"

"That's not true!" Adrian's voice rose sharply. "If I looked down on her, why would I have married her? Grandmother, you can't question my feelings like this."

His fists clenched, knuckles turning white. "I kept our marriage secret to protect her from those people. Even our wedding had to be done in the shadows... Do you have any idea how much it hurt? Watching those men at the company swarm around her, I wanted to—"

Years of suppressed frustration finally found release. For the first time, Adrian dropped all pretenses in front of the grandmother who had doted on him since childhood.

Beatrice waved a hand. "Enough. I know you care deeply. But the Evelyn of today is no longer that naive girl you could manipulate so easily." Her expression turned grave. "Her grandfather is someone of considerable influence. Everything you've done these years—he's been watching."

Adrian's pupils contracted.

"Even if you were still married, winning her back would require his approval first." Beatrice's tone carried a warning. "I'm telling you this now so you can prepare for a long battle."

Adrian's face darkened.

It struck him then—he knew nothing about the woman who had shared his bed for years.

Meanwhile, Evelyn Roland slid into the backseat of a car, her expression icy.

"To the civil affairs office," she ordered, her voice tight with suppressed fury. "Now."

Sophia Blanchet, sitting in the passenger seat, startled. "Sis, why are we going there?"

"To verify something." Evelyn stared straight ahead, her jawline tense.

Sophia wisely fell silent. In the rearview mirror, she caught the storm brewing in her sister's eyes.

The civil affairs office was nearly empty.

Evelyn slapped her ID card onto the counter. "I need a replacement marriage certificate."

The clerk took the document. "Please fill out this form first. We'll need to check our records."

The pen scratched against paper. Evelyn watched the clerk's fingers move across the keyboard, her heartbeat accelerating.

"A replacement is possible," the clerk finally said. "Would you like to proceed now?"

Evelyn's breath caught.

No divorce record?

Her voice trembled. "So... my marital status is still... married?"
###Chapter 484 

The clerk looked bewildered by Evelyn's question.

"Ma'am, aren't you here to replace your marriage certificate? How could we issue a replacement if you weren't legally married? Let me process that for you right away."

Evelyn froze in place.

The efficient clerk soon handed her a brand new crimson booklet.

She stumbled out of the civil affairs office like a ghost.

Sunshine bathed the streets, but her heart felt weighed down by stones.

Adrian Valentine had deceived her for years.

"Adrian, you lying bastard!" she muttered through clenched teeth. "We've been over for ages!"

She'd specifically inquired about divorce procedures during breastfeeding periods. Court intervention would expose their twins' existence.

"How could this happen..." Evelyn clutched her head in agony.

"All settled, darling?" Adrian's lazy drawl materialized behind her.

She whirled around.

Sunlight gilded his hair as he stood there with that infuriating smirk.

"Adrian!" Her entire body trembled with rage. "Was this some twisted game to you? Marriage, divorce—all at your whim. What am I to you? If you never loved me, why couldn't you let me go? Even the divorce papers were fake! Is there a single truthful word in that mouth?"

Years of careful planning—shattered in an instant.

Adrian studied her flushed cheeks in silence.

Even furious, she looked breathtaking—those parted lips, the heaving chest.

How he longed to confess his undying feelings.

"It took me two years to move on," Evelyn's voice cracked. "And now you tell me we were never divorced? Do you find this amusing, Adrian?"

Only those who've loved and lost understand the agony of forgetting.

Her intensity caught him off guard.

"Sweetheart, I—"

A glacial glare silenced him. She turned on her heel.

Three steps away, she remembered the offensive booklet in her hand.

With all her strength, she hurled it at him.

"I signed those divorce papers. You could've finalized it anytime. No shared assets, no complications—just clean closure."

Watching her retreating figure, Adrian's heart splintered.

He'd wounded her deeply, but surrender wasn't an option.

Evelyn drove off without a backward glance.

Adrian bent to retrieve their marriage certificate. His fingers traced the photograph of their smiling faces.

A smile tugged at his lips unbidden.

Those mesmerizing eyes burned with unwavering determination—he would win her back.
###Chapter 485

Warren Garten and Isabella Langley stood side by side at the entrance of the civil affairs office.

Isabella had dressed meticulously for the occasion, her white dress enhancing her delicate beauty. She needed to marry Warren quickly to salvage her crumbling reputation.

Suddenly, the sound of Evelyn Roland and Adrian Valentine's conversation reached her ears.

Isabella's smile froze. She remembered the day she had followed Adrian here—how it had all been an elaborate ruse he'd orchestrated.

Her heart felt as if it had been pierced by a blade. She had believed herself the victor, only to realize she'd been the fool all along.

"Adrian Valentine!" Isabella shrieked, her composure shattered. "You only got close to me to investigate your father's death! Even our divorce was just part of your act!"

Under the sunlight, Adrian narrowed his mesmerizing peach-blossom eyes. He adjusted his cufflinks lazily, a mocking smile playing on his lips. "You flatter yourself."

Three simple words plunged Isabella into an icy abyss.

She stared at him, spellbound. He stood there like an ink-wash painting—aloof, aristocratic, and lethally captivating.

From the first moment she had secretly watched him after returning to the country, she had been utterly consumed. He filled her dreams, her thoughts, even her every breath.

She had believed she possessed him, but she had never truly had him at all.

"Hahaha..." Isabella suddenly burst into laughter, the sound hollow and bitter.

Warren wrapped an arm around her shoulders. "Isabella, let's go get our marriage license. I'm the only one who will never deceive you." He shot Adrian a challenging look.

Adrian didn't even spare him a glance. As he turned to leave, he tossed over his shoulder, "May you have a long and happy marriage. Though..." He paused. "Let's see if you make it to the new year."

Isabella's nails dug into her palms as she glared at Adrian's retreating figure. "Warren, I want Evelyn dead."

A ruthless glint flashed in Warren's eyes. "Don't worry. I already have men tailing her. And Cassandra Valentine—she'll be dealt with by tonight."

Only then did Isabella smile. She linked arms with Warren and strode toward the civil affairs office. Nearby, lurking reporters immediately raised their cameras.

One hour later.

Evelyn sat in her office, absently toying with a crystal rabbit charm—the first gift Adrian had ever given her.

"Evelyn," his voice echoed in her memory, soft and tender. "When I'm not here, let this little rabbit keep you company."
###Chapter 486

Evelyn still remembered that afternoon vividly.

Sunlight filtered through the sheer curtains, tracing the perfect contours of his profile.

Compelled by some unseen force, she rose on her toes and brushed her lips against his.

"Okay," she whispered against his ear, her voice barely audible.

It was one of the rare moments she initiated affection.

Adrian's eyes darkened with desire as he pinned her against the wall until dusk.

Afterward, he held her close, satisfaction lacing his voice. "Again, darling."

The memory washed over her like a tidal wave.

Evelyn's fingers absently traced the crystal figurine on her desk.

"Evelyn?" Sophia entered with a glass of milk. "The meeting starts in five minutes."

She blinked, realizing three hours had slipped away.

"What's on the agenda today?" She took a sip, her tone disinterested.

Sophia hesitated. "Nathan's been..."

"What about him?"

"Yelling since dawn. His assistant left in tears."

Evelyn recalled Scarlett's morning call.

Natalie had left the hotel alone. Nathan stormed out after her.

A lovers' quarrel, then.

Rubbing her temples, Evelyn exhaled.

Her own life was tangled enough without playing referee.

"Let him vent." She grabbed her purse. "I'm leaving early."

Sophia suggested, "There's the charity gala tonight. Nathan's representing the company. You could—"

"No." Evelyn dialed Scarlett's number. "What are you craving?"

A yawn answered her. "Lamb skewers..."

"Have Victoria make them." She glanced outside. "I'll be home soon."

Hanging up, her fingers found the bunny charm in her pocket.

She'd discarded her wedding ring during the divorce—but kept this.

Sunlight glinted off the crystal rabbit.

The food market buzzed with life.

Evelyn inhaled the savory scents and disappeared into the crowd.
###Chapter 487

Sophia Blanchet linked arms with her sister as they strolled down the bustling shopping street. Knowing Evelyn had been under immense work pressure lately, she'd deliberately brought her out to unwind.

Evelyn Roland cradled a freshly bought portion of crispy tofu, its steaming aroma wafting up. She took a bite, the crunchy exterior giving way to silky softness as spicy flavors exploded on her tongue, momentarily pushing her worries aside.

"Look! Cotton candy!" Sophia's eyes lit up as she pointed to a roadside stall. The vintage bicycle cart displayed rainbow-hued spun sugar glinting in the sunlight.

With a smile, Evelyn bought her sister a pink heart-shaped cloud. Sophia accepted it with childlike delight, transporting Evelyn back to their childhood days of sharing sweets.

"Let's get hotpot," Evelyn suggested. "There's a new Sichuan-style place in the back alley."

Sophia frowned. "But Gabrielle said you're on a restricted diet—"

"Just for today." Evelyn winked. "I haven't had spicy food in ages."

Inside the steamy restaurant, crimson broth bubbled violently. Evelyn swished a slice of tripe through the boiling oil—seven dips up, eight dips down. The numbing heat made her sigh contentedly.

Emerging later, both women reeked of spices. Sophia sniffed her sleeve. "Gabrielle's going to smell this from a mile away."

"No spare clothes in the car?"

"Zachary took it today."

As night deepened, they walked slowly to let the breeze dissipate the scent. Neon lights bathed the streets in artificial daylight. Evelyn glanced at the smoggy sky, lamenting the absent stars.

Suddenly, she froze. Squinting down a dim alley, she caught movement—two shadowy figures dragging a woman. The victim's faint whimper carried on the wind: "H-help..."

Sophia followed her sister's gaze. "What's wrong?"

"Someone's being abducted." Evelyn was already striding toward the alley.

The desperate cry came again, clearer now. Sophia's pulse spiked as she sprinted after Evelyn toward the danger.
###Chapter 488

The heavy scent of grease hit Evelyn Roland as the storage door behind the bar kitchen swung open.

Sophia Blanchet followed closely, her high heels making sticky sounds on the greasy floor.

"You bitch! You got away last time, but no one's saving you now!"

A man's crude curses echoed from the darkness.

Evelyn froze mid-step.

Cassandra Valentine?

"Back off! Did Isabella send you?" Cassandra's voice trembled.

Evelyn's eyes turned sharp.

"Shut up! No one's coming for you tonight." The man sneered. "After this job, we're getting ten million."

Sophia already had her phone out, recording.

"Call the police," Evelyn ordered under her breath before kicking open the inner door.

Under the dim light, an obese man pinned Cassandra down.

Evelyn lunged forward, grabbing the man by his collar.

"Ah—!" His scream was like a slaughtered pig.

The other three thugs stood frozen.

"You're dead, bitch!" A shirtless brute was the first to react.

With a twist of her wrist, Evelyn slammed the obese man onto the floor.

Cassandra's clothes were disheveled, her face flushed. "Evelyn..."

"Sophia!" Evelyn snapped.

Sophia had already sent the recording to the police.

Evelyn's fist flew through the air, striking the nearest man.

Crack!

The sound of a breaking nose was unmistakable.

Blood splattered across the greasy walls.

Before the second thug could react, a side kick sent him flying.

"My face...!" He writhed on the ground, clutching his face.

The third thug staggered back in fear.

Evelyn advanced, her gaze icy.

"Mercy, please!" He dropped to his knees.

Police sirens wailed outside the warehouse.

Sophia helped the weakened Cassandra up. "Stay with me."

Evelyn pressed her foot down on the obese man's wrist. "Talk. Who sent you?"

Sweat dripped from his face in pain. "It... it was Isa—"

The sirens grew louder.

The thugs looked like ghosts.

Cassandra leaned against Sophia, tears mixing with sweat.

Evelyn released her foot as the fleeing thugs were tackled by police.

"Isabella again," she murmured.
###Chapter 489

Sophia Blanchet and Evelyn Roland moved in perfect sync. Within moments, four burly men lay sprawled across the ground.

Evelyn pressed her boot against the leader's chest. "Did Isabella Langley send you?"

The man's lips turned purple as he shook his head violently. "N-no... don't know any Isabella..."

Beads of sweat formed on his forehead. His voice trembled. "Have mercy, ma'am. We were just hired hands. Go after the middleman—he was involved last time too..."

Evelyn's gaze shifted to the shivering man pinned under Sophia's foot.

With a flick of her fingers, she sent a pill sailing into his mouth.

"Poison," Evelyn said with a smirk. "Lie to me, and you'll never touch a woman again."

The man suddenly clutched his groin and howled. "I'll talk! A man paid us! Last time I escaped before the cops came—"

Sirens wailed in the distance.

Evelyn quickly briefed the arriving officers before helping the disoriented Cassandra Valentine to her feet.

"Officers, these are the same men from last time," Cassandra murmured, her cheeks flushed. Her fingers tugged weakly at her collar. "So hot..."

The police waved urgently. "Get her to a hospital!"

Evelyn nodded, supporting Cassandra as they moved toward the exit.

Sophia handed a recording to the authorities before catching up.

Cold wind hit them at the alley's mouth. Evelyn slipped another pill between Cassandra's lips.

"Hold on," she said, restraining Cassandra's wandering hands. "Ten minutes for it to work."

Cassandra clung to her, breath scorching. "Evelyn..."

Sophia returned at a sprint with ice-cold water.

Cassandra gulped it down greedily before suddenly curling into a shivering ball on the pavement.

Evelyn knelt, letting her lean against one knee.

A cold male voice cut through the night behind them. "Since when did you two get so close?"

###Chapter 490

Evelyn's head snapped up at the familiar voice. Adrian stood in the corridor shadows, his tall frame elongated by the dim lighting. Like a lone wolf, his sharp eyes glinted coldly in the darkness.

"Stay out of my business." Evelyn turned away. "Stop haunting me."

Adrian's brow furrowed. He'd assigned guards to protect her discreetly, knew exactly where she'd been today. Yet she still rejected his presence.

His gaze dropped to Cassandra's flushed face. "What happened this time?"

Cassandra scoffed, finally catching her breath. "Your precious fiancée Isabella strikes again. Failed last time, so she tried once more. How dare you judge me, Adrian?"

Evil always finds opportunity.

"She's not my fiancée." His voice turned glacial.

"Spare me the act." Cassandra sneered. "You and Isabella are cut from the same cloth—running when things get tough. Evelyn divorcing you was the smartest decision."

Leaning on Evelyn's shoulder, she continued her tirade. "Oh, you're so impressive, so handsome, with women throwing themselves at you. But divorcing Evelyn? That's the one decent thing you've done. Couldn't just admit you fell out of love? Had to cheat with that viper Isabella?"

Adrian's expression darkened. His cousin's words painted him as irredeemable.

"You're my sister. Is this appropriate?"

Cassandra barked a laugh. "When have you treated me as family? You knew the truth yet stayed silent, letting your sister and adoptive mother torment me. I nearly died years ago because of you. Don't call me 'sister.'"

She'd heard the family secrets from Grandmother. If Uncle were still alive, the Valentines would reign supreme in Vienna.

Suddenly, Cassandra turned to Evelyn. "I heard you're with Sebastian now? Good choice. Don't let this one slip away."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. Why drag her into their feud?

Adrian's stare turned arctic, locking onto Evelyn.

"Feeling better?" Evelyn asked Cassandra. "If you can stand, let's get you home. I have things to do."

Thoughts of her two children softened her gaze.

Adrian's breath hitched at her fleeting smile—a rare splash of color in his monochrome existence.

His attention snagged on the bunny charm bracelet around her wrist. She still wore it. But the bare ring finger sent his heart plummeting again.

"Evelyn," Cassandra whimpered, "I feel awful. Take me home? Or...let me stay at your place tonight?"

She couldn't face that ice-cold mansion. Her parents only saw her as a cash cow. Returning in this state meant another round of scolding.

Evelyn sighed. "I'll take you home."

Helping Cassandra up, she deliberately avoided Adrian's scorching gaze.
###Chapter 491

The autumn breeze brushed against Cassandra Valentine's cheeks. She took a deep breath, feeling the summer heat gradually fade.

"Let's go." Cassandra tightened her grip on Evelyn Roland's arm, afraid she might change her mind.

Evelyn turned to give instructions. "Sophia, bring the car around."

Sophia Blanchet hurried off.

Adrian Valentine watched Sophia's retreating figure with an unreadable expression.

He silently followed the two women.

Evelyn pretended not to notice.

The trio stood by the roadside waiting. Sophia returned breathlessly. "The tire's flat."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow.

A luxury car shouldn't have a spontaneous flat.

Adrian seized the opportunity. "My car is just ahead."

"No need." Evelyn's voice turned icy. "Sophia, hail a cab."

Sophia rushed off again.

Adrian's eyes darkened. "You'd rather take a taxi than ride with me?"

"Don't ask questions you already know the answer to." Her tone was glacial.

"Darling—"

"Enough!" Evelyn cut him off. "I told you I'd only marry someone who truly loves me."

"That man will never be you."

She severed all possibilities with finality.

Rage flickered in Adrian's eyes. "Evelyn, you'll always be my wife."

"See you tomorrow." He turned away, barely containing his anger.

Evelyn watched his retreating figure, her chest aching faintly.

Once bitten, twice shy.

She no longer dared to touch love lightly.

Cassandra sighed. "You two are actually perfect for each other."

"He just went about it the wrong way."

Evelyn frowned. "Drop it."

"You're becoming a spinster." Cassandra teased. "My brother isn't bad."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Worry about yourself first."

Cassandra's expression dimmed. "Father is forcing me to marry Sebastian Cortez."

"Do you know him? Could you introduce us?"
###Chapter 492

Evelyn's head snapped up. "Who did you just say?"

Cassandra swirled her wine glass, lips curving. "Sebastian Cortez."

Evelyn confirmed she heard right and immediately shook her head. "Forget it. He's taken. I'll introduce you to someone else."

She sighed inwardly. That silly Scarlett would be no match for Cassandra.

Having grown up together, Evelyn much preferred Scarlett as her future sister-in-law.

The Valentines were ambitious schemers. If they latched onto Sterling Manor, who knew what chaos they'd unleash.

If not for Beatrice's iron grip, Valentine Group would have changed hands long ago.

Cassandra suddenly laughed, crescent eyes twinkling. "Perfect. I detest bland men. I prefer the wild, protective type."

Evelyn faltered.

An image of Zachary's muscular frame flashed through her mind—undeniable primal magnetism.

Cassandra exhaled dramatically. "At least I can report back to my parents now."

Evelyn's heart ached at her forced smile. Society heiresses wore gilded cages.

A taxi pulled up.

Sophia opened the passenger door while Evelyn helped Cassandra into the backseat.

Nearby, Adrian lowered his binoculars with a scowl. "Follow that cab."

He'd punctured Evelyn's tires specifically to track her home.

Rush hour traffic crawled through Vienna. Forty minutes later, the taxi stopped before an upscale apartment building.

Evelyn realized Cassandra lived just one block from her own villa.

"Care to come up? I'm on the tenth floor," Cassandra offered by the elevator.

Evelyn declined. "Another time."

Cassandra suddenly spun with outstretched arms. "Knowing Sebastian's taken feels like shedding chains. I can breathe again."

Evelyn blinked.

So she'd misread the situation.

Watching the elevator doors close, Evelyn exhaled in relief.

"Thank goodness she didn't set her sights on Nathan."

Outside, Sophia was speaking with Zachary.

"Boss!" Zachary jogged over, black shirt straining over defined muscles.

Evelyn eyed his bulging biceps. "Where's Nathan?"

"Still negotiating the project." Zachary opened the car door. "Sophia called about your transportation issue."

Evelyn nodded. Nathan's focus meant his emotions remained unaffected.

Leaning back, she closed her eyes—completely oblivious to the sleek black sedan trailing them.

Adrian's fingers drummed the steering wheel, gaze locked on the vehicle ahead.
###Chapter 493

Adrian Valentine switched to an inconspicuous black sedan to follow them.

Victor Ashcroft's hands trembled slightly on the steering wheel. This time, they would definitely find Evelyn's residence.

The car entered an upscale gated community and finally stopped in front of a European-style manor.

Adrian's pupils constricted. So this was where she lived.

Victor sucked in a sharp breath. "Mr. Valentine, this estate is worth at least two hundred million. No wonder we couldn't locate her."

Before Adrian could respond, a silver sports car pulled up in front of the neighboring villa.

Sebastian Orlando stepped out carrying multiple shopping bags, the tips of barbecue skewers poking out from one of them.

"Evelyn, I'm here," he said into his phone. "Brought everything you love."

Evelyn had just settled on the living room couch when she heard his voice. She chuckled. "Scarlett's been craving lamb skewers all week."

"Got them. Be right there." Sebastian hung up and strode toward the entrance.

Adrian watched him enter the opposite villa, recalling the crimson rose garden he'd glimpsed earlier.

"Victor." His voice tightened. "Contact the developer tomorrow. I'm buying a property here."

Victor immediately nodded. "Yes, sir."

Adrian's gaze remained fixed on Evelyn's front door.

His bewilderment about his wife's identity only deepened.

Grandmother Beatrice knew the truth but refused to speak.

Evelyn's connection to Frederick Roland was equally mysterious.

Why could everyone else call her Evelyn, while he was stuck using that man's chosen name for her?

A self-deprecating smirk tugged at Adrian's lips.

Until this puzzle was solved, he would never find peace.

Two hours later, Sebastian and his sister finally emerged from Evelyn's home.

Only when they returned to their own villa did Adrian's tense nerves relax slightly.

"Let's go." His voice was hoarse.

Victor nearly wept with relief as he slammed the accelerator—his bladder was about to burst.

Upstairs in the master bedroom, Ethan Roland slept soundly.

Sophia Roland sat on the carpet stacking blocks. She immediately looked up at the sound of approaching footsteps.

"Mommy..." The toddler wobbled to her feet, tiny hands reaching for Evelyn's collar.

Evelyn sighed and caught the mischievous little fingers.

She blamed Gabrielle's insistence on breastfeeding.

"After Mommy showers, okay?" she coaxed gently.

Sophia blinked her big eyes and nodded, though it was unclear how much she understood.

###Chapter 494

Felicia blinked her big eyes and tugged at Evelyn's sleeve with her tiny hand. "Mommy... bath time," she said in her sweet baby voice.

Evelyn couldn't help but laugh at her daughter's adorable pleading face.

"Alright, Mommy will take a bath." She crouched down and pinched Felicia's chubby cheeks. "But you have to promise not to disturb your brother while he's sleeping."

Felicia immediately pouted, her eyes darting around mischievously.

"Don't play dumb." Evelyn tapped her forehead lightly. "We still haven't talked about how you hid Ethan's toy car yesterday."

The little girl flashed an angelic smile and gestured with her hands. "Felicia good."

Evelyn gave her a skeptical look before heading to the bathroom. She glanced back one last time—Felicia was already engrossed in building with her new blocks, sitting cross-legged on the carpet like a tiny engineer.

Lately, both children had developed a fascination with toy stores. Every time they saw a new toy on TV, they'd drag her shopping the next day. Evelyn shook her head and took a quick shower.

When she stepped out wrapped in a towel, Felicia had abandoned her blocks and was running toward her with outstretched arms.

"Hug!"

Evelyn caught the wiggly bundle and kissed her rosy cheek. The girl had gained weight recently, feeling heavier in her arms.

"Smell nice!" Felicia buried her face in Evelyn's neck, nuzzling contentedly.

Carrying her daughter, Evelyn entered the bedroom. Tristan was already asleep, one small hand resting above his head, lips slightly parted as he breathed evenly. She gently kissed his forehead.

The moment Evelyn set Felicia down, the little girl flipped over and tried to crawl away.

"Bedtime," Evelyn said firmly, holding her in place.

Felicia blinked innocently while reaching for her brother's hair. Evelyn swiftly pulled her back and tucked her under the covers.

"Milk," Felicia bargained.

With a resigned sigh, Evelyn went to prepare a bottle. When she returned, Felicia had twisted herself into a pretzel, one foot sticking up as she tried grabbing her toes.

"Stop playing and drink." Evelyn handed her the bottle.

Felicia continued wiggling while drinking, occasionally letting out happy little hums. Watching her antics, Evelyn couldn't suppress a smile.

Half an hour later, Felicia finally fell asleep, her lips still making sucking motions. Evelyn carefully adjusted her blanket and checked Tristan's covers.

Exhaustion washed over her as she turned off the lights, but her mind remained alert. The day's events replayed like a slideshow behind her eyelids.

She reached for her phone. The bright screen pierced the darkness, illuminating Isabella Langley and Warren Garten's beaming wedding photo trending online, their marriage certificates held proudly.

The comments section had exploded.

—Is this for real? That act with Adrian Valentine was so obviously fake.
—Congrats sis! Warren's way more reliable than Adrian!
—Wake up! Her dad's scandal isn't over. Rumor says today's car crash was staged.

Evelyn massaged her temples. Isabella's latest move was disastrous—she might as well be digging her own grave. Switching off the phone, she stared into the darkness until dawn's first light crept through the curtains.

###Chapter 495

She tossed her phone onto the bedside table and turned over, pulling the blankets tightly around her.

......

Isabella Langley received the news at the same time—Cassandra Valentine had been rescued by Evelyn Roland again.

Her fingers clenched around the phone, knuckles turning white.

Why did Cassandra always escape unscathed?

Crash!

The crystal ornament on the coffee table shattered as she violently swept it onto the floor.

Warren Garten stood nearby, his expression dark. The plan had been flawless, yet they had still failed.

"Is Evelyn some kind of bloodhound?" he gritted out. "How the hell did she find that remote location?"

Murderous intent swirled in Isabella's eyes. "That bitch has to die."

Warren pulled her into his arms. "Don't be angry, darling. Tonight is our wedding night." He kissed her earlobe. "Tomorrow, I'll handle it. No one will trace it back to us."

Isabella leaned against his chest, letting him carry her to bed.

The sound of tearing fabric cut sharply through the room.

Outside the door, Eleanor Langley held up her phone, recording every word of their conversation.

Hearing the noises from inside, she smirked in disdain and slipped away silently.

Back in her room, she sent the recording file to Cassandra.

Eleanor stared at her phone screen, nails digging deep into her palms.

Vincent Langley would return eventually.

Before that, she needed Isabella and Cassandra to tear each other apart.

......

Adrian Valentine's villa was brightly lit.

He unlocked his phone—news of Isabella and Warren's wedding flooded every headline.

Hmph. He tossed the phone onto the sofa.

The bedroom remained exactly as Evelyn had left it.

For the first time, Adrian dared to step inside.

He lay on one side of the bed, fingertips brushing over the pillow she used to sleep on.

In his memories, she always sat propped against the headboard, reading.

Under the warm glow of the lamp, her downcast lashes looked like a painting.

Every time he emerged from the shower, he would take the book from her hands.

Then press her into the soft mattress.

The sound of her gasping breaths from those nights still echoed in his ears.

Adrian traced the wrinkles in the sheets, a confident smile curving his lips.

"Wait for me, darling."

Gazing up at the chandelier, he thought of the little bunny charm on Evelyn's wrist.

That night, he slept more soundly than he had in months.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the city, Evelyn stared at the ceiling until dawn.

###Chapter 496

Evelyn blinked her bleary eyes open.

Two little ones slept soundly beside her, their cheeks rosy.

She slipped out of bed quietly and grabbed her phone before retreating to the bathroom.

"Cassandra Valentine" flashed on the screen.

"Hello?"

"Evelyn!" The voice on the other end was frantic. "Isabella's gone completely mad—she's plotting to kill you! I just received an anonymous recording of her threats."

Cassandra's voice trembled.

She'd discovered the late-night audio file while preparing meeting materials. Isabella's icy tone had jolted her awake.

Evelyn leaned against the bathroom doorframe. "I'm fine. You're the one who needs to be careful. Since she failed with me, you'll be her next target."

"Should I take this recording to the police?" Cassandra hissed.

Evelyn massaged her temples.

Since when did this business tycoon become so naive?

"Pointless. Last time we had video evidence and it still didn't stop her. This is just audio."

She paused. "I suspect Isabella has schizophrenia."

"What?" Cassandra gasped.

"An angel when calm, a demon when enraged." Evelyn lowered her voice. "Stay far away from her."

Silence stretched for several seconds.

"So... whoever sent this recording wants us to destroy each other?"

A faint smile touched Evelyn's lips. "Finally catching on."

Cassandra exhaled sharply.

"Fine, I'll be careful. Dinner tonight? My treat."

Hanging up, Evelyn was fully awake now.

She washed up quickly and tiptoed downstairs.

In the kitchen, Victoria was preparing breakfast in her floral apron.

"Evelyn? You're up early." She looked surprised.

Evelyn stretched her wrists. "Couldn't sleep. Going for a run."

Instead of her usual garden workout, she jogged straight past the gated community.

Her silhouette gradually disappeared along the riverbank in the morning light.
###Chapter 497

The morning mist still lingered as Evelyn Roland set out for her jog along the riverbank. Dressed in white athletic wear, her long legs moved with effortless grace in the soft dawn light. Her ponytail swayed gently with each stride.

Passing men slowed their steps, their gazes instinctively drawn to her. Evelyn paid no mind to their stares, maintaining her steady breathing rhythm.

Compared to the tedious equipment drills at the police academy, she far preferred the freedom of running outdoors. Especially those shooting classes—whenever she gripped that silver pistol, she could feel the thrill coursing through her veins.

After an hour, Evelyn stopped at a well-known breakfast spot by the river. Wiping sweat from her brow, she scanned a QR code to order hot soy milk and crab roe buns.

She settled onto the outdoor steps, taking large bites of the bun. Only in solitude could she shed the poised demeanor expected of Sterling Manor's young mistress.

"Vanessa, you gambled again?" A furious shout cut through the air.

Evelyn glanced up to see Leonard Lefèvre gripping a woman's wrist. The woman looked haggard, the wrinkles at her eyes pronounced.

"If I don't play mahjong with those society wives, who'll bring you clients?" Vanessa Kalmien yanked her arm free. "I told you not to get divorced!"

Evelyn's brow furrowed slightly. Wasn't this woman Leonard's mistress? Why was she blaming him for the divorce?

"I divorced to give you legitimacy!" Leonard's face darkened. "But you lost three hundred thousand last night—that was the company's emergency fund!"

Vanessa lowered her voice abruptly. "Mrs. Huang is signing the contract today. I lost to her on purpose. This deal will net us millions—what's three hundred thousand?"

Leonard fell silent.

"Your ex-wife knew how to make money," Vanessa said, eyes reddening. "Why couldn't we just take the money quietly? Why did you have to divorce her?"

Evelyn nearly choked on her soy milk. This lovers' quarrel was rewriting her understanding of relationships.

###Chapter 498

Leonard Lefèvre stood in the center of the living room, his arms hanging limply at his sides.

Exhaustion weighed on him like never before.

The sound of his son slamming the door still echoed in his ears.

Vanessa Kalmien sat on the couch, her crimson-painted nails digging into the leather armrest.

"Vanessa, what should I do?" Leonard's voice was hoarse.

She looked up sharply, fury burning in her eyes.

"How dare you ask? There's only three million left in the company account! We can't even pay next month's salaries!"

Leonard collapsed into the armchair.

Sophia Lefèvre's warning before their divorce flashed through his mind.

"You think Vanessa really loves you? She only loves your money!"

Back then, he'd dismissed it as his ex-wife's jealousy.

"It's not too late to beg Sophia to take you back," Vanessa suddenly softened her tone.

Leonard stared at her in shock.

"You want me to remarry her?"

She rose and knelt before him, gripping his hands.

"Leonard, we're not young anymore. What's pride worth?"

Her nails bit into his skin.

"Without money, we can't even afford the maintenance fees for this apartment."

Evelyn Roland stood outside the door, her empty soy milk cup in hand.

She hadn't expected to overhear such a bombshell conversation.

A hand reached from behind and took the empty cup from her.

"Did you enjoy it?" A deep male voice murmured by her ear.

Evelyn nearly jumped out of her skin.

Leonard's voice drifted through the door crack. "I'll go see Sophia tomorrow."

Vanessa smiled in satisfaction.

"That's more like it. Remember, you must convince her to take over the company finances again."

Cunning glinted in her eyes.

"With money, we can live anywhere. You only need to visit me once a week."

Leonard studied the stranger before him.

Suddenly he remembered Vanessa twenty years ago, standing in the rain in her faded dress waiting for him.

"Vanessa, you've changed."

She lit a cigarette with a cold laugh.

"You're just naive, Leonard."

Her face blurred behind the curling smoke.

"There's no such thing as true love in this world. Only mutual benefit."

Evelyn gasped audibly outside.

The man behind her shushed her softly.

Leonard buried his face in his hands.

"I must have been blind..."

Vanessa exhaled a smoke ring, her voice icy.

"Too late for regrets now. Either remarry her, or we'll be sleeping on the streets together."

She strode toward the bedroom, her heels clicking sharply against the marble floor.

"I want to see money in that account by tomorrow."

The door slammed shut.

Leonard lay sprawled on the couch like an empty husk.

Evelyn took two silent steps back, bumping into a solid chest.

"Seen enough?" The man's deep voice held amusement.

Sophia Lefèvre stood at the stairwell corner, having witnessed everything.

Her red lips curved upward as she turned to leave.
###Chapter 499

Vanessa Kalmien strode out of the café in her high heels, her smile vanishing instantly.

She wiped her wrist with disgust where Leonard Lefèvre had touched her.

How dare this old man dream of romance with her?

Back then, she'd only agreed to be his mistress because of his wealth.

Now that her looks were fading and she couldn't find a better sugar daddy, she had no choice but to stay.

"Useless old fool," Vanessa muttered under her breath.

The thought of enduring his peculiar bedroom demands tonight made her nauseous.

"Wake up, Leonard." She turned to sneer at him. "What's love got to do with our arrangement? Without money, we can't even raise your son!"

An all-night mahjong session had drained her. All she wanted was to go home and sleep.

"Go reconcile with your ex-wife. Once the Evans family acknowledges your son, their fortune will be ours eventually."

With that parting shot, Vanessa walked away without looking back.

Leonard stood frozen, his coffee cup trembling in his hand.

He never imagined this woman coveted the Evans family fortune.

Evelyn Roland shook her head as she finished the last crab roe bun.

This woman's shamelessness was truly eye-opening.

She reached for her soy milk only to find the cup empty.

"Enjoying the show, darling?" Adrian Valentine appeared behind her, holding the empty cup.

Evelyn glared. "You drank my soy milk?"

"Mediocre at best." Adrian smirked. "Not as good as yours."

Ignoring him, Evelyn got up to buy another cup.

She sipped as she walked, pretending not to notice Adrian following her.

Her phone rang.

"Victoria?"

"Sis, breakfast is ready. When are you coming home?" Victoria Laurent's voice came through.

"Go ahead without me. I'll be back in an hour." Evelyn checked the time.

"Seriously? Did you run out of town?" Victoria exclaimed dramatically. "My eyes have 100-megapixel vision, you know."

Evelyn nearly choked on her soy milk.

"Just keep it warm. I'm working late tonight—no need to prepare dinner."

"No way!" Victoria protested. "Gabrielle said you sneaked hotpot last night. Tonight you're having something light at home."

Evelyn paused mid-step. "How did she know?"

"You both reeked of hotpot!" Victoria laughed. "That's the lamest excuse ever, sis."

Grumbling, Evelyn hung up.

Ever since her pregnancy, even her beloved hotpot had been forbidden.
###Chapter 500

Evelyn sighed as she looked at her phone screen. "Got it. I'll definitely be home for dinner tonight. Is Grandpa coming back?"

Victoria's voice came through the receiver. "The old master arrives tonight. Nathan will pick him up from the airport. He said to have Ethan delivered by eight—he'll take care of him personally tomorrow."

Evelyn relaxed. "Good. Talk later."

She pocketed her phone and was about to resume her morning jog when she caught sight of Sophia Lefèvre pushing Christian's wheelchair in the distance.

The mother-son duo were early risers too.

Life hadn't been easy for them since Mr. Lefèvre's divorce.

Evelyn wondered how much of the earlier commotion they'd overheard.

"Evelyn." Sophia greeted her warmly from afar.

Christian smiled gently. "Long time no see."

He rarely saw Evelyn exercising. Bathed in sunlight, her posture was straight, her curves striking enough to hold his gaze.

Evelyn nodded. "Good morning, Mrs. Lefèvre."

"Evelyn, I never got the chance to thank you for saving Christian." Sophia's eyes held sincerity. "Are you free tonight? I'd like to treat you to dinner."

Now that Isabella had married Warren, she could finally breathe easy.

That venomous woman would never hurt her son again.

Evelyn thought of Gabrielle's constant chatter and shook her head. "Not tonight. How about tomorrow?"

Sophia nodded eagerly. "Of course. Evelyn, could I have your number? We've had trouble reaching you."

Evelyn's tone remained neutral. "No need for formalities. It was nothing."

Sophia glanced at her son. Her life had only regained color since his return.

"To you it was nothing. To us, it was salvation."

Evelyn didn't want the credit.

She approached Christian. "How's your leg? Can you stand yet?"

Christian's smile brightened. "I can stand. With support, I can even take a few steps."

Truthfully, his legs were fine—just weakened from prolonged bed rest.

With medication and rehab, his recovery progressed well.

Most importantly, his improved mindset had lessened the pain.

"By the way, Evelyn," he suddenly remembered, "could I have Gabrielle's number? She took care of me for three years. I'd like to thank her properly."

Evelyn's gaze sharpened. "I'll have to ask her first. She rarely goes out—it's up to her."

Christian didn't want to miss this chance. He knew Gabrielle was a good person.

"Could you ask her now? Who knows when I'll see you again?"

His pleading eyes wore her down. Reluctantly, Evelyn dialed Gabrielle.

"Sis?" Gabrielle's voice remained bright.

Evelyn cut to the chase. "Ran into Christian. He wants your number."

Gabrielle refused instantly. "We're not close. His legs are fine, right? Three years of care is enough—I don't want further contact."

Evelyn gave Christian an apologetic look.

He'd expected this. Leaning toward the phone, he quickly said, "My legs still hurt. I need your acupuncture. When are you available?"
