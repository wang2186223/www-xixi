###Chapter 1

The black Lincoln Navigator glided through the iron gates of the most exclusive estate in A City's affluent suburbs.

Inside the opulent mansion, Evelyn Sinclair sat blindfolded with silk.

He refused to let her see his face.

Breathe. Just breathe.

You have to do this, Evelyn. Dad needs that liver transplant. A few moments of discomfort are nothing compared to saving his life.

The sound of the car pulling into the driveway snapped her back to reality.

She clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms.

Dominic Blackwood entered the room, his imposing frame casting a shadow over her. Even through the blindfold, she could feel the weight of his presence.

"H-Hello..." Her voice trembled as she instinctively retreated.

Pathetic. After days of steeling herself, she still couldn’t suppress the fear coiling in her stomach.

Dominic studied her—young, fragile, trembling like a leaf in the wind.

He despised this arrangement, but he had no choice. His grandfather’s ultimatum loomed over him: Produce an heir before your next birthday, or lose everything.

His deep, velvety voice cut through the silence. "What are you afraid of?"

Evelyn flinched. That voice—smooth, commanding, nothing like the grizzled tone she'd expected from a man desperate enough to pay for an heir.

"I'm clean. No diseases, no twisted desires." His words were meant to reassure, but they only made her pulse race faster.

Before she could respond, he spoke again, cold and detached. "Let’s begin."

Then his arms were around her, lifting her effortlessly.

She gasped, her body stiffening.

"If it hurts, tell me to stop."

A warning, not comfort.

His grip tightened as she tried to pull away.

"Don’t." The single word was a command, leaving no room for defiance.

Her face burned.

Why would a man like him—wealthy, powerful—need someone like her?

Was he disfigured? A monster hiding behind that hypnotic voice?

"I have a question."

"Speak." Impatience laced his tone as his hands moved with purpose.

"The contract said IVF. Why... why change to... this?"

His breath warmed her forehead. "I want every chromosome intact. No middlemen."

Then his fingers dug into her skin.

She cried out.

Her whimper seemed to ignite something in him. His restraint slipped, his movements turning rougher, more possessive.

She was drowning—pain, fear, exhaustion pulling her under.

By the time it was over, she barely registered him leaving.

When she woke at 3 AM, Margaret Whitmore, the housekeeper, stood by the bed. "Shall I assist you to the bathroom, Miss Sinclair?"

"No. I can manage."

Her reflection in the mirror was hollow-eyed, tear-streaked.

She scrubbed her skin raw, as if she could wash away the memory of his touch.

Back in the bedroom, the sheets had been changed.

That night, she dreamed of her schoolgirl crush—the transfer student from years ago, the boy named Blackwood who’d vanished as suddenly as he’d appeared.

The next morning, her body ached.

She stared at her reflection, disgusted with herself.

Evelyn, you don’t get to fantasize about him anymore.

Locked in her room, she received the message.

He was coming back.

Margaret frowned. Two nights in a row?

The mansion buzzed with activity.

Evelyn’s stomach twisted.

Dominic strode in, dressed in tailored black slacks and a crisp white shirt.

The air thickened with tension.

He gripped the back of her neck, pulling her against him.

She froze.

His gaze burned as it traveled down to her lips.

A mistake. The contract forbade kissing.

Damn it.

"Let’s begin." His voice was rough as he tossed his coat aside and flicked off the lights.

She bit into the pillow, silent.
###Chapter 2

He left as soon as it was over.

Evelyn was drained, her body limp against the sheets. She curled into herself, trembling.

The doctors had said this position increased her chances.

Night after night, it continued.

Dominic Blackwood never missed an appointment, no matter how late his meetings ran. His presence was as inevitable as the moon rising.

Margaret Whitmore and her husband, Walter Harrison, exchanged worried glances. They knew better than to comment on their employer’s… enthusiasm.

The man was ruthless in business—cold, calculating, impossible to read.

But this?

This was something else entirely.

By the end of the month, Evelyn could barely stand.

Dominic was unpredictable. One moment, tender. The next, punishing.

Her body no longer felt like her own.

Tonight, he dressed swiftly, adjusting his cufflinks with practiced ease.

"I expect good news," he said, voice clipped.

Then he was gone.

Silence swallowed the room.

To Evelyn, he was a phantom—nameless, faceless, terrifying. A monster lurking beneath a polished exterior.

She heard the click of his lighter outside. The scent of tobacco drifted through the open window.

All she had to do was look.

But fear held her still.

A month later.

Two bold red lines stared back at her.

Relief crashed over Evelyn like a wave.

For weeks, she’d prayed for this. Now, she wouldn’t have to endure his visits anymore.

Margaret was the only face from that side of the bargain she ever saw.

No lawyers.

No contracts.

Just silence.

Until now.

"I’ll need to clear your requests with Mr. Blackwood," Margaret said, phone already in hand.

Evelyn had two conditions:

She would continue attending college until her pregnancy became obvious.
She refused to stay in that mansion. Her tiny apartment was sanctuary enough.
A minute later, Margaret nodded.

"He agreed."

Evelyn exhaled.

That afternoon, she called the hospital.

"Dr. Grant? How’s my father?"

"The surgery’s scheduled. The donor’s a perfect match."

Evelyn’s throat tightened.

She’d sold her body for this.

Should she feel guilty?

No.

Her father was alive.

That was all that mattered.

Tears spilled anyway. She wiped them away, forcing a smile.

Five months later.

Her bump was undeniable now.

Margaret handled everything—even the principal personally escorted her out after approving Evelyn’s leave.

"We’ve listed it as a medical absence," Margaret assured her. "No one will know."

Evelyn nodded, grateful.

That evening, she visited her father.

At eighteen, pregnant by a stranger—Robert Sinclair would never understand.

Thankfully, autumn layers hid her secret.

She tugged her hoodie lower as she stepped onto the hospital floor.

Then froze.

Her stepmother’s voice slithered from the room.

"—should’ve died in that accident."

Evelyn’s blood turned to ice.
###Chapter 3

"Listen to me, Robert. We only have two daughters, right? I know Evelyn isn't your biological child, but—"

Victoria didn't get to finish before Robert cut her off. He had been bedridden for months, though his health had improved recently. "Just say what you mean. I'm your husband, after all."

"I know you love me and our Sophia..." Victoria took his frail hand, her voice softening. "You mentioned sending Evelyn abroad after high school, didn't you? Sophia is only two years older, and all she does now is party at bars. She's throwing her life away, and it terrifies me. She's my only blood-related child! Robert, I want her to study overseas with Evelyn!"

Evelyn stood outside the door, her brow furrowing.

Sophia was twenty now, but she had learned to skip school back in middle school.

Smoking, drinking, staying out all night—those were just a few of the colorful labels attached to her.

Evelyn had never liked this stepsister of hers.

Robert Sinclair wasn't rich. His life savings totaled six hundred thousand, earned through relentless work for this second family of his. He had pushed himself so hard that his liver had nearly given out.

The doctors had declared him terminal, yet he refused to touch a single penny of that money for his own treatment.

Two months ago, he had made it clear—he was done fighting.

Once a patient gave up, neither doctors nor family could change their mind.

With tears in his eyes, he had forced Evelyn to listen to his will. "Evelyn, I haven’t accomplished much in life. All I have is this six hundred thousand for you. Don’t grieve too much when I’m gone. After the funeral, take the money and study abroad. Live well. Don’t be greedy like your mother or useless like me. If you promise me that, I can die in peace."

Even now, the memory made Evelyn’s eyes burn.

She knew her father would rather die than spend that money on himself. That was why she had made the secret deal—funds for his treatment, a donor, in exchange for...

She watched through the door as her father and stepmother exchanged loving words. Instead of warmth, she felt only a suffocating frustration.

In the end, she didn’t enter.

Downstairs, she ran straight into Sophia.

"Well, if it isn’t perfect little Evelyn." Sophia shoved her lightly, a slim cigarette between her fingers. She blew smoke into Evelyn’s face, then eyed her up and down with a smirk. "You’re eighteen now, and Daddy’s dying because he won’t pay for treatment. Why don’t you sell yourself a few more times? Might keep him alive a little longer."

Evelyn met her stepsister’s revolting gaze evenly. The anger inside her boiled over. She spat in Sophia’s face. "Great idea. Must feel as good as letting out a massive fart."

Sophia’s eyes flashed. Evelyn’s defiance lit a fire in her.

"You little brat! Since when do you talk back to me?"

Evelyn walked away, shoulders slumped.

Sophia trembled with rage. "Oh, playing the saint again? Can’t wait to see your true colors! Even your dad said your mom was shameless! Maybe you should get a DNA test—who knows which one-night stand’s bastard you really are!"

At seven months pregnant, Evelyn could feel the life inside her growing stronger. Every kick filled her with an indescribable joy.

She began imagining the baby’s face.

A boy? A girl?

Her stomach was enormous. Was the baby getting too much nutrition?

Since overhearing her father agree to send Sophia abroad, Evelyn had visited the hospital less.

It wasn’t that she loved him any less. But her swelling belly was harder to hide, even under thick winter clothes.

And Victoria was always there. Evelyn didn’t know if it was concern for her husband or fear that the six hundred thousand would vanish.

She could only hope it was the former.

Soon, Evelyn learned her father had returned to work—overtime, business trips, no rest.

Furious, she tried to reason with him over the phone, but it was useless.

After the new year, her due date arrived.

She was admitted to the best private maternity ward, surrounded by attentive female doctors. Tests, monitoring, nothing was overlooked.

Evelyn never asked about the baby’s father, but the staff sometimes discussed him openly. They never named him, but she knew—he wasn’t just some ordinary businessman.

She didn’t understand her own condition until she overheard the doctors’ verdict.

They wanted a C-section.

Then she was wheeled into the operating room.

The procedure was painless. The real agony came later.

For nine months, the child had been part of her. Now, suddenly, it was gone.

They were separated.

The loss of her own flesh tore through her like a blade.

Tears spilled silently down her cheeks.

This had been a fair, formal deal from the start. So why did it hurt so much?

Margaret watched Evelyn’s silent grief. As she was wheeled out, Margaret delivered her orders. "You’re only nineteen. This must stay a secret forever. Move on, child. Live well."

The words were meant to comfort, but they cut deep.

"Is it... a boy or a girl?" Evelyn whispered.

"A girl. Perfectly healthy," Margaret lied.

In truth, Evelyn had given birth to twins—a boy and a girl.

Evelyn closed her eyes, exhausted.

A girl.

Her daughter.

Evelyn stayed only ten days in the hospital.

She couldn’t bear the emptiness, the constant ache of missing her child.

Back in her rented room, she called her father.

Victoria answered. "Evelyn? Your dad’s busy. What do you want?"

Evelyn paused. Since when had reaching her father become so hard?

"When will he be free?"

"Who knows? He’s working himself to death for your future. Should I have him call you back?"

"I’ll wait." Evelyn hung up.

She knew Victoria wouldn’t pass on the message.

Now, she could count her family on one hand.

Her father, slaving away in another city for this fractured household.

Her newborn daughter—somewhere in this city, or maybe far away. From birth, that child belonged to the man behind the deal.

And her mother? As if she had never existed.

Evelyn didn’t know her face, her whereabouts, her life.

Did she ever miss her daughter?
###Chapter 4

Evelyn shook her head violently, forcing the image of that faceless woman from her mind.

A stranger. That's all she was.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand.

Olivia Kensington's name flashed across the screen.

Evelyn answered.

"Finally! You've been ghosting me for days!" Olivia's pout filled the screen. She propped her chin on her hand dramatically. "Are you seriously moving to the UK, Evie? What if some posh brat tries to mess with you? My fists can't cross oceans."

A pause. Then Olivia's eyes widened. "Oh god, British boys hit puberty at like twelve! And the dorms—co-ed! Listen, if you see some hot aristocrat with an accent and lose all self-control—"

Evelyn's gaze drifted past Olivia's shoulder to the restaurant's mounted TV.

BREAKING: 56-YEAR-OLD BILLIONAIRE WELCOMES SECRET LOVE CHILD.

No mention of the mother.

"Evie?"

"Evelyn! Earth to Evelyn!"

Olivia waved frantically at the camera. Evelyn's frozen expression sent panic through the screen. "Hey! What's wrong? You're scaring me!"

The hospital exit flashed in Evelyn's mind. She'd sworn never to think about the life she'd left behind.

But how?

That baby carried her DNA.

Her lungs constricted.

Madness clawed at her thoughts.

Pointless. All of it.

She ended the call and splashed icy water on her face.

It didn't help.

Maybe it was her own childhood—abandoned, motherless—projecting onto that innocent life.

The neighborhood whispers still haunted her. No mother. Disgraceful. Who would want her?

Bullied. Ostracized. Hating the woman who birthed then vanished.

Now the TV taunted her with that billionaire's unnamed daughter.

She'd become what she despised most.

Her fingers trembled as she searched for the tycoon's details.

Fifty-six. Balding. Surprisingly fit.

Could this man really be—?

The voice. She needed to hear his voice.

Frantically, she scrolled through video clips until her phone died.

Nothing.

Despair swallowed her whole.

Blackwood Estate.

Dinner service glittered under crystal chandeliers.

Two nursemaids wheeled bassinets to Reginald Blackwood's wheelchair.

The patriarch peered at his great-grandson's rosy cheeks. "Spitting image of Dominic. He'll command boardrooms before he's ten."

Polite smiles circled the table. No one dared contradict.

After sufficient cooing, Reginald's gaze turned steely. "Without Dominic's leadership these past two years, our empire would be dust. Any objections?"

Silence.

"Time passes," Reginald continued. "Julian." He addressed the brooding young man slouching in his chair. "Shadow your brother. Learn."

"Whatever." Julian shrugged.

Margaret Lockwood slammed her palms on the table. "How is this fair? Dominic gets everything while my son—"

Reginald ignored her. "Video call. Now."

A servant obeyed.

Dominic Blackwood's sharp features appeared on screen. "Grandfather?"

"We're naming the boy. I propose Alexander. Pure. Strong."

Margaret fumed silently.

Dominic's jaw tightened. "If purity's the theme, what about nche? Same meaning."

"nche Blackwood." Reginald tested the name. "Perfect."

Departure day arrived too soon.

Nathan Kensington stood tall beside Evelyn at Heathrow. Robert Sinclair gripped Nathan's shoulder. "Keep them safe."

Nathan nodded. He'd chosen England solely because Evelyn was going.

Olivia hugged her brother. "Watch out for Evelyn. And avoid Sophia Montgomery—she's toxic."

Nathan sighed.

Evelyn turned for one last glimpse of her father. Hot tears blurred her vision as she waved goodbye.
###Chapter 5

When Evelyn Sinclair stepped back into the bustling streets of A City, five years had slipped through her fingers like sand.

Nearly two thousand days and nights had passed since she left. Not an eternity, but certainly not insignificant.

Back then, fate had tossed her around like a ragdoll, leaving her utterly defenseless.

Now, she was determined to seize control of her own destiny.

The morning sun painted the sky in soft gold as she walked out of her suburban apartment.

"Eve! Over here!" Olivia Kensington rolled down her car window, waving excitedly.

Time had changed them both. No longer the naive eighteen-year-olds they once were.

Evelyn and Nathan Kensington had flown back together yesterday, with Olivia picking them up from the airport.

Last night, Nathan had taken Evelyn to the Kensington estate for dinner.

Mr. and Mrs. Kensington adored her, already treating her like their future daughter-in-law.

This morning, Nathan had planned to accompany Evelyn to her interview at T Corporation, but an urgent matter pulled him away.

Evelyn slid into Olivia's passenger seat, buckling up.

"Guess what my mom said after you left with my brother last night?" Olivia grinned.

"What?" Evelyn bit her lip, worried about their approval.

"She said, 'Look at Evelyn! So elegant, so graceful. Now look at you—swearing like a sailor and lounging around like a tomboy!'" Olivia reached over to pinch Evelyn's cheek. "Whatever skincare routine you’ve got, spill it."

"Hardly. You’ve never lived abroad—it’s not all sunshine and roses." Evelyn swatted her hand away. "Eyes on the road."

They chatted easily during the drive.

By the time they reached T Corporation, it was already past eight forty.

"I hope Nathan makes it in time. The CEO here is ruthless," Olivia muttered, texting her brother frantically.

Ruthless? The word sent a shiver down Evelyn’s spine.

She pulled out her phone, searching for any scrap of information about Dominic Blackwood, the CEO of T Corporation.

Most of what she found were tabloid rumors—fluff pieces about the wealthy elite.

Dominic Blackwood, president of T Corporation under Blackwood Industries, was twenty-nine. His marital status? A mystery. The press had never uncovered a single detail about his personal life.

The name "Blackwood" still carried a faint echo in Evelyn’s memory.

But those were just childish fantasies, long buried in the deepest corners of her heart.

The articles mentioned a dramatic power struggle five years ago—between the two Blackwood heirs.

Julian Blackwood, the publicly acknowledged successor, had been abruptly dethroned overnight.

Meanwhile, Reginald Blackwood had shockingly named an unknown heir—Dominic—to take over the crumbling empire.

An unknown heir.

The article’s implications were clear: Dominic was, bluntly, the illegitimate son.

Evelyn stared at her screen, lost in thought.

The towering skyscraper of T Corporation loomed over her, its glass facade gleaming like a challenge.

Nathan arrived in a rush. He’d researched the company thoroughly, but seeing the building in person made his stomach twist.

He couldn’t afford to mess this up—not in front of Evelyn.

Inside the interview room, five executives sat in judgment. Among them, the most intimidating figure of all—Dominic Blackwood himself.

As another candidate finished, one of the interviewers glanced at Dominic, trying to gauge his reaction.

But the CEO’s attention was fixed on the surveillance screen. What had caught his eye?

"Next," someone called.

The screen showed the waiting area, where hopeful candidates fidgeted under the watchful eye of the cameras.

Dominic’s gaze locked onto one woman in particular.

Not a girl anymore—Evelyn was twenty-three now. The last traces of youthful innocence had melted away, replaced by a quiet confidence. Every curve, every subtle smile radiated a magnetic femininity.

His mind flashed back to five years ago—to the nights she had trembled beneath him, her soft cries echoing in the dark.

"Nathan’s almost here," Olivia nudged Evelyn in the hallway.

Evelyn snapped out of her thoughts, tucking her phone away.

Had time blurred her memory? Staring at Dominic’s photo, she couldn’t shake the feeling she’d seen him before. He bore an uncanny resemblance to that wealthy basketball player from her high school.

Same last name, too.

Just then, Nathan jogged up the stairs, ruffling Evelyn’s hair affectionately. "Sorry I’m late."

"It’s fine. They haven’t called us yet," she reassured him.

Olivia groaned. "Ugh, save the lovey-dovey stuff for later. Some of us are still single."

"Then prepare to suffer," Nathan shot back. "Because I’m marrying this woman one day."

"Do it!" Olivia’s eyes sparkled. "Mom and Dad already adore her. Once you two settle into your jobs, just elope already."

Nathan grinned, stealing a glance at Evelyn.

She shifted slightly, uneasy.

Life was good now. Nathan had been her rock these past five years, helping her heal from the scars of her past.

Before he confessed, she’d sensed his feelings—but trauma had made her recoil from any man’s touch.

Yet Nathan never gave up. He pried open her darkest secrets—and instead of running, he stayed.

She was lucky.

"Nathan Kensington—you’re up!"

Nathan squeezed Evelyn’s hand. "Wish me luck."

She nodded.

As he stepped inside, an icy gaze sliced through him.

Dominic had seen everything—the way Nathan touched her, the way she looked at him.

The interview was brisk, professional.

Nathan answered each question with calm precision, impressing the panel.

Dominic’s attention, however, remained on the screen.

There, Evelyn stared at the door, biting her lip, fingers twisting nervously.

Worried for someone else.

For him.
###Chapter 6

Ten minutes later, Nathan finished his interview.

He pushed the door open and stepped out.

Evelyn immediately stood up. "How did it go?"

"The panel asked some challenging questions, but nothing we couldn't handle." Nathan couldn't resist pressing a kiss to Evelyn's forehead, his voice steady. "Overall, it went well."

Evelyn exhaled in relief.

"Next, Evelyn Sinclair," the secretary called.

Evelyn hastily smoothed her blouse and entered the room, nerves tightening her chest.

The moment she stepped inside, Dominic's sharp gaze locked onto her.

She took her seat, spine straight, and met each interviewer's eyes in turn.

Then, she began her introduction. "Good morning. First, thank you for this opportunity. My name is Evelyn Sinclair."

Since deciding to return home and pursue a career here, she'd rehearsed countless interview openings.

This one wasn't groundbreaking, but it was polished. Flawless.

The interview progressed.

Dominic studied her with an icy intensity.

His stare was so penetrating that despite answering every question with practiced ease, Evelyn's skin prickled with discomfort.

It wasn't just daggers—it felt like invisible thorns pressing into her flesh.

She had glanced at Dominic when she first entered, of course.

But this was a professional setting. She couldn't afford distractions, no matter how many questions burned in her mind.

"Miss Sinclair," Dominic's cool voice cut through the panel's questions, startling everyone. "Are you married?"

The interviewers froze, turning to their CEO in unison.

He was part of the panel, yes—but this?

"No," Evelyn answered, forcing calm into her voice despite her racing pulse.

His frown deepened. "Do you have plans to marry?"

She hesitated, then nodded. "I do."

The interviewers exchanged baffled looks. Why was their boss asking this?

The brief exchange gave Evelyn a clearer view of Dominic's striking features. Up close, the resemblance to that arrogant boy from the neighboring high school was undeniable.

But the ruthless businessman before her bore little resemblance to the reckless youth she remembered.

Everything about him—his presence, his expression—radiated cold authority.

—

Finally, the interview ended.

Evelyn walked out, legs unsteady.

"How was it? Tell me!" Olivia rushed to her side.

Evelyn blinked. "They asked if I was married. And if not, whether I intended to be."

Nathan frowned. What kind of invasive question was that?

But Olivia waved it off. "Oh, that's standard here. They could've asked if you have kids—that's worse."

"Why would they care?" Evelyn asked as they headed downstairs.

"Because children interfere with your career," Olivia explained, glancing between her brother and Evelyn. "Most companies here discriminate against mothers. You're new—you'll get used to it."

—

That afternoon.

Evelyn and Nathan both received calls: they were hired on a two-month probation. If they passed, they'd become permanent employees at T Corporation.

The next day.

Nathan and Olivia picked Evelyn up for work.

"I'm buying a car soon," Nathan told Evelyn as they entered the design department. "No more relying on my little sister's rides."

Olivia smirked, wedging herself between them. "What, am I the third wheel now?"

Evelyn laughed. "Neither of you needs to pick me up starting tomorrow. The subway's convenient, and your detour is too long."

—

First day on the job.

Evelyn worked with intense focus.

That afternoon, Nathan was abruptly pulled into an out-of-town assignment by a senior designer.

Before leaving, he grabbed his work laptop and gave Evelyn a hurried heads-up.

Honestly, he was confused too. Why send a rookie on a business trip? Wouldn't he just slow them down?

Evelyn didn't have time to dwell on it. She immersed herself in learning the company's systems.

Near quitting time, Olivia appeared at her desk. "Done? Mom wants you over for dinner."

Evelyn looked up from a stack of blueprints. "I just got assigned overtime."

Olivia's eyes widened. She rushed back to her desk to check her email.

Damn. Overtime was real.

Designers often worked late, but this was brutal luck—Nathan sent away, Evelyn stuck at the office.

The team ate takeout, then kept working.

By 10:30 PM, the supervisor dismissed Olivia and two others.

Evelyn had to stay.

Her body clock was wrecked. Exhaustion weighed on her.

She stood, grabbing her mug for coffee.

When she returned, her supervisor thrust a blueprint at her. "The CEO needs this. Now."

Evelyn set her coffee down and took the file, leaving the department.

Only three people remained: the supervisor, a senior designer, and her—a glorified intern.

Deliver a blueprint to the CEO?

As the elevator ascended, Dominic's face flashed in her mind.

The doors opened on the top floor.

Evelyn navigated the hallways, finally reaching the CEO's office.

She knocked.

"Enter." His voice was cold, yet rich.

She stepped inside, approaching the massive desk in the monochrome office. Placing the blueprint down, she said, "The file you requested, sir."

Dominic was absorbed in his work. He reached for the blueprint without looking up.

As Evelyn turned to leave, his voice stopped her.

She turned back. Was there more?

Dominic's gaze swept over her. Five years had only heightened her allure—fair skin, curves, an aura of quiet elegance.

"Go home and prepare," he said, tone brooking no argument. "You're accompanying me on a business trip tomorrow."

Evelyn wanted to protest—she wasn't experienced enough for this. But his expression silenced her.

She nodded and left.

Dominic watched her go, lingering on the graceful curve of her waist.

Long after she'd gone, he realized his throat had gone dry. His chest burned.
###Chapter 7

Evelyn left.

Dominic abruptly dropped the blueprint he'd been studying. He pushed away from his workstation and strode toward the wine cabinet instead. Selecting a crystal glass, he filled it halfway and downed the contents in one swift motion, his brow furrowed.

This damn desire.

It was late when Evelyn finally left the company, but luckily, the last subway was still running.

The moment she got home, she replied to Nathan’s messages.

Then she pulled out her suitcase and started packing for her business trip the next day.

Her phone rang.

Nathan’s name flashed on the screen.

"Aren’t you asleep yet? I told you to rest early," Evelyn said, concern lacing her voice.

"Still working. Brought files back to the hotel," Nathan replied. Then, "I saw your text. Why are you traveling? Who’s going with you?"

"Not sure yet. I’ll find out tomorrow," she answered.

"If there are men in the group, keep your distance," Nathan warned. "We barely know these people."

"Got it."

A loud banging noise cut through the call—sharp, insistent, like someone trying to break down a door.

Evelyn tensed. "What’s happening?"

"N-Nothing." Nathan’s voice wavered. "I’ll check outside and call you back."

The line went dead before she could tell him to be careful.

She stared at her half-packed suitcase, then at her darkened phone screen. Worry gnawed at her. Nathan was in an unfamiliar city, surrounded by strangers.

Nothing happened that night.

The next morning, her phone buzzed—a colleague calling to confirm their departure.

Evelyn waited outside her apartment complex, exhaustion weighing on her. She’d stayed up half the night waiting for Nathan’s call.

It never came.

She tried calling him. His phone was off.

Fifteen minutes later, a sleek Bentley pulled up. Two colleagues stepped out—a man and a woman. Introductions were quick, and soon they were back in the car.

The drive to H City took seven hours. The company had arranged for the Bentley to be driven there for convenience.

Evelyn chatted with her colleagues, laughter filling the car.

By afternoon, they arrived.

At the hotel, her female colleague, Abigail, suggested, "Let’s freshen up and rest. We’ll meet for dinner."

Evelyn nodded.

She hauled her luggage upstairs, showered, and changed into loungewear. Then she ironed her work clothes, hanging them neatly.

Glancing at the clock—4 PM.

Still no word from Nathan.

She called him.

This time, his phone was on. But it rang endlessly.

She tried again. This time, he rejected the call.

A text popped up: "Busy. Can’t talk. Will call later."

Evelyn sighed in relief. At least he was safe. Maybe last night’s disturbance had just been a drunk guest.

She replied, "Okay, focus on your work."

She set her phone down—then it buzzed again.

A WeChat message from Nathan. But the words were jumbled nonsense: "Hahaha fiber mesh entrance fee iFeng—"

Evelyn frowned.

"?" she sent back.

A minute later, he replied: "Arm bumped the screen while drawing."

She dismissed it.

Then—ding dong—the doorbell rang.

Evelyn tensed. "Who is it?"

A man’s voice answered. "Miss Sinclair, I’m Sebastian Whitmore, Mr. Blackwood’s assistant. May I trouble you to open the door?"

Sebastian Whitmore—Dominic’s right-hand man. Everyone at the company knew him.

Evelyn opened the door.

"Nice to meet—" Her greeting froze as she spotted two small children beside him.

A boy and a girl, their eyes bright, smiles dazzling. Like perfect little dolls.

Sebastian stood stiffly in his suit. "These are Mr. Blackwood’s children. He’s occupied, so—"

Evelyn’s stomach dropped.

She wasn’t against babysitting, but this felt… off. She was here to work, not play nanny.

And seeing other people’s kids always reminded her of her own.

"I’ll be good," the little girl piped up, blinking up at Evelyn with big, dark eyes.

She nudged her brother. "Big Brother—"

The boy, slightly taller, kept his cool expression but softened for his sister. "I’ll behave too."

Sebastian checked his watch. "I’ll leave them with you, Miss Sinclair. Urgent matters to attend to."

Before Evelyn could protest, he was gone.

She looked down at the kids. "Come in."

The girl grabbed her brother’s hand, and they marched inside.

"Want something to drink?" Evelyn asked awkwardly.

"Milk," the girl chirped, perching on the couch.

Evelyn dug out the hotel’s overpriced milk—89 yuan for what cost 3.50 at a store. She poured two glasses.

The boy didn’t touch his.

The girl gulped hers down, even licking her lips after.

Evelyn sat stiffly, searching for conversation. "Are you twins?"

The boy rolled his eyes. "Obviously."

His look said it all: Idiot. Look at us.
###Chapter 8 

Evelyn didn't dare speak another word after the little boy turned his nose up at her.

The silence stretched uncomfortably.

"It's awkward, isn't it?" the boy finally said.

His sister nodded in agreement.

Evelyn remained silent.

"Miss, you can call my father right now and tell him you don't want to babysit us," the boy suggested coldly.

He was surprisingly hostile for his age.

"I never said I didn't want to take care of you," Evelyn clarified quickly.

She wouldn't dare refuse her boss's children. Dominic Blackwood would have her head for lunch.

"If you really want to take care of us, then act like it," the boy snapped, clearly disliking the tense atmosphere.

This babysitter was much worse than the others.

Evelyn sighed internally.

She should've checked her horoscope before leaving home today.

"Come on, Alex," the little girl said, noticing the woman's discomfort. She tugged her brother's sleeve angrily.

Evelyn exhaled in relief as the two children disappeared into the bathroom.

Inside the bathroom:

"Big brother, why are you so mean to the pretty lady?" the sister whispered.

"She has an agenda," Alexander replied solemnly. "All these beautiful women only pretend to like us because they want to marry Dad."

"They want to marry Dad?" Isabella blinked in confusion.

"At least the others fake it better," Alexander muttered. "This one can't even do that!"

If this woman married their father, she'd never treat them well.

"Great-grandpa says we shouldn't judge people so quickly!" Isabella insisted.

"I don't care!" Alexander's face turned red with anger. "I'll only ever have one mother - the woman who gave birth to me!"

Isabella pouted. "Great-grandpa said we were planted in the garden like flowers!"

"Idiot!" Alexander stormed out of the bathroom, slamming the door behind him.

Evelyn jumped at the noise.

Such temper for such small children!

"I'm sorry," Evelyn said quickly. "I'm not very good with kids. That's why everything feels so awkward."

"It's all Alex's fault!" Isabella declared loudly.

Evelyn turned to the fuming boy. "Would you like to watch some cartoons?" She picked up the remote. "How about Peppa Pig or Paw Patrol?"

"That's for babies!" Alexander scoffed.

Evelyn's smile faltered.

Another uncomfortable silence settled over them.

"Miss, why don't you ask how old we are?" Isabella suggested helpfully.

Evelyn seized the opportunity. "How old are you?"

"I'm five, and so is Alex."

"Do you go to school?" If they did... today was Thursday.

"We have private tutors," Isabella explained. "But Daddy said he wanted to take us out today. He promised us a ride on the big Ferris wheel."

"I see," Evelyn nodded.

"Give me your phone. I want to call my father," Alexander demanded.

Evelyn blinked but handed it over immediately.

Alexander searched through her contacts but found nothing. No phone number. No WhatsApp. Nothing.

"You don't have any way to contact my dad?" he asked suspiciously.

Evelyn shook her head. "No."

"You're lying," Alexander accused.

"I told you she's not one of those stepmom-wannabes!" Isabella rolled her eyes dramatically.

Alexander looked guilty and avoided Evelyn's gaze.

Suddenly, everything clicked for Evelyn.

"So that's why you've been so cold," she said gently. "Let me explain something to you both."

She looked from Alexander to Isabella. "Your father left you with Sebastian, who was busy with work, so he asked me to watch you temporarily. There's absolutely nothing between your father and me. We're just employer and employee."

Alexander studied her carefully.

Evelyn continued honestly, "Your father and I live in completely different worlds. Some people are born into privilege, others aren't. We have different needs, different circles. Those worlds don't mix. Do you understand?"

"No..." Isabella shook her head.

Evelyn turned to Alexander.

"I get it," he said. "Dad's elite class, you're working class."

Evelyn burst out laughing. "Ouch, but yes. The gap between your father and me is enormous. You don't need to worry - even if your father were the last man on earth, I would never become your stepmother. Understand now?"

Isabella nodded slowly, though still somewhat confused.

"Good. Now let's start over." Evelyn smiled. "I'm Evelyn Sinclair. You can call me Miss Sinclair or just Eve."

"I'm Isabella Blackwood, like a beautiful rainy day!" the girl announced proudly.

"I'm Alexander Blackwood. Call me Alex or Xander." The boy's hostility had noticeably decreased.

Isabella?

Like a rainy day?

Alexander Blackwood?

Alex?

Xander? Isabella?

Evelyn suddenly felt an odd connection to these children.

With the misunderstanding cleared, the kids quickly warmed up to her.

She canceled her dinner plans with coworkers.

While her colleagues returned to work after their meal, Evelyn's new mission was clear - take care of the boss's children.

At first, she was overly cautious, terrified any scraped knee might cost her job. But soon, she found herself rolling on the carpet with them, her heart aching with bittersweet joy.

Her own child would be about their age now.

When she looked at their happy faces, she could almost see her own baby.

How was that child? Was she happy?

That evening, they dined at the hotel restaurant.

Isabella sat properly for exactly three minutes before drooling over another table's fried chicken.

"Wipe your mouth, it's disgusting!" Alexander scolded.

Evelyn quickly dabbed Isabella's chin with a napkin.

"Does your father not allow fried chicken?" she asked sympathetically. If her daughter craved something this badly, she'd make an exception.

Isabella nodded, eyes still glued to the golden crispy chicken. She was so distracted she dropped her fork.

Evelyn signaled a waiter.

Ten minutes later:

Two pieces of fried chicken arrived.

Alexander didn't take any, pushing both toward his sister. Though clearly tempted, he declared, "You can have them all. Dad says real men stick to their principles."

Evelyn remained silent but was deeply impressed. This five-year-old's self-control was remarkable.

Successful adults often made their journeys look effortless. But no one saw their sacrifices, their restraint.

Was Dominic Blackwood like that?

This serious, guarded little boy was clearly his father's miniature version.
###Chapter 9

Little Isabella was practically floating with joy after sneaking fried chicken behind her father's back. The entire walk back to the room, she clung to Evelyn like a baby monkey, her tiny arms wrapped tightly around Evelyn's leg.

Evelyn had to hobble awkwardly up the stairs with the child attached to her limb.

"Time for bed now." After watching cartoons with the siblings for a while, Evelyn turned to them. "I'll take you back to your room."

Alexander looked up with serious eyes. "We don't have the key card."

Isabella was already half-asleep, her chubby fingers still gripping Evelyn's sleeve. Her eyelids fluttered shut.

Evelyn bit her lip. How were they supposed to get back in without the key?

She had no idea when Dominic would finish his business dinner and return.

"Let me call Mr. Whitmore." Evelyn couldn't move with Isabella clinging to her, so she asked Alexander to fetch her phone.

The boy retrieved it obediently.

After getting Sebastian Whitmore's number from a colleague, Evelyn made the call.

"Miss Sinclair," Sebastian answered, sounding apologetic. "Mr. Blackwood is still dining with provincial officials. It might be quite late. Could the children stay with you tonight?"

Evelyn sighed.

By ten-thirty, she'd finally gotten both children to sleep. Alexander took the left side of the king-sized bed while Isabella curled up on the right.

Evelyn tiptoed around, cleaning the bathroom and folding their clothes neatly on the sofa. She tucked Isabella in before carefully slipping into bed herself.

Thankfully the bed was enormous.

Within minutes, exhaustion pulled Evelyn into sleep.

Sometime in the dead of night, her phone vibrated beneath the pillow.

Bleary-eyed, she fumbled for it.

An unknown number flashed on the screen: 139-0909-9999.

"Who is this?" she mumbled sleepily.

"Open the door." The deep, whiskey-rough voice sent shivers down her spine.

Evelyn blinked. "What?"

Silence. Just heavy breathing.

Then her sleep-fogged brain registered the two small forms sleeping beside her. Alexander. Isabella.

"Mr... Mr. Blackwood?" Her voice squeaked.

"Open. The. Door." Each word dripped with barely restrained impatience.

Evelyn's heart stuttered. She scrambled up, smoothing her pajamas before rushing to the door.

Her boss had come for his children, and she'd kept him waiting. Damn it!

The children slept soundly, undisturbed.

Evelyn opened the door.

Dominic leaned against the doorframe, eyes closed, coat draped over one arm. His other hand held the black phone he'd just called from. He'd clearly been waiting awhile.

"Mr. Blackwood?" Evelyn barely dared to breathe.

He lifted his head slowly. Even drunk and exhausted, the man radiated power. His aristocratic bone structure and commanding presence couldn't be dimmed by alcohol.

Their eyes locked for an eternity.

Evelyn stepped aside wordlessly, allowing him entry.

As he passed, the scent of expensive whiskey and tobacco enveloped her.

She stood frozen by the door, not daring to look.

The hallway lights were painfully bright.

Minutes ticked by with no sound of waking children.

Confused, Evelyn crept back inside.

The bedroom was bathed in soft lamplight.

The sight stole her breath.

The massive bed now held all three Blackwoods - the weary father finally home, curled protectively around his sleeping children.

Should she wake him?

Would her drunken boss fire her on the spot?

If she didn't, where would she sleep?

Deciding against provoking a drunk Dominic, Evelyn grabbed her coat and slipped out.

She tried calling her female colleague first.

"The number you have dialed is unavailable..."

Next, Sebastian. No answer. Probably passed out drunk.

The front desk informed her the hotel was fully booked.

Defeated, Evelyn trudged back upstairs.

Was she doomed to stand in the hallway all night?

At 1:15 AM, the elevator dinged.

A scarred man emerged with two heavily made-up women. Spotting Evelyn, he released his companions.

"Well hello, beautiful. Need some company?" He leered.

"Stay away!" Evelyn fumbled with her key card, darting inside like a frightened rabbit.

She pressed against the door, heart hammering.

Knocking started - not too loud, not too soft. Terrified, she retreated toward the bathroom.

Then strong hands slid under her coat from behind.

She whirled around.

The bathroom door had opened silently. She stumbled backward into a hard chest.

A scream died in her throat as warm lips captured hers.

In the pitch-black bathroom, only one grown man could be holding her like this.

Dominic Blackwood.

Evelyn pushed against him uselessly.

Trapped between the predator outside and the dominant male inside, she could only whimper as his kiss deepened.
###Chapter 10

Evelyn's mind went completely blank for several seconds.

She bit her lip in frustration at her own momentary weakness.

'Evelyn, remember Nathan!'

'Nathan is the only man who makes your heart race!'

"Yet here you are with me now. How easily distracted you've become." Dominic's strong hands pushed aside her white coat.

His lips met hers with unexpected warmth.

The scent of his shower gel lingered on his skin - the same brand she used. He must have showered in her bathroom earlier.

Evelyn realized with growing panic that passive resistance wouldn't work here.

She needed to act decisively before this situation escalated beyond control.

As her eyes adjusted to the dim lighting, Dominic's striking features became visible.

The soft glow accentuated his chiseled jawline and those dangerously tempting lips.

Any observer might mistake him for some seductive movie star rather than her employer.

Every movement radiated raw masculine energy.

Gathering courage, Evelyn suddenly drove her knee upward with all her strength.

"Ugh—"

A pained grunt escaped Dominic as he instinctively hunched over.

"Let me go!" She twisted violently in his grasp.

His fingers tightened painfully around her wrist, making escape impossible.

Just as despair began creeping in, Dominic abruptly released her.

Evelyn didn't hesitate - she bolted for the door, slamming it shut behind her with enough force to rouse the sleeping twins.

The hotel corridors felt endless at this late hour.

Evelyn paced nervously, avoiding both her compromised room and any dead-end spaces like restrooms.

Eventually she retreated to the brightly lit lobby.

Two receptionists and four security guards provided comforting visibility.

Safety in numbers.

"Some tea, miss?" A kind attendant offered.

"Thank you." The warm liquid soothed Evelyn's rattled nerves as she prepared for a long vigil.

Morning brought congestion and chills.

Wrapped in a borrowed blanket, Evelyn assessed her situation between sneezes.

'If he offers a sincere apology, maybe I'll stay. If not...I'm resigning immediately.'

Corporate harassment stories were depressingly common worldwide.

But Evelyn refused to be another statistic.

Her colleagues Abigail and Gregory descended for breakfast at eight.

"You're up early," Abigail remarked upon spotting Evelyn in the lobby.

Evelyn felt immediate relief at seeing familiar faces.

Then the elevator doors opened.

Dominic emerged with Alexander and Isabella in tow.

Their eyes locked - his sharp gaze taking in Evelyn's disheveled state.

"Go with Uncle Sebastian," Dominic instructed the children.

When little Isabella made a cute face at Evelyn, her heart inexplicably softened.

After Sebastian led everyone away for breakfast, Dominic approached Evelyn directly.

"Why was I in your room last night?"

Evelyn blinked in shock.

Was this amnesia? Or calculated deception?

Their eye contact felt painfully unequal.

Now impeccably dressed in a crisp white shirt, Dominic looked every inch the respectable executive.

A stark contrast to last night's predator.

"You were intoxicated, Mr. Blackwood."

"Fragments remain. Was that you?" His cool tone carried unspoken accusation.

Evelyn's pulse quickened. Did he think she'd engineered some seduction plot?

"Absolutely not! A room service attendant came by briefly - maybe five minutes?" She mentally kicked herself for underestimating the timeframe.

Dominic's intense scrutiny traveled across her features.

"Nothing was stolen. Though certain...areas were improperly handled."

Heat flooded Evelyn's cheeks.

"Are you injured? Should you see a doctor?"

His smirk was razor-sharp. "I'm more concerned about her knee."

Evelyn froze.

"Service staff must be accustomed to workplace hazards," Dominic remarked casually before lighting a cigarette and walking away.

Only then did Evelyn notice the dull ache in her own knee.

What drove this powerful man to such extremes? Isabella and Alexander's mother must have been gone a long time...
###Chapter 11 

Evelyn returned to her hotel room.

The housekeeper was finishing up the cleaning.

With a polite nod, Evelyn headed straight for the closet. She pulled out one of the outfits she had pressed the night before and disappeared into the bathroom to change.

The housekeeper worked efficiently.

By the time Evelyn finished freshening up, every trace of Dominic Blackwood had been wiped from the room.

She exhaled in relief.

Ten minutes earlier, Nathan had texted her. "Evelyn, my team wrapped up the project. I'm heading to H City this afternoon to see you at your hotel. We have tomorrow off."

She had replied simply: "Sounds good. I'll send you the address."

For some reason, guilt prickled at her as she surveyed the space where Dominic had spent the night.

The housekeeper noticed Evelyn staring absently at the bathroom door, her brow furrowed.

"All done," the woman announced cheerfully, holding a trash bag by the exit.

Evelyn snapped back to attention. "Thank you."

The housekeeper added, "I put the used underwear in the small drawer inside the closet."

"Underwear?" Evelyn blinked.

She definitely hadn’t left any lingerie lying around.

"The men's underwear. Your husband's, right? Found it in the laundry basket in the bathroom."

With that, the housekeeper left.

Evelyn froze.

Men’s underwear? Her husband?

Heat flooded her cheeks. She pressed her lips together, her mind racing. What was she supposed to do with it?

Return it? Absolutely not.

Tossing it seemed like the best option.

It wasn’t as if her boss would miss a single pair.

Evelyn shook her head. What am I even thinking?

Thankfully, her phone rang.

Abigail Thornton’s name flashed on the screen.

"Hey, Abigail," Evelyn answered.

"Have you eaten yet? Don’t skip meals. Meet me downstairs at ten after breakfast—there’s a meeting you should attend."

"Got it. See you at ten."

Evelyn had been worried she’d be stuck babysitting again today.

Not that she minded Alexander and Isabella—but work was work.

Since T Corporation was paying her, she wanted to contribute. More importantly, she wanted to learn.

Her father would’ve wanted that for her.

At the thought of her father, her expression dimmed.

Victoria Montgomery was stunning for a woman nearing fifty. She must have been breathtaking in her youth.

Her father adored his second wife.

Now, he poured everything into Victoria’s happiness.

Evelyn felt adrift. Her childhood memories told her he had loved her mother just as deeply. After her mother left, he had drowned in alcohol for eight long years.

Losing her had shattered him.

At ten sharp, Evelyn headed downstairs.

"Get in," Abigail instructed.

Their profession demanded simplicity and professionalism in attire.

Evelyn matched Abigail’s style—a crisp blouse with two buttons undone, paired with an A-line skirt. Smart, yet undeniably feminine.

This time, they took two cars.

Abigail and Evelyn rode in the lead vehicle, while Dominic and Gregory followed in the luxury sedan.

"Why isn’t Sebastian with us?" Evelyn seized the chance to ask. "What exactly are we supposed to do at the meeting?"

"Sebastian’s taking the boss’s kids to the amusement park," Abigail answered easily. "Your job today? Listen and learn."

Evelyn nodded.

They arrived at the hotel.

The prestigious establishment offered impeccable service. The meeting was held on the 99th floor.

This was Evelyn’s first high-stakes business negotiation. There was something undeniably magnetic about watching powerful men engage—firm handshakes, sharp exchanges.

Dominic Blackwood transformed during negotiations.

He handled every challenge effortlessly. No matter how formidable his opponent, he commanded respect.

Evelyn absorbed every word, refusing to let her focus waver.

Eventually, Director Worthington—seated to Dominic’s right—leaned in with a smile. "My daughter insisted on tagging along. She made me promise to convince you to show her around A City. Threatened to disown me if I failed!" He chuckled. "I’ve spoiled her rotten, haven’t I?"

Evelyn kept her expression neutral, as did everyone else at the table.

This had clearly veered into personal territory.

They left the hotel at half past one.

Evelyn carried her laptop as she slid into the car. Abigail followed.

Outside, Director Worthington and his daughter bid Dominic farewell with enthusiastic handshakes.

"See that?" Abigail smirked. "Director Worthington’s angling for a Blackwood marriage."

Evelyn hesitated. "Hard to say if that would be an upgrade or a downgrade for her."

Abigail laughed. "Right now, it’s just wishful thinking on their part. Unless Dominic Blackwood himself wants it, any woman aiming for him is reaching above her station. Doesn’t matter if she’s royalty."

Fair point.

Evelyn glanced at the director’s daughter dispassionately. If the boss marries her, she’ll be Alexander and Isabella’s new mother.
###Chapter 12

The two luxury vehicles departed from the prestigious hotel, returning to their temporary lodgings.

Evelyn stepped out first when they arrived.

Abigail followed closely behind.

At the entrance stood Sebastian Whitmore, impeccably dressed in a tailored suit and polished leather shoes.

"Good afternoon, Mr. Whitmore." Evelyn greeted him politely, mirroring Abigail's professionalism.

Sebastian acknowledged Evelyn with a nod, though his gaze lingered on her with unexpected intensity.

Even after Evelyn entered the lobby, Sebastian remained frowning slightly as he watched her retreating figure.

Dominic emerged from the car and immediately noticed the peculiar expression on his assistant's face.

His dark eyes locked onto Sebastian with characteristic intensity. Catching himself, Sebastian quickly assumed his usual professional demeanor.

Dominic strode past him, his voice icy. "You were staring at her."

The accusation hung in the air.

Sebastian hesitated, weighing his words carefully before responding, "No, I wasn't."

The weak denial only darkened Dominic's expression further.

Nathan Kensington arrived just then, stepping out of a taxi with his laptop bag. Spotting his superiors by the elevator, he blinked in surprise before offering a respectful greeting. "Mr. Whitmore, Mr. Blackwood."

Dominic's piercing gaze assessed the newcomer.

"I'm Nathan Kensington from the design department." Nathan introduced himself hastily before adding, "I won't disturb you further, sir. I'll head upstairs now."

Dominic's expression remained unreadable, but an invisible chill seemed to radiate from him, creating an impenetrable barrier.

Back in his suite, Dominic methodically undid his cufflinks while observing his sleeping children. Exhausted from play, they lay tangled in the luxurious bedding.

He moved to the suite's bar, uncorking an expensive Bordeaux and pouring himself a generous portion. The wine burned its way down his throat as he drained the glass in one swallow.

The twins stirred awake not long after.

Alexander woke first, quietly completing his bedtime routine before helping his sister select her favorite princess nightgown.

"What's wrong with Daddy?" Isabella whispered.

Her brother shook his head. He didn't understand adult moods, but knew better than to pry.

Meanwhile downstairs...

Nathan set down his laptop bag and unexpectedly pulled Evelyn into an embrace.

Evelyn stiffened. "What's this about?"

Their one-year relationship had been notably lacking in physical affection due to Evelyn's discomfort with touch - a boundary Nathan had always respected.

Tonight, however, he seemed different.

"Nothing. Just missed you," Nathan murmured tiredly.

Evelyn remained silent.

They dined together that evening before Nathan suggested shopping for essentials he'd forgotten in his rushed departure.

By 9:30 PM, laden with purchases, they returned to the hotel.

"I'd like a room, please." Nathan presented his ID to the receptionist.

Evelyn waited nearby, recalling how the same clerk had claimed no vacancies the previous night.

As expected, the receptionist looked up apologetically. "I'm sorry, sir. We're fully booked."

Nathan frowned before turning to Evelyn.

In the elevator, he proposed, "Could I stay in your room tonight? You take the bed, I'll take the couch."

Evelyn hesitated.

"I'm your boyfriend, Ev. After five years, don't you trust me yet?" Nathan's wounded expression filled her with guilt.

He had always treated her with respect, never pressuring her physically.

"Alright," she relented. "But just the couch."

Meanwhile, in the suite's dining area...

The Blackwood family sat together for a late supper.

Isabella devoured her fried chicken, tear stains still visible on her cheeks from her earlier tantrum.

Sebastian, abruptly summoned by his employer, stood awkwardly nearby.

"Has that design department rookie secured accommodations?" Dominic's tone gave nothing away.

Confused by his boss's sudden interest in a junior employee's lodging, Sebastian answered truthfully. "The hotel's fully booked. It appears he'll be staying with his girlfriend tonight."

A storm gathered in Dominic's eyes at this news - an emotion Sebastian rarely witnessed from his typically inscrutable employer.

Isabella pouted after finishing her meal. "I don't like mean Daddy!"

"Behave," Alexander chided.

"Mean Daddy! Mean Alex!" she retorted.

Sebastian intervened diplomatically. "How about I take you to visit Miss Evelyn? You could stay with her tonight."

Without waiting for permission, Isabella scrambled from her chair, determined to see her beloved Miss Ev.

Receiving no objection from Dominic, Sebastian escorted the girl from the suite toward Evelyn's room.

Before reaching her floor, his phone rang.

"Mr. Blackwood?" Sebastian answered, surprised.

After the call, though frowning, he had no choice but to follow orders.

Late that night, Abigail grumbled wearily in the car, "That Penelope Worthington is nothing but trouble! One day with her and we're all suffering. Why else would the boss order us to leave H City immediately? This goes beyond unreasonable - it's downright cruel! We've paid for the rooms, but he won't let us use them? Does he enjoy watching us suffer through this midnight exodus?"

Evelyn shared her exhaustion.

The boss's motives remained a mystery.

Nathan sat in the passenger seat while Gregory drove.

Back at the H City hotel...

Dominic stood alone on his balcony, cigarette in hand. Exhaling slowly, he allowed his carefully controlled mask to slip.

The business world knew him as impenetrable - a man without vulnerabilities.

The wine he'd consumed earlier left him slightly intoxicated.

Memories surfaced - her moans five years ago, her furious resistance last night. He laughed bitterly at himself before extinguishing the cigarette.

Next morning at H City International Airport...

Dominic's handsome face remained stormy throughout their departure.

Following behind, Sebastian couldn't help thinking: You might prevent them sharing a room in H City, sir, but you can't stop them returning to their shared home in A City.

After all, what right do you have to interfere?
###Chapter 13 

By dawn, they had returned to A City.

Dominic naturally drove the company Bentley back to headquarters.

Abigail stepped out of the vehicle.

Meanwhile, Nathan retrieved Evelyn's luggage from the trunk. "I'll take you home first so you can rest. Get some sleep. I'll come find you tonight."

Evelyn nodded.

They wheeled their suitcases toward the curb after bidding farewell to Abigail and Gregory, then hailed a taxi.

Nathan made a mental note to purchase a car tomorrow.

Being without one was becoming increasingly inconvenient.

Exhaustion weighed heavily on Evelyn. She'd managed barely two hours of fitful sleep in the car last night - hardly comfortable.

Before they could flag down a cab, Nathan's phone rang.

"Let me get this." He glanced at the screen and warned Evelyn before answering.

She studied his face as he frowned through the call. After several terse "okays," he finally said, "Understood. I'll be there."

"Trouble at work?" Evelyn asked when he hung up.

"Yeah. Team leader called an emergency meeting before lunch. Wants to capitalize on momentum and strategize next steps." Nathan massaged his temples as a cab rounded the corner.

Evelyn took her luggage from him. "Go ahead. I can manage."

Guilt twisted Nathan's features. Any decent boyfriend would escort his exhausted girlfriend home after a business trip. Yet work obligations forced him to abandon that duty.

Evelyn slid into the taxi.

As it pulled away, she drifted between consciousness and sleep.

Eventually, the driver announced their arrival.

Bleary-eyed, Evelyn recognized her apartment complex.

She stepped into the biting cold.

Five years of independence in A City had hardened her. Colds and fevers barely registered anymore.

But strength had limits.

Every woman craved care and attention.

Nathan's apparent obliviousness to her condition stung.

Two days and one night away left her utterly drained.

Her head throbbed. She must have dozed off because when she next stirred, her breath came in fiery gasps.

Stumbling to the kitchen, she hunted for cold medicine.

Midway through pouring water, her doorbell chimed.

"Who is it?" Her voice emerged weak and raspy.

Few knew this rented apartment - only Nathan and Olivia.

"Miss Sinclair? Neighborhood hospital. We received a house call request for an injection."

Evelyn blinked.

Who could have called them? Nathan?

So he had noticed her illness.

Perhaps it was the fever, but her emotions felt dangerously raw. Even this small gesture touched her deeply.

After the IV drip, another knock came.

Every muscle protested as she dragged herself to the door, only to find an extravagant meal delivery - the kind reserved for drama protagonists.

"Sign here, please." The delivery duo's gazes held unspoken judgment.

Evelyn flushed. This modest neighborhood clashed violently with such opulence.

She signed and they left.

The lavish spread left her bewildered.

Nathan came from comfortable but not extravagant means. Occasional nice dinners were one thing - this was absurd.

Yet it had already been ordered.

Though her appetite had fled, she forced down a few bites of the mild, sick-friendly dishes.

After cleaning up, she texted Nathan: "Thank you."

"For what?" came the swift reply.

Evelyn hesitated. Perhaps he found gratitude between partners unnecessary. "I wanted to say it anyway."

After a long pause: "Since when did you get so sentimental?"

It wasn't sentimentality - just profound gratitude. With her father's affection stolen by another woman and daughter, and extended family long estranged, she stood utterly alone.

Only the Kensington siblings offered warmth now.

Nathan had promised an evening visit.

But afternoon brought another call canceling plans.

Evelyn wordlessly wrapped the three-course meal she'd prepared and refrigerated it.

Morning arrived.

Nathan drove over to collect her.

Her congested voice betrayed her condition as she buckled up.

"You're sick?" Nathan's brow furrowed.

Evelyn froze mid-click, studying his face.

"Cold out?" Concerned, he reached across to feel her forehead. "You're burning up. Wait here - pharmacy's just ahead."

She watched him jog toward the store.

The realization struck like lightning: he'd known about her illness all along.

That explained yesterday's house call and gourmet meal.

Olivia couldn't have arranged it - buried in work since Evelyn's return, she barely had time to breathe.

Her phone vibrated.

Dazed, Evelyn checked the unknown number.

"Hello?"

"Delivery for Miss Sinclair. You're not home?"

"I'm at the complex entrance." She unbuckled and stepped out.

Minutes later, a green-vested courier presented an enormous floral arrangement. "Freshly flown in this morning. Sign here!"

"Who sent these?" Evelyn demanded.

"Client confidentiality." He grinned and departed.

The extravagant bouquet dwarfed her frame.

Its delicate fragrance did nothing to soothe her turmoil.

"Evelyn." Nathan's voice held an edge.

She turned. The vibrant blooms clashed violently with his stormy expression.

"I don't know who sent these." Panic laced her words.

"Really?" His gaze hardened. "Special delivery flowers. How... thoughtful." The sarcasm cut like glass.
###Chapter 14

"I don't know who sent them," Evelyn repeated.

She couldn't bear to meet Nathan's wounded stare. She didn't need any more complications in her life.

But fury burned in Nathan's eyes as he snapped, "You don't know? Are you joking? Do you think I'm an idiot, Evelyn Sinclair? It's barely been a week since we got back, and already there's another man in the picture. If it's just tonic, what kind of man would spend a fortune shipping fresh flowers to you?"

The accusation in his glare made her skin prickle.

She knew she'd done nothing wrong. Her conscience was clear.

She truly had no idea who had sent the flowers.

"I'm going to work." That was all she said, her voice steady. Without a second glance, she tossed the bouquet into the nearest trash bin.

Nathan watched her walk away, his hands curling into fists at his sides.

She crossed the street calmly, disappearing into the subway station.

He remained rooted in place, anger coiling tight in his chest.

Then he turned and slammed his fist into the lamppost. Pain shot through his knuckles, sharp and searing, but it did nothing to quell the storm inside him.

Maybe only marrying her would finally ease this gnawing fear.

At the office, Evelyn couldn't focus.

The subway ride had given her too much time to think.

Now, she had a suspect.

But the idea was absurd.

In H City, Dominic Blackwood had called her. That meant, as her boss, he had access to her contact details—her number, her address.

For someone in his position, getting an employee's personal information was laughably easy.

Her phone buzzed, snapping her out of her thoughts.

A WeChat notification.

"I overreacted."

"I'm terrified of losing you."

"Don't be mad. Let's talk."

Nathan had sent a string of messages.

Evelyn didn't reply.

No one liked being accused of cheating for no reason.

At lunch, Olivia slid into the seat across from her in the cafeteria.

"My brother sent me to smooth things over," she said, pushing a tray toward Evelyn. "He says he got jealous and pissed you off."

Evelyn kept eating in silence.

"Come on, Evelyn, cut him some slack." Olivia laughed. "He's crazy about you. His jealousy just proves how much he cares. Honestly, I think you mean more to him than our parents or even me. You're his whole world."

Evelyn exhaled, the tension in her shoulders easing slightly.

If she imagined another woman secretly sending Nathan gifts... yeah, she'd probably lose it too.

That afternoon, the design department head left his door wide open.

Evelyn passed by frequently on her way to refill her water bottle.

"Who's free to run an errand?" the department head called without looking up.

"I'll do it." Evelyn seized the opportunity, her eyes bright.

Her coworkers shot her grateful looks.

Everyone was swamped—having her handle minor tasks was a relief.

This time, the errand involved delivering blueprints to the president's office.

Exactly what she'd been waiting for.

She took the elevator to the top floor.

Entered the executive suite.

Placed the blueprints on the desk.

But she didn't leave.

"Something else?" Dominic didn't glance up, his long fingers tracing the lines of the blueprint spread before him.

He looked intense, wholly absorbed in his work.

"Thank you, Mr. Blackwood," she ventured.

Her pulse kicked up as she tested the waters.

Stupid, Evelyn. If you're wrong, this is going to be so awkward.

To her shock, Dominic's hands stilled.

He lifted his head, his gaze piercing. "Not bad. At least you recognize your benefactor. You're not as clueless as I thought."

Evelyn blinked.

Clueless?

And benefactor?

Was she some kind of pet he'd taken in?

But semantics didn't matter.

"I don't understand why you did that, Mr. Blackwood," she said carefully.

"You took care of Alexander and Isabella. That wasn't easy." His tone was matter-of-fact. "And I passed out in your bed drunk. I owe you for that. If not for me, you wouldn't have gotten sick."

Evelyn stiffened.

They'd barely interacted in H City after she fell ill. How did he even know?

"Thank you," she said, shifting uncomfortably. To prevent further misunderstandings, she added, "The compensation was more than enough. Please don't send anything else, Mr. Blackwood. As your employee, helping you is part of my job."

Her words were deliberately distant, putting a firm boundary between them.

Dominic chuckled, a single dark sound. His expression was unreadable as he arched a brow. "Confident, aren't you? Assuming I'd give you more."

Evelyn's face burned.

She'd only been worried about explaining more gifts to Nathan.

"If there's nothing else, I'll head back downstairs." She nodded politely and turned to leave.

Retreating with her dignity in tatters.

"Stop." His voice cut through the air.

She froze.

"You said helping me is part of your job, right?" His tone gave nothing away.

Evelyn's stomach dropped.

She nodded warily.

Dominic gestured to a stack of books and cartoon-printed wrapping paper on the coffee table. "Stay and wrap these for my kids."

"Wrap them?" She eyed the books.

"And be quiet about it. Don't disturb my work." With that, he returned to his blueprint, frowning in concentration.

Evelyn had no choice but to comply.

It had been years since she'd last wrapped textbooks.

Four books in total—two labeled Isabella Blackwood, two Alexander Blackwood.

She cut the wrapping paper carefully, but her movements were clumsy from disuse.

She was definitely going to ruin a sheet.

"I—"

She remembered his order not to interrupt, but she had no choice.

Dominic looked up.

Evelyn met his gaze briefly before dropping her eyes. "I messed up one of the sheets. There isn't enough left..."

Her voice was soft, hesitant.

The way she bit her lip sent an odd heat curling through him.

"More in the drawer," he said, his voice rougher than usual.

Relieved, she hurried to retrieve them.

Beneath the desk, she spotted the stack of cartoon paper Sebastian had bought for the twins.

As she crouched to select new sheets, her fingers brushed against a Spongebob wrapper.
###Chapter 15

Evelyn believed Isabella would adore this SpongeBob wrapping paper.

She set aside the other designs and selected the SpongeBob one, rising from her seat.

"Ah—"

In her focus on choosing the perfect wrapping for the books, she'd entirely forgotten about the imposing figure beside her.

The vintage brooch on Evelyn's blouse had snagged on Dominic's designer belt.

"My apologies, I—" Evelyn stammered, staring at the tangled metal with growing horror.

Dominic's dark gaze dropped to where she fumbled. Something unreadable flickered in his eyes.

"Just give me a moment..." Her fingers trembled as she attempted to free the intricate clasp.

Never in her twenty-three years had Evelyn found herself handling a man's belt buckle. Not during that fateful night five years ago, nor in her relationship with Nathan.

Why did these mortifying situations only occur around Dominic Blackwood?

The ornate brooch had wedged itself stubbornly into the belt's mechanism. The more she struggled, the warmer her cheeks burned.

"Are we making progress?" His deep voice rumbled above her.

Evelyn glanced up.

Dominic stood like a marble statue—tall, immaculate in his tailored suit. Three buttons of his crisp white shirt lay undone, revealing a tantalizing glimpse of toned chest. His narrow waist accentuated broad shoulders, the perfect proportions of a man who belonged on a Milan runway.

"I... I don't mind sacrificing the brooch." She averted her eyes. "But freeing it might damage your belt."

Years of studying luxury brands abroad told her that belt cost more than her monthly salary.

"A scratched buckle beats having you permanently attached to my waist." Dominic observed her frantic efforts with amusement.

Golden twilight bathed his sharp features as Evelyn resumed her task, lips pressed in concentration.

Her warm breath ghosted across his abdomen as she worked. Dominic's posture stiffened imperceptibly.

Click.

Finally, the brooch came free.

Evelyn exhaled in relief, cradling the damaged keepsake. Then she noticed.

Her gaze dropped.

A shocked gasp escaped as she stumbled back, eyes wide with horrified realization.

Dominic loomed over her, his expression unreadable. When their eyes met, Evelyn's mouth went dry.

"Sorry! I'll finish wrapping those books now, Mr. Blackwood!" She snatched up the SpongeBob paper and fled to her task.

The remaining hour passed in excruciating awkwardness. Dominic's very presence erected invisible barriers of power and privilege.

Only when safely in the elevator did Evelyn's pulse steady. She resolved never to visit the executive floor again.

Work piled high on her desk provided blessed distraction from the afternoon's humiliation.

"Dinner at our place tonight," Olivia whispered during a document exchange. "Nathan's picking us up."

Evelyn nodded absently.

Olivia's gaze caught on the damaged brooch. "What happened?"

Though not valuable, Evelyn had cherished this piece since adolescence—the sole contents of a keepsake box Olivia had glimpsed years ago.

"A child grabbed it," Evelyn lied smoothly. "Wouldn't let go."

"Ugh, spoiled brats." Olivia shook her head sympathetically before returning to work.

Evelyn's fingers traced the twisted metal thoughtfully.

At day's end, Nathan waited outside in his new car—a post-business trip indulgence.

"Sorry about today," he murmured, holding the door open.

Olivia departed in her own vehicle while Evelyn slid into the passenger seat. Silence stretched during the drive to the Kensington residence.

Nathan's parents greeted them personally at the curb.

"You shouldn't have come down!" Evelyn protested.

Patricia Kensington squeezed her hand. "We missed you!"

"Mom's fonder of you than Nathan is!" Olivia teased.

Nathan lingered behind, fingers clenched around a velvet ring box in his pocket. This proposal felt like a gamble—he couldn't predict Evelyn's reaction.

Their relationship had always existed in this uncertain space.

And uncertainty made his palms sweat.
###Chapter 16

Evelyn knew Nathan adored her. But she also knew her feelings didn't match the intensity of his.

That's why he'd orchestrated this elaborate proposal. The moment he decided to pop the question at noon, he'd summoned his entire family - grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins. Over a dozen relatives now filled the Kensington home.

When Evelyn followed Olivia upstairs, she froze the instant the door swung open.

Olivia mirrored her shock, gaping at the crowd like they were apparitions.

"You're finally here!" Nathan's paternal aunt spotted Evelyn first. Recognizing the girl from photos, she clutched her mother's arm excitedly. "That's Nathan's girlfriend, Evelyn Sinclair! Standing right there! Oh, what a vision. Come see, Mother!"

Evelyn stood speechless.

"Come inside." Nathan's tender voice broke through as he gently pulled her forward.

Forcing a polite smile, Evelyn greeted each relative. Nathan's grandmother refused to release her hand, patting it affectionately with every word.

An uneasy premonition settled in Evelyn's stomach.

Her eyes found Nathan smoking on the balcony, hands shoved in pockets. The tension in his shoulders betrayed his inner turmoil.

Dinner surpassed even New Year's feasts.

"This is incredible," Olivia whispered between bites.

Nathan's grandparents and parents occupied the head table with the couple. Others filled surrounding tables with light chatter throughout the meal.

As Evelyn set down her fork, Nathan locked eyes with her. "Come with me."

They retreated to his childhood bedroom.

"What's wrong?" Evelyn's voice carried the gentle warmth of mid-morning sunlight.

Nathan's gaze burned with determination and tenderness. Taking her hand, his voice trembled slightly. "I owe you an apology for this morning."

"It's forgotten," she assured him.

"Thank you for understanding my fears." He pulled her close, whispering against her hair, "You can't imagine how terrified I am of losing you."

Evelyn stayed silent.

"I've loved you since you first stepped into our home," he confessed. "A high school freshman - I felt criminal for those feelings. I tried dating others, but only found irritation. Then I realized - I just had to wait for you to grow up."

His arms tightened. "When you confessed your past...it shattered me."

Evelyn stiffened. So it did bother him.

"Not because you were 'tainted,'" he rushed to clarify. "Because I failed you. I should've been there from the start. Should've protected you."

His voice broke. "No man will ever love you longer or more fiercely than I do."

Evelyn's heart melted.

This was the unconditional love she'd prayed for. That powerful man from her past had wanted her to move on too. She remembered his butler's words: "I hope you live well."

She'd wondered then - could someone like her ever deserve happiness?

But happiness didn't require wealth or status. Just someone who cherished her. Someone like Nathan.

Pulling back, she met his gaze. "Stop doubting yourself. You make me feel guilty. I'm not remarkable enough to attract attention."

Nathan remembered the imported flowers.

"Even if someone noticed me," Evelyn vowed, "I'd never reciprocate."

Reassured, Nathan led her back to the living room. When she moved toward the sofa, he held her firmly in the center.

Confused, Evelyn looked up just as he produced a velvet ring box before their assembled family.

Olivia gasped. "He's proposing!"

Nathan dropped to one knee. "Marry me, Evelyn Sinclair. Become part of my family. Be my beloved wife."

Evelyn stood stunned. Marriage had always felt distant.

"Say yes, dear!" Nathan's mother urged.

Olivia nudged her.

She'd known this was inevitable since agreeing to date Nathan.

...

By 9 PM, Evelyn finally escaped the family's enthusiasm. Nathan drove her home.

"I'll walk from here," she said upon arrival. She needed solitude after the emotional whirlwind.

"Sleep well." Nathan respected her space.

Watching his Audi disappear, Evelyn turned toward her building. The well-lit path held scattered evening walkers.

As she fumbled for her keys, a child's voice called: "Lady!"

She turned toward the shadows behind a streetlamp.

Two figures stood solemnly - one tall, one small.

Dominic Blackwood's chiseled features hid in darkness, his stormy gaze promising tempers barely leashed.

Beside him, Alexander bit his lip, all arrogance from their hotel encounter gone.

Evelyn's breath caught. "Why...are you here?"
###Chapter 17 

"Excuse me, we're—" The boy's words cut off abruptly as an elderly woman approached.

Was this Miss Evelyn's mother?

"Hello, Grandma!" Alexander greeted politely.

Grandma?

Evelyn turned, following the boy's gaze.

A woman in her fifties, dressed in a sleek white-and-pink Adidas tracksuit, paused mid-stride. Her sharp eyes locked onto them.

Dominic remained silent. He knew this wasn't Evelyn's mother.

"Can I help you?" Evelyn asked, unnerved by the woman's scrutiny.

The stranger frowned, crossing her arms. "Young lady, marriage means responsibility. You can't let your husband and child starve while you're out gallivanting. Look at the time! Dinner should've been ready hours ago."

Her pointed glare at Dominic made Evelyn's cheeks burn.

Before she could protest, the woman turned her wrath on Dominic. "And you! Sulking like a child won't solve anything. What kind of example is that for your son? Modern men cook. Your wife isn't your maid!"

Evelyn's jaw dropped. The misunderstanding was absurd.

"Ma'am, you're mistaken," she blurted. "He's my employer. Nothing more."

The woman's skeptical gaze swept over them—the stiff-backed billionaire, the flustered young woman, the hopeful child clutching gifts.

Her lips pursed. "Sugar babies in this neighborhood? Disgraceful."

With that, she marched off, leaving Evelyn speechless.

Dominic's voice cut through the tension. "Alexander. Say what you came to say."

Evelyn turned.

The boy blinked up at them, confused. Then—remembering his role—he toddled to a shadowed corner.

With visible effort, he lugged two ribbon-tied boxes forward. One pale blue, one ivory.

"Miss Evelyn," he panted, "these are for you." His anxious glance at Dominic betrayed his uncertainty.

Evelyn's resolve wavered. She couldn't reject gifts offered with such earnest effort. Taking them, she met Alexander's hopeful gaze.

"Why give me these?" she asked the boy, though the question was meant for his father.

Unseen by Evelyn, Dominic's eyes locked onto the diamond glittering on her left hand.

Engaged.

Alexander scratched his head. "Dunno..." He looked to Dominic for guidance.

"Mission accomplished. Let's go." Dominic's obsidian gaze lingered on Evelyn for a heartbeat before he turned away.

Both Evelyn and Alexander stared after his retreating figure.

"My dad, he..." The boy trailed off, shoulders slumping.

Evelyn sighed. "I can't keep these."

"Why not?"

How to explain adult complications to a child? She settled for, "Gifts should be earned."

Gently, she returned the boxes. "Catch up to your father. Give these back for me."

A white Porsche idled at the curb.

Dominic gripped the steering wheel, cigarette smoke curling around his sharp features. His eyes darkened at the sight of the returned gifts in his son's arms.

"Trash them," he ordered coldly.

Blackwood Estate

The car barely stopped before Alexander bolted out, silent tears streaking his face.

Reginald Blackwood nearly spilled his tea. "What's upset my great-grandson?"

In five years, father and son had never fought.

Dominic loosened his tie, striding inside.

"Did some gold-digger accost you again?" Beatrice Lockwood, his mother, took his coat with a knowing look.

Dominic shook his head.

Beatrice frowned. What else could wound Alexander so?

The twins had been sheltered, ignorant of mothers until playmates mentioned theirs. That day, Alexander had demanded, "Where's ours?"

Reginald's lie—"You have no mother"—no longer worked.

Defeated, the old man had sighed. "She's far away. If she returns, your father will introduce you."

Only Alexander remembered.

Beatrice handed the coat to a maid, gazing out the window. As grandmother, she burned to know the twins' mother.

But five years had buried that secret.

Luke had never spoken of it.

Faye Thomas and Charles Finn—his former aides—had retired "due to illness." Perhaps a visit might loosen their tongues...
###Chapter 18 

The following morning.

Evelyn didn't leave her apartment until eight sharp.

Her subway commute took exactly twenty minutes. Moments like these made her grateful she'd found affordable housing so close to the corporate headquarters.

Stepping outside, she instinctively raised a hand to shield her tired eyes from the harsh morning sunlight.

Sleep had eluded her completely last night, leaving her exhausted and bleary-eyed.

The bright rays stung her sensitive eyes painfully.

She'd spent hours analyzing Dominic Blackwood's baffling behavior. Why would the powerful CEO shower her with such extravagant gifts?

Had the house call and gourmet meal truly been appreciation for babysitting his children?

Were those imported flowers merely a polite gesture during her illness?

Yet the man's demeanor had been anything but friendly.

The two gift boxes from last night confused her most of all.

The sheer extravagance of these gestures unsettled Evelyn deeply.

Who was Dominic Blackwood? And more importantly - who was she?

The CEO of T Corporation stood at the pinnacle of the business world. Even without his wealth, his sculpted physique and striking features would make him any woman's fantasy.

Evelyn? She was nobody.

Her only qualifications? Being female and breathing.

Dominic's actions suggested something absurd - too ridiculous to entertain seriously.

A man like him could have any mistress he desired.

Why would he look twice at someone like her?

It made zero sense.

...

Outside her apartment complex.

Evelyn paused at the crosswalk, scanning for traffic when movement caught her eye.

An elderly sanitation worker in a fluorescent vest emptied the trash bins.

He pulled out two familiar boxes - one blue, one white.

Identical to the ones Alexander delivered last night.

As the old man crouched to inspect them, two fashionably dressed women exited the building.

"Hey old man, what'd you find there?" The younger woman, mid-twenties, approached eagerly.

To the elderly worker, designer clothes held little value. His aging wife couldn't wear such styles.

A passing car blocked Evelyn's view momentarily.

When she looked back, the women were negotiating with the cleaner, offering to buy his discovery.

"Here's two hundred bucks, old timer. Take it!"

Money exchanged hands, and the women lunged for the remaining box.

"Wait." Evelyn approached calmly. "I'll give you ten thousand for both boxes."

The women glared daggers at this unexpected interference.

Who did this meddler think she was?

Evelyn met their hostility unflinchingly. She had every right to intervene.

These items no longer belonged to Dominic after her refusal - they were the cleaner's property now.

The Ralph Lauren outfit represented peak luxury for working women, favored even by celebrities.

The Tiffany brooch exceeded that value exponentially.

Together worth over $150K, being snatched up for two hundred?

That wasn't just greedy - it was criminal.

"T-ten thousand?" The old man gaped.

Evelyn nodded firmly.

"Fifteen thousand!" The first woman countered, shooting Evelyn another glare before rummaging for her bank card.

"Twenty thousand." Evelyn increased her offer without hesitation.

The cleaner's skeptical expression clearly doubted her sincerity.

"Probably fakes," one woman whispered to her friend. "This smells like a scam. Since when do you find luxury goods outside some cheap apartment?"

The friend reconsidered, pocketing her card. "You're right. Almost fell for it! Total con job!" They stormed off indignantly.

The old man bristled. "Who you calling scammers? You three are the shady ones here!"

...

Twenty minutes later, Evelyn guided the elderly man into a high-end boutique.

With receipts and authentication, converting the items to cash proved simple.

She handled every step.

The bewildered old man clutched the money bag, trembling. "I-I..."

"No scam, sir. Finder's keepers." Evelyn had refused these gifts initially - she wouldn't claim them now.

Brand new with original receipts, liquidation was guaranteed.

"Divine luck!" Tears welled in his eyes as he hugged the life-changing sum. "Five years of medicine right here! No one will come after me later, right?"

Evelyn reassured him, then noticed his pronounced limp.

...

Evelyn arrived at T Corporation at 10:30 AM.

Their conversation revealed the cleaner lived alone with his ailing wife, childless.

During his first sanitation year, a hit-and-run driver shattered his leg.

The fleeing perpetrator remained at large.

Medical bills and ongoing treatment had nearly broken him. Only concern for his wife prevented suicide.

Suddenly, Evelyn felt gratitude toward Dominic Blackwood.

To the wealthy, a few hundred thousand meant nothing. To this man? A miraculous second chance.

Inadvertently, Dominic had performed genuine charity.

Only upon entering the near-empty office did Evelyn realize - it was Saturday.

...

Meanwhile, a father-son standoff unfolded elsewhere.

Dominic sat in his black Land Rover, dark shirt accentuating his stormy expression. "Last chance. Coming or not?"

"No! You're hopeless!"

Alexander hugged his backpack tighter, puffing his cheeks at his father. "I wanted to help make you likable, but where do I even start? Terrible temper, zero gentleness - the list goes on!"

Dominic's brow furrowed dangerously. Was his son scheming something?

The final blow came delivered with childish bluntness. "You'll die alone at this rate!"
###Chapter 19

Alexander watched Dominic's car disappear down the driveway. His small hands clenched into fists. He knew his words had struck deep this time - straight into his father's icy heart.

Isabella came skipping down the stairs, her pigtails bouncing. "Where's Daddy going?" she asked, peering up at her brother.

"He left." Alexander scuffed his shoe against the pavement. "I think... I hurt his feelings."

The little girl merely shrugged. "I miss Miss Evelyn!"

Their father? Who cared about him? He never smiled, never played, always glared with those stormy eyes. She liked him even less than her boring math teacher. Isabella Blackwood couldn't care less whether her father spent weekends at home.

But Miss Evelyn? She smelled like flowers and always had candy in her purse.

"Want me to take you to Miss Evelyn's place?" Alexander offered, grabbing his sister's hand. "I remember where she lives."

Isabella nodded eagerly.

The twins exchanged conspiratorial grins.

They flagged down a rideshare, giggling as they climbed into the backseat. Unbeknownst to them, one of the Blackwood family drivers tailed the vehicle at a discreet distance.

When they arrived at the gated community of Royal Heights, the driver immediately called Dominic. "Sir, the children are waiting outside Royal Heights. They seem to be expecting someone."

"Keep watching them," Dominic's cold voice crackled through the phone.

The driver kept his eyes glued to the small figures, not daring to blink.

"Should we call Miss Evelyn?" Isabella whispered, shrinking under the curious gazes of passing residents.

Alexander frowned. He only knew which building she lived in, not the exact apartment. His gaze flickered to the familiar Blackwood car parked nearby. Of course Father would have them followed.

Just as he was about to lead his sister to a payphone, a familiar figure rounded the corner.

Evelyn froze when she saw the two children clutching hands on her doorstep. Again? Why did her boss's kids keep appearing at her home?

She adored these two, but getting too close was dangerous. Rumors could spread. Her job could be at risk.

Sighing, she approached them. "What are you two doing here?"

Alexander spoke first, his voice wobbling. "We took a cab. Daddy yelled at Isabella and made her cry. We... we didn't know where else to go."

Evelyn crouched down, studying their pitiful expressions. She gently wiped a smudge from Isabella's cheek. "You should go home, sweethearts. Parents don't stay angry for long. I'm sure your father already regrets it."

Their excuse had failed. Alexander squeezed his sister's hand - their secret signal.

On cue, Isabella's lower lip trembled. Big tears welled in her eyes.

"Fine. We'll leave you alone." Alexander tugged his sister's arm dramatically. Isabella resisted, then "accidentally" tumbled onto the gravel path.

"Oww!" A tiny scrape bloomed on her knee.

Evelyn's resolve shattered. She scooped the sobbing girl into her arms. "Shh, it's okay. Let's get you cleaned up." She shot Alexander a look. "Both of you, come inside."

Isabella's tears vanished instantly. She nuzzled into Evelyn's neck. "Miss Evelyn, you're my favorite!"

Evelyn sighed but couldn't suppress a smile.

Inside the modest apartment, Evelyn sat Isabella on the couch and fetched her first aid kit. The girl bravely endured the stinging antiseptic, fascinated when Evelyn tied the bandage into a perfect bow.

Glancing at the clock, Evelyn realized it was nearly lunchtime. "Hungry?"

Two eager nods answered her.

While cartoons played in the background, Evelyn rummaged through her fridge. She'd feed them well before sending them home.

The rice cooker hummed. Evelyn bit her lip. She'd deliberately avoided saving Dominic's number, though the digits were seared into her memory. Even if she had it, calling that intimidating man was unthinkable.

Better to put them in a cab later and secretly ensure they got home safely.

She prepared three simple dishes and a light soup - nutritious but kid-friendly. Her cooking skills were decent, at least.

"Stay here," she instructed before dashing out to buy fried chicken from the clean-looking shop downstairs.

Keys jingling as she returned, Evelyn expected to find Isabella waiting by the door. Instead, she came face-to-face with a towering, broad-shouldered figure.

Her smile died. Her grip on the chicken bag tightened. Every instinct screamed to flee.

But this was her home.

Dominic Blackwood stood in her living room, his storm-gray eyes boring into hers.
###Chapter 20

Dominic didn't glance at her. His voice was cool. "The food's getting cold."

He turned effortlessly, striding toward her tiny balcony as if he owned the place. The space couldn't have been more than two meters squared.

Evelyn remained frozen.

The man moved through her apartment with unsettling familiarity, retrieving his cigarette case mid-stride. A single tap produced a cigarette that found its way between his lips. The lighter flicked open with practiced ease.

Every motion screamed power and control.

This was her home, yet the scene unfolding felt surreal. The twins sat obediently at her table, spoons in hand, waiting like she owed them dinner. Adorable, yes. But the grown man smoking on her balcony? That was another matter entirely.

Most people would at least pretend to care about boundaries.

—

Evelyn served the children first, then retreated to the kitchen's false safety. She'd essentially become their surrogate mother—unpaid and unappreciated.

This couldn't continue.

The kitchen's sanctuary shattered when tobacco invaded her senses.

She looked up into Dominic's smoldering gaze.

Suddenly, the air thickened. His imposing frame blocked her exit, cornering her near the fridge.

Her pulse spiked.

She needed out. Now.

One step forward met with immovable resistance.

Evelyn's warning glare bounced off his armor. His attention had dropped to her mouth, making her cheeks burn.

"Why no onions, Miss Eve?" Isabella's voice carried from the dining area, accompanied by spoon clinks.

Evelyn turned her face away. "I... don't eat onions."

She attempted escape again.

The children were safer company.

Dominic's hand clamped her shoulder, rooting her in place.

"Have you lost your mind?" Her voice cracked. Looking up, she found his dark eyes consuming her.

His silence was more terrifying than words.

She struggled uselessly. Those obsidian eyes promised she wouldn't win this.

"Control yourself, Mr. Blackwood!" She hissed, mindful of young ears.

Dominic leaned closer, his breath hot on her skin. "I am controlling myself. Very deliberately."

His twisted logic left her speechless.

Suddenly, there was no space between them. None at all.

"I'm engaged!" She reminded him sharply. "This could ruin your reputation!"

Dominic remained unmoved. As if her relationship status meant nothing.

Outside, Alexander declared, "Not eating veggies is bad, Miss!"

"Yeah!" Isabella chimed in. "Daddy disciplines picky eaters!"

The word "discipline" made Evelyn's breath hitch.

Dominic's smirk appeared. Then his large hand slid down her waist—

He'd never actually disciplined the twins. But his stern demeanor made the threat effective. Old Man Blackwood had weaponized it.

Now the children parroted the warning faithfully.

"Isabella! Alexander! Come here!" Evelyn called desperately.

Surely he wouldn't—

"Okay!" Small feet pattered toward the kitchen.

"Alexander and Isabella Blackwood." Dominic's voice froze them mid-step. "Return to the table."

Full names. The ultimate parental weapon.

The twins retreated instantly.

Evelyn glared at the man trapping her. Force wasn't working. Maybe reason would. "You could have any woman. Why me?"

His voice dropped to a rough whisper. "Love enters through the stomach while sense exits through the door. Tonight, I'm proving that theory." His fingers tightened. "How much longer will you make me wait?"

A phone buzzed.

Saved!

Evelyn seized the distraction, twisting free—only to be yanked back violently.

His arms banded around her like steel.

She barely had time to gasp before his mouth crashed down. His kiss was both tender and possessive, mapping her face with devastating precision. From forehead to eyelids, nose to lips—he claimed every inch.

Her protests dissolved into helpless whimpers.
###Chapter 21

Dominic's lips trailed down Evelyn's collarbone with deliberate slowness.

A sharp gasp escaped her.

Her mind went blank.

Tears burned behind her eyelids. Against her will, the memories of five years ago came rushing back.

All she could hear was the ragged breathing of a stranger.

That night after giving birth flashed before her eyes. She'd been video-calling Olivia when she spotted the wealthy businessman on TV news.

A contract was a contract. It didn't matter who he was - Evelyn had no right to refuse.

Now, as Dominic forced his kiss upon her, all she could think of was that middle-aged man. Bile rose in her throat.

Dominic noticed her distraction immediately. He gripped her chin, forcing her to meet his darkened gaze. "What's wrong? Why are you crying?"

Evelyn blinked up at him dazedly.

The height difference was staggering. In her slippers, she barely reached his shoulders. To him, she must look like some pitiful, red-eyed creature.

"I was thinking Mr. Blackwood isn't what he appears to be," she whispered, struggling to keep her voice steady. "You're far worse."

She hated showing weakness. But emotions weren't logical.

Life had thrown everything at her - the good, the bad, the unspeakable.

That night five years ago topped the list of horrors.

Dominic's kiss had ripped open old wounds. His voice afterward shattered what little composure she had left.

Her strength was just a facade. Underneath, she was fragile as glass.

"Miss—" Alexander burst into the kitchen, his eyes widening at the scene.

Evelyn turned away hastily.

Dominic didn't acknowledge his son. His handsome face darkened at her words. A monster? Him?

Since when had he sunk so low?

He prided himself on self-control. Women had never been his weakness.

His phone kept ringing insistently.

Suddenly, Evelyn was free.

Dominic answered with a tone that could freeze hell.

Being so close, Evelyn heard the caller clearly.

"Dominic? Did I interrupt something?" The woman's voice was sweet but nervous. "You sound...angry."

His expression turned thunderous.

Alexander watched his father warily as Dominic snapped, "What do you want?"

"I just thought...since you left so suddenly for A City..." The woman trailed off awkwardly. Clearly making excuses.

Dominic said nothing, his attention still on Evelyn.

"I'm coming Monday," the woman continued brightly. "Starting my own business there. My parents support the idea. Maybe you could give me some advice? As a successful businessman?"

Evelyn recognized her now.

Penelope Worthington. Director Worthington's precious daughter.

"We'll discuss it when you arrive." Dominic hung up without ceremony.

Alexander stood frozen, his small frame trembling under his father's icy stare.

Isabella hovered at the doorway, too scared to enter.

Did Daddy make Miss Evelyn cry? Meanie!

Before she could wonder further, Dominic scooped her up abruptly.

"Big bro—" she called over his shoulder.

Alexander glanced between Evelyn and his furious father. His heart pounded.

"I'll visit again, Miss Evelyn," he promised before following.

Dominic didn't bother helping Isabella with her shoes. He simply carried her out.

Alexander scrambled after them.

In the Range Rover, Alexander muttered, "That was too much, Dad."

Isabella sulked in her car seat.

Dominic started the engine silently, his expression unreadable.

Father and son wore matching scowls.

—

"Evelyn, my parents want to buy you and Nathan a house after the wedding. Any preferences? They've saved up. I'd suggest somewhere central—easier commute."

After Dominic left, Olivia called.

"A house?" Evelyn found this moving too fast.

They talked briefly before Olivia, sensing her distress, urged her to rest.

Instead, Evelyn cleaned.

As she tidied, she spotted a tiny pair of fox-shaped shoes.

Isabella's.

Her father had carried her off barefoot.

Evelyn sighed. Barely started working and already clashing with the boss.

Whose fault was it? She didn't know.

She'd probably be fired soon. Or should resign.

The balcony ashtray caught her eye next. Normally unused, today it held two fresh cigarette butts.

She cleaned meticulously until not a speck remained.

Then she saw them.

The black lace bra and matching panties she'd hung to dry yesterday.

Normally, no one saw her laundry. The tiny apartment left no choice.

But now...

The thought of Dominic seeing—perhaps examining—her intimate wear made her skin prickle with discomfort.
###Chapter 22

That evening at Blackwood Estate.

The entire family gathered for dinner, though Dominic Blackwood's seat remained conspicuously empty.

Beatrice Lockwood placed cucumber slices on both Alexander and Isabella's plates. "Growing children need proper nutrition. Even if you dislike it, you must eat some. Unless you want to remain this height forever?"

The rest of the table continued their meal without comment.

Alexander obediently chewed his cucumber before looking up. "Grandmother, why don't you eat onions?"

The stir-fried onions were a family favorite - enjoyed by Great-grandfather Reginald, Uncle Julian, and even Margaret Lockwood. Only Beatrice consistently pushed the dish away, claiming the smell ruined her appetite.

Before Beatrice could respond, Margaret snorted. "Such high maintenance. Typical of her kind."

Reginald's sharp cough silenced further remarks. Though Margaret rolled her eyes, she returned to eating without another word.

Beatrice maintained her composure. "It's hereditary. My father couldn't stand onions either."

"Really?" Alexander fumbled with his chopsticks. "Miss Evelyn doesn't eat onions either!"

Beatrice smiled faintly. Many people avoided onions - just like cilantro. Nothing unusual about that.

After dinner, the twins played outside until dusk, then dutifully prepared for bed.

—

The night stretched endlessly for Evelyn Sinclair.

Tangled in sweat-drenched sheets, she thrashed against haunting dreams.

Water cascaded in her vision. Dominic stood showering when she entered, pressing against his sculpted back. As he turned, his mouth trailed fire down her neck.

She arched toward him, desperate for more.

His rough hands mapped her body while hot breath whispered against her skin. Every touch ignited tremors through her overheated flesh.

Suddenly the scene shifted.

A repulsive middle-aged tycoon leered at her with greasy intent.

Evelyn jolted upright, gasping.

Only a nightmare. Thank God.

Outside her A City apartment, starless darkness mirrored her turmoil. Five years hadn't erased that televised image of her baby's father - his porcine features forever imprinted behind her eyelids.

Therapy had provided temporary relief overseas, but the nightmares always returned. Why couldn't her subconscious release what reality had moved past?

Evelyn turned toward the window, seeking grounding in the present.

Then Dominic's voice echoed from earlier that day: "What are you thinking about? Why are you crying?"

Her fingers clawed the sheets as another memory surfaced - that hoarse command from five years ago: "Spread your legs for me—"

The two voices merged thunderously in her mind.

Lightning flashed, illuminating her tear-streaked face just before rain lashed the windows.

She finally surrendered to sobs.

'Face it. You sold yourself to that disgusting man at eighteen to save your family.'

'You despise him so deeply that you'd rather believe Dominic was—'

—

At dawn, Alexander crept into his sister's room.

"Isabella, why do you think Father was holding Miss Evelyn yesterday?"

"He was?" Isabella blinked sleepily.

"Yes! And she was crying."

"Maybe he hit her."

"Why would he—"

"Because she's picky! She won't eat onions!"

Alexander's brow furrowed. Had Father really punished Miss Evelyn for not eating onions? That didn't seem right.

"I'll talk to him," Alexander decided. "Men should be gentle with ladies."

Isabella sighed dramatically. "Father needs so much guidance."

Dominic returned at sunrise. As he removed his tie, a childish note on his bathroom door caught his eye: "Father - plese be a gentelman."

He set it aside without comment.

Alexander appeared moments later, keeping a safe distance. "Father, may I ask you something?"

To the boy's surprise, Dominic nodded permission.

"Isabella says you hit Miss Evelyn for not eating onions." Alexander gathered courage. "People have rights! You can't force your will on others! Miss Evelyn isn't even your child like we are!"

Dominic arched a brow. "If I provide for someone their entire life, shouldn't they obey me too?"

Alexander scratched his head. "I suppose, but—"

Without further explanation, Dominic stepped into the shower, ending the conversation. Some lessons required more maturity than his son possessed.
###Chapter 23

The boy had countless questions swirling in his young mind. He lingered by the bathroom door, waiting impatiently for his father to finish showering.

Dominic stepped out with only a towel wrapped around his waist. Water droplets glistened on his sculpted torso as he ran fingers through damp hair.

"Dad, doesn't Miss Evelyn have parents? Why do you need to take care of her?" Alexander couldn't comprehend this arrangement.

Dominic sat on the edge of the bed, spreading his legs as he towel-dried his hair. "How old are you? How old is she?"

"I'm five..." The boy hesitated. "But I don't know her age."

Dominic met his son's curious gaze. "You're five. She's twenty-four. Nineteen years apart." He leaned forward. "You'll grow up fast. Soon you'll be a man with dreams and responsibilities. By then I'll be in my fifties, aging. Same for your Miss Evelyn. One day we'll be as old as your great-grandfather."

Alexander nodded solemnly.

"But Miss Evelyn will have her own husband and kids." The boy's forehead wrinkled. "Will you take care of them too?"

Dominic's expression darkened. "Why would I care for her husband?" He stood abruptly, tossing the damp towel aside.

Her husband? That Nathan Kensington?

Dominic's jaw tightened visibly.

Alexander bit his lip, fingers fidgeting. He couldn't understand why his simple question had angered his father again.

Meanwhile at Regal Capital...

Evelyn had no recollection of when sleep finally claimed her. Nightmares tormented her until dawn, leaving her with a throbbing headache that refused to subside.

Her phone vibrated unnoticed.

Nathan's message read: "Evelyn, guessing you're still asleep. Hope this doesn't disturb you. Swamped today - can't visit. Take medicine if cold persists. See you Monday. Mom's bringing chicken soup - she got your address."

The sleeping woman remained oblivious.

Outside the apartment complex...

Morning sunlight filtered through post-rain humidity, casting gentle warmth on pedestrians.

Patricia Kensington carefully balanced her soup container, walking briskly toward Regal Capital after disembarking the bus.

The aging neighborhood showed signs of wear but maintained quiet dignity. Elderly residents rocked on chairs, sipping tea in clusters.

A woman in floral print fanned herself dramatically, pointing toward Building 12. "Next time she appears, I'll show you! Never judge by appearances! That innocent-looking girl is actually a shameless homewrecker!"

"Tabitha, hush! You can't make such claims without proof," another woman chided.

Tabitha bristled at the challenge. "Ask anyone here! Have I ever lied? Let her confront me! I'll name her right now - Evelyn Sinclair!"

Patricia's hands trembled violently as she approached. "Did you say Evelyn Sinclair? What exactly do you mean by homewrecker?"

The gossiping women turned in unison.

Tabitha eyed the newcomer suspiciously. "Who's asking? Never seen you here before."

Patricia's voice shook with maternal protectiveness. "She's my daughter-in-law! How dare you spread such filth!"

"Aha! The mother-in-law!" Tabitha's gaze dropped to the soup container, smirking. "You don't live together, do you? Bet your son's rarely home either. Pathetic - defending that slut while she parades her sugar daddy around!"

Patricia's face drained of color. "You... saw this yourself?"

Tabitha pointed triumphantly toward a lamppost. "Right there! Disgusting public display!"

"My son is quite tall..." Patricia grasped at straws.

"Ask your precious daughter-in-law!" Tabitha sneered. "Over 190cm, designer suit, obviously wealthy. Textbook sugar daddy arrangement!"

The soup container crashed to the pavement.

By the time Evelyn awoke, the clock showed past ten. She reached for water, throat parched, then checked her phone. Nathan's seven AM message about his mother's visit made her frown.

Patricia should have arrived hours ago.

Worried about wrong bus stops, Evelyn dialed her mother-in-law's number.

"Sorry, the number you called is currently unavailable." The robotic response offered no comfort after prolonged ringing.
###Chapter 24

Evelyn dialed Nathan's number.

The same automated message played. "The subscriber you are trying to reach is currently unavailable."

A knot formed in her stomach.

She prayed nothing terrible had occurred.

Next, she tried Olivia.

Olivia answered breathlessly. "What's up, darling?"

Evelyn explained the situation.

"Maybe she got called to a last-minute mahjong game?" Olivia suggested. "You know how she keeps her phone buried in her bag during games. And Nathan's probably swamped with work."

Taking Olivia's words at face value, Evelyn tried to relax.

After hanging up, she stepped into the shower. The hot water revived her spirits somewhat. As she towel-dried her hair, her phone buzzed on the coffee table.

Nathan's name flashed on the screen.

"Hello?" She answered instantly.

Silence stretched before Nathan's icy voice came through. "Evelyn Sinclair, how many men have you been fucking behind my back?"

"What? That's insane!" The accusation blindsided her.

"Stop playing innocent!" His voice cracked with rage. "Who even are you? Some two-faced whore I've been stupid enough to trust?"

Evelyn's grip tightened around her phone.

"Tell me!" Nathan raged. "Am I just your safe option? Your pathetic backup plan? The gullible idiot you cheat on?"

Each word stabbed like icicles.

"Calm down. You're clearly mistaken about something." Her voice turned frosty.

"Mistaken?" A bitter laugh. "I was the fool for trusting you! I should've believed Sophia when she warned me overseas. She was right, wasn't she? You were spreading your legs for anyone who'd pay your tuition!"

His words weren't a question but a condemnation.

The man who'd pledged to marry her now shredded her reputation without proof.

Evelyn's hands trembled violently.

"All those times you claimed to be working?" Nathan sneered. "Bullshit. If you'd really been juggling jobs, where were the exhaustion signs?"

"Then what exactly do you think I was doing?" Her jaw clenched.

"You really want me to say it?"

"Spit it out."

"Fine. Six men in five years. Four married. They kept you as their little whore, funding your education in exchange for your body. You even aborted one of their bastards!"

Her heart shattered.

Hot tears blurred her vision as she stared at the engagement ring.

One week. That's all their engagement had lasted before he destroyed it with baseless accusations.

The man who'd sworn to protect her now publicly branded her a slut based on hearsay.

This betrayal cut deeper than any physical wound.

Nathan kept ranting, demanding to know about the "mystery man" neighbors had seen her with.

Evelyn ended the call mid-sentence.

Her phone rang again.

She let it.

No more words. No more explanations.

Not devastated. Just... exhausted.

Curling on the couch, she hugged her knees. Five years ago, Nathan had appeared like sunlight through storm clouds. He'd promised to clear her skies, to make her world bright again.

She'd believed him.

Like a fool.

Now the storm raged fiercer than ever, and she stood drenched and alone in the downpour.

She drifted into an uneasy sleep, only waking when hunger pangs became unbearable.

Grabbing her purse, she headed out for food. Maybe wandering the city would clear her mind.

The subway turnstile clicked behind her when someone grabbed her wrist.

"Little sister!" Sophia Montgomery beamed.

Nathan's words echoed: "I should've believed Sophia..."

This viper had poisoned Nathan against her.

Evelyn yanked her arm free. "Don't touch me!"

"Such hostility." Sophia smirked, following her onto the crowded train.

The doors closed.

"Mother wants you home for dinner," Sophia announced loudly.

Evelyn ignored her.

"Excuse me!" Sophia suddenly addressed a seated elderly woman. "Your foot's crushing my shoe!"

Tabitha, the neighborhood gossip, blinked up at her.

When she heard Sophia mention their shared mother, Tabitha withdrew her foot. "How old are you, dear?"

"Twenty-six," Sophia snapped.

Tabitha's eyes widened. "Goodness! You look at least thirty-five with a twenty-six-year-old daughter?"

The carriage erupted in laughter.

Sophia's face turned purple with rage.
###Chapter 25

Tabitha's wrinkled face twisted in disgust as she studied Evelyn's impassive expression.

"Just as I expected from a husband-stealer," she thought bitterly. "Ice runs through her veins. Her own flesh and blood is being humiliated, yet she doesn't even blink!"

Sophia Montgomery clenched her fists until her manicured nails dug into her palms. She should've saved that insult for this wretched girl instead!

The subway had just left East Gate station when Tabitha finally exploded. "Have you no shame, girl?" she spat.

Evelyn met the older woman's glare evenly.

Shame? For what?

She was morbidly curious what venom this unscrupulous hag would spew next.

"You tried stealing my seat earlier!" Tabitha accused, jabbing a bony finger. "At my age, I can barely stand! Yet you young things—too lazy to earn proper cars—come crowding public transport to rob elders of their rightful places!"

She puffed up like a proud peacock. "Thank heavens my son owns three luxury cars!"

Sophia straightened at that, barely concealing her smirk as she anticipated Evelyn's humiliation.

Other young commuters shifted uncomfortably. Many chose the subway for convenience, not poverty. But since the attack wasn't directed at them, they watched the drama unfold.

"I recently returned from studying abroad," Evelyn replied calmly. "My family isn't wealthy, so I worked multiple jobs to save money. I gave it all to my parents to buy a car—because filial children don't let their elders fight for subway seats."

Tabitha's face turned purple with rage.

The carriage erupted in laughter—this time at the old woman's expense. Would she now accuse her own son of being unfilial?

At the next stop, Tabitha shoved through the crowd and stormed off, unable to bear the mocking stares.

Sophia continued shadowing Evelyn.

Evelyn didn't head straight home. She wandered downtown, occasionally pausing to admire the architectural marvels.

She dreamed of one day designing a building that held real meaning.

After half an hour under the blistering sun, Sophia gave up. She shot Evelyn one last incredulous look—how could this woman stroll leisurely when she'd just lost her fiancé?

And why wasn't her flawless skin burning like everyone else's?

Hailing a cab, Sophia slammed the door with unnecessary force.

Evelyn stood transfixed before the city library. She snapped several photos from different angles, planning to study them later.

Only work could quiet her turbulent thoughts.

Back in her apartment, Evelyn dropped her bag and changed into slippers. She spent hours analyzing the architectural photos, working well past midnight.

Nathan Kensington hadn't contacted her all afternoon.

It wasn't until after her shower, when she was finally heading to bed, that her phone buzzed.

Three voice messages from Nathan.

Evelyn stared at the night sky through her window as she played the first one.

"You're the one who wronged me... So why am I drowning my sorrows?" Nathan's drunken voice slurred. "Where's my innocent Evelyn? What have you done with her? Give her back!"

The second message was worse. "I chased you for four years... We've dated for one... Why won't you... let me touch you?"

Evelyn listened to all three, hoping—praying—to hear him say "break up."

He never did.

It seemed she'd have to initiate it herself.

Her phone buzzed again. The new message was nearly incoherent, drowned in bar noise. "Stop pretending to be pure! I bet you're spreading your legs for every man behind my back! What kind of life did you really lead in the UK? You're no better than a—"

Evelyn's pulse spiked. She clenched her teeth and returned to her laptop.

Work. Only work could silence this madness.

But even as exhaustion blurred her vision, the questions persisted.

Why did Nathan trust Sophia over his own fiancée? Why believe some random gossip over the woman he claimed to love?

His faith in her was paper-thin.

The next morning, Evelyn exited the subway and walked toward her office building.

Sebastian Whitmore stepped out of a Bentley nearby, clutching a document folder. He'd been tasked with driving young master Alexander to English lessons when the boss urgently requested these files.

Inside the car, Alexander swung his short legs—then froze.

"Miss Evelyn!" He'd been worrying about her since their last encounter. Now here she was!

The boy tossed his bag aside and leaped from the car.

Evelyn, running on two hours of sleep, barely registered the shadow blocking her path until she looked up.

Nathan Kensington stood before her, bloodshot eyes and disheveled clothes betraying his all-night bender.

"Move," Evelyn said flatly.

"I came to apologize for last night," Nathan said through gritted teeth. "But now you're the one giving me the cold shoulder?"

Evelyn studied him like a stranger.

What twisted delusions made him imagine his fiancée had betrayed him—not once, but countless times?
###Chapter 26

Nathan's eyes darkened as he scrutinized Evelyn from head to toe. "At sixteen, you were soft. Vulnerable. Now? You're nothing but thorns. Defensive spikes that shoot out the moment someone sees through you."

Evelyn absorbed his words, each one a fresh wound. Yesterday's accusations still echoed in her mind.

Nathan had a gift for cruelty.

His words were daggers, shredding her heart until it bled.

She was done.

"Work starts soon," Evelyn said flatly, stepping past him.

Nathan seized her wrist, yanking her back. His eyes burned. "We're not finished. How can you just walk away?!"

Olivia rushed out, frantic. "Nathan, stop! Let her go!"

Evelyn's low heels offered no stability. The sudden jerk twisted her ankle. Pain shot up her leg, but she refused to flinch.

She wrenched free as Olivia pried at Nathan's grip.

Then—Evelyn ripped off her ring and hurled it at his face.

Her voice was steel. "We're done. Today."

She kept it steady. No cracks. No tears.

If she wavered, she lost.

For five years, Nathan and Sophia Montgomery had played their parts perfectly.

Olivia once warned Nathan to stay away from Sophia. He swore there was nothing between them.

Now? The truth was clear.

Evelyn had been the fool.

Across the courtyard, Sophia lounged by the fountain, smirking into her compact mirror as she watched the drama unfold.

Evelyn refused to look weak.

The ring struck Nathan's nose. He caught it, staring at the band like it was a betrayal. When he finally met her eyes, his voice cracked. "Done? Just like that? I'm in agony, and you say it like it's nothing?"

"Both of you, stop." Olivia's gaze darted between them.

Evelyn's laugh was ice. "I'm calm because I know the truth."

"That's all you have to say?!" Nathan's fists clenched, trembling.

"You stopped trusting me. Nothing I say matters now." She turned, ignoring the throbbing in her ankle.

Nathan lunged after her.

Olivia grabbed him. "This is work! Do you want to humiliate her in front of everyone? Think, Nathan!"

Evelyn's throat tightened. Olivia was right.

Her past was a shadow she couldn't escape. If Nathan snapped, he'd drag it all into the light.

Where was the rational man she once knew?

He knew how much reputation meant to her after what happened five years ago. Yet he'd weaponized it.

"You believe Sophia over Evelyn?" Olivia spat. "What is she to you? Are you really that stupid?"

Nathan watched Evelyn walk away, fists shaking.

The flowers. Sophia's lies. That nosy neighbor, Tabitha.

His voice was raw. "I trusted her once. Never again."

Evelyn entered the building, head down, thoughts chaotic.

A small voice chirped, "Miss Evelyn!"

Alexander Blackwood clung to her leg, grinning up at her with wide, innocent eyes. "I waited forever! Now I caught you!"

Evelyn scanned the lobby. No one seemed to recognize the CEO's son.

"Why are you here?" she whispered, trying to detach him.

Alexander only tightened his grip. "Miss Evelyn, your eyes are red."

Sebastian Whitmore descended the stairs, scanning the lobby. The young master had vanished.

Security footage revealed the boy on the first floor—hugging Evelyn's leg.

Sebastian called her.

"Miss Sinclair, could you bring Alexander to the top floor? Mr. Blackwood is... displeased."

Evelyn stiffened. "Can't you come down?"

A pause. Then—"Actually, just stay there."

Sebastian's tone shifted.

A minute later, Dominic Blackwood emerged from his private elevator.

Evelyn's pulse spiked. "Your father's here. Let go."

The boy refused.

Dominic's large hand closed around his son's wrist.

Alexander's grip on Evelyn's thigh meant Dominic's fingers brushed her skin—smooth, bare, warm.

Before being led away, Alexander blinked up at her. "Miss Evelyn, does it still hurt where Daddy hit you?"

Evelyn froze.

Hit her?

The boy clarified, "You were bad, so he spanked you, right? He said you cried..."

Heat flooded her cheeks. "I—I'm fine! It doesn't hurt!"

She bowed stiffly to Dominic, putting distance between them.

His gaze dropped to her bare left hand.

A slow, knowing smirk curved his lips.
###Chapter 27

Evelyn walked back into the design department.

She'd shaken Nathan off downstairs, but she'd still have to face him at their workstations.

At least their desks were far apart.

Abigail Thornton watched Evelyn sit down and immediately checked her reflection, sighing. "We both pulled an all-nighter on that business trip. How come you look flawless while I've got these dark circles?"

One of their female colleagues leaned over anxiously. "What eye cream do you use, Evelyn?"

Evelyn blinked awkwardly. "I... don't use any."

"Seriously?!" The colleague gasped. "Are you some kind of goddess? No dark circles after staying up all night? We should just dump all the overtime on you!"

Abigail set her mirror down with a teasing smirk. "Don't bully Evelyn. Her boyfriend Nathan's right here to protect her!"

The office buzzed with envy.

But Abigail noticed something off—both Evelyn and Nathan seemed tense.

Later, exhausted, Evelyn grabbed her mug for coffee. Abigail followed.

Once they were alone in the pantry, Abigail checked the hallway before whispering, "Did you and Nathan fight?"

They'd bonded during their H City trip. To Evelyn, Abigail wasn't just a senior colleague—she actually cared about the new hires.

"We broke up."

Abigail froze. "But you were fine on the drive back! What happened?"

Evelyn stirred her coffee silently.

"Okay, you don't have to talk about it." Abigail backtracked, feeling awkward. "Couples fight. Give it a few days—"

Evelyn shook her head sharply.

Abigail didn't push further. They weren't close enough for deep personal talks.

At lunch, Abigail wanted to invite Evelyn out, but Olivia Kensington got there first. Fine—Olivia was Nathan's sister. Maybe family could help.

Walking to the cafeteria, Olivia groaned. "I don't know what's wrong with my idiot brother. Why would he believe that witch Sophia?"

Evelyn forced a laugh. "It doesn't matter."

The strained sound made Olivia bristle. "Don't give up so easily! If that bitch wants to play games, we'll play dirtier."

Evelyn's phone rang—Vivienne Laurent, head of design.

"Gotta take this," Evelyn whispered.

Olivia nodded, heading to order food. She knew Evelyn's favorites by heart. When Evelyn returned, two lunches waited.

Evelyn sat and picked up her chopsticks. "I have to eat fast. Vivienne's sending me on another assignment."

"Another trip?!" Olivia shrieked.

"Not this time." Evelyn swallowed a bite. "Some director's daughter is visiting. Higher-ups want her well entertained. Abigail and I are on welcoming duty."

Olivia stabbed her rice. "Newbies get all the grunt work. Abigail loves sucking up, but why drag you into it? If she gets promoted, do you get a cut?"

She tapped Evelyn's bowl warningly. "Don't take any crap. If she's rude, call me. I'll tear her apart."

Evelyn wolfed down her food. "Gotta run." She vanished before Olivia could protest.

The company sent a car to fetch Penelope Worthington from the airport.

Penelope emerged—petite but towering in 20cm heels. Her Chanel ensemble and limited-edition Hermès bag screamed wealth. With her jewelry, her outfit cost over a million.

Abigail muttered, "Her dad's a government official. Isn't she worried about corruption scandals?"

Penelope approached the car.

Evelyn greeted her politely. "Good afternoon, Miss Worthington."

Penelope's flippant "Afternoon!" dripped with disdain as she eyed their professional attire. Peasants.

Sebastian Whitmore was driving, but Penelope treated him differently—probably because she'd researched Dominic Blackwood's inner circle.

She insisted on sitting upfront to chat with Sebastian. Evelyn and Abigail sat silently in back.

Penelope leaned toward Sebastian. "Mr. Whitmore, does Mr. Blackwood have a girlfriend? I never see women around him."

Sebastian smiled tightly. "I wouldn't know about Mr. Blackwood's private life. You should ask him directly."

Penelope huffed but dropped it.

Evelyn stared out the window until Sebastian added casually, "Men like Mr. Blackwood are... intense. They don't fall easily, but when they do, it's for life. If his woman betrays him?" He chuckled darkly. "She'd better pick out a graveyard plot and urn in advance."

Evelyn couldn't see Penelope's reaction.

But her own blood ran cold. Love or death? What kind of twisted obsession was that?
###Chapter 28

They arrived at the heart of the city.

Sebastian tightened his grip on the steering wheel. "Miss Worthington, shall I drop you at your hotel or the shopping district?"

"Neither." Evelyn applied the final touches to her lipstick before snapping it shut. "I'm meeting a friend for lunch."

Sebastian nodded. "Have you chosen a restaurant? If not, I can arrange reservations anywhere you'd like."

If Blackwood Enterprises was an empire, then Dominic was its sovereign ruler—and Sebastian, his most trusted chancellor. The man answered to no one but Dominic himself.

No wonder Evelyn felt invincible with such power at her disposal.

"We already have reservations." She named an exclusive five-star restaurant.

The car glided smoothly toward its destination.

Ten minutes later, Sebastian pulled over. "We're here, Miss Worthington."

"Thank you." Evelyn grabbed her designer bag and tossed her chestnut waves over one shoulder. Before exiting, she pointed lazily at the backseat. "You. Come with me."

Sebastian's jaw tightened imperceptibly. Her arrogance was becoming intolerable.

Evelyn, however, seemed oblivious—or simply didn't care.

Penelope Worthington was the epitome of a spoiled heiress. She probably felt incomplete without an entourage trailing behind her.

Oddly, she hadn't ordered Abigail to accompany her. Perhaps because Abigail's resting expression resembled a storm cloud.

Evelyn, on the other hand, looked far more... manageable.

Evelyn stepped out onto the pavement.

Sebastian drove off without a backward glance.

"Follow me." Penelope glanced at Evelyn as if she were a stray puppy before strutting ahead without another word.

A hundred meters away stood the glittering hotel where Penelope had booked their lunch.

Evelyn's phone buzzed with a message from Abigail:

"Our job is to monitor her, not worship her. Be civil if she is. If she's not? Don't bend."

Penelope whirled around. "Why are you lagging? Keep up!"

Evelyn slipped her phone into her bag.

The private dining room Penelope had secured was obscenely lavish. Her guest hadn't arrived yet, so Penelope settled in to touch up her makeup.

Evelyn took a seat on a nearby sofa, her posture relaxed.

Then Penelope's phone rang.

She answered with a saccharine voice that instantly turned venomous. "Where the hell are you? Keeping me waiting? You worthless little—"

Evelyn froze. So this was the "friend" Penelope had invited—someone she addressed with such charming endearments.

"Your mother? Ugh, I hate dealing with elders." Penelope sighed dramatically. "Fine. Bring her along."

Twenty minutes later, the door swung open.

Evelyn rose automatically—only to lock eyes with Victoria Montgomery and Sophia Montgomery.

Every drop of blood drained from her face.

Politeness? Unnecessary.

Victoria and Sophia gaped at her in shock.

"Do you... know each other?" Penelope's gaze darted between them, sensing the tension.

Victoria recovered first, beaming at Penelope. "You must be Penelope! Sophia's told me so much about you. My, you're even more stunning in person—that porcelain skin, that figure! I heard you were the campus queen abroad, outshining even the local beauties!"

Penelope preened under the praise, accepting it as her due. She even allowed Victoria to clasp her hands without protest.

Sophia smirked, pleased at how effortlessly her mother had charmed Penelope.

"Mrs. Montgomery, Sophia, join me here," Penelope cooed.

Sophia sauntered over but paused beside Evelyn. "What are you doing here?"

"Enjoy your lunch." Evelyn's voice was ice. "I need the restroom."

She walked out without another word.

"How do you know her, Penelope?" Victoria's voice carried after her.

"Oh, I don't," Penelope said quickly. "I'm in A City to meet my fiancé. She's just some employee from his company—assigned to carry my bags and fetch my drinks."

Evelyn strode down the corridor, their voices fading.

She knew exactly the kind of character assassination Victoria and Sophia would launch. After years of enduring it, their words barely registered anymore.

Anger only fed their delight.

Back in the room, Sophia hesitated before mentioning Evelyn.

Penelope snapped. "Spit it out, Sophia! Don't you dare hide things from me!"

"Tell her!" Victoria urged. "Penelope's too pure-hearted. She needs to be warned!"

Penelope's eyes narrowed dangerously. "Warned about what?"

Sophia feigned reluctance. "Penelope... your fiancé's company employs Evelyn Sinclair, right? I'm just... worried."

"Worried? Why?" Penelope's voice sharpened. "Her last name is Sinclair? I never asked before. Why does she share your surname?"

Sinclair wasn't common. Two Sinclairs who knew each other? Suspicious.

"I won't lie. Evelyn is my stepsister." Sophia glanced at her mother, eyes welling with fake tears. "My mother paid for her education abroad, but she spent it seducing wealthy men. Her reputation is... tarnished. I'm terrified she'll set her sights on your fiancé next."

Penelope slammed her palm on the table. "That bitch dares to target my man?"

"Don't underestimate her." Sophia sipped her tea calmly. "Her birth mother was a homewrecker—stole a married CEO, destroyed his family. Her father warned us to watch her closely. The apple doesn't fall far."

"I'll ruin her now."

Penelope leaned in, whispering, "You know the club scene, right? Get me those... special drugs within thirty minutes. Money's no object. And find me the filthiest, most desperate man you can."

Sophia's eyes gleamed with hidden triumph. "Drugs? Why?"

Penelope's smile was venomous. "I want to set her body ablaze with lust. Film her on her knees, begging. Then broadcast it to the world."
###Chapter 29

Sophia looked stunned. "But... She's my little sister..."

Victoria had been navigating high society for decades. She'd seen every dirty trick women played on each other. The moment Penelope lifted her gaze, Victoria immediately understood what the girl was plotting.

Penelope hissed at Sophia through gritted teeth, "Stop protecting that little slut! She's a cancer that needs cutting out immediately. You and your mother already wasted enough on her - overseas education, lavish allowances. More than she deserved! All she knows is stealing other women's men!"

"I'm warning you, she means nothing to me. This is necessary to protect my relationship!" Penelope stormed back to her seat.

Sophia pretended to agonize over the decision until Penelope's patience snapped. Only then did Sophia make the arrangements.

...

After exiting the private dining room, Sophia first checked the hallway.

Confirming she was alone, she slipped into an alcove and dialed a number.

The line rang endlessly before a gruff voice answered. "The hell you want?" Vincent Mercer sounded irritated.

"Took you long enough," Sophia snapped. "Were you busy dying between some whore's legs?"

Vincent's laugh was rough. "Spit it out already."

Sophia's fingers tightened around her phone. This was her chance. "I need the strongest stuff you've got. Something that'll make a saint beg for it within minutes."

"When?"

"Now. Get here in twenty." She rattled off the five-star hotel's address before he could protest. "I'll pay twenty grand. Cash."

The mention of the luxury location silenced Vincent's doubts. Rich bitches at fancy hotels always paid. "Be there in fifteen."

"Hurry! And Vincent?" Sophia's voice dropped. "You haven't had action in a while, right? She's all yours tonight. Do whatever you want with her."

"Now you're speaking my language."

...

When Sophia returned, Evelyn still hadn't come back from the restroom.

"Done," Sophia texted Penelope. "My contact wants a hundred thousand for the rush job."

"Money is irrelevant," came Penelope's instant reply.

Evelyn finally reappeared, her complexion alarmingly pale.

"You're back! Sit, sit." Penelope's sudden warmth was jarring. "I had no idea you're Sophia's sister! I wouldn't have dared approach you otherwise."

"I'm not feeling well," Evelyn said stiffly. "I should leave."

Victoria and Sophia exchanged panicked looks. Their prey was slipping away!

"Oh no you don't." Penelope grabbed Evelyn's wrist. "We're practically friends now. I'll need your help keeping those gold-diggers away from Dominic."

Evelyn pulled back. "I'm just a junior designer. I barely interact with Mr. Blackwood." She needed to distance herself from Dominic immediately. Penelope Worthington wasn't someone to cross.

"But you know his habits, his schedule." Penelope forced Evelyn back into her chair. "Tell me everything."

Sophia exhaled in relief as Evelyn sat. Tonight, they'd eliminate Evelyn for good.

Vincent Mercer was perfect for the job - a walking disease at thirty-two, recently diagnosed with AIDS. Sophia couldn't wait to infect Evelyn with the same curse. That would destroy her permanently!

After several minutes of strained conversation, Evelyn tried leaving again.

Victoria played her trump card. "Evelyn, have you contacted your father recently?"

Evelyn froze. "How... how is Dad?"

"Not well. The doctors aren't optimistic." Victoria had carefully severed all contact between Evelyn and Robert Sinclair during those five years abroad. Now she watched satisfaction as Evelyn's defenses crumbled.

When the food arrived fifteen minutes later, Sophia excused herself.

Returning, she saw untouched drinks and casually distributed them - juice for Penelope, then Evelyn. As she handed Evelyn her glass, she discreetly emptied the hidden vial into it.

"To your father's health," Penelope raised her glass. "Let's toast with juice instead of wine. And Evelyn, promise you'll keep those vultures away from Dominic!"

Distracted by thoughts of her father, Evelyn clinked glasses absently and took a sip.

"What's Dad's new number?" Evelyn asked desperately.

Victoria smirked. "He changed it. I'm waiting for his call too."

Evelyn's hands clenched. How convenient that her stepmother suddenly couldn't reach him! Anger made her throat dry. She drank again.

"I should..." Evelyn began, then gasped. Fire exploded through her veins, burning through reason.

Sophia watched, breathless, as Evelyn clawed at her collar, her pale skin flushing. Even Penelope stared, realizing how dangerously alluring Evelyn looked in her drugged state - that porcelain skin, those swollen lips, every movement radiating desperate sensuality.

If even Penelope felt tempted, what man could resist?

Evelyn shook her head violently, fighting the haze. Seeing Sophia and Penelope's predatory excitement, understanding dawned.

She grabbed her purse and bolted.

Sophia immediately called Vincent. "She's heading downstairs! Intercept her at the entrance! Ten grand if you break her tonight. Another ten if you infect her. Move!"
###Chapter 30

"Burning up... I'm on fire..."

"Why does this hurt so much? Ugh..."

With trembling fingers, Evelyn Sinclair punched the elevator buttons. The doors finally slid open after what felt like eternity.

Thank God it was empty!

Evelyn collapsed against the mirrored wall as the elevator descended. Her cheeks burned crimson, soft whimpers escaping her parted lips despite her efforts to stay silent.

The elevator halted at the seventh floor.

A young man stepped inside - probably a college student judging by his casual outfit and boyish face. He couldn't have been older than nineteen, though his height surpassed six feet.

"Are...are you alright?" His voice cracked when he noticed her flushed state. The sight clearly startled him.

"Stay...away." Evelyn gritted her teeth. Every fiber of her being screamed at her to close the distance between them.

The drug turned her thoughts to liquid fire. She felt adrift at sea, desperate for any anchor. And for some insane reason, this stranger's presence called to her primal instincts.

The boy's ears turned red under her heated gaze. Though she was undeniably beautiful - all soft curves and intoxicating femininity - he instinctively backed away.

"Should I call an ambulance?" He fumbled for his phone, genuine concern in his voice. "You look really sick."

Evelyn's mind warred with itself. One part wanted to throw herself at this boy. The other screamed that this wasn't her - it was the drugs talking!

Ding.

The elevator reached the lobby.

As the doors parted, a towering silhouette blocked the exit.

"Let me help you to the hospital-" The boy reached out, but before his fingers could brush Evelyn's arm, an invisible force slammed him against the mirrored wall. The impact knocked the air from his lungs.

When his vision cleared, he saw the mysterious woman cradled against a broad chest.

Even from behind, the newcomer radiated power. His tailored suit hugged an athletic frame, the polished shoes alone costing more than the boy's tuition. But more than his appearance, it was the aura of danger that made the boy freeze.

This man wasn't to be trifled with.

Outside, Vincent Mercer scoured the hotel lobby.

Where would a drugged woman run?

This was his golden ticket - money for sleeping with her, even more if he infected her. The thought alone made his pulse race. Opportunities like this didn't come often.

"Did a woman come through here?" Vincent leaned against the reception desk, trying to sound casual. "Probably drunk? Flushed face, acting strange?"

Dominic Blackwood's head snapped up at the question.

The receptionist shook her head. "Haven't seen anyone like that."

Vincent muttered curses as he headed for the stairs. "Did she hide in some bathroom?"

Dominic carried Evelyn away unnoticed. Vincent glimpsed only the man's imposing back - and knew better than to look closer. Men like that spelled trouble.

A black sedan idled at the curb. Sebastian Whitmore waited inside, but Dominic bypassed the car entirely. No one could see Evelyn like this - not even his most trusted aide.

She writhed in his arms, all soft whimpers and wandering hands. Each touch ignited fresh fire along his skin.

The decorative Ferris wheel near the hotel - owned by Blackwood Corporation - became their destination. Access required a code.

Evelyn trembled violently as Dominic dialed Sebastian. "The Ferris wheel password. Now."

"49270166." Sebastian knew better than to ask questions. "Should I-"

"Investigate who Evelyn Sinclair interacted with today." Dominic's voice turned glacial. "Someone drugged her. I want answers."

Evelyn slumped against Dominic's chest, seeking relief from his cooler body temperature. A breathy sigh escaped her when she found it.

"Hold me...please..." Her plea came out in a desperate moan.

Dominic gripped her chin, forcing her glassy eyes to meet his. "Do you recognize me?"

"You're..." Her words dissolved into incoherent whimpers. The drugs had obliterated rational thought, leaving only raw need. "Please...I need..."

She was unraveling before him.

Dominic fought his body's response as she mewled like a kitten in heat. When he didn't comply, she rose on tiptoes, pressing her overheated body flush against him.

"I'm...burning up...help me..." Her breath scorched his neck.

Dominic's hand tightened on her waist. "What exactly do you want me to do?" His voice dropped to a dangerous rasp.

Evelyn's fingers clawed at his shirt, her lips finding his throat. When she sucked lightly, his entire body tensed.
###Chapter 31

Dominic's entire body tensed.

A familiar heat pooled in his groin, sending blood rushing to his head. His breathing became ragged.

Evelyn's intoxicating beauty always captivated him.

"Ah!"

Suddenly, she was weightless in his arms again as he lifted her effortlessly.

Carrying her toward the Ferris wheel, Dominic gritted his teeth against her wandering hands and the feather-light kisses she trailed along his throat. Her lips kept finding the hollow of his collarbone.

Evelyn didn't recognize this man. She barely remembered her own name. Primal instincts drove her actions - this was the only relief from the unbearable fire consuming her.

The agony was unbearable.

Please, someone end this torment.

Her desperate fingers found the third button of his shirt.

The top two buttons were already undone. With a sharp tug, she ripped the third one clean off.

His sculpted chest was revealed, radiating raw masculine power.

"Enough!" Dominic growled, shooting her a warning glare. He punched in the security code with one hand while restraining her with the other.

The Ferris wheel door slid open.

He carried her inside as the cabin began its ascent.

Evelyn gasped. His deep voice sent shivers down her spine.

The door sealed shut behind them.

Worried she might fall, Dominic carefully lowered her onto the bench seat.

When he tried to pull away, her limp arms coiled around his waist like vines.

Dominic froze.

"I'm burning... please..." Her whimper was barely audible.

Millions of ants seemed to crawl beneath her skin whenever the contact broke.

"Just endure it. Stay still." His voice was thick with restraint. He couldn't look at her - one glance might shatter his control.

"I'm dying..." Her breathing came in ragged gasps. Why wouldn't anyone help her?

Despair washed over her as she rubbed her cold shoulders, tossing her hair to relieve the unbearable heat. She writhed against the seat...

Dominic's jaw clenched. Watching the cabin rise, his body betrayed him despite his iron will.

"I need... please..." Her incoherent pleas were punctuated by soft moans.

His phone rang.

Sebastian's professional tone reported: "Mr. Blackwood, the suspects are detained. However, there's a mother-daughter pair connected to Miss Sinclair."

Dominic's voice turned arctic. "I don't care who they are. Handle it."

"But..." Sebastian hesitated. "Penelope Worthington was with them..."

"Arrest her too." His tone could freeze hell.

After hanging up, Dominic turned - only to find Evelyn's condition had worsened.

Her legs rubbed together desperately beneath her ruined pencil skirt. The once-professional garment now clung indecently, the slit at the back revealing too much.

Dominic was no saint. Five years ago, they'd shared countless passionate nights. Now, at the peak of his virility...

He knew exactly what she needed.

When Evelyn slipped a hand beneath her skirt, Dominic swore violently. He seized her wrist. "Don't."

A man's touch. Evelyn's eyes flew open, rationality gone.

She launched herself at him, her floral scent overwhelming his senses.

"You're drugged," he rasped in her ear. One hand cradled her neck, the other stroked her hair. "If I take you now, will you regret it later? I'll take responsibility."

She nuzzled against him like an affectionate kitten.

"Wha...?" She couldn't comprehend his words, only the unbearable thirst.

Her lips traced his sharp jawline, his perfect nose, finally finding his mouth. Her soft curves pressed against him relentlessly.

Dominic saw red.

Her cry of surprise was swallowed by his brutal kiss. It felt like he wanted to break her apart and absorb her into his very being.

Tears streamed down her face as pleasure overwhelmed her. Shame forgotten, she straddled him shamelessly.

Her mischievous fingers tugged his shirt free from his waistband.

Dominic caught her wrists. "Do you know what you're playing with?" he warned darkly.

"I want it... ah!" She was pinned beneath him again, but her hands refused to stay still.
###Chapter 32

"Do you enjoy this?" Dominic's voice was husky as he lifted Evelyn from the bench in one swift motion, his movements urgent and rough.

Her body collided with his solid chest, the impact knocking the breath from her lungs.

It took her a moment to realize she was now trapped in his unyielding embrace.

"I'll make sure you love it even more." With that promise, Dominic pinned her against the glass window of the Ferris wheel cabin. High above the city, his lips claimed hers—soft, demanding, intoxicating.

The cool night air contrasted sharply with the heat of his touch.

A quiet moan escaped her as he deepened the kiss, his tongue teasing hers.

Unable to resist, her hands slid around his waist, gripping the fabric of his shirt.

When she responded, Dominic groaned, his lips parting further, guiding her into the rhythm he set.

Evelyn's fingers trailed up his torso, settling on his broad shoulders. Her body arched instinctively, craving more of him.

Her tongue tangled with his, both of them lost in the desperate need between them.

Only when she gasped for air did he finally pull back—but not for long. His lips found the delicate shell of her ear instead.

His breath scorched her skin as he nipped at her earlobe.

A whimper tore from her throat.

Her cheeks burned with desire. His shirt was half undone, the fabric wrinkled from her desperate grip.

As his mouth trailed down her neck, teeth grazing her collarbone, pleasure shot through her, leaving her trembling.

His heartbeat pounded against her chest, his breathing ragged. Every inch of him was pure temptation, eroding her last shred of control.

"Please..." she begged shamelessly, tears welling in her eyes.

Dominic bit down gently on her collarbone before pulling away slightly, his own restraint fraying.

With one hand tangled in her hair, the other worked at his belt, the metallic clink loud in the quiet cabin.

Then—

A sharp vibration cut through the moment.

Dominic ignored it, too consumed by the woman in his arms.

The phone rang again.

Growling, he yanked it out, his expression darkening at the caller ID.

Sebastian Whitmore.

His jaw clenched. Without hesitation, he tossed the phone aside, letting it clatter to the floor.

His lips crashed back onto hers, his hands roaming possessively—

Then the damn phone rang again.

Sebastian gripped his phone tighter, his brow furrowed. He'd lost count of how many times he'd called.

Eight? Nine?

Finally, the line connected.

"Apologies, Mr. Blackwood," he said carefully, "but this couldn't wait. We found the bottle in the hotel trash. The lab results came back—this drug is dangerous. Any woman who takes it cannot engage in intercourse. If she does—"

"What happens?" Dominic's voice was ice.

Sebastian swallowed hard. "She could hemorrhage."

Even through the phone, the threat in Dominic's silence was palpable.

"Send a doctor. Now."

Back in the Ferris wheel, Dominic forced himself to put distance between them.

But Evelyn whimpered, reaching for him.

"Stay still," he ordered, voice strained. "Unless you want to get hurt."

She sobbed, frustration and need warring inside her.

The doctor wouldn't arrive for another twenty minutes.

Dominic couldn't stand her tears. His usual iron control wavered.

If he couldn't take her, he could still give her something.

His lips captured hers again, swallowing her cries.

Her body melted against his, the heat between them unbearable.

Dominic's hands roamed, reducing her to a trembling mess—

Sebastian, ever efficient, got the doctor there in fifteen.

Evelyn was handed over, her body limp from the medication.

Sebastian stood stiffly, watching Dominic's thunderous expression.

Definitely unfulfilled.

The doctor administered a sedative, and Evelyn finally stilled.

Dominic turned away, lighting a cigarette with sharp, controlled movements.

Sebastian waited until the cigarette was done before daring to speak.

"Should I arrange for you to see a doctor as well, sir?"

Dominic exhaled sharply. "Call her friend. She'll stay with her at the hospital."

Evelyn woke to a dry throat and unfamiliar surroundings.

She turned her head, blinking at Olivia beside her.

"How... are you feeling?" Olivia asked hesitantly.

Evelyn frowned, taking in the sterile hospital room.

"What happened?"

"You don't remember?" Olivia bit her lip. "Sophia Montgomery drugged you. With an aphrodisiac."

The word sent a jolt of humiliation through Evelyn.

Her mind raced, grasping at fragments—spiked juice, burning heat, running...

But after that?

Nothing.
###Chapter 33

Evelyn stared at Olivia. Her hands trembled as she whispered the terrifying question. "Tell me... did I do something unforgivable?"

She swallowed hard before adding, "And... were there any men involved?"

Olivia shifted uncomfortably. "I can't say for sure. I wasn't with you when the drugs took effect. The doctors only contacted me after they'd stabilized your condition."

Evelyn's breath hitched at the revelation.

Someone had called medical professionals for her.

She pressed her palms against her temples, desperately trying to recall. After several tense minutes, she murmured, "There was a guy in the elevator... I think he mentioned taking me to the hospital?"

"That must be what happened." Olivia visibly relaxed. "I was terrified someone might have... you know. I even called back, but a female doctor answered."

The confirmation eased some of Evelyn's panic.

"Water?"

"Of course!" Olivia hastily grabbed a glass and helped her drink.

Then she reached for the fruit basket.

Evelyn's gaze dropped to the enormous banana Olivia offered.

Her cheeks burned crimson.

Was this a lingering drug effect? Vivid, inappropriate images flooded her mind - a man frantically unbuckling his belt...

"No thanks." Evelyn shoved the fruit away with more force than necessary.

Olivia shrugged and started peeling it. "More for me then. Starving here."

Evelyn gaped as her friend took a bite. Those unwanted visions returned with vengeance.

"Another glass! Now!"

She pressed icy fingers to her flaming cheeks. The drugs had clearly scrambled her brain.

What was wrong with her?

Olivia held the banana between her teeth while pouring water.

Evelyn gulped it down, praying for mental clarity.

"The police arrested both Sophia Montgomery and Penelope Worthington," Olivia reported between bites. "No updates yet, but now that you're awake, they'll probably question you soon."

"They actually got arrested?"

Evelyn hadn't expected justice to come so swiftly. Women like Sophia usually escaped consequences, their victims too ashamed to press charges.

She'd been mentally preparing her revenge plan.

"You should rest more," Olivia suggested, eyeing her pale complexion. Then with a mischievous grin: "Thank God you're not male - you might've literally died from overexertion!"

Evelyn glared.

Footsteps approached, followed by a familiar voice thanking someone. The private ward's acoustics carried every sound clearly.

"Is that Mr. Sinclair?" Olivia whispered, recognizing Robert Sinclair's voice before Evelyn could react.

Evelyn scrambled up.

She hadn't seen her father in months.

But the moment her feet touched the floor, an uncomfortable wetness made her freeze.

"Something wrong?" Olivia steadied her.

Evelyn couldn't answer. If she were male indeed...

No time to change now.

Robert entered with Victoria Montgomery trailing behind.

"Evelyn, you're awake." His shoulders sagged with visible relief.

Evelyn steeled herself against the pang in her chest, focusing instead on her stepmother. "Why aren't you in handcuffs too?" She refused to believe Victoria was innocent.

Victoria clutched Robert's sleeve like a frightened child.

"Evelyn," her father chided. "Mind your manners. She's still your elder."

The words stabbed like ice.

Anyone would think Victoria was his first wife, Sophia his biological daughter.

And Evelyn? Just some inconvenient orphan.

"Glad you're alright." Robert's wrinkled brow furrowed deeper as he patted her shoulder. "Your stepmother spoiled Sophia rotten. Bad influences corrupted her. She's not evil at heart!"

Olivia's jaw dropped at the absurd justification.

Evelyn's laugh was razor-sharp. "I trust the police to handle this. I don't control law enforcement."

Victoria's face twisted. "You're perfectly fine! No missing limbs! Even if Sophia made mistakes, must you destroy her future?" Her voice cracked theatrically. "Kevin, what do we do?"

Evelyn watched the performance coldly.

"We only live once. Why should I suffer for her crimes? Does she deserve protection while I don't?" Snatching her clothes, she headed for the bathroom. "I need to shower. Leave."

"How dare you! I regret marrying into this wretched family!" Victoria's shrieks followed her. "After all my kindness, this is how you repay me?"

The shower drowned out the tantrum.

Olivia's sarcastic retorts carried through the door. "Stop screeching, you hypocrite! Keep it up and you might stroke out!"

Soon, blessed silence returned.

By evening, Olivia left after her parents called.

Alone, Evelyn found strange freedom in having nothing left to lose.

At six, her phone rang.

She froze mid-outfit change when she saw the caller ID.

Dominic's deep voice sent shivers down her spine. "Are you alone?"

"N-no... someone's here..."

A ridiculous hope flickered - that he'd visit if she said yes.

Pure delusion.

"Really?" His voice sounded unnervingly close. "Good. I wouldn't come if you were alone. Improper for a man and woman to be unchaperoned."

The door swung open.

Evelyn gasped. There stood Dominic in his impeccable suit, taking in her half-dressed state.

Her bare skin flushed pink, chest rising rapidly under his gaze.

She'd literally dug her own grave.
###Chapter 34

Evelyn spun around instantly, scrambling to cover herself with the hospital gown. But it was too late. Dominic Blackwood had already seen everything.

"Why are you alone?" His deep voice sliced through the tense silence.

Her lie had been exposed. Evelyn froze, her fingers clutching the thin fabric.

"I meant someone would come later... not that they were here now..."

Dominic's dark eyes swept the empty room before returning to her. "The police called me. How are you feeling?"

Penelope Worthington had been arrested, but too terrified to involve her father. So she'd given them Dominic's contact instead.

Evelyn's mind reeled.

Those piercing black eyes held hers captive.

"I'm... fine..." Heat flooded her cheeks at the thought of her CEO discovering she'd been drugged with an aphrodisiac.

"Sebastian arranged your leave. Rest well."

"Thank you... please thank Mr. Whitmore for me..."

She couldn't meet his gaze.

Suddenly, Dominic closed the distance between them.

Evelyn stumbled back until her shoulders hit the wall. Her eyes dropped instinctively to his waist, then darted up to the defined muscles straining against his dress shirt.

Her breath hitched as he caged her in, his towering frame overwhelming.

Dominic braced his arms on either side of her head, leaning down until his breath warmed her lips. "Are you afraid of me?"

His masculine scent enveloped her - crisp cologne laced with tobacco. Dangerous. Intoxicating.

Her pulse hammered as she forced the words out. "Yes. This isn't appropriate..."

"You feared me, yet lured me here? I can't tell when you're lying." His velvet voice dripped with accusation.

Evelyn's head snapped up. "I never—"

"You said someone was here when I asked. I specifically warned against being alone together."

She had no rebuttal.

Dominic traced her bottom lip with his thumb. "This lie brought me to your room. Doesn't that make you the seductress?"

Evelyn watched his finger with dazed fascination, her body betraying her with tremors. "You misunderstood..."

This was all wrong.

She'd never expected the formidable Dominic Blackwood to personally visit. Now every protest sounded hollow.

She'd lied. She'd been half-dressed. The evidence stacked against her.

Yet she remembered how he'd pinned her against her kitchen wall. A true gentleman would have apologized and left when he saw her undressed.

The silence stretched, amplifying her racing heart.

"I need to rest..." She pushed against his chest, but he didn't budge.

"What do you want?" Her eyes glistened with unshed tears. "If you touch me, I'll call the police."

Dominic's hot breath fanned across her flushed skin. "What do I want? You. Is that clear enough?"

His vulgar words struck like physical blows.

Heat pooled low in her belly as their bodies pressed together. Even through layers of fabric, his heat seared her.

Her struggles only intensified the friction between them.

Tears welled in her eyes as she pleaded silently.

Dominic's darkened gaze showed no mercy. He captured her lips in a searing kiss that left her boneless.

Evelyn had never burned like this.

"No..." She turned her face away, fighting the haze of desire.

Dominic claimed her mouth again, his tongue plundering with possessive intensity.

She tasted his dominance, his control. It terrified her.

Jason's warning echoed in her mind - those who betrayed Dominic Blackwood should pick out their urns in advance.

This was her first intimate contact since that night five years ago. Even then, she hadn't been kissed like this.

Dominic's lips trailed down her neck, drawing soft moans from her throat. The wet sounds of his mouth on her skin sent fresh waves of heat through her.

She blamed the lingering drugs for her weakness.

For five dizzying minutes, she surrendered. Then reality crashed back.

Terrified, she bit down hard.

The metallic tang of blood filled her mouth.

Dominic pulled back, his lust-darkened gaze burning her. A flush colored his sharp cheekbones as he rasped, "Careful. You might get pregnant swallowing my blood."

Her entire body ignited with shame.
###Chapter 35

Footsteps echoed down the hallway.

"Miss Sinclair, is Mr. Blackwood with you?" Sebastian Whitmore's professional voice carried through the door.

Evelyn's breath hitched as she turned toward the sound.

"Daddy?" Alexander's voice piped up.

The moment he'd heard Miss Evelyn was hospitalized, the boy had rushed over. Now he stood bouncing at the threshold, but Sebastian held him back.

"Let me in!"

"Shh." Sebastian pressed a finger to his lips.

The assistant maintained a respectful distance. As a professional, he knew better than to witness anything inappropriate between his boss and the woman.

"Daddy?" Alexander raised his small fist to knock.

The door swung open before he could. Dominic Blackwood glared down with icy eyes.

How dare Daddy visit Miss Evelyn without him! Alexander ignored his father's expression and dragged in an oversized fruit basket and stuffed animal. He launched himself at Evelyn. "Miss Evelyn! Are you feeling better?"

Evelyn's smile froze. Heat still lingered on her cheeks.

Sebastian caught Dominic's subtle nod and discreetly exited.

Dominic turned his glare toward his son, now receiving head pats from Evelyn. "Stop clinging to her. She needs rest."

Alexander immediately released her.

"You should lie down, Miss Evelyn..."

Evelyn shot Dominic an exasperated look. The man who'd kept her up all night had no right to talk about rest.

Dominic's sculpted features remained impassive as he strode into the bathroom and locked the door. The exhaust fan whirred to life, followed by the distinctive click of a lighter.

"Miss Evelyn, does Daddy's smoking bother you?"

She shook her head.

"Do you have a fever?" Alexander set down his toy and pressed one hand to Evelyn's forehead, the other to his own. "You feel warmer than me."

Evelyn nodded. "A little."

She certainly couldn't explain she'd been hospitalized due to... certain pharmaceutical effects.

Alexander pushed the gifts toward her. "I brought fruits and this teddy because Isabella says girls heal faster with stuffed animals."

"You're so thoughtful." Evelyn couldn't resist pinching his cheeks.

Spending time with father and son had revealed stark contrasts.

One was considerate and kind.

The other was domineering and selfish.

Would Alexander develop properly under such influence?

Noticing Evelyn's frown, Alexander followed her gaze to the bathroom door. "Daddy's actually nice," the boy declared, scrunching his face in concentration. "Sure, he's moody and obsessive about weird things. He hates most people and only eats seven specific foods. But deep down, he's good."

From the bathroom came the sound of a cigarette being crushed with unnecessary force.

Evelyn moved to the mini-fridge. "Would you like some water?"

The appliance was nearly empty - just a half-finished bottle remained. She poured the last into a glass.

Alexander gulped it down instantly.

Evelyn stared at the empty bottle.

"I'm totally full now!" the boy announced, patting his stomach with transparent falsehood.

Children's lies were endearingly obvious. Evelyn checked the clock - 7:30 PM. She needed to end this visit before boundaries blurred further.

After ruffling Alexander's hair, she approached the bathroom door. "Are you finished?"

Silence.

"I need to use the facilities." Her dismissal couldn't be clearer.

Still no response.

Evelyn's cheeks burned as she recalled what awaited inside. Earlier, she'd showered and left her lace underwear soaking. The delicate garment with its strategic cutouts wasn't something she could casually replace.

Worse, the evidence of her... episode... remained clearly visible on the fabric.

There was no way Dominic hadn't noticed.

Gathering courage, Evelyn pushed the door open.

Dominic's smoldering gaze locked onto her. "Out!" he growled.

"Sorry! I-" She slammed the door shut, heart pounding.

"Was Daddy peeing?" Alexander asked innocently, looking up from his homework.

Evelyn's face flamed.

The image was seared into her mind - Dominic standing at the toilet, belt undone, cigarette dangling from his lips while he...

How would she ever sleep tonight?

That visual would haunt her forever.

"Girls can't watch boys pee. Naughty!" Alexander stuck out his tongue.

Evelyn wished the floor would swallow her. To be chastised by a child about adult matters...

Her legs trembled as she retreated to the farthest corner of the room.
###Chapter 36

Evelyn's legs had gone numb from crouching on the cold tiles for so long when she finally heard the sound.

Dominic's deep voice carried through the bathroom door, rough with post-release satisfaction. "You can come in now."

Biting her lower lip, Evelyn swallowed her embarrassment and pushed herself up, opening the door once more.

Dominic's gaze was unreadable when their eyes met.

She couldn't hold his intense stare for more than a second before looking away.

The man looked impossibly put together. His tailored suit was flawless, every button perfectly aligned. Not a single strand of his dark hair was out of place.

It was as if the heated moments before had never happened - as if she'd imagined the whole thing.

When she moved to enter, his muscular frame blocked the doorway.

His intoxicating masculine scent surrounded her, making her pulse race.

"Let me through," Evelyn murmured, staring at the floor.

Dominic's jaw tightened. He stepped aside, his shoulder brushing hers as he passed.

Evelyn took a shaky breath and entered the bathroom.

Before closing the door, she glimpsed Dominic approaching Alexander from behind. The boy barely glanced up from his homework, completely absorbed in his task.

Both father and son seemed to have mastered the art of emotional detachment.

First they'd invaded her home. Now they'd commandeered her hospital room - the child studying while the adult... took care of himself...

Evelyn shook her head, refusing to dwell on that thought.

She was at her breaking point.

After putting away her undergarments, she leaned against the tiled wall, furious with herself. The humiliation burned through her.

She kept making a fool of herself.

By day, he was the untouchable CEO of a corporate empire. She was just another faceless employee, not even working directly under him.

Yet behind closed doors, they shared moments like this. The cognitive dissonance made her head spin.

Everything Dominic did screamed that he wanted her.

Evelyn massaged her temples with a heavy sigh.

Just then, she heard small footsteps approaching.

"Miss Evelyn, your phone's ringing! It's your dad..." Alexander's sweet voice came through the door. "I... I accidentally answered it. He said he's your father."

She opened the door to accept the phone from the boy.

Dominic stood by the window, impeccably dressed in his three-piece suit. He was examining the empty fruit basket before moving to the equally bare refrigerator.

"Dad?" Evelyn closed the bathroom door for privacy.

Alexander pouted thoughtfully before returning to his homework.

Robert got straight to the point. "Evelyn, I'm begging you this one time! Drop the charges against Sophia!"

"Is that really why you called?" Evelyn's hand trembled around the phone. The disappointment cut deep, her eyes stinging with unshed tears. "It's not personal. The law is the law. Who am I to change that?"

Robert's tone turned harsh. "If it's not personal, why is Sophia still in custody? I heard another girl named Penelope got released because she had connections. They tried to get Sophia out too, but the police said the victim needs to withdraw the complaint!"

Evelyn wanted to explain that she hadn't even called the police. She hadn't seen any officers or given any statements.

But now she was profoundly grateful to whoever had made that call.

Her father's coldness made her pause before responding hoarsely, "Am I not your biological daughter? Sophia drugged me. Do you have any idea what could have happened if I hadn't escaped? She tried this same despicable trick overseas too! She only stopped abroad because she got scared, but now that we're back home, she's at it again. She's the one who needs to learn a lesson, not me. What did I do wrong?"

Silence.

"I can't remember the last time we had a real father-daughter talk. These past five years abroad changed everything between us. How did we get here? I don't understand..."

Her throat tightened. "What shocks me more is that after everything, my own father cares more about Sophia's arrest than his daughter's wellbeing."

"Sophia hadn't even been detained a full day before you came rushing here with Victoria to plead her case. I was so happy to see you at first... until I realized the truth."

"You've been in the city this whole time. You never traveled for work. Yet you avoided seeing your own daughter for over a year, even changed your number... Who would believe something so absurd?" Her voice broke.

In the room, Dominic placed headphones over his son's ears.

The boy worked faster with music, though his father had always said headphones were bad for children. So why allow them now?

Dominic frowned toward the bathroom.

Evelyn forced her voice steady. "I used to blame Victoria - thought she'd manipulated you into cutting ties with me. But now I see the truth..."

"I've always wanted your marriage to be happy, as long as Victoria truly loved you..."

She hung up.

Sliding down the wall, she buried her face in her knees, muffling her sobs.

Outside, Dominic reached for the door handle. He wanted to pull her into his arms, but remembering the fragile state of their relationship, he withdrew his hand.

She wouldn't want his comfort.

Turning to his son, he removed one headphone. "Finish your work. Then we'll take Miss Evelyn shopping."

The boy's face lit up with excitement.

When Evelyn emerged fifteen minutes later, both males were dressed to go out.

Relief washed over her, though she maintained polite composure. "Leaving? Let me see you out."

Her emotions were in tatters. She desperately needed solitude.
###Chapter 37

Alexander opened his mouth to speak, then hesitated. He glanced warily at his towering father behind him before turning back to Evelyn with a firm shake of his head.

"No, we're taking you to the department store."

"The department store? Why?"

The question left her lips before she remembered—the fridge was empty. No bottled water. The boy must have noticed and worried she'd have nothing to drink.

"I can just boil water. We don’t need to go."

What she really needed was for them to leave. Now.

But Alexander dug his heels in. "Nope. I’m scared you won’t have food or drinks..."

Helpless, Evelyn shot Dominic a pleading look. Parent your child, please.

Instead, the man ruffled his son’s hair and said mildly, "Lex might insist on staying the night if we don’t get you supplies."

Evelyn had no rebuttal.

If fate had to tether her to a Blackwood, she’d take Alexander’s occasional visits—a fleeting taste of warmth, of motherhood she’d lost. A balm for the ache.

But Dominic? She prayed their paths would never cross again.

Two weeks in his orbit had already painted a target on her back—Penelope Worthington, the heiress who didn’t understand consequences. What worse disasters awaited if she stayed entangled with him?

Clutching her wallet, Evelyn followed the father-son pair out of the hospital in her borrowed off-white dress.

Dominic led, his stride effortless. She hung back—a sparrow trailing a dragon. The mismatch was glaring.

The store stood just outside the hospital gates. No need for the car.

As they walked, Evelyn felt eyes on her. Passersby glanced, then lingered on the man ahead—like he’d stepped off a Forbes cover.

At the entrance, she grabbed a cart.

Dominic kept looking back, ensuring she followed. Noticing the cart, he frowned. "I’ll push it."

"I’ve got it."

"Every other man here is doing it." His tone brooked no argument. Before she could protest, his palm cradled the back of her head while his other hand claimed the cart.

Evelyn scanned the store. True—husbands pushed carts for wives. But she wasn’t his anything.

Yet arguing here? Futile.

With a quiet sigh, she took Alexander’s hand and trailed behind Dominic’s broad frame, hyperaware of every T Corporation employee who might spot them.

The mineral water aisle came first. Dominic loaded a crate before she could blink.

Ahead, chocolate bars glinted under fluorescent lights. Evelyn’s gaze flickered toward them—then away.

Alexander, however, froze mid-step, eyes locked on the snack aisle. "Dad... chips? Just one bag this month?"

Dominic’s attention snagged on Evelyn’s lingering glance at the chocolate.

"Miss Sinclair gets first pick. She’s sick," he said, tousling his son’s hair.

"Okay!" Alexander chirped, logic accepted.

Evelyn’s cheeks warmed. This... indulgence unnerved her.

Three girls passed by. One gasped, whispering, "Holy hell, a man who pampers his woman like a princess? And that face—I’d melt on the spot."

Evelyn’s flush deepened.

The cart now overflowed with chocolates. Her protests were ignored.

Alexander pouted. "Why does Miss Sinclair get all the chocolate and I only get chips?"

Dominic wheeled the cart away without answering.

Evelyn wished the floor would swallow her.

Then—disaster.

Dominic stopped dead in the lingerie section.

Evelyn’s stomach dropped.

He tugged her closer, voice low near her ear. "Saw you needed these."

Her face burned. He knew. About the ruined underwear from the aphrodisiac incident.

"My friend brought me new ones," she mumbled, fleeing with Alexander in tow.

Night air prickled Evelyn’s skin as they walked back. Dominic’s silhouette stretched long under streetlights.

Exhaustion and embarrassment left her shaky.

A sneeze ripped through her. Then another.

Alexander scrambled for tissues.

Dominic set down the bags, shrugged off his coat, and—before she could refuse—draped it over her shoulders from behind, one hand briefly steadying her waist.

"Thank you," she whispered, enveloped in his warmth and scent.

He didn’t reply, just reclaimed the bags and walked on.

Evelyn clutched Alexander’s hand, staring at Dominic’s retreating back.

And hated herself for the treacherous thought:

This feels like safety.
###Chapter 38

The hospital room felt unnaturally quiet when Evelyn returned.

She stared at the shopping bags for what felt like an eternity before finally forcing herself to brush her teeth.

Dominic and Alexander didn’t linger long after that.

Once she was cleaned up, Evelyn changed into her pajamas and sank into the sterile white hospital bed. Her fingers twisted the sheets restlessly. Sleep refused to come.

She tossed. Turned. The silence pressed in on her.

Her eyes stayed wide open.

For the first time in her twenty-four years, someone had given her a coat without hesitation when she was cold.

She couldn’t deny the warmth that flickered in her chest at the memory.

Dominic led his son out of the hospital, heading for the car.

They barely made it past the first traffic light before he rolled down the window and lit a cigarette. The ember glowed between his fingers as he exhaled, his sharp gaze fixed ahead.

"Dad," Alexander piped up from the backseat, his small voice hesitant. "You always say it’s rude to listen to other people’s calls. But you told me to answer Miss Evelyn’s phone..."

Dominic took another drag. Silent.

Alexander fidgeted. "We didn’t even ask her permission..."

Dominic flicked ash into the tray. "I had you answer so you could check if it was someone dangerous calling her."

"Oh." The boy blinked, processing.

Evelyn spent the night in the hospital.

Morning came with the doctor’s visit—a week of rest, no late nights.

"Thank you, Dr. Grant," Evelyn murmured.

The doctor packed her instruments.

"Can I recover at home instead?" Evelyn asked. The hospital fees were exorbitant, and Sebastian had arranged this room.

The meal with Penelope Worthington had been work-related, so the company covered her stay.

Still, she hated hospitals.

"Of course. I’ll prepare your medication." Dr. Grant nodded politely before leaving.

Evelyn had been hospitalized before, but never treated so kindly.

She skipped lunch, rushing through discharge paperwork.

On the subway home, Olivia called. Evelyn assured her she was fine.

"About my brother—" Olivia started.

"Oh, my stop’s here. Talk later." Evelyn cut her off.

She and Nathan were over. Whether they could be friends again? That was up to fate.

Her lower back ached—a lingering effect of the drugs.

At home, she changed the sheets, showered, and collapsed into bed.

A thunderclap jolted her awake.

Darkness. Rain hammered the windows.

She fumbled for the lights.

The doorbell rang.

"Who is it?"

"Me." Dominic’s voice, low and rough.

Through the peephole, she saw him—drenched, holding a sealed bag of medicine.

She’d forgotten to pick it up.

Guilt twisted her stomach as she opened the door.

Dominic handed her the dry medicine, his clothes soaked.

"Why didn’t you use an umbrella?" she asked.

"Can I come in?"

She stepped aside.

He toed off his shoes. "Didn’t think about the rain until it was too late."

She bit her lip. The storm had started with that thunderclap.

Dominic, dripping but composed, tilted his head. "Mind if I shower here?"

She hesitated.

He headed for the bathroom.

"Should I dry your clothes?" she called after him.

He turned, nodded, his gaze dark.

She looked away.

When he stripped off his coat, his wet shirt clung to his torso, outlining every muscle.

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

She fled to the kitchen, swallowing her pills with water.

Forty minutes later, she’d washed, dried, and ironed his clothes.

Dominic emerged in just a towel, water sliding down his chest.

Evelyn kept her eyes firmly on the floor.

He stood at the balcony, smoking silently.

Then he was behind her, voice rough. "Done?"

She handed him the warm clothes. "Yes."

His breath brushed her cheek. "Thanks."

The doorbell rang again.

Evelyn froze.

Dominic didn’t react.

She peeked through the peephole—Nathan, umbrella in hand, leaning against the wall, cigarette dangling.

Her stomach dropped.

She couldn’t let him see Dominic here.

"Evelyn, open up!" Nathan slammed his fist against the door.

A neighbor yelled at him to quiet down.

"Mind your own business," Nathan snarled.

The neighbor retreated.

Dominic moved toward the door.

Evelyn grabbed his arm. "Please, don’t go out there."

He frowned. "Am I that embarrassing?"

That wasn’t it.

Nathan’s key turned in the lock.

Dominic spun her around, crushing his lips to hers.

The kiss was punishing, possessive.

She gasped.

Nathan’s voice came from the other side of the door. "Evelyn, we need to talk."

She shook her head, pleading.

Dominic pinned her wrists, his other hand sliding under her nightgown.

His fingers traced her inner thigh.

A moan escaped her.

The storm outside drowned nothing.
###Chapter 39

Nathan's footsteps approached the bedroom door. His fingers closed around the doorknob.

He twisted it forcefully. The lock held firm.

Dominic had secured it from inside. The flimsy mechanism wouldn't withstand much pressure.

Evelyn's pulse hammered in her throat. Her face went deathly pale.

The man's scorching kiss silenced her protests. Desperate eyes pleaded with him as she shook her head.

Dominic claimed her mouth relentlessly, his tongue plunging deep. When he finally withdrew, his darkened gaze burned with unchecked desire.

His stubbled jaw scraped her cheek. Their heated bodies pressed together as his iron grip pinned her wrists. His other hand slid lower, applying unbearable pressure.

"Please...stop..."

Her knees buckled. Disoriented, she stumbled forward into his unyielding embrace.

"Let me go...don't..."

Tears welled as she forced the whisper past trembling lips.

Nathan refused to give up outside.

When the door resisted, he assumed Evelyn was sulking. Alcohol always made him lose control.

He lit a cigarette to calm his frayed nerves. The rising smoke only deepened his agitation.

The doorknob rattled violently as he wrestled with the lock.

Finally, Nathan ground out his cigarette. "Evelyn Sinclair!" he bellowed. "You think a locked door stops me? Remember - you're still my fiancée!"

Pain lanced through Evelyn's chest.

Regret flooded her. Dating Nathan had been a mistake. Trusting any man had been foolish. Believing in happiness? Naïve.

Those were the errors of a weaker woman.

Dominic acted as if they were alone in the universe. His entire focus centered on conquering her trembling form.

His wandering hand gathered the hem of her nightgown. The fabric slid upward until most bunched in his fist.

Evelyn struggled silently, terrified of alerting Nathan.

She couldn't bear both men seeing her like this.

The humiliation would destroy her.

"Look at you," Dominic growled between kisses. "Dressed like this - you knew exactly what you were doing."

His rough palm found her damp heat.

Her traitorous body betrayed her.

With only a door separating them, Evelyn stifled her cries against Dominic's mouth. Tears spilled over as his fingers worked ruthlessly.

She felt like prey caught in a trap.

This wasn't some seduction attempt.

Alone, Evelyn rarely wore nightclothes. Today's ankle-length gown was her most modest - worn only because she'd napped earlier.

She never expected this invasion.

Dominic didn't care for explanations. He'd already convicted her of temptation.

Nathan's back thudded against the door. "I know you're there, Evelyn. Can you feel me? You still love me-"

"Enough!" She squeezed her thighs together, writhing against the door.

Dominic broke the kiss, fury blazing in his eyes as he studied her tear-streaked face.

She couldn't scream. Couldn't make this worse. Men might brush this off, but a woman's reputation...

His commanding presence overwhelmed her. That unshakable aura demanded obedience.

"Turn around." The order vibrated with dark promise.

Five years ago, she'd surrendered to another man's demands. The memories still haunted her.

She shook her head mutely.

Words wouldn't stop him. Nothing would.

Evelyn was tired of being everyone's puppet.

If he violated her today, she'd press charges. No more compromises.

First, she'd lived for her father's approval. Then for Nathan's. Now both had betrayed her.

Losing everything brought unexpected freedom.

With nothing left to lose, she could finally stand tall.

No more caring what anyone thought.

"You'd rather have that madman outside?" Dominic sneered before capturing her lips again.

The chaste kiss surprised her. Before she could react, he spun her around.

Her back pressed against his chest.

One powerful hand pinned both wrists above her head against the wall.

He yanked up her nightgown, baring her from waist to shoulders.

Dominic's breath hitched at the exposed skin. His mouth trailed fire down her spine.

A moan escaped before she could stop it.

As Dominic fumbled with his zipper, Nathan felt the door shift.

"Are you crying?" Guilt laced his voice. The thought of Evelyn weeping on the other side twisted his gut. "Answer me!"

He cursed himself for reducing a woman to tears.
###Chapter 40

"Answer him. Are you crying?" Dominic's gravelly voice vibrated against her bare back.

His lips trailed fiery kisses up her spine, each one more deliberate than the last, until his teeth grazed her earlobe. "Tell me, Evelyn. Are those tears?"

A thunderclap shook the apartment windows, lightning illuminating their tangled silhouettes against the door.

"You're an animal!" Evelyn gasped, arching away from his tormenting mouth.

Dominic chuckled darkly, nipping at her sensitive skin. "In public, I'm every inch the gentleman. But behind closed doors? I'm your personal beast."

His calloused thumb circled her navel with agonizing slowness, the rough pad of his finger sending electric shocks through her nervous system.

Evelyn writhed, her back pressing flush against the door as she tried to escape the sensation. The movement only served to grind her hips against his growing hardness.

Outside, Nathan's pleading voice cut through the storm. "I lost control that night, Evelyn. My mother called me worthless trash for letting you slip away! When Tabitha told us you'd brought a man home..." His voice cracked. "Those imported roses... I could never afford such extravagance."

Dominic's hands tightened possessively around Evelyn's waist as Nathan continued his drunken confession.

"My mother already thought of you as her daughter. What mother wouldn't rage seeing another man sneaking into her future daughter-in-law's apartment?"

The only response was the rhythmic thud of bodies against the door. Nathan misinterpreted the sound as sobs.

"Come out when you're done crying. Just apologize to my mother and we can—"

Evelyn's entire world narrowed to the heat of Dominic's body pinning her against the door, his relentless hands mapping every inch of exposed skin.

She squeezed her eyes shut. Before tonight, she'd never so much as held Dominic Blackwood's hand. That argument in the courtyard had been their only interaction.

Yet here she was, trembling beneath his touch while Nathan poured his heart out through the door.

Dominic's teeth scraped her shoulder as his fingers dipped lower. Evelyn's breath hitched.

"No...oh God..."

Her knees buckled. Dominic caught her effortlessly, turning her to face him in one fluid motion.

Shame burned through her at the hunger in his darkened eyes. Even as Nathan pounded on the door, demanding answers, her traitorous body arched toward Dominic's touch.

"Still shaking your head?" he growled against her swollen lips. "Your body says otherwise."

A particularly violent kick rattled the doorframe. "Who the hell is in there?" Nathan roared. "Open this door!"

Dominic's expression darkened. In one swift movement, he hauled Evelyn toward the bed, her protests dying in her throat as his mouth claimed hers again.

The pristine white sheets contrasted sharply with Evelyn's flushed skin as Dominic pinned her beneath him.

"Get out!" she gasped, pushing weakly at his chest.

Nathan's enraged shouts grew louder. "Adulterous bitch! I'll break this door down!"

Dominic's grip on her ankle tightened as he dragged her toward him. The door shuddered under another brutal kick.

Evelyn's vision blurred as pleasure and panic warred within her. The last coherent thought she had was that the door wouldn't survive another impact.

Neither would she.
###Chapter 41

Evelyn's humiliation knew no bounds.

Never in her wildest dreams had she imagined Nathan would call her such vile names.

Dominic's grip on her delicate ankle was unrelenting. She recoiled, her mouth bitter with fear as those predatory crimson eyes devoured her.

His rough handling left angry red marks on her porcelain skin.

"Stop!" she gasped.

Thud!

Thud!

Nathan's kicks shook the door violently.

The wood splintered under the assault. Evelyn's already pale face drained of all color, her fingers clutching the sheets.

Trapped between the enraged man and the crumbling door, she suddenly found her lips captured in a searing kiss.

A commotion erupted outside.

Evelyn's world narrowed to Dominic's scorching breath and the sinful sounds of their entanglement.

Outside the bedroom.

Nathan spun around to face four uniformed officers and a security guard entering through the open door.

"Come with us!"

Nathan glared at the intruders. "Since when do cops interfere in lovers' quarrels?"

"Trespassing complaint," an officer stated firmly, gripping his arm.

Evelyn heard every word through the thin door.

Dominic had released her moments earlier.

Now she burrowed beneath stifling covers, sweat trickling down her neck despite the storm outside. The air hung thick with their unfinished passion.

She didn't understand why he'd stopped. Maybe some shred of decency remained in that ruthless man.

The bedroom window stood open.

Dominic leaned against the frame, lighting a cigarette with practiced fingers. After a deep drag, he dialed a number.

"Bring Dr. Grant. Same address. Now."

Under the suffocating blankets, Evelyn puzzled over his words. Why summon her physician? And what did he mean by "same address"?

The police intervention remained a mystery too. Probably Dominic's doing - he always had contingency plans.

Finishing his cigarette, Dominic turned to find her still hidden.

Rain pounded the windows as he strode over and yanked the covers away.

Evelyn scrambled back. "What now?"

Instead of anger, his voice softened. "Clean up. Dr. Grant's coming."

She blinked in confusion.

"You're bleeding." Guilt shadowed his features.

Evelyn's mind blanked.

She knew exactly what kind of bleeding he meant. The kind that had made even this beast pause mid-assault.

"What...how?"

Panic rising, she clutched the sheets tighter. A crimson smear the size of a coin stained the bedding.

In the heat of the moment, between Dominic's advances and Nathan's violent intrusion, she'd noticed nothing.

Now the sight chilled her.

Just over twenty-four hours since the aphrodisiac incident. Dr. Grant's warning echoed in her mind - potential infertility in worst cases.

Dominic said nothing, just studied her before exiting to the wrecked living room. Furniture lay overturned, cigarette ash scattered everywhere.

Evelyn inhaled deeply. She'd be fine. Just fine.

A dull ache in her lower back was her only discomfort. That had to be positive, right?

Grabbing clean sleepwear, she retreated to the bathroom.

The shower lasted ages. She scrubbed until her skin burned, then collapsed on the tiles, hugging her knees.

Only Dr. Grant's arrival forced her out.

"Let's examine you in the bedroom," the physician suggested.

Twenty minutes of probing questions left Evelyn alternating between pallor and blushes. The humiliation was excruciating.

"Early menstruation from overstimulation," Dr. Grant concluded, scribbling a prescription. "Herbal supplements three times daily. Complete abstinence for one month."

Evelyn's face burned crimson.

The middle-aged doctor delivered the instructions matter-of-factly before nodding to Dominic and departing.

Sebastian waited outside, taking the medical bag with a respectful nod to both before escorting Dr. Grant out.

As the elevator doors closed, Evelyn blocked Dominic's path. "You should go now."

Guilt gnawed at him. He'd faced near-amputation years ago without this level of dread. Her wellbeing consumed him entirely.

"Really leaving? Your body begged for more earlier," he taunted, icy composure returning.

Evelyn glared. "How dare—"

Dominic seized her chin, his whisper turning her ears scarlet. "That was just foreplay, darling. Imagine what the main event would do to you."
###Chapter 42

Dominic's departure left Evelyn standing frozen at the doorway, her fingers gripping the frame until her knuckles turned white.

He wasn't wrong. Neither was Dr. Grant's diagnosis. But Evelyn couldn't decide if her own reactions were justified. Her traitorous body had completely undermined her defenses.

Few women could remain indifferent to a man of Dominic Blackwood's caliber.

Yet when confronted with such an extraordinary man, most women would instinctively measure themselves. They'd question their worthiness, calculate the risks.

Only someone like Penelope Worthington could possibly match his stature.

Evelyn knew her place. That's why she'd maintained such rigid boundaries. But today, when Dominic had pressed her with such relentless intensity, her body had surrendered before her mind could protest. It felt alien - this responsive flesh that didn't belong to her anymore.

"Your body speaks truths your lips deny." The phrase reeked of chauvinism, yet Evelyn couldn't deny its painful accuracy tonight.

She despised this version of herself.

Detested how easily her body yielded to his demanding touch.

Sleep proved impossible.

First came the humiliating task of changing the soiled sheets. Then her restless mind kept replaying every moment while her cramping body twisted in discomfort.

At Blackwood Manor...

Alexander perched on the second-floor landing, watching his little sister Isabella sip milk with unusual solemnity. "Slow down, Bella."

Reginald Blackwood entered from the gardens, scanning the room. "Your father hasn't returned?"

Isabella shook her head, leaving a milky mustache above her lip.

"Not at the office either." Julian Blackwood lounged on the leather sofa, phone discarded beside him. "Perhaps brother's found himself a stray."

"A stray?" The old man leaned heavily on his cane, perplexed. His eldest grandson maintained fastidious standards.

Why would Dominic keep a pet outside when the manor grounds offered ample space?

Alexander's eyes gleamed mischievously. After wiping his sister's face, he bounded to his uncle. "Does Father really have a dog now?"

He'd always wanted one!

"You children and grandfather wouldn't understand. I meant my brother may have found himself a...companion." Julian barely caught himself before using cruder language in front of the children.

One vulgar word and their grandfather would cane him senseless.

This time, the generational gap collapsed as understanding dawned on Reginald's face.

The old man sank onto the sofa, cane tapping thoughtfully against marble. Dominic wasn't getting any younger. While he had heirs, the absence of feminine companionship...

A man had needs.

Reginald recalled the Worthingtons' insistent marriage proposal earlier that day. Director Worthington demanded his daughter marry into the Blackwoods, but now his grandson might have taken a mistress.

What tangled webs.

Dawn broke clear after the rain.

Evelyn rose early, grateful for her unexpected week off. She pocketed Dr. Grant's prescription and headed out.

The department store stood conveniently near the subway station. Weekday crowds were thinner than Sunday's bustle.

Evelyn selected brown sugar first, then fresh ginger. As she reached for sanitary products, a hesitant voice called, "Evelyn...Evelyn Sinclair?"

She turned to see a woman at the opposite end of the aisle. The stranger hesitated before rushing forward with a shriek. "It is you!"

Evelyn barely had time to react before being crushed in a suffocating embrace.

When the woman finally released her, tears glistened in her eyes. "Remember me? Middle school, back row? My mother taught English - she tutored you!"

Evelyn nodded. "Cassandra Blake."

"You remember!" Cassandra's usually boyish demeanor melted into sentimental tears.

They'd shared three years of classes and clandestine cup noodles. An ordinary friendship, except for Evelyn - the perpetual bullying victim. Cassandra had been her sole ally, her teacher's daughter status offering protection.

After completing their purchases, they left together. Evelyn invited Cassandra to her apartment.

"My mother's leg condition brought us here two years ago," Cassandra explained as they walked.

Her parents' amicable divorce after her father's affair with a younger colleague was old news. Evelyn knew Cassandra had taken her mother's surname in elementary school.

"How is Mrs. Blake now?" Evelyn asked, genuinely concerned. The kind teacher had left lasting impressions.

Rumors said Mrs. Blake once privately tutored a certain elite high school student named Blackwood too...

Back then, "Senior Blackwood" existed only as a distant silhouette in Evelyn's mind - untouchable, irrelevant.

Now, meeting Dominic forced comparisons. Similar features, but the gulf between a teenage boy and a powerful man proved vast.

"Amputation," Cassandra admitted after a pause, voice heavy.

Evelyn offered comfort, but Cassandra shook it off.

At Evelyn's door, Cassandra suddenly brightened. "Mom's birthday next weekend! You must come - we're gathering old classmates."

Old classmates.

The phrase should warm hearts, but Evelyn recoiled internally. Schoolyard trauma ran deep.

Cassandra, oblivious, continued, "Mom checked the register last night - you're the only one who never attended reunions. Others come regardless of status - deliverymen to CEOs."

Evelyn's mind returned to Senior Blackwood...

If he attended this year, she might finally solve the mystery of Dominic's identity.
###Chapter 43

It made no difference whether they were identical or not. Evelyn Sinclair was determined to attend this reunion.

Not for her former classmates. Not for that senior whose face she could barely recall. Only for the teacher who'd shown her such kindness - Mrs. Blake.

Now that she knew about the event, skipping it wasn't an option.

Noon at Blackwood Estate.

Dominic Blackwood hadn't taken three steps inside before his grandfather started trailing him. "You're not getting any younger," the old man nagged. "When will you settle down? What's your type, anyway?"

Dominic ascended the stairs in silence.

Undeterred, Reginald Blackwood followed, leaning heavily on his cane. That ungrateful grandson of his had no respect for elders whatsoever.

"Curvy? Fair-skinned?" the old man pressed, convinced he knew his grandson's preferences.

Dominic entered his bedroom, shedding his coat and carelessly discarding his tie.

"I heard Director Worthington's daughter is visiting," Reginald continued. "Why haven't you introduced her? If he hadn't called me personally, I'd be completely in the dark!"

"Why would I?" Dominic's icy retort cut through the sound of running water. "She's nobody important."

The old man's eye twitched. Message received - his grandson had zero interest in the Worthington heiress.

Downstairs, Julian Blackwood nearly bit into a blood peach when his grandfather's cane jabbed his back.

"What was that for?" Julian whirled around.

"Sit," Reginald commanded with unusual gravity.

Julian glanced between the stairs and his grandfather's stern expression before reluctantly complying. "What's wrong?"

"Keep tabs on your brother," Reginald ordered. "Find out about this woman he's seeing."

Julian's eyes nearly bulged from their sockets. "You want me to spy on Dominic? Are you trying to get me killed?"

Their conversation halted abruptly as Dominic descended the stairs, freshly showered.

Julian studied his brother with open curiosity. What kind of woman could make his ice-cold brother stay out night after night?

Dominic settled at the dining table with a newspaper.

Ten minutes later, Margaret Lockwood came downstairs as Beatrice Lockwood returned home.

Lunchtime at the Blackwoods.

Dominic's phone rang.

"What is it?" he answered without looking up from his paper.

Sebastian Whitmore was mid-bite when he remembered an item on his boss's schedule. "Mr. Blackwood, your high school teacher's birthday is next weekend. Will you be attending? If not, I'll arrange your flight to America."

As expected, Dominic declined.

He'd attended once before. The endless flattery and empty compliments had bored him to tears. Since then, he'd sent prearranged gifts and made a personal call.

Mrs. Blake had been just his teacher. But when he'd been forced to leave town years ago, he'd entrusted her with a special request.

She'd fulfilled that duty impeccably.

That alone earned his lifelong gratitude.

The annual call followed its usual script - too busy to attend, work commitments, etc.

"Focus on your career," Mrs. Blake advised. "That's what matters most for a man."

Just before hanging up, she added, "You might not know this, but I'm quite pleased - remember Evelyn Sinclair? That bullied girl? My daughter ran into her today and invited her to the reunion. She seems to be doing well, thanks in part to you."

Dominic's grip on the phone tightened. He hadn't anticipated Evelyn's attendance. "That's...good to hear."

"You're a good man. Karma will reward you." The line went dead.

Reginald watched his grandson's expression darken inexplicably. Three minutes ago, he'd been perfectly composed.

"Lunch is ready," the old man announced.

Dominic didn't seem to hear. Frowning, he pulled up Sebastian's number - then immediately canceled the call.

He'd nearly canceled his America trip over a woman? The realization startled him. Why did she matter so much?

Especially when she played games, never speaking her mind, always keeping him guessing.

Cassandra Blake stayed at Evelyn's apartment all morning before leaving.

Evelyn walked her to the subway entrance, watching until she disappeared into the crowd.

At the neighborhood gates, Patricia Kensington stood scanning the area.

Evelyn had no choice but to approach. Hiding wouldn't solve anything.

Patricia's gaze locked onto Evelyn, fury rising. She'd been ringing Evelyn's doorbell earlier with no answer. But Evelyn had to come home eventually.

"Aunt Kensington," Evelyn greeted politely.

SMACK!

Patricia's palm connected sharply with Evelyn's cheek. "Don't call me that! Each time you do, it shaves years off my life!"

Evelyn touched her stinging cheek, then lifted her chin. "If you have something to say, say it. Otherwise, I'm going inside."

"How dare you speak to me like that?" Patricia's eyes turned razor-sharp.

"I'll match your energy," Evelyn replied coolly before turning away.

She maintained minimal respect for her elder. But only just.

Patricia's temper exploded. She chased after Evelyn, grabbing her collar from behind and yanking her backward. "You little witch! What did my son ever do to you? He caught you cheating, and you had your filthy boyfriend throw him in jail! Where's the justice?"
###Chapter 44

Patricia Kensington was completely out of control. She yanked Evelyn Sinclair back and forth, ruining her perfectly styled hair.

Sharp nails dug into Evelyn's neck, leaving angry red marks. The sting from earlier still burned across Evelyn's cheek.

Patricia gripped Evelyn's hair like a vice, screaming, "Women like you deserve to be branded! Is money all you care about? Would you sell your soul for cash? Go find yourself a sugar daddy if you want, but stay away from my son! How will you ever repay him for wasting five years of his life?"

Evelyn had endured enough. Wincing, she tore her hair free and shoved Patricia away with surprising force. "Stop it!"

The older woman stumbled back, her face flushed with rage. Trembling fingers pointed accusingly. "You shameless, scheming little tramp! How dare you act innocent!"

A crowd gathered around them, drawn by the commotion.

One middle-aged woman tried intervening, holding Patricia back. "Calm down, dear. You shouldn't believe neighborhood gossip about your daughter-in-law cheating."

Evelyn recognized her instantly - Tabitha, the same woman who'd spread those vile rumors with Daisy.

"This is none of your business!" Patricia snapped. "I know exactly what kind of woman she is."

Seeing Patricia's irrational anger, the woman backed off awkwardly.

Evelyn retreated to her apartment, done with the Kensington family drama.

The first thing she did was search for new apartments online.

Her phone rang. Olivia Kensington's name flashed on the screen.

"Evie, are you okay?" Olivia sounded frantic. "Did my mom confront you? Did you see her?"

"We met. It's handled." Evelyn kept her voice steady, not wanting to worry her friend.

"I'm so furious with my family right now!" Olivia's voice cracked. "I'm coming over."

Before Evelyn could protest, the line went dead.

She texted instead: "Don't upset yourself. This will blow over."

"You're too kind. My family doesn't deserve you." Olivia replied instantly, adding a tearful emoji.

Evelyn sighed. What choice did she have but to be understanding?

Nearly an hour later, Olivia arrived breathless at Evelyn's door.

Her eyes widened when she saw Evelyn's face. "Did my mother...hit you?"

Evelyn nodded silently.

"She's lost her mind!" Olivia exploded. "I swear my brother and mother have gone completely irrational. They'll believe some neighborhood busybody over their own family. They won't even listen to me!"

They moved to the bedroom where Olivia spotted the rental listings on Evelyn's laptop.

"You're moving out?"

Evelyn sighed. "It's the only way to find peace."

Olivia grabbed a drink from the fridge, studying the listings. "Get a two-bedroom. I'll move in with you - we can watch each other's backs."

Evelyn hesitated, not wanting to cause a rift between Olivia and her family.

"Don't worry," Olivia said, reading her thoughts. "I've wanted to move out since sophomore year. My parents fight constantly..."

Evelyn had never known what having two parents was like. Was it warm and loving? Or filled with shouting matches? She'd never know.

By afternoon, they'd chosen an apartment.

The next day, they signed the lease, paid the deposit, and moved in - all within twenty-four hours.

On moving day, Evelyn wanted to clean the place thoroughly.

Concerned about her friend's exhaustion, Olivia hired professional cleaners online.

"Freedom at last," Olivia sighed happily, collapsing onto the new sofa.

Evelyn felt lighter too, the weight of recent events finally lifting.

Her week off passed in a blur.

Returning to work brought an unpleasant surprise - Nathan Kensington at his desk in the design department.

He looked up, meeting Evelyn's gaze with open contempt.

That same accusing look from when he'd screamed "adulterous pig" outside her door.

At 9:20 AM sharp, Abigail Thornton circulated a meeting notice.

The design team assembled in the conference room where their no-nonsense department head - a woman who favored ambitious female employees - assigned an important project. Abigail, who liked Evelyn, ensured her inclusion.

As they filed out post-meeting, the department head pointed at Abigail and Evelyn. "Conference room, 62nd floor. Now!"

No time for questions. Abigail hustled Evelyn into the elevator.

Nathan, who'd wanted to confront Evelyn, had no choice but to return to his desk.

A staff member ushered them into the 62nd-floor conference room where they took inconspicuous seats.

The atmosphere was tense. Evelyn barely dared breathe as she scanned the room's powerful occupants - company executives and project partners.

At the front, a woman presented a land development proposal. To her right sat Dominic Blackwood, as composed and imposing as ever.

Evelyn quickly averted her gaze, cheeks burning with memories of their scandalous encounters.

The marathon meeting lasted two hours.

During the lunch break exodus, Evelyn froze - Dominic stood just outside, conversing with three high-ranking officials.

Sebastian Whitmore spotted them. "Miss Thornton, you handle your liquor well. You'll join the lunch meeting." His tone brooked no refusal. Then to Evelyn: "Miss Sinclair, come along. The bosses could use your design insights."

As an employee, Evelyn couldn't refuse.

Flustered, she felt an intense gaze. Turning, she locked eyes with Dominic - his expression unreadable, yet brimming with something dangerously intense.
###Chapter 45

Evelyn and Abigail returned to the design department before their lunch meeting.

Evelyn placed her laptop back on her workstation. The phone she'd left behind suddenly buzzed with an unknown number.

138...6688. The message read: "Miss Evelyn, my summer break starts soon. Are you free in ten days?"

She recognized it must be Alexander.

Her fingers flew across the screen. "Work's overwhelming right now. Just got assigned a major project. Can't afford to take time off. Sorry."

She needed to maintain distance from Dominic Blackwood's son.

That man's accusations still burned. She'd never approached his children with ulterior motives.

In their world, men like Dominic expected gold-diggers at every turn.

If a woman escaped his wrath, she might gain his temporary attention—but only as a transaction. Bodies for money. Hearts never involved.

Evelyn knew better than to play that dangerous game.

Dominic was forbidden. A temptation she couldn't afford.

Alexander's delayed reply finally came: "Oh... okay......" The trailing dots screamed disappointment.

Her chest ached. If only Alexander and Isabella were orphans—she'd adopt them in a heartbeat. Raise them while chasing her design dreams.

But they had a father. A powerful one.

She silenced her phone and walked out.

Nathan stood abruptly. Her conflicted expression ignited his fury.

Evelyn barely reached the restroom when an iron grip yanked her backward.

"Let go! This is workplace harassment—" She glared at Nathan, wrenching her arm free.

"Private talk. Now." He dragged her into the supply closet.

Evelyn shoved against him. "I'll scream!"

Nathan cornered her with a sneer. "Scream? Didn't lose your voice when that bastard fucked you senseless?"

She recoiled. "You're being irrational."

"Irrational?" His laugh turned manic. "My fiancée spreads her legs for another man, but I can't react? Are you insane? Engaged to me while taking some stranger's cock? God, Evelyn, I never guessed you were such a slut in college."

Her laughter rang hollow. "Now you know. Consider it a late revelation."

His fists clenched. The recent 96-hour detainment kept him from striking her—but not from venom.

"Fucking blind idiot I was! Thank Christ I didn't marry trash like you. Who knows how many men you'd parade through our home once I'm old?"

"Disgusting." Ice flooded her veins. She turned to leave.

The door flew open.

Abigail emerged from the restroom. Seeing Nathan's twisted expression, she pulled Evelyn away. "Let's go."

Nathan watched them leave, knuckles white. No man tolerated being cuckolded.

Evelyn had been his choice. His property.

For years, she'd played the perfect girlfriend. Now the mask slipped, revealing a whore.

Marie claimed she'd slept around abroad. That voice he'd heard through her apartment door confirmed it.

Filthy bitch.

But five years of deception demanded payback.

Downstairs, Evelyn's shoulders slumped.

Abigail hesitated. "You okay?"

A bitter smile. "Heard everything, huh?"

"Only parts. But that guy's unhinged. You're nothing like he said."

Evelyn weighed her words. "He wasn't entirely wrong. There was a man in my apartment... after we officially broke up."

Abigail's brows shot up.

"The guy might... have some interest in me. But it's not love. Just obsession. My refusals don't matter to someone that controlling."

Abigail blinked. What kind of man inspired words like "obsession" and "controlling"?

They reached the lobby. "How will you handle Nathan at work?" Abigail asked.

"I'll resign after getting my salary."

"Absolutely not!" Abigail gripped her arm. "After all the opportunities I gave you?"

Guilt twisted Evelyn's stomach. But staying meant endless drama.

Two luxury cars idled outside. Sebastian spotted them and gestured. "Miss Sinclair, this car please."

He directed Abigail to the second vehicle, claiming she'd handle client small talk.

The unspoken message was clear.

Sebastian opened the Bentley's door with deference.

Evelyn's breath hitched at the figure inside. Terrified, she slid in.

Dominic's eyes flicked open as her shadow fell across him.
###Chapter 46

The limousine's engine purred to life.

Sebastian had handled all hotel arrangements with military precision beforehand.

Evelyn sat rigidly in the backseat. She deliberately avoided looking forward, terrified of accidentally meeting Dominic's gaze. Her eyes remained fixed on the passing cityscape.

Dominic flipped through financial reports with detached efficiency. His aristocratic fingers turned each page crisply. An aura of glacial indifference surrounded him, freezing any possibility of conversation.

Evelyn's throat constricted.

Anxiety always triggered her thirst reflex.

Upon arrival, Abigail didn't wait for Evelyn. She practically bounded toward the waiting executives, oozing professional charm.

The seasoned businesswoman had pieced everything together. That intimidating man Evelyn mentioned? None other than T Corporation's CEO himself - their ultimate superior.

Sebastian's poker face confirmed her suspicions. His deliberate seating arrangements spoke volumes.

Abigail nearly vibrated with excitement. This surpassed even her biggest career wins. As a pragmatic woman, she recognized the extra hurdles women faced climbing corporate ladders.

Evelyn Sinclair was her golden ticket. The boss's current obsession!

Whether fleeting fancy or serious interest didn't matter. The undeniable fact remained - Evelyn held Dominic Blackwood's attention.

Men shared a universal weakness. The unattainable fascinated them most. Abigail decided then to play Cupid.

Her career needed this strategic alliance. Someone who could whisper in the CEO's ear. Evelyn was perfect.

The hotel lobby swallowed their group.

As the most junior employee, Evelyn trailed two paces behind Dominic. Head bowed, she moved silently through marble halls toward the elevators.

The doors slid open.

Entering first trapped her near the control panel. Moving would require brushing past him. The thought made her skin crawl, so she stayed rooted.

The elevator ascended.

At the restaurant level, Evelyn took her assigned seat beside Dominic.

Courses arrived, followed by vintage wine.

Her phone buzzed urgently.

"Excuse me," she murmured, rising. "I need to take this."

Every head turned except Dominic's. "Make it quick," he commanded without looking up.

The hallway provided sanctuary. "Hello?"

Michelle from Design Department whispered frantically: "I just saw Nathan dragging some woman into the stairwell! He looked... guilty."

Evelyn's grip tightened.

"That cheating bastard!" Michelle hissed.

"Impossible..." They'd barely settled into the company. No way he'd already seduced someone new.

Besides, why would he keep harassing his ex if he had a new girlfriend?

Most damning - he'd proposed barely two weeks ago.

"Listen carefully - I'm putting you on speaker. Stay quiet." Michelle positioned her phone near the stairwell door before retreating.

"So you're ditching me now? Didn't hear complaints when you were pounding into me," a female voice sneered.

Evelyn froze.

"You came onto me first!" Nathan sounded furious.

"Took you one try to cave. Real men have self-control." The woman's mocking tone dripped with contempt.

"Shut up and abort it. I don't want your brat!"

"You think I'll obey? You screamed about knocking me up during sex! That's why I let you finish inside me! Now you refuse marriage? Think I'm stupid like Evelyn?"

Evelyn leaned against the wall, eyes closed.

Sophia was pregnant. Nathan hadn't denied paternity - just demanded termination. Proof of their ongoing affair.

Pregnancy tests required weeks to show positive. This betrayal spanned months.

She'd been blind. While Nathan proposed with fake devotion, he'd been sleeping with Sophia. Played for a fool.

That "accidental" WeChat message during his business trip? Probably Sophia's doing. That mysterious hotel room visitor? Undoubtedly Sophia.

Evelyn disconnected, thanking Michelle before returning.

Her seat beside Dominic felt like a trap. Requesting relocation would draw unwanted attention.

Abigail signaled a waiter to fill Evelyn's glass. "You kept everyone waiting," she chided loudly. "Apologize properly with a toast."

One glass wouldn't kill her.

Evelyn drained it swiftly.

The refilled glass glinted ominously. Already lightheaded from gulping the first, she barely registered the alcohol content.

As she moved to sit, Abigail's foot shot out.

Evelyn pitched sideways, wine splashing across...

"Evelyn!" Abigail feigned shock, retracting her foot. "Quick! Help Mr. Blackwood clean up!"
###Chapter 47

Evelyn never imagined a single glass of wine could make her this lightheaded.

She shook her head, swaying slightly under the heavy tablecloth of the massive round table. The table had eight ornate legs, one particularly thick one directly in front of her.

That must have been what she tripped over.

Now her boss's trousers were drenched in red wine - right at the most embarrassing spot possible. The stain spread obscenely across the fabric. Evelyn felt like she deserved to die ten times over for this.

Dominic already suspected her of trying to seduce him. After this incident, she'd never be able to look him in the eye again.

"Don't just stand there! Help Mr. Blackwood clean up!"

Abigail thrust a packet of tissues at her urgently.

Acting on instinct, Evelyn grabbed a tissue and pressed it directly against her boss's crotch...

The white tissue immediately darkened to a deep, suggestive red upon contact. Her fingers brushed against something firm beneath the fabric.

She realized with horror that her wiping motions were causing her fingers to rub against his groin repeatedly.

Something terrifying seemed to be growing beneath his pants... at an alarmingly rapid pace.

Evelyn's face burned.

With three business partners watching - both men and women - this must be mortifying for Dominic. She bit her lip, trying to focus, but her nervousness only made her hands shake worse.

Half the tissue packet was gone, but the stain remained.

Dominic was notoriously fastidious. There was no way he'd continue dinner with wine-soaked trousers...

Just as panic set in, his hand clamped around her wrist like a vice.

She looked up into his icy, penetrating gaze.

Towering over her, his chiseled features hardened as he ground out through clenched teeth, "Come with me."

The entire room froze in surprise.

All three business partners exchanged glances, realizing Miss Sinclair was clearly more than just an employee to Mr. Blackwood.

Even Abigail and Sebastian looked shocked at their boss's blatant possessiveness. He might as well have declared to everyone present that Evelyn Sinclair belonged to him.

Dominic dragged her to the elevator, pulling her inside as the doors closed. The ascent seemed endless, confirming they were heading to one of the penthouse floors.

The higher they rose, the dizzier Evelyn became.

Who knew she'd be taken down by one glass of wine? She'd clearly overestimated her alcohol tolerance.

When the doors opened, Dominic yanked her down the hallway to a suite. Swiping the keycard, he pulled her inside and immediately pinned her against the entryway wall.

The dim lighting played tricks on their expressions, making Dominic's striking features look like a three-dimensional masterpiece.

His scorching kisses rained down mercilessly.

Evelyn weakly struggled, but he easily pulled her against his solid frame.

"Mmm... no..." Her protests were swallowed by his relentless assault as he deepened the kiss.

Her wine-sweetened breath only fueled his desire, making him want to devour every inch of her.

"Ah! Stop... please..." Her hair tumbled wildly as Dominic's large hands roamed freely over her body through her clothes.

Three buttons popped off her blouse, silently hitting the carpet.

She pounded her fists against his chest, tears welling.

Dominic suddenly broke the kiss, gripping her chin roughly. "Why the tears?" His voice was rough with impatience. "Don't want me touching you? Or are you just afraid to admit how much your body wants this?"

"If you're angry about the accident, I'll stay far away from you from now on," she whispered, interpreting his roughness as punishment.

The bold taste of wine on his lips was intoxicating. What woman wouldn't be mesmerized by a man like him?

But she knew this infatuation couldn't last.

Men like Dominic were mirages in the desert - there one moment, gone the next.

She'd known Nathan Kensington for four years, yet reality had slapped her hard. Nice appearances meant nothing. And this powerful, accomplished man before her? His ruthless nature was obvious at first glance.

The chasm between their worlds had existed since birth.

Experience taught that relationships only worked between equals. At best, she'd be a temporary plaything for him.

How delusional would she have to be to dream of marrying someone like Dominic?

Sweet dreams only led to harsher awakenings. That's why Evelyn avoided them - the emptiness afterward hurt too much. Nightmares were better; at least she could wake up relieved it wasn't real.

Dominic's broad palm burned against her waist. Pressing his heated face to hers, he rasped in her ear, "Was that really an accident? Or did you want to touch me there?"

She knew exactly what "there" meant.

The alcohol must be hitting hard, Evelyn thought. Dominic burned like a supernova, incinerating her rationality.

"Let me go. I'm still on my period..." She panted, resting her forehead against his arm.

This was her last shred of clarity - reminding him she couldn't have sex right now.

If he lost control, it would be a bloody mess...

Evelyn refused to risk her health.

"I'm too dizzy. I need to go home."

She never should have finished that entire glass.

Dominic exhaled sharply, fighting his raging desire. Gently stroking her hair, he murmured, "Just rest for now."

Scooping her up, he carried her to the massive bed.

Through her haze, Evelyn watched him open the closet and remove a perfectly pressed suit.

Then he began undressing...

His sculpted back faced her, every muscle defined. She couldn't look away.

Once dressed, his usual impenetrable demeanor returned. But then he knelt to remove her heels.

When his hand closed around her foot...

An electric jolt shot through her. Her toes curled instinctively, trying to pull away from his grasp.
###Chapter 48

The friction left Evelyn's delicate foot tingling from Dominic's scorching touch.

She couldn't recall when he'd released her. Waves of pain radiated from her abdomen, a thin sheen of sweat forming on her forehead.

The wine's haze and the cramps pulled her into the plush warmth of the bed. Before she realized it, sleep claimed her.

Dominic occasionally used this hotel suite—his private sanctuary since taking over Blackwood Enterprises.

No unauthorized personnel ever stepped foot here.

After she drifted off, he adjusted the thermostat and draped the blankets over her with care.

When Evelyn stirred, darkness had swallowed the sky.

She blinked at the unfamiliar room, memories flooding back.

Sitting up, she rubbed her temples. The dizziness lingered, but her mind was clear.

Her phone lay beside her. A message from Abigail Thornton glowed on the screen.

"At the office. The boss asked where you were. Told her Sebastian Whitmore gave you a last-minute task—said you wouldn't return today." Sent at 4:30 PM.

Evelyn exhaled.

Abigail had witnessed how Dominic treated her earlier. She must've guessed where Evelyn had gone.

Was this cover-up to spare her office gossip?

"Thanks, Abby," she typed.

"Don't mention it. Just remember me when you're the boss's favorite," came the instant, teasing reply.

Evelyn's fingers hesitated. "I know my place."

"What place? Stop being dense. I'm counting on you!" Abigail shot back, exasperated.

Evelyn's chest tightened. Who would she rely on when Dominic discarded her?

As she debated how to escape the suite, warmth enveloped her from behind. She spun, meeting Dominic's piercing gaze.

"I'll take you home." His finger pressed the biometric scanner, and the door clicked open.

She hurried out first, putting distance between them.

The floor was eerily silent—no staff, just their footsteps. The lobby's buzz greeted them downstairs.

Employees bowed as they passed. Evelyn quickened her pace, but curious stares followed.

A taxi approached. She yanked the door open—

Dominic's hand clamped around her wrist. He hauled her out, shoved her into his Land Rover's backseat, and apologized smoothly to the driver.

The entire move was effortless, witnessed by gaping employees.

Evelyn wanted to vanish.

A nobody like her, receiving such attention? The rumors would paint her as a scheming seductress.

She'd be crucified alone.

The drive spanned half the city. Her cramps worsened, sapping her strength. By the time they stopped, the world spun.

"Careful." Dominic steadied her as she stumbled.

She sidestepped his touch. "Thank you for the ride, Mr. Blackwood. And... sorry about the wine earlier."

Her new apartment was cheaper but less convenient. The silver lining? A community hospital steps away.

"See a doctor. Or I'll worry." He didn't force her, just watched from a meter away, illuminated by city lights like some untouchable deity.

She shook her head. "I'm fine."

Dominic pulled out his phone. "Calling Dr. Grant. Address—"

"No!" She lunged for it.

He caught her wrist effortlessly, his grip firm. Her pulse fluttered under his thumb.

"Psych." He lowered the phone, lips quirking.

The screen was dark—no call made. But the threat hung in the air.

Evelyn dreaded Dr. Grant's visits. The first time, she'd been drugged. The second, bleeding mid-intimacy.

Each more humiliating than the last.

This pain? Maybe the aphrodisiac's aftermath. Or the wine during her cycle.

Fine. She'd go.

She wrenched free. "I'll handle it."

The hospital loomed twenty meters ahead.

Dominic followed, his designer suit out of place in the sterile halls. The receptionist gaped, fingers fumbling the keyboard.

"Gynecology, please," Evelyn mumbled.

Behind her, Dominic waited, the picture of a devoted husband. His intense gaze never strayed from her.

A woman elbowed Evelyn, eyeing Dominic enviously. "Where'd you find him? Bet your nights are... eventful."

She forced a smile, cheeks burning.

The judgment had already begun.
###Chapter 49

Evelyn Sinclair felt heat rising to her cheeks.

The woman beside her showed no restraint in their conversation. She chattered excitedly about every imaginable topic, completely indifferent to the presence of men nearby.

"Tell me everything! I'm dying to know!" The woman's eyes sparkled with anticipation.

Evelyn was stunned. Topics once considered taboo were now being discussed so openly.

"He's not..." She shook her head.

Before she could finish saying "He's not my husband," the woman discreetly glanced behind Evelyn, her gaze lingering on Dominic Blackwood with unmistakable hunger.

Then she turned back abruptly, interrupting. "We're both women. We've surely been with our husbands. No need to be shy! Share some details with me. How many times a week? Just one look tells me your man is very... skilled."

Her admiring gaze drifted back to Dominic's imposing figure. He sat not far behind them. She murmured, "His very presence screams he could make a woman climax endlessly, anytime, anywhere..."

Evelyn was speechless.

This conversation needed to end.

First, Dominic Blackwood wasn't her husband. The thought alone was dangerous.

Second, she refused to contemplate whether he possessed that alleged "overbearing" ability.

"Excuse me, I need the ladies' room." Grabbing her purse, Evelyn escaped the nosy woman.

After exiting, she found a quiet corner in the waiting area.

Twenty minutes later, her number was called.

Entering the examination room, she followed instructions to remove her skirt and underwear before lying on the table.

"Slide down further," the middle-aged female doctor instructed after a glance.

Evelyn adjusted her position.

"Bend your knees, spread your legs wider." Once positioned, the doctor asked, "Name?"

"Evelyn Sinclair."

Gynecological exams weren't new to her. Her first was five years ago - a prerequisite before bearing that man's child. She'd been stripped, interrogated, and examined with cold instruments in a humiliating ordeal.

Though years had passed, the memory surfaced during every exam.

The procedure lasted five minutes.

Evelyn sat up, exhaled softly, and cleaned herself before dressing hastily. She followed the doctor out.

Back in the waiting area, she awaited results.

When called, she stood - then noticed a man rising from a secluded corner.

He moved toward the doctor's office.

Evelyn froze.

Was he planning to join her?

It was inappropriate for a non-husband to attend a gynecological consultation.

"If there are issues, I want immediate follow-up. I won't tolerate negligence regarding your health." Dominic's commanding tone brooked no argument.

Evelyn frowned, ready to refuse.

But recalling the woman's bold questions earlier, perhaps societal norms had changed since her teenage years.

Dominic Blackwood had built an empire from nothing - a man who calculated every move. For such men, relationships held little value.

Perhaps he feared she carried diseases. Dr. Grant had only addressed surface issues earlier.

What illnesses terrified men so? Syphilis? AIDS?

As Dominic played husband and entered with her, a dark thought struck: What if the doctor misdiagnosed her with AIDS?

She almost wanted to see his reaction. Would he flee in terror?

Later, she'd learn STD tests required specialized hospital labs unavailable here.

"Doctor, about my condition..." Evelyn tensed.

The doctor reviewed notes. "Everything's normal. Avoid colds, strenuous activity, and get rest." She observed Evelyn's attire. "Office worker? Minimize heels for now."

Evelyn nodded.

"No serious issues. Don't over-worry. Here's a prescription for common medications." Noticing Dominic's attentive gaze, the doctor added, "Your wife is healthy. Scans show good ovaries, uterus, and pelvic structure. From my experience, she appears quite fertile."

Evelyn flushed crimson. The phrase "wide hips mean fertility" popped into her head - something overheard during overseas studies or family gatherings.

Being called "fertile" was embarrassing enough. Worse, it was said before this man.

Leaving with her report, Evelyn avoided Dominic's eyes. "Mr. Blackwood, I'm heading home to rest."

"I'll walk you out."

He draped his coat over her shoulders, anticipating refusal, so he firmly held them when she stiffened.

Enveloped in his scent, Evelyn felt uncomfortably warm. She met his gaze, determined to refuse.

Dominic's stare was unwavering. "The doctor said no colds."

Such lavish concern unsettled her. But arguing would prolong their interaction. Better to comply for a quicker departure.

Turning toward her apartment, she walked briskly.

He followed at a perfect distance - close enough to imply connection, far enough for propriety.

Despite the cool breeze, warmth spread through her. Her hands trembled. Her pulse raced...
###Chapter 50

Evelyn had to confess that Dominic's presence made her feel unusually secure.

What woman wouldn't crave protection from such an extraordinary man?

Yet experience had taught her that even when a man seemed perfect, he could still break your heart. Only after being wounded would one understand how love could be both sweet as honey and sharp as a blade.

What would this man ultimately leave her with? She couldn't predict, nor was she willing to gamble on it.

Evelyn remained silent throughout the ride until they reached her apartment complex.

She had no intention of inviting Dominic inside. Revealing her exact unit number might lead to unexpected visits with his children in tow.

Currently sharing the apartment with Olivia, Evelyn dreaded potential misunderstandings.

The office rumors about her relationship with their boss were awkward enough. She couldn't afford similar gossip about her personal life.

Moreover, her breakup with Nathan was still fresh. If Olivia saw Dominic escorting her home so soon, even if her friend believed her, it might paint her as promiscuous.

"Mr. Blackwood, drive safely." Evelyn handed back his coat without meeting his eyes.

Dominic stood half a meter away, observing how her delicate fingers clutched his black coat.

He made no move to take it.

Under the neon glow, he lit a cigarette and inhaled deeply before asking in that rich baritone, "What exactly are you afraid of?"

Everything about him intimidated her - his imposing physique, aristocratic bearing, every refined movement that screamed unattainable.

"Mr. Blackwood, why must you torment me like this?"

"Why indeed?" He closed the distance between them in one stride. When she instinctively recoiled, he caught her chin, thumb tracing her jawline. "I have my reasons."

Evelyn searched his inscrutable gaze.

What possible reason could he have?

Was it some male compulsion to chase what they couldn't have? Once conquered, would she become disposable?

She turned her face away, breaking contact with those long fingers.

Dominic brought the cigarette to his lips but still didn't reclaim his coat.

Exasperated, Evelyn decided to be blunt. "I hope you'll show mercy and stop playing these games. Surely you're not lacking for female company. Any type you desire must be readily available."

He exhaled smoke toward her, arching an eyebrow. "Go on."

Bathed in neon, Evelyn's eyes shimmered like tear-filled crystals. "I want neither wealth nor fame - just a simple, stable life. I've no intention of clinging to your coattails or dreaming of fairy tale endings."

"Plenty of women would kill for that chance - actresses, socialites, heiresses... Take your pick."

Dominic studied her intently. Outwardly calm, inside raged a tempest. Had he ever pursued any woman like this?

Even his mother hadn't received such attention.

Couldn't she see how far he'd lowered himself?

"Do you think just anyone can cling to me?" His expression turned icy. "For someone who trembled at my mere touch, you're setting quite the barrier now."

Evelyn's head snapped up, cheeks flushing crimson despite the neon glow.

"Wait here. Imagine the consequences if you disobey." He finally took his coat, took one last drag, and walked away.

Left standing dumbfounded, Evelyn watched Dominic's retreating figure - tall, commanding, radiating authority.

She closed her eyes. No matter how much Dominic resembled Alexander Blackwood, their personalities were worlds apart. One a gentleman, the other sharp-tongued and temperamental.

How could they possibly be the same person?

Lost in thought, Evelyn didn't notice the approaching Audi Q5 until it was nearly upon her.

Inside, Nathan's dark mood had infected Sophia. He'd been heading for the supermarket parking lot when Sophia suddenly shouted, "Stop the car!"

"This isn't your driveway," Nathan snapped without looking at her.

"It's Evelyn! Stop!" Sophia glared at him. "Isn't this what you wanted? A chance to see your precious Evelyn?"

Nathan's expression shifted instantly at Evelyn's name.

Sophia felt the baby inside her was a cruel joke. "Since you blame me for losing her, maybe I should help reconcile you two!"

She flung the door open before Nathan could respond.

Evelyn froze at Sophia's sudden appearance.

"Surprised?" Sophia's voice dripped venom. "Didn't expect to see me here? You forgot to tell Cassandra we're not exactly sisterly."

Since running into Cassandra months ago, Sophia had learned Evelyn's address through casual conversations. Playing the innocent girl, she'd gleaned information while Cassandra remained unsuspecting.

Remembering the pregnancy rumors, Evelyn felt only calm detachment.

"When's the wedding? Don't forget to invite me. You two seem perfect for each other."

Sophia sneered. "Playing tough? Admit it - you're heartbroken I took your man!"

Evelyn laughed lightly. "Just discarded some worn-out shoes. Once something's thrown away, who picks it up afterwards doesn't concern me."

Sophia's mask of composure finally cracked.
###Chapter 51

"We should never see each other again. It's bad for your health - all this agitation will age you prematurely."

Evelyn's words struck Sophia like physical blows before she turned to leave.

"Wait!"

Sophia's demeanor shifted instantly. She grabbed Evelyn's arm with both hands, her voice trembling. "I was wrong. I'm so sorry. Hit me, yell at me, do whatever makes you feel better."

Evelyn turned slowly to face her.

Sophia's hands slid from Evelyn's shoulders to grasp her fingers instead. With wide, innocent eyes, she whispered, "Evie, you know I've always lacked a father's love. That's why I envied you so much. When I joined your family, I resented your happiness. But I was young and foolish then. Please believe me - I never meant to steal Nathan from you..."

Evelyn knew every trick in Sophia's playbook after years of their toxic dance.

Without looking, she sensed someone approaching behind her.

This pathetic performance wasn't for her benefit - it was for their audience.

"Evie, Nathan and I never slept together. There was only that one night overseas when I had nowhere else to go. He took the bed, I slept on the floor. Nothing happened." Sophia raised one hand in oath while clinging to Evelyn with the other. "I swear on my life."

Evelyn yanked her hand free. "Enough of your solo drama."

"You really hate me that much?" Sophia's voice cracked. Tears spilled from her doe eyes as she gazed at Evelyn.

The waterworks were impressive. To any observer, Evelyn would appear the cruel stepsister tormenting poor Sophia.

Knowing Nathan stood behind her, Evelyn smirked. "I couldn't care less what you two did. Why this performance today? Regretting your conquest? Was he that disappointing in bed you want a refund?"

Sophia's teary eyes widened like a wounded fawn. Inside, she seethed. 'How dare you call Nathan used goods? Look at yourself - what man would want such a dried-up prune of a woman?'

"That's enough." Nathan strode forward, gripping Sophia's wrist as he pulled her away.

Evelyn stood her ground.

"Nathan, you're hurting me..." Sophia whimpered, struggling weakly against his iron grip.

He didn't relent. As Sophia yelped in pain, she glanced back at Evelyn - and flashed a triumphant smile.

"Go home. We'll discuss the child tomorrow." Nathan released Sophia abruptly, lighting a cigarette with agitated movements before driving off.

Sophia gaped at his retreating taillights, barely restraining her scream of frustration.

Nathan drove with one hand on the wheel, fuming over Evelyn's insults. 'Bad in bed? Discarded shoes? We'll see who gets discarded!'

"Bitch!" He jerked the wheel around a corner, angrily flicking his cigarette out the window.

Abandoned in the parking lot, Sophia noticed bystanders staring. She wiped her tear-streaked face and muttered, "Evelyn Sinclair, you'll beg for mercy soon. I always get what I want - your marriage, your man, everything you hold dear."
###Chapter 52

Dominic Blackwood stood at the pharmacy counter, purchasing four boxes of medication according to the prescription Dr. Eleanor Grant had provided earlier.

This marked his first time buying feminine healthcare products.

Yet when he returned home, Evelyn was nowhere to be found.

Late that night at Blackwood Manor, Alexander remained wide awake. The small boy perched on the edge of the black leather sofa, stubbornly fighting sleep.

"Big brother, aren't we going to bed?" Isabella mumbled drowsily, hugging her stuffed rabbit as she slumped against the couch cushions.

"Go ahead if you're tired. I'll wait alone." Alexander rubbed his eyes but refused to let them close.

He needed to speak with their father before sleeping - needed answers only Dominic could provide.

Hearing her brother's determination, Isabella shook herself awake. If Alexander could stay strong, so could she.

Uncle Julian's words haunted them both. Someday their father would remarry. They'd have a stepmother.

But the siblings only wanted one truth - where was their real mother? Had she died? Or abandoned them?

The children waited in stubborn silence.

Youthful exhaustion won eventually. Both dozed off before ten o'clock, Isabella sucking her thumb with soft smacking sounds.

Beatrice Lockwood discovered them while making her nightly rounds. She summoned maids to carefully carry the sleeping children upstairs.

Dominic returned well after midnight. He checked on Alexander and Isabella first, then showered before collapsing into bed.

Two hours later, he still stared at the darkened ceiling. Sleep refused to come.

A quiet sigh broke the silence.

Dominic sat up halfway, rubbing his temples. His son had somehow appeared beside him.

"Father, Uncle Julian says you're suffering from lonely insomnia..."

Dominic arched an eyebrow, lacing fingers behind his head. "What does a child know of insomnia?"

"I know enough to share your pillow. Then you won't feel alone." The boy scooted closer before hesitating. "Father...may I ask you something?"

For once, Dominic felt patient. He nodded.

"Is our mother...alive?" Alexander whispered the forbidden question.

The silence stretched.

Finally, Dominic answered drowsily: "Yes."

Alexander's eyes flew wide. Alive? Their mother was alive!
###Chapter 53

The next morning brought an unexpected sight - the boy wasn't sleeping in.

Thump. Thump. Thump. Little feet raced back to his room. Alexander grabbed his toothbrush, scrubbing his pearly whites with meticulous care.

Finished, he dashed to find Isabella. Throwing open her door, he declared, "Our mother's alive."

Isabella's braid swung as she tilted her head. "What are you saying, Alex?"

"I said our mother's alive!" Alexander marched forward, kneeling to help his sister with her shoes before leading her through the mansion's corridors.

Their nanny paid no attention to the children's antics.

Alexander positioned Isabella as lookout while he slipped into Uncle Julian's room. He snatched the phone from the nightstand, tiptoeing back out...

"Got it?" Isabella's eyes widened.

Nodding, Alexander led her to a secluded corner. Small fingers dialed a familiar number.

Across town, Walter Harrison's phone rang.

Walter and Margaret were jogging through their gated community when the call interrupted their morning routine. Walter frowned at the caller ID. "It's Julian Blackwood."

"Why would Dominic's brother call you?" Margaret's brow furrowed.

The couple had worked with the Blackwoods two decades prior. After old Reginald Blackwood retired, his son took over - only to fall gravely ill years later. The patriarch had to resume control until Dominic returned.

Dominic proved himself a natural leader, inheriting the family's best traits. Unlike his philandering father, the young heir showed remarkable restraint. Thirteen years since his return at sixteen, Dominic had cemented his position beyond challenge.

Now retired, the Harrisons dreaded any Blackwood contacting them. Every inquiry in recent years centered on one topic: the twins' mother.

"Mr. Julian?" Walter answered cautiously.

A child's voice replied instead. "Grandpa Walter..."

"Alexander?" Walter's confusion grew.

"Grandpa, can I ask you something?" The boy's politeness couldn't mask his urgency.

"Of course, young master."

Alexander knew better than to expect full honesty from the old retainer.

"Daddy finally told me last night... Mommy's alive." The boy's voice wavered. "Everyone says you and Grandma Margaret knew her. Will she come back for us?"

Walter hesitated.

"Will Daddy marry Mommy again?"

Choosing his words carefully, Walter deflected. "I doubt it. I heard she has a boyfriend now."

Last year's vacation to England had placed them near Evelyn's university. Whether Dominic orchestrated this remained unclear, but Walter had reported seeing Evelyn with a young man. The way Dominic's expression darkened spoke volumes.

Walter recalled those early days - Dominic visiting Evelyn's room nightly like a man possessed. The frequency alone suggested more than mere physical need. Five years of celibacy since confirmed Walter's suspicions.

Now Dominic had told his son the truth. Evelyn must have returned.

"Okay... thanks, Grandpa." Disappointment colored Alexander's voice before the line went dead.

Over breakfast, Walter analyzed the situation with Margaret.

"Dominic's nothing like his father," Margaret mused. "Remember how he'd sneak into her room every night? Like some lovesick tomcat." She sipped her milk. "Even without this boyfriend situation, that prideful boy would need several lifetimes to win her back."

Walter smirked. "Arrogant to a fault. If he saw Evelyn with another man but couldn't swallow his pride..."

Meanwhile at Blackwood Manor:

The twins deleted the call history and returned the phone.

"Can we ask Daddy for phones?" Isabella trailed after her brother.

Alexander shook his head. "Uncle Julian's a heavy sleeper. We'll just keep borrowing his."
###Chapter 54

Alexander tugged at Evelyn's sleeve. "Grandpa Walter told me Mommy already has a boyfriend. So Daddy doesn't stand a chance anymore."

Isabella nodded absently, only half-listening to her brother's words.

"Then let's find Daddy a new girlfriend. Miss Vivienne would be perfect." Alexander sighed dramatically. "It's not that Daddy doesn't want Mommy. Mommy just moved on first."

At the breakfast table...

Beatrice Lockwood descended the stairs, impeccably dressed with flawless makeup. "Father, I have an appointment this morning," she announced to the assembled family.

Reginald Blackwood opened his mouth to respond when Margaret Lockwood cut in with a mocking laugh. "Look at you - dressed to kill with those blood-red lips. Meeting your latest sugar daddy?"

After ten years of daily squabbles, only the family patriarch still reacted to their constant bickering.

Beatrice remained unruffled. "Unlike you, Margaret, I don't need male attention to feel alive. Edmund died young, but I'd never dishonor his memory."

"Who are you calling desperate?" Margaret slammed her chopsticks down with a clatter.

A maid quickly restrained Margaret as she lunged toward Beatrice.

"You homewrecking bitch!" Margaret shrieked, finger jabbing the air. "If you hadn't seduced my husband, I wouldn't be in this mess! Just looking at your smug face ruins my appetite!"

Noticing Reginald's darkening expression, Beatrice wisely chose not to engage further. Grabbing her limited-edition Chanel bag, she swept out of the mansion with regal poise.

Left with no outlet for her rage, Margaret pounded her chest in frustration until maids escorted her upstairs.

Julian Blackwood frowned. "Call Dr. Whitmore to check on Mother," he instructed the butler.

Beatrice had barely slept three hours last night.

She'd overheard everything yesterday when the twins discussed questioning their father about their mother's whereabouts in the garden.

The identity of the children's mother remained such a closely guarded secret that even family patriarch Reginald knew nothing...

Walter Harrison and Margaret Whitmore kept their silence so well that no amount of bribery or subtle questioning could extract information.

Before leaving this morning, Beatrice had cornered Alexander when no one was looking.

"Daddy just said Mommy's alive," the boy confessed. "When I asked more, he told me to drop it..."

Everyone knew Dominic's infamous temper, so the children dared not push further.

Beatrice couldn't help wondering: Was the twins' mother some secret lover? A girlfriend even she didn't know about? Or perhaps the result of some under-the-table arrangement?

Whatever the circumstances, there had to be clues. Why would her own son keep this from her?

Giving birth to the Blackwood heir was every social climber's dream. No woman would pass up the chance to marry into such wealth.

Once in her car, Beatrice made a call.

The line connected immediately.

"Don't play games with me, Robert Sinclair," she warned coldly, gazing out the window. "This is your last chance, or our past relationship means nothing."

Meanwhile...

Evelyn stood in her kitchen preparing noodles.

She tossed in fresh vegetables and two perfectly poached eggs. Soon, the aromatic broth filled the apartment.

Olivia Kensington, freshly showered, waited eagerly for breakfast.

Evelyn's phone kept buzzing on the counter.

Since both women were now working, urgent messages weren't unusual. Olivia checked the screen - Victoria Montgomery's name flashed with a preview:

"Eve, want the recording of Nathan cheating with that woman? Useful for the breakup."

Olivia's blood boiled.

Impossible!

She unlocked Evelyn's phone and replied: "Yes, send it now."

Victoria forwarded the damning audio.

Every word between Nathan Kensington and Sophia Montgomery came through crystal clear.

My brother really betrayed Evelyn...

They even have a child on the way.

What the actual fuck!

Olivia immediately called Nathan. "You claim to want a proper woman but can't resist some slut? Perfect match - a bitch deserves a dog! Hope you both get syphilis and rot in hell together!"

Hearing the commotion, Evelyn rushed from the kitchen. "Liv, what's wrong?" Who was she screaming at this early?

Olivia hung up. "Nothing. Just borrowing your phone to curse someone out."

During their commute, Evelyn checked her call history but found it erased. With no further messages, she dismissed the incident.

Olivia had a site visit with her supervisor, so Evelyn took the subway alone.

As she boarded the crowded train, she puzzled over Olivia's strange behavior. Those curses about a cheating couple...

Is Liv in a relationship? Did some bastard hurt her too?

Evelyn sighed. Why must good women always attract scum?

The subway grew more congested. A middle-aged man deliberately pressed close, sharing Evelyn's handhold when plenty were available.

Recognizing the creep, Evelyn tried to move away, but he only pressed closer.

Just as she wondered how to escape the harassment, strong hands steadied her.

She looked down to see elegant masculine fingers gripping her waist.

Dominic's deep voice tickled her ear. "Still mad at me, wifey?"

His muscular frame enveloped her protectively. That single word - "wifey" - made the pervert slink away under Dominic's icy glare.

Why is Dominic Blackwood on the subway? I must be dreaming...

Safe in his embrace, Evelyn nonetheless felt uneasy. The train swayed, forcing their bodies together repeatedly in the packed car.
###Chapter 55

The subway doors slid open at each station.

Evelyn became acutely aware of her body pressed flush against Dominic's. Something unfamiliar stirred within her.

Sunlight streamed through the carriage windows, casting reflections of passengers onto the glass.

At first, Evelyn couldn't bring herself to look. But as her blush gradually faded, she dared a glance at their reflection.

Dominic stood tall behind her, one hand gripping the overhead rail while the other encircled her waist protectively.

She was petite compared to his towering frame. Unless she craned her neck, his face remained out of view.

That disgusting older man had only brushed against her hand earlier. Yet Dominic's possessive reaction had him claiming her entire body instead.

Other passengers overheard him calling her "darling." The men nearby instinctively gave them wider berth, not wanting to provoke the apparent husband.

When they reached the downtown commercial district, the carriage emptied considerably.

Evelyn turned slightly. "Our stop," she whispered, unsure if the CEO even knew how public transportation worked.

Dominic simply nodded.

She exited first, walking briskly toward the station exit without looking back. Would he still follow?

Emerging above ground, T Corporation's headquarters loomed across the street - less than five minutes away.

Evelyn's pulse quickened. Though not walking side-by-side, her boss's imposing presence trailed close behind.

'This is company territory,' she panicked. 'What if someone sees us?'

Dominic taking the subway was conspicuous enough...

Her pace unconsciously quickened.

Dominic had arrived at Evelyn's apartment complex at 7:20am. He'd driven there, only to see her walk straight past his car toward the subway station.

So he followed.

Bought a ticket.

Boarded her train.

She remained oblivious the entire way.

Five years should have made her just another face in the crowd. Yet here he was, inexplicably drawn into her orbit once more.

Employees entering the T Corporation building did double-takes seeing their CEO approach from the subway station instead of his usual chauffeured car.

Evelyn kept her head down through the revolving doors, beelining for the elevators.

She watched the floor numbers descend, ready to dart inside. But fate had other plans.

The doors opened.

Her face paled as a familiar figure held them open and stepped in.

The elevator ascended in heavy silence.

At intermediate floors, startled employees apologized profusely upon seeing their boss, refusing to enter.

Evelyn might as well have been invisible - except for the confused glances darting between her and Dominic.

Finally at her floor, she moved to exit.

"Your medicine." Dominic's gravelly voice stopped her. A pharmacy bag appeared before her, his fingers brushing her wrist.

She'd stood him up last night.

Yet he'd still gotten her medication.

Only now did she properly look at him. No suit today - just a rolled-sleeve white shirt, somehow making him appear both more approachable yet no less commanding.

Her fingers closed around the bag...

Abigail arrived early, sleep eluding her. Rubbing her tired eyes, she headed to the breakroom for coffee.

A figure by the elevators caught her attention.

Evelyn?

Before Abigail could call out, a man pressed Evelyn against the elevator wall. The glint of an expensive wristwatch confirmed his identity.

Abigail retreated to the breakroom, sipping bitter coffee as she processed what she'd seen.

When Evelyn finally emerged, her flushed cheeks and swollen lips told their own story...

By noon, Evelyn's concentration shattered when her phone buzzed.

"Evelyn!" Cassandra's excited voice crackled through. "Remember that gorgeous upperclassman Crawford from the neighboring high school? The basketball star?"

Evelyn's breath hitched.

"He never attended our reunions! But this time he's coming! Mom said he's actually cutting short a U.S. business trip to bring back a renowned orthopedic specialist for her!"

Cassandra's voice turned teasing. "Funny how I suddenly recall you having the biggest crush on him back then..."
###Chapter 56

"I didn't..." Evelyn's immediate response was defensive.

Cassandra scoffed. "Lying to me now? Who was that girl hiding behind the school walls every break, staring dreamily at the high school football field next door?"

Memories flooded back.

In middle school, Evelyn had developed a habit of watching beautiful scenes—and people—for hours. Her favorite subject had been the star quarterback from the neighboring high school, Julian Blackwood.

Cassandra mistook Evelyn's silence for embarrassment. "Come on, he was gorgeous! Those dimples could melt glaciers. Half the school had a crush on him. Why be ashamed?"

Evelyn coughed, her cheeks burning.

Suddenly, Julian's face in her mind morphed into Dominic Blackwood's sharp features.

Rumors said Dominic had a younger brother named Julian who resembled him. Evelyn had never met Julian in person.

What if her teenage crush had actually been Julian, but Dominic was the one occupying her thoughts now? That would be the cruelest twist of fate.

"Crush? I was fourteen," Evelyn muttered stubbornly.

Cassandra rolled her eyes. "Fourteen-year-olds date all the time. Remember Sarah from our class? Got pregnant freshman year. My mom's a teacher—I hear these stories daily." She leaned in. "Face it, you were smitten. Just too shy to admit it."

Evelyn had no rebuttal.

"The party venue changed. I'll text you the new address. Gotta notify others!" Cassandra hung up abruptly.

Evelyn slumped onto her bed, phone slipping from her fingers.

She'd been agonizing over whether Julian would attend. Now Cassandra confirmed it.

Every girl had that one unforgettable first crush. Even if Evelyn refused to voice it, she knew the truth.

She shook her head, forcing herself back to reality.

Even if they crossed paths, they'd probably exchange a brief nod at most. The football star wouldn't remember the invisible girl peeking through the fence.

Resolved, Evelyn returned to work.

At a modest Chinese restaurant beyond the city's fourth ring road, Beatrice Lockwood tapped her manicured nails against the teacup. The pot was half-empty when Robert Sinclair finally arrived.

Robert entered the private dining room, the waiter trailing behind with menus. "What would you like to order?"

Beatrice opened her mouth to decline, but Robert quickly ordered three dishes, soup, rice, and a Coke.

"Your food will arrive shortly," the waiter said before exiting.

Beatrice checked her diamond watch pointedly. "Do you know what time it is? I don't have all day, Robert."

"My family's watching me. Sorry I'm late," Robert admitted.

Beatrice nearly laughed. "Some things never change. Still pathetic after all these years." Her gaze swept over his worn jacket. "I can't imagine any woman marrying you. No ambition. Your only talent was deceiving naive young girls."

Robert sat stiffly.

This woman had trampled his pride for decades. Normally, he'd avoid her entirely.

But today, he needed her signature.

"My hometown house is being demolished. You own one-third. Do you want monetary compensation?" He couldn't meet her eyes.

Beatrice remained stunning, her beauty defying age.

As the second wife of T Corporation's former chairman, she frequented high society events and magazine covers.

Robert still remembered the first time he saw her newspaper photo with another man.

That day at the construction site, he'd been so transfixed by the image that he didn't hear coworkers shouting warnings. The crane nearly crushed his left ear.

The Luojiazhen house was a crumbling two-story building. Developers required all owners' signatures for compensation.

When they married twenty-five years ago, Beatrice's name was added to the deed. Neither mentioned it during their divorce.

If not for the developers' pressure, Robert would never have contacted her.

Beatrice studied him disdainfully. "I barely remember Luojiazhen."

She pursed her red lips. "What's the compensation rate in that backwater? Two thousand per square meter? My share wouldn't even buy a designer handbag. Keep it for your current wife."

Robert produced the contract and pen.

Beatrice signed swiftly, eager to sever ties. "Done." She slid the documents back and stood.

Robert blocked her path. "About Evelyn... I've kept my distance as you instructed last time. You said you wanted better for her."

Beatrice paused. "She's back?"

Robert nodded.

"Then follow my plan. Even if she's dating someone, I'll arrange a better match. She's my daughter—I know what's best." With that, Beatrice strode out, leaving the dingy restaurant behind.
###Chapter 57

Robert Sinclair's head throbbed relentlessly the entire night after returning home.

Victoria Montgomery ransacked every corner of the house searching for the contract documents.

After an exhaustive search, she hissed to Sophia, "Your uncle's playing games with me. Why won't that bastard just drop dead already?"

"Are you insane?" Sophia grabbed her mother's arm. "We won't get the demolition compensation if he dies now. It's nearly a million dollars! You've never held that kind of money in your entire miserable life." She lowered her voice. "If he's going to die, he better wait until we secure those funds first."

Victoria kicked a stool aside. "This is all your fault that I'm stuck living this pathetic existence with him."

Three hours later, their search proved futile.

Victoria stormed into the bedroom to confirm Robert was asleep before joining her daughter for takeout.

As they cracked open lobster shells, Sophia asked, "Mom, who do you think he married before? A man of his status wouldn't hide his ex-wife's identity without reason."

"Use your brain," Victoria sneered. "That woman remarried into wealth. Women like her fear nothing more than their dirty past being exposed." She'd tear the house apart again tomorrow - she needed that name.

Sophia peeled another lobster. "I've collected photos of every socialite in the city from magazines, but none resemble Evelyn."

"That birth mother of hers is just as heartless. Abandoned her own flesh and blood for twenty years without a backward glance." Victoria's lips curled in disgust.

The next morning, Robert left the house.

Sophia followed her mother's instructions and tailed him discreetly.

She cursed herself for failing yesterday - she could have seen Evelyn's precious biological mother by now.

Robert took a taxi to an unremarkable café.

Sophia peered through the window and dialed her mother. "He's not meeting his ex. It's Evelyn."

"That ungrateful wretch!" Victoria's voice crackled with rage through the phone. "He wants to give our money to his bastard daughter? Over my dead body!"

Inside the café, Robert stirred his cappuccino with trembling hands.

Evelyn had noticed her father's distance over the past year. Each visit to the city left her unsettled - knowing he was nearby yet unreachable.

"I heard about your breakup with Nathan?" Robert asked bluntly.

Evelyn studied her father's prematurely aged face. The daughter in her ached at the sight, but she masked her concern - terrified any mention might push him further away.

Robert slid a medical file across the table with shaking hands.

Evelyn's breath caught at the words "Oncology Report." Her hands trembled as she flipped through the pages. "This can't be real!"

Five years ago, he'd barely survived cancer. Now the diagnosis showed terminal lung cancer...

"The tumors are inoperable," Robert admitted. The constant chest pain and labored breathing had become unbearable. "I kept my distance because I wanted you to learn independence. To thrive without me." His voice broke. "You grew up motherless yet surpassed every privileged child. You're strong, principled, kind..."

Tears spilled down Evelyn's cheeks onto the medical report.

"Before I go, your happiness is all that matters." Robert forced a smile that didn't reach his sorrowful eyes. "Find someone worthy, Evelyn. Let me see you settled. It's the only peace I'll have."

Evelyn listened in stunned silence.

"The house compensation will be your safety net. Not that I doubt your judgment - any man you choose would be devoted." He patted her hand. "But every woman needs security."

Evelyn noticed the report date - exactly when her father started withdrawing.

"Dad... How could you keep this from me?" Her voice shattered.

He should have sought treatment immediately. What if there'd been hope?

Thirty minutes later, Evelyn sat alone in the café.

Robert had excused himself, sparing her further pain.

Beside his untouched coffee sat the medical file and a handwritten note.

Evelyn's swollen eyes remained fixed on the documents. The unfairness crushed her - why did good people suffer most?

Outside, she called her father through tears. "Let's get you hospitalized. There might still be options..."

Five years ago, she'd helped save him once.

"Go on that arranged date first. If it goes well, I'll consider treatment." Robert cared more about this than his prognosis. He trusted Beatrice wouldn't harm her own daughter.

"I'll go," Evelyn whispered. Fresh tears fell at hearing his voice.

At the windy intersection, Evelyn ended the call and collapsed against a lamppost, weeping openly.

That weekend, Evelyn left her apartment barefaced for the blind date.

Olivia blocked the doorway. "Skip the date if you want, but aren't you meeting school friends tonight? At least some mascara?"

Evelyn shook her head. Makeup felt trivial when her world was crumbling.

"Fine. You've got that natural glow anyway." Olivia squeezed her hand. "Uncle Robert will pull through!"

She chattered nervously while walking Evelyn to the elevator.

Outside, Evelyn's mind still reeled from her father's diagnosis.

Head bowed, she didn't notice the figure approaching until a strong hand seized her wrist. Before she could react, familiar arms maneuvered her against a car door. The overpowering kiss that followed left her breathless.

Dominic Blackwood's lips claimed hers with desperate intensity.

After days apart on business, he'd rushed back craving this - her taste, her warmth, her very breath.

Evelyn didn't resist. In her grief, the familiarity comforted.

Only when her lips grew tender from his relentless attention did he pull back. His hot whisper seared her ear: "I want to devour you whole. Carry you inside me wherever I go."
###Chapter 58

Evelyn's tear-filled eyes fluttered open. Her flushed cheeks burned as she stared at the imposing figure before her in utter bewilderment.

Dominic's smoldering gaze burned with raw intensity as he studied her face. The charged silence between them stretched unbearably long. Unable to decipher her thoughts, he pulled her close once more.

Evelyn gasped as she was swallowed whole by his demanding kiss.

Through half-lidded eyes, she traced the sharp angles of his aristocratic features - the proud nose, the pronounced brow that set him apart from ordinary men. Moonlight sculpted his devastating beauty into something almost supernatural.

His large hand cradled her head while the other tilted her chin upward. Fiery kisses trailed from her lips down her neck, branding each inch of exposed skin...

"Mmm..." Evelyn arched instinctively against him.

Dominic's moist lips left a searing path across her collarbone as his hands explored relentlessly.

The electric tension between them crackled dangerously.

Inexperienced in intimacy, Evelyn had only ever known Dominic's touch. He dominated her completely.

Her body responded against her will.

When she closed her eyes, his skillful tongue turned hers to liquid fire. Gasping for air, she pushed weakly against his granite chest.

Dominic captured her trembling hand, lacing their fingers together with possessive strength.

A dangerous heat pooled low in Evelyn's belly, terrifying in its intensity.

She tried to look away but found herself mesmerized by the sight of him devouring her lips.

His taste intoxicated her - minty freshness laced with something darker, more addictive...

The overwhelming sensations forced her eyes shut again. She surrendered completely to the mind-numbing pleasure.

Their passionate exchange grew increasingly feverish.

Thankfully, the tinted windows of his luxury car shielded them from prying eyes.

Dominic's ragged breathing filled the confined space.

His body's reaction pressed unmistakably against her.

"I...can't breathe..." Evelyn managed between kisses.

The night air sizzled between them, thick with unspoken desire. Their heated bodies fused together in the cramped backseat.

Evelyn felt herself losing control, shamefully craving more.

Dominic pulled her slender frame flush against him, guiding her arms around his waist.

Their entangled forms left no space for hesitation.

Like star-crossed lovers discovering passion for the first time, they teetered on the brink of madness. Evelyn's swollen lips stung from his relentless attention, the metallic tang of blood teasing her senses...

Panic surged through her. If this continued, he would consume her entirely.

"Did I hurt you?" Dominic's voice emerged rough and strained. His bloodshot eyes betrayed the effort of stopping himself mid-descent.

Evelyn avoided his gaze, fingertips brushing the scorching planes of his chest before jerking back from the heat.

Noticing her evasion, Dominic cupped her face gently. "Your heart's racing," he murmured against her lips.

Evelyn ducked her head in denial.

Dominic's predatory gaze contrasted sharply with Evelyn's dazed expression - a lion to his bewildered kitten.

"I...I should go." Evelyn longed to vanish into thin air.

As she exited the vehicle, several elderly neighbors turned curious eyes their way.

Dominic's long strides closed the distance instantly. One moment Evelyn walked alone; the next, she was swept off her feet.

"Put me down!" she shrieked.

Dangling over his shoulder, Evelyn flushed crimson.

The watching seniors shook their heads at the young couple's brazen display.

The car door swung open.

Evelyn found herself unceremoniously deposited inside.

Nosy neighbors strained to peer through the heavily tinted windows, seeing nothing.

Dominic gave no opportunity for protest as the engine roared to life.

"Seatbelt. Now." His growled command preceded a sharp turn that sent them speeding from the complex.

Trapped, Evelyn considered the unthinkable - jumping from a moving vehicle.

The Land Rover navigated side streets before stopping abruptly on a deserted road.

Evelyn's pulse quickened, remembering her class reunion tonight. Did Dominic have plans too? Perhaps attending a professor's birthday?

Dominic leaned back, eyes closed, breathing uneven. "Did you miss me?" The unexpected question hung between them.

Evelyn froze. Between her father's cancer diagnosis and Dominic's sudden reappearance, she hadn't allowed herself to think about his unexplained absence.

"I really must go." Deflection seemed safest.

Her hand found the door handle, only to be captured by Dominic's firm grip.

Heat radiated from his touch. Evelyn stared resolutely out the window, feeling his fingers tighten possessively.

Dominic studied her evasion with growing irritation. Her stubbornness tested his legendary temper.

"Come here." Without warning, he yanked her across the console.

Evelyn landed with a yelp against him, her face pressed against an unmistakable bulge.

Her eyelashes fluttered in shock.

Scarlet flooded her cheeks.

Dominic relished her weight against him. Desire coiled tight in his abdomen as his Adam's apple bobbed visibly. Her proximity ignited every nerve.

"Let go!" Evelyn squirmed.

Dominic held fast.

The friction of her movements against his arousal became unbearable. "I have a blind date in thirty minutes," she blurted, scrambling upright. "I'll be late."
###Chapter 59

The instant Evelyn mentioned "blind date," Dominic's expression darkened visibly. His frown deepened into something almost frightening.

"Release me. This is pointless and you're just wasting your time!"

Her words weren't meant for Dominic alone - she needed to hear them herself.

Dominic's eyes flashed with sudden intensity, his grip tightening momentarily before relaxing.

Evelyn found herself half-sprawled across his lap, lips pressed tightly together as she struggled to control her breathing.

After what felt like an eternity, the hand at her waist loosened. The fingers encircling her wrist slackened...

She was free.

Yet Evelyn's face showed neither relief nor distress as she straightened her clothes and retrieved her bag.

Just as she reached for the door handle, Dominic yanked her back violently, tossing her onto the passenger seat.

"Planning to seduce your date with these prudish clothes?" Dominic growled, pinning her down.

His burning gaze locked onto her panicked eyes.

Evelyn recognized the words as pure anger.

She wore full-length trousers and a long-sleeved blouse. Olivia had scolded her earlier for dressing like "a repressed spinster" for this arranged meeting.

Since learning of her father's terminal diagnosis, Evelyn had lost interest in everything.

If her blind date judged her by appearances, so be it.

Yet Dominic claimed she was "wearing too little" in this modest outfit.

The implication stung - he might as well have called her a whore.

"Perhaps you need an optometrist, Mr. Blackwood. Could you find anyone dressed more conservatively? What exactly about this screams 'provocative' to you?" Evelyn retorted bitterly.

Dominic's jaw tightened. Objectively, she was covered from neck to ankle - excessively so.

The damned truth was this woman could ignite his desire without showing an inch of skin...

"If a man gets aroused seeing me like this, that's his problem, not mine." Evelyn implied Dominic's accusation revealed more about his own inappropriate thoughts.

"You're the first woman who looks indecent even when fully clothed," Dominic countered, experiencing her sharp tongue firsthand.

As punishment, he crushed his lips against hers.

"Mmmph—" The brutal kiss made her wince. Her mouth already felt raw.

Was this how all kisses were? He seemed more animal than man.

The metallic tang of blood only seemed to excite him further.

Dominic's tongue probed the tender spot he'd created, reigniting the heat between them.

As he reclined the passenger seat, Evelyn shook her head desperately, twisting to escape.

"Moving like that against a man... Are you trying to provoke me further?" Dominic breathed heavily, fighting for control.

Evelyn's wide, frightened eyes and trembling lashes spoke volumes.

She feared he'd take her right there.

Her blind date appointment time loomed.

She couldn't stand up her father's chosen suitor - not when the man was dying.

After facing life's fragility before, Evelyn valued little else. Her purity meant nothing compared to her father's life.

She'd been cruel to him before learning the truth. Now she'd do anything for him.

"Why this sudden blind date?" Dominic knew she'd rushed into dating after Nathan.

Evelyn remained silent.

Another punishing kiss stole her breath as their bodies pressed together inseparably.

Dominic traced her swollen lips with his tongue. "I'll ask again - why the blind date?"

Evelyn stared mutely, momentarily speechless.

"Not satisfied yet? Your eyes are begging for more..." Dominic began unbuttoning her blouse.

"Ah! I'll... I'll talk!"

His fingers at her throat made coherent speech impossible.

Dominic pulled back. "Why?"

Evelyn swallowed hard before explaining about her father's concealed illness and his wish to see her settled.

Trapped beneath Dominic with barely an inch between them, his breath hot on her lips, Evelyn felt utterly vulnerable.

"You still want to go?"

"Yes." She kept her eyes closed.

Dominic seized another kiss before demanding, "Is this man more attractive than me?"

Evelyn's stinging tongue made her wince. If this was how he kissed, actual intimacy might destroy her.

She shook her head, chiding her wandering thoughts.

"He's not as wealthy as you - that's a point in his favor," Evelyn admitted. "I know almost nothing else about him."

Dominic frowned. "Is wealth a crime?"

Evelyn's pulse raced. "To my father, it is. He despises rich men."

"Why?" As a wealthy man himself, Dominic took offense.

Evelyn shook her head. The truth - her mother abandoning them for a rich lover - was too shameful to share.

She feared Dominic's pity and the unpayable debts his help would incur.

"Fine," Dominic conceded unexpectedly. "I'll take you to your date. But on one condition."

Evelyn waited.

"Kiss me properly for ten minutes." Dominic cradled her head, demanding she take the initiative this time.
###Chapter 60

Ten minutes later...

"I...I can't do this," Evelyn gasped, her wide eyes filled with panic.

Dominic leaned in, his sculpted lips hovering just above hers, teasing but not fully claiming them. His breath was hot against her skin, making her tremble.

She squeezed her eyes shut. "I—I can do it. Just...don’t..."

Dominic studied her heaving chest for a moment before pulling away, settling back into the driver’s seat.

He rolled down the window and lit a cigarette with practiced ease, exhaling a slow stream of smoke. His fingers, long and elegant, pressed against his temple as if easing a headache.

He would wait.

At twenty-nine, Dominic had more experience with women than Evelyn had with hotel stays. Yet unlike other men of his status, he never let it go to his head.

She wasn’t wrong—he could have any woman with just a glance. But he despised those who threw themselves at him.

No actress, no socialite, no heiress could compare to the woman who had unknowingly claimed his heart.

Evelyn adjusted her seat, fidgeting awkwardly.

Dominic took another drag before turning to her, his gaze scorching.

She bit her lip, unsure what to do.

Just kiss him.

"Come here," he ordered, extending a hand.

She hesitated.

His patience thinned. "I can cancel this blind date whenever I want. You know that, don’t you?"

A threat, clear as day.

Swallowing hard, she leaned forward.

Dominic guided her onto his lap, his hands firm on her waist. The forest surrounded them, the wind whispering through the trees as she straddled him, her back pressed against the steering wheel.

"Still need me to teach you?" His voice was low, eyes locked onto her flushed face.

Her lips parted slightly, her gaze fixed on his mouth.

Slowly, she pressed her lips to his—soft, hesitant.

She didn’t move.

His breath burned against her skin.

The difference between being kissed and kissing was staggering.

Her lips trembled, barely brushing his before retreating.

"Open for me," he murmured, guiding her hands to his neck.

Evelyn clutched his shirt, tilting her head to deepen the kiss. Her tongue darted out tentatively, licking at his lower lip.

She pulled back, flustered, her gaze dropping to his throat, then lower—

She couldn’t do it.

"You’re too innocent," Dominic muttered before taking control.

His hands slid up her back, his mouth claiming hers with ruthless precision.

She gasped when he bit down. "Don’t—don’t bite—"

"Promise me," he growled between kisses, his fingers tangling with hers. "You won’t look at him longer than necessary."

Her mind spun.

Is this surrender?

The café was elegant, all floor-to-ceiling windows and soft lighting.

Evelyn excused herself to the restroom, her thoughts still tangled with Dominic.

What kind of woman kissed another man right before a blind date?

She fixed her makeup and smoothed her dress before returning.

Dominic had driven flawlessly, arriving exactly on time.

Now, she sat nervously, waiting.

"Miss, would you like to order?" a waiter asked.

"I’m waiting for someone," she replied politely.

Two minutes later, a white Maserati pulled up.

A man stepped out—casual yet stylish, like a Hollywood actor.

"Hi," he greeted warmly.

Evelyn stood. "Hello."

He sat.

"Are you... Adrian Delacroix?"

"That’s me." His Chinese was broken but earnest.

They ordered coffee.

Adrian launched into introductions.

Evelyn listened, bewildered. She had never considered dating a foreigner.

Still, he was polite. She’d stay ten minutes—no more.

How did Dad even meet someone like him?

Outside, a black Range Rover parked by the window.

Dominic stepped out, coffee in hand, his gaze piercing through the glass.

Evelyn’s pulse spiked.

Adrian leaned in. "So, Evelyn, what do you look for in a partner?"

Just then, Dominic strode inside, his presence colder than the café’s AC.

He sat at the table beside them.

And waited.
###Chapter 61

"I don't have any particular requirements in a partner."

Evelyn just wanted this blind date to be over.

Dominic's presence at the next table made her even more tense.

"You really don't have any standards?" Adrian raised an eyebrow. "Then let me tell you about my situation—"

His phone buzzed beside his coffee cup.

"Excuse me, I need to take this."

Adrian stood up and walked away.

Evelyn exhaled in relief.

She kept her gaze fixed on her coffee, afraid to glance in Dominic's direction.

Dominic remained still, flipping through a newspaper, occasionally sipping his black coffee.

The caller ID read: Aunt Beatrice.

Adrian answered.

"How's the date going?" Beatrice demanded, impatient for an update.

Adrian glanced back at Evelyn, sighing. "Aunt Beatrice, she's lovely. I don't want to hurt her."

Beatrice scoffed. "Hurt her? What nonsense!"

"I'm gay. I can't give her a real marriage—not even normal intimacy. If we marry, my parents will demand children. But I can't... She's sweet, gentle, refined. I can't do this to her."

"I don't care about your preferences! If you want to keep your boyfriend, you need to appease your parents. They just want grandchildren! Take her abroad, use IVF—no need to touch her. I'm helping you, Adrian. Don't be stupid."

Her voice turned sharp. "That girl isn't marrying you out of love. She's desperate—a perfect pawn! Seize this chance. Or should I remind you? Your boyfriend committed fraud. Without my help, he'll rot in prison."

The call lasted ten minutes.

When Adrian returned, Evelyn was ready to leave.

But he sat down with a dazzling smile. "Evelyn, I'm so glad we met. It's love at first sight for me. Do you feel the same?"

Evelyn blinked.

Love at first sight? Seriously?

She couldn't imagine anyone falling for her that fast.

"You've seen me—my looks, my height, my family's wealth. Marry me, and we'll live overseas. I'll ensure you never want for anything."

Evelyn choked on her coffee.

Dominic's icy gaze locked onto Adrian.

"I'm sorry, Mr. Delacroix." Evelyn wiped her lips, flustered. "We're not compatible. I'll cover the coffee. Goodbye."

She grabbed her purse, nodded politely, and left without looking back.

Outside, she hailed a taxi.

She showed the driver her phone—the screen displayed an address in the city's most exclusive neighborhood.

As the car pulled away, Evelyn glanced back. The black Range Rover wasn't following her.

She relaxed.

Dominic didn't chase me. Maybe he's not the same man I once knew.

The cheerful boy from her memories had become a ruthless tycoon.

On the way, Cassandra called, urging her to hurry.

At 9:30 PM, the taxi arrived at the mansion.

Cassandra greeted her outside.

Evelyn gaped at the grand estate. "This place..."

"Recognize it? A celebrity hosted her birthday here last year—a publicity stunt to snag a rich heir!" Cassandra rolled her eyes. "Dominic Blackwood isn't like us. Tonight, we get to see how the elite live."

This is Dominic's home?

In A City, only the Blackwood family of T Corporation owned such wealth.

"Have you seen Dominic yet?" Evelyn asked nervously.

"Not yet. He's busy but will arrive soon." Cassandra smirked. "Look at those gold diggers. Dressed to kill just for a glimpse of him."

The mansion buzzed with glamorous guests—though not all were stunning. Some, like Evelyn and Cassandra, looked ordinary, sipping drinks shyly.

"This is Evelyn. Remember her?" Cassandra introduced her to former classmates.

A bespectacled man stood. "Of course! She sat in the second row—always top of the class."

Others greeted her warmly, avoiding school topics.

They chatted about careers, exchanged contacts.

Someone asked, "Cass, where's the teacher?"

"Inside. Dominic brought a specialist from abroad. Mom's amputated leg still hurts—no doctor here can fix it."

Their group spoke softly, but across the pool, wealthy girls flaunted designer bags and rare lipsticks.

Then, a car engine roared at the gates.

Silence fell.

Even the loudest socialites quieted.

A black Range Rover entered, its custom license plate gleaming.

The door opened.

Dominic stepped out, radiating power.

His presence screamed dominance—aggressive, controlling, responsible.

"So handsome..." a female classmate whispered, then covered her mouth.

Dressed in black trousers and a white shirt (two buttons undone), his rolled-up sleeves warned: Don't stare.

Evelyn froze as he approached.

"Evelyn." Dominic suddenly smiled—a rare, breathtaking sight. "You came."

His deep voice resonated, making it seem he'd attended just for her.
###Chapter 62

Evelyn lifted her gaze to meet Dominic's, her eyes wide and unblinking.

The air between them grew thick with unspoken tension. Time seemed to freeze as she struggled to process the revelation.

Her lashes trembled, unshed tears glistening in her eyes.

Dominic Blackwood was Upperssman Blackwood.

All her past suspicions paled in comparison to the undeniable truth standing before her.

Years had changed them both. The boy she once knew had become a man, just as she had transformed from that timid schoolgirl.

From classroom corridors to corporate boardrooms, from oversized uniforms to tailored suits. After all this time, fate had brought them back together.

But life hadn't been kind to Evelyn after graduation. She'd done things she wasn't proud of.

The memory of their heated kiss in the car surfaced, sending a rush of warmth through her. She quickly suppressed it, afraid her emotions might betray her.

She couldn't explain this connection between them.

Suddenly, they were teenagers again.

"Upperssman Blackwood, how could you only remember Evelyn!" A statuesque blonde interrupted, batting her lashes at Dominic.

His attention never wavered from Evelyn.

The blonde huffed, eyeing Evelyn's simple attire with disdain. "Really? Her?"

Dominic's voice cut through the tension. "I remember that summer basketball tournament against Lincoln High. The whole school came to watch. When I made the winning shot, I heard one voice cheering louder than all the others." His gaze locked onto Evelyn. "It was hers."

Evelyn's cheeks burned.

That never happened.

She'd never dare stand in the front row, let alone cheer loudly. Back then, she always hid in the shadows.

Dominic's words made Evelyn the sudden center of attention.

"No... I really didn't..." Evelyn stammered, shrinking under her classmates' curious stares.

The medical expert finished examining Mrs. Blake's leg.

With the examination complete, Cassandra helped her mother into a wheelchair, guiding her toward an elaborate birthday cake.

Evelyn watched as Cassandra assisted her mother with the candles and cake cutting.

As slices were distributed, each former student reintroduced themselves and offered birthday wishes.

Seeing Mrs. Blake again after all these years stirred something in Evelyn. Having grown up without a mother, her teacher's kindness had been the closest thing to maternal love she'd ever known.

"Evelyn, I'm so glad to see you doing well." Mrs. Blake took Evelyn's hand. "Have you ever tried finding your mother?"

Evelyn's fingers twitched at the question.

"No," she lied, forcing a smile. "I'm sure she's happy wherever she is. She wouldn't want me disturbing her."

The truth was, she'd searched desperately as a child, plastering missing person posters across town. But the world proved too vast, and her efforts fruitless.

"Being filial to your father is enough," Cassandra comforted. "You've grown into such a remarkable woman."

Evelyn had transformed from that shy, bullied girl into someone poised and confident.

Dominic approached with two glasses of juice, handing one to Evelyn with an intimacy that didn't go unnoticed.

A waiter followed, serving Mrs. Blake and Cassandra.

Cassandra's eyes darted between them, sensing there was more to their story.

A married couple joined them, their toddler immediately crawling toward Evelyn.

"My son must think you're beautiful," the mother laughed, wiping the child's drool.

Evelyn smiled. "I don't mind. I love children."

"You should have your own soon," the woman suggested kindly. "Raising children is such joy."

Dominic's hand found Evelyn's under the table, giving a reassuring squeeze.

She pulled away, surprised he'd sensed her discomfort. The topic of motherhood always brought a pang of longing.

"So, Dominic," the husband asked, "Mrs. Blake mentioned you only attended our school for a year?"

Dominic nodded without elaboration.

"I know a secret," Cassandra announced playfully. "My uncle was principal back then. He told me Upperssman Blackwood got called to his office for having a crush on a classmate!"

Evelyn's mood darkened inexplicably.

"He told my uncle he wouldn't approach her until graduation," Cassandra continued, eyes twinkling. "Even promised to marry her afterward! When my uncle said he'd regret it, Dominic insisted he'd already decided - he wanted to marry her and have children together."

Dominic didn't deny the claims.

That year, family turmoil had exiled him to their small-town school. There, he'd fallen hopelessly, helplessly in love.

With Evelyn.
###Chapter 63

Evelyn couldn't bear to listen any longer.

"I need some air." She set down her glass and stood abruptly.

The admission burned in her chest. Envy. Jealousy. Ugly emotions she'd never wanted to acknowledge.

For twenty-four years, happiness had been a foreign concept. Childhood meals were always cold. Schoolyard bullies became high school tormentors.

She'd learned early that some things were never meant for her.

Like a mother's love.

If others had to fight for it, she knew she'd never stand a chance.

Especially not with someone like Dominic Blackwood.

Adulthood brought no liberation, only heavier chains of reality.

"Evelyn, you must've committed terrible sins in your past life," they'd whispered. "That's why you're paying for them now."

The mansion had bathrooms everywhere - courtyard, first floor, second floor.

She just needed to splash water on her face.

The courtyard bathroom was occupied by unfamiliar female classmates taking selfies. "Hurry, get one of me in this stall! Celeste the movie star made out with her boyfriend right here!"

Sharing a celebrity's bathroom space seemed to thrill them.

Evelyn turned away silently.

More classmates crowded the first-floor restroom, reapplying makeup. These were the same girls who'd pulled her hair and mocked her motherless state years ago.

Time had erased their memories. Evelyn had no desire to remind them.

Standing before the second-floor mirror, she studied her pale reflection and shut her eyes.

Her phone buzzed. Robert Sinclair.

"Dad, you should be asleep." Her voice cracked.

He asked about the blind date.

"I can't see myself with a foreigner. He proposed marriage and moving overseas within minutes." She leaned against the sink. "It felt... desperate."

Her father's warmth returned through the phone. "My fault entirely. An old friend made the introduction without proper vetting. He sounds unstable."

"Just an awkward dinner." She didn't want his guilt.

After hanging up, Robert called Beatrice.

The mahjong tiles clacked as Beatrice's phone rang. Her expression hardened at the caller ID.

"Excuse me, darlings." She draped her Prada shawl over her shoulders gracefully. "Continue without me."

In the corridor's shadows, Beatrice hissed, "I told you never to call this number."

"What kind of predator did you set my daughter up with? Marriage proposals at first meeting? Moving abroad? Have you lost your mind, Beatrice?"

Robert's lung condition made his angry wheezing worse.

Silence.

"You heartless woman!" He coughed violently. "She's your flesh and blood, not some stray you can discard!"

"Robert Sinclair, you forfeited all rights to judge me when you impregnated me. From her first breath, that girl ceased being my concern. I'd adopt a hundred strays before claiming your bastard. Meeting you was my greatest regret - must I keep proving it?" The venom flowed freely.

Robert slammed the phone down.

Beatrice smirked, gazing indifferently at the moonlit gardens.

Dominic was her only child.

Everything else - everyone else - could burn.

The phone rang again. Robert's number flashed.

"Enough!" Beatrice snapped. "If you're begging for money, name your price! Just swear you'll never contact me again. To me, you're already dead!"

"Listen carefully, Beatrice." Robert's voice turned deadly calm. "I may be worthless, but I never wronged you. Hurt my daughter again, and I'll expose every skeleton in your closet with my dying breath."

He knew her game.

After two strategic divorces, Beatrice had clawed her way into T Corporation's inner circle. She'd spent years silencing her impoverished ex-husband.

Now that their daughter was grown, Beatrice feared the girl might come knocking. Shipping her abroad was the perfect solution.

"Evelyn knows nothing," Robert said. "She thinks you're dead. Keep it that way."

Beatrice exhaled. "This arrangement suits me perfectly. Don't test me, Robert."

Back in the mansion...

Evelyn exited the bathroom straight into a solid chest.

Dominic leaned against the doorframe, cigarette dangling from his fingers. His frown deepened as he studied her.

Nervous under his gaze, she murmured, "I should go."

"Wait." His large hand closed around her trembling wrist.

Before she could protest, he'd spun her around and shoved her into a dark room. The lock clicked ominously.

Pinned in the corner by his broad frame, she felt his warm breath at her ear as he undid another shirt button. "I noticed you watching me play basketball back in that small-town high school. I've wanted you since then."

Lightning shot down Evelyn's spine.

"I..." Denial died on her lips.

"Shh." His finger pressed against her mouth. "I couldn't claim you then - not when my life wasn't my own. But now?" A dark chuckle. "Now I'll spoil you rotten every damn day."

In the darkness, she couldn't see his expression, only felt his heat as he captured her lips, tasting her like the sweetest addiction.
###Chapter 64

No woman alive could resist such a heartfelt confession.

From the very start of any relationship, what women truly crave is genuine care and unwavering security.

Evelyn understood perfectly that Dominic was born into privilege. The woman he'd eventually marry must come from an equally prestigious family.

Sadly, she lacked such distinguished lineage.

Their love had been doomed from the beginning.

Had this confession come years earlier, it would have only led to heartbreak. Back then, he'd been bound by familial obligations, lacking independence. Too many variables stood between them.

Such circumstances would have only deepened their pain.

Perhaps they could have carried on in secret.

But clandestine love exhausts the soul. No matter how passionate the beginning, reality would have eroded their bond until nothing remained but surrender and separation.

Leaving two shattered hearts with no solace, no amount of tears ever enough to heal the wounds.

But the Dominic Blackwood of today was different.

Vibrant. Seasoned. Unshakable. He now held T Corporation firmly in his grasp - wielding absolute power while his family depended on him.

The choice of life partner was entirely his to make.

"Thank you..."

The words slipped from her lips before she realized.

Evelyn returned his kiss with awkward, unpracticed movements.

Tears began flowing unbidden.

Dominic tasted the salt on her lips. His smoldering gaze locked onto her as he broke the kiss.

She still couldn't meet his eyes.

With gentle pressure beneath her chin, he compelled her to face the intensity of his stare.

Her pulse raced. As her eyes adjusted to the dim light, she saw the raw possessiveness in his expression. His commanding presence and masculine aura were intoxicating.

"Why the tears?" His voice was velvet as he brushed his lips against her damp cheek.

Evelyn's lashes fluttered. "I just... can't believe someone like you would want someone like me."

Happiness had come too suddenly. It felt surreal, like a dream she never wanted to end. Even knowing it was real, part of her feared waking up.

She'd gladly die in such a dream.

Dominic's next kiss was fiercer - demanding, possessive. He needed her to feel his reality, to know his soul burned for her still.

The fire between them hadn't dimmed.

His ardor remained undiminished.

The kiss lasted until she whimpered, until she trembled against him.

Evelyn was powerless against his passion.

Mindful of overwhelming her, Dominic gentled the kiss, soothing her swollen lips with tender caresses.

When they descended later, he waited before following.

At her request, he gave her ten minutes' head start. She feared gossip if they left together.

Though Dominic cared nothing for rumors, he acquiesced. For now, he'd respect her need for discretion.

Evelyn bid farewell first to Mrs. Blake and Cassandra, then to several classmates before finally exiting the mansion.

"Sure you don't want company? Little rabbit shouldn't wander alone with wolves about," Cassandra teased at the doorway.

Evelyn flushed.

"Ah, I see..." Cassandra's knowing smirk deepened Evelyn's blush.

From the second floor, Dominic watched Evelyn depart, his gaze tracking the slow march of time on his watch.

Precisely ten minutes later, he descended.

After arranging transportation for Mrs. Blake, he headed to his car.

Several hopeful women lingered, eager for even a moment of his attention - a handshake, an introduction, perhaps his number.

But his icy demeanor deterred all approaches.

The Range Rover pulled away.

Evelyn had barely walked fifty meters when headlights approached.

The car stopped. A tall figure emerged.

"I could've managed," she murmured, still unaccustomed to his attentiveness.

Dominic opened her door, hands hovering protectively at her waist as if she might break.

Once seated, she looked up at him.

He stood framed in the doorway, all lean muscle and perfect angles. Leaning in, he captured her lips once more.

'So this is how it's done...'

Evelyn surrendered to the kiss.

When it ended, Dominic circled to the driver's seat. Buckling her in, he grasped her hand while steering effortlessly with the other.

Silence filled the car.

Evelyn focused on the heat of his palm, her heartbeat erratic.

At a red light, she stared fixedly ahead.

'What is this feeling?'

Relief came when they finally reached her neighborhood.

Parking at her building, Dominic made no move to leave. Every second apart already felt like torture.

"I should go. Drive safely." Her voice was barely audible.

"Not yet."

His grip tightened. The car's dim interior hid her blush.

Her pulse raced.

'What now?'

She had no experience with such moments.

Nathan had never made her feel this way.

Her phone chose that moment to ring.

"I... I should get this."

She pulled away, cheeks burning.

Olivia's voice came through: "Evie, there's a car parked below. I saw movement inside - was that you? Is your date keeping you there? Should I come down?"

"No! I'm coming up now!" Ending the call, Evelyn gave Dominic a flustered nod before practically fleeing the vehicle.

Blackwood Manor.

Alexander and Isabella exchanged glances as their father returned unusually early - and in unusually high spirits.

"Sleeping?" Dominic texted from the sofa.

"Daddy, what are you doing?" Isabella eyed his uncharacteristically soft expression.

'Has hell frozen over?'

Ignoring his daughter, Dominic read Evelyn's reply: "Still awake. You?"

"Me too." His response was immediate.

Then silence.

No further messages came.

Evelyn grew shy, uncertain what to say next.

Dominic needed clarity. His fingers moved decisively: 'From this moment forward, one nod from you and I'll become your husband.'

He sent the message, heart pounding.
###Chapter 65

Reginald Blackwood stood in the courtyard leaning on his cane, watching from a distance.

When his grandson returned with that peculiar expression, the old man immediately sensed something was different. His wild grandson had finally found himself a girlfriend!

Isabella crept up behind her father. Standing on tiptoes, she peeked over his shoulder.

"Daddy, I didn't know you used WeChat," she said in her childish voice.

Isabella knew Great-grandpa, Grandma Beatrice, Grandma Margaret, and Uncle Julian all used WeChat - everyone except Daddy. She'd never seen him use it before.

Dominic sat stiffly on the sofa, his brow furrowed as he stared intensely at his phone screen.

Still no reply from Evelyn.

'Is that a rejection?'

Just then, Julian came downstairs. Hearing Dominic had a WeChat account, he approached in surprise. "Damn, you don't even have a profile picture," he commented, peeking over Dominic's shoulder.

Dominic quickly switched off the screen showing his chat with Evelyn, his expression darkening.

'Why isn't she responding?'

"Talking to a girl?" Julian sprawled on the opposite sofa, the picture of a spoiled rich boy with his feet on the table. His eyes gleamed as he studied his brother's stony face. "Her profile pic is one of those cutesy cartoon avatars girls love. Why so grumpy? Did she reject you?"

The eavesdropping old man frowned deeper.

Julian launched into his analysis: "So you're chasing her and she's playing hard to get? Wow...what kind of woman turns down a catch like you? Don't tell me she's using your interest to boost her own status?"

He knew his brother had always been ascetic and distant, especially with women. Now that Dominic had finally fallen, Julian feared his powerful brother might get played.

He'd seen how gold diggers operated - first aiming for marriage, then settling for money when that failed. To Julian, all women were the same.

Dominic set down his silent phone. "Shallow," he muttered.

"You won't find a woman who isn't these days. Look at me - I can't even find anyone decent lately. Each one's worse than the last," Julian said, thinking he was commiserating.

"I meant you're shallow." Dominic's eyes were dark pools of ink.

Julian froze mid-reach for his cigarette!

His brother had clearly been bewitched by some vixen to turn against family!

"Give me that..."

At Evelyn's apartment, Olivia had snatched her phone.

Noticing Evelyn's flustered reaction, Olivia's eyes widened as she read the messages. "Evie! What's gotten into you? Is this man really that amazing? You're blushing just from one meeting!"

Evelyn finally saw Dominic's message:

"From this moment forward, just say the word, and I'll become your husband whenever you wish."

Love should be a sweet, gradual process.

Most men's promises like this were half-truths not to be taken seriously - just impulsive words.

But Evelyn believed Dominic meant every syllable.

She looked up at Olivia nervously. She couldn't hide this budding relationship from her best friend and roommate forever.

"That wasn't my blind date," Evelyn admitted. "The blind date didn't work out."

Olivia was stunned.

'If not the blind date, then who?'

"My brother was wrong, but your breakup was recent..." Olivia tread carefully. "Has someone been pursuing you since then? And...you like him too?"

Evelyn nodded.

"Are you sure you don't want to wait? What if he's a player?"

Seeing how messy this sounded, Evelyn explained everything.

Olivia's jaw dropped.

After gaping at Evelyn for a full minute, she finally processed the shocking news.

"Our...our boss? Mr. Blackwood? The CEO of T Corporation?" Olivia squeaked.

Evelyn curled into the sofa, silent.

"Evie! That's our boss! You hit the jackpot! No, no, that sounds crass. What's the right word? You've landed a...ugh, I can't even think straight!" Olivia was practically vibrating with excitement.

"Reply to him quick - the boss is probably waiting anxiously." Olivia shoved the phone back. "My bad for teasing you and taking your phone."

As Evelyn typed her reply, she remembered Nathan's proposal words:

"Evelyn, you must understand. No man has loved you longer or more deeply than I have..."

Now she knew that was false.

There was another man who'd loved her longer - since before she even understood romantic love.

At Blackwood Manor, Dominic lay awake. After tossing and turning, he got up to drink water. The second time, he used the bathroom. The third time, he smoked on the balcony.

Each time, his eyes darted to his silent phone.

On his fourth trip to the balcony, Dominic lit another cigarette, frowning deeply. 'Was I too pushy?'

The business adage "it's not a sale if you're forcing it" came to mind.

With nicotine calming him, he resolved to be more aloof with her - not too indulgent, not too attentive.

If she messaged, he wouldn't reply immediately.

Buzz.

His phone vibrated.

Dominic turned to see the screen light up in the dark bedroom.

He rushed back so eagerly he banged his thigh against the bed frame. Wincing, he grabbed the phone.

"Okay." Evelyn had sent a voice message.

Despite his resolution, Dominic immediately held down the voice button, his tone rough from smoking: "Let's watch the sunrise tomorrow."

"Okay..."

Her soft voice melted his stern expression.

Love's first taste left Dominic sleepless.

At 3 AM, he grabbed his car keys.

Julian, just back from clubbing, yawned as he saw his brother meticulously dressed in a suit. "Ghost hour and you're going somewhere?"

Ignoring him, Dominic drove off.

Julian watched the sports car vanish, shaking his head. "Definitely a girl. Taking the sports car out at 3 AM? What else could it be?"
###Chapter 66

Evelyn stepped out of her apartment complex just before dawn.

Dominic stood waiting by his sports car, his silhouette sharp against the streetlights.

Every fiber of his being had been anticipating this moment since midnight. When she appeared, he wordlessly opened the passenger door and pressed a steaming latte into her hands.

Even in summer, the predawn air carried a chill.

The warmth of the cup seeped into Evelyn's fingers as she slid into the leather seat.

She'd promised herself she'd stay awake to keep him company during the drive. But exhaustion won, and her eyelids grew heavy within minutes.

Dominic focused on the empty streets as the sports car purred through sleeping neighborhoods. Twenty minutes later, they arrived at Blackwood Enterprises headquarters.

He checked his watch. 4:15 AM.

Gazing at Evelyn's peaceful sleeping face, he couldn't bring himself to wake her. There would be other sunrises.

Then a passing truck blared its horn.

Evelyn jolted awake.

Dominic shot a glare at the retreating vehicle before softening his expression. "We're here. The rooftop."

Still disoriented, Evelyn blinked at the imposing skyscraper before them.

As they exited the car, she suddenly felt warmth envelop her shoulders. Dominic had draped his jacket over her.

"I'm fine," she protested, touched by his thoughtfulness but unwilling to inconvenience him.

"Adults look after children," he said firmly, adjusting the jacket. "Especially sleepy ones."

The scent of his cologne clung to the fabric as they rode the elevator up.

The city stretched endlessly below them at 4:30 AM - a sea of twinkling lights Evelyn had never witnessed from this vantage point.

Then came the first golden streaks across the horizon, painting the skyline in liquid gold.

A breeze played with Evelyn's hair as she smiled unconsciously.

Dominic watched the sunrise reflected in her eyes. "I don't remember you smiling like this before."

His arms encircled her from behind as he buried his face in her hair, breathing deeply.

"Give me your lifetime," he murmured against her neck. "I'll never let tears touch your face again. If they do, hold me accountable."

As the sun crested the skyline, he turned her to face him and captured her lips.

Evelyn hesitated only a moment before sliding her arms around his waist, returning the kiss with tentative passion.

Dominic's control shattered at her response. His hands roamed her back through the thin fabric of her dress as the kiss deepened.

"Mm..." Evelyn eventually pulled back, overwhelmed.

He'd pressed her against the railing, his body hot and demanding against hers.

By 6 AM, her lips were swollen from his relentless attention.

"Even before I had you, I loved you," Dominic growled between kisses. "Now that you're mine, that love only grows stronger."

They descended in the elevator, Evelyn too flustered to meet his gaze.

The building remained empty at this hour.

Back in the car, Dominic announced, "Come with me to pick up Alexander and Isabella. We're taking them to my uncle's."

Evelyn touched her tender lips. "You should go alone. I should head home."

She'd never experienced such intensity before - not even with Nathan. Dominic kissed and touched her with possessive certainty that left her trembling.

"What are you afraid of?" he challenged. "You'll meet my family eventually."

The thought terrified her. The Blackwoods were old money - the foundation of the city's elite. Dominic's father's scandalous second marriage to a socialite had nearly toppled their empire.

When the twins saw Evelyn, they swarmed her like ducklings, clinging to her legs.

Dominic's stern expression made them cower. "Get in the car. Now."

Isabella pouted but obeyed.

Evelyn didn't know her delayed text reply had kept Dominic awake all night, swinging between fury and desire.

As she settled the children in back, Isabella suddenly gasped. "Aunt Evelyn! Your lips are all red and puffy!"

The little girl rummaged in her backpack. "Here's my special mosquito bite cream! It works super fast!"

Evelyn accepted the ointment wordlessly.

Dominic caught her eye in the rearview mirror, his gaze dark with satisfaction at the visible proof of their passion.

Blushing, Evelyn turned to stare out the window.
###Chapter 67

The morning sun painted the sky in golden hues as Dominic, Evelyn, and their twins Alexander and Isabella stopped at a quaint café for breakfast. Evelyn fidgeted with her blazer sleeve, painfully aware of how mismatched she looked beside the impeccably dressed CEO.

"At least I wore office attire today," she thought, relieved she wouldn't need to change before work after their sunrise excursion. If anyone stared, she prayed they'd assume she was just his assistant.

The children visibly relaxed when Dominic stepped away to the restroom. Isabella smeared strawberry jam across her toast and confided, "Aunt Eve, Daddy throws tantrums worse than I do. He made me cry three times last week."

Alexander nodded solemnly. "He's emotionally constipated. We've tried interventions, but he refuses to acknowledge his issues."

Evelyn stifled a laugh, dabbing jam from Isabella's chin with a napkin.

Dominic's return shattered their camaraderie. "What's so amusing?" he demanded, jealousy lacing his voice.

Isabella stabbed her toast dramatically. "Our fun evaporated when you came back. I was telling Aunt Eve about your emotional abuse."

"Aunt Eve shouldn't marry you," the little girl continued with heartbreaking sincerity. "You'll make her cry buckets."

Evelyn nodded gravely. "Duly noted."

Dominic sipped his perfectly tempered milk, then swapped cups with Evelyn. "Yours is too hot," he murmured.

The twins exchanged bewildered glances. Since when did Daddy notice anyone's comfort? His mood swings lately were giving them whiplash.

Thirty minutes later, they departed with the children walking ahead, whispering conspiratorially. Dominic's hand settled possessively on Evelyn's waist.

"Stop," she hissed, scanning for paparazzi. Though Dominic maintained a pristine public image, one photo with her could shatter that. She couldn't bear becoming his liability.

His lips brushed her ear. "I'll stop when you're in my bed."

Evelyn's cheeks burned as she hurried toward the children. At twenty-four, she understood exactly what making her cry in bed entailed.

The drive to Dominic's uncle's estate stretched endlessly. Before dropping off the twins, his uncle called - they were already waiting in the courtyard when they arrived.

"Granduncle!" Isabella sprinted into the elderly man's arms while Alexander maintained dignified distance, avoiding hugs in the summer heat.

The uncle's gaze locked onto Evelyn with unsettling intensity. "Hello," she greeted politely.

"His secretary," Evelyn clarified when Dominic hesitated. She wasn't ready for girlfriend labels with his family. Dominic allowed the fib, though his jaw tightened.

As they departed, Evelyn mentioned, "I'm taking my father for his hospital check-up this afternoon. You can drop me downtown."

"I'll come," Dominic insisted.

"My father doesn't know about you yet." She bit her lip. Convincing her dad to accept a billionaire son-in-law would require finesse.

Dominic caressed her nape. "I'll prove not all wealthy men are monsters."

Meanwhile, at the estate, the uncle watched the twins play with orange tabbies, frowning. "That girl... she looks familiar."

His wife rolled her eyes. "Pretty secretaries are a dime a dozen."

"No," he insisted. "She resembles someone from our past. The likeness is uncanny."

"Millions share similar features," his wife countered. "That actress Miranda Yates looks more like Katherine's daughter Yvette than her own sister!"

The uncle turned away, the conversation clearly going nowhere.
###Chapter 68

Frederick Lockwood stood with his hands clasped behind his back as he entered the living room.

Eleanor Lockwood held her reading glasses in one hand and a watering can in the other, carefully tending to the blooming orchids on the windowsill.

The antique cabinet in the living room was crafted from dark mahogany with intricate peony carvings. Each delicate petal appeared almost lifelike under the morning light.

He opened the cabinet door.

A collection of yellowed newspapers occupied the left shelf - Frederick's lifelong habit of preserving historical editions.

Resting atop the pile lay a leather-bound photo album.

Frederick retrieved the album and flipped through the pages until he found the photograph that had been troubling him.

The faded image showed four young people - a younger version of himself and three women in their twenties.

In the center stood Beatrice Lockwood wearing fashionable red bell-bottoms of that era, though her smile seemed forced compared to the others.

To Beatrice's left stood Eleanor in her youth.

On the right was Beatrice's childhood friend Genevieve Prescott, her white sundress and elaborate braids perfectly preserved by the photograph.

Though twenty-eight years had passed since that moment was captured, Frederick's memory remained sharp.

After prolonged examination, Frederick wondered if he was imagining things.

A secretary couldn't possibly be connected to someone of importance.

So absorbed was he in thought that he didn't notice Eleanor had finished watering the plants.

Eleanor's expression darkened when she saw the open album. She pointed accusingly at Genevieve's image. "Still pining after her after all these years?"

"Don't be ridiculous!" Frederick snapped the album shut and shoved it back into the cabinet.

"If you're going to stare at another woman's picture, at least have the decency to admit it!" Eleanor's voice rose. "Genevieve Prescott is the Provincial Committee Secretary's wife now! You should be ashamed - a man in his thirties mooning over a girl twenty years his junior!"

Frederick turned away without responding. At his age, petty arguments weren't worth his time.

Genevieve had been Beatrice's closest friend. Though she'd never returned his youthful affections, Frederick bore no resentment.

She'd married well to a decorated soldier and lived happily. Her husband's current prestigious position was well-deserved.

Frederick's heart ached for his sister Beatrice. Compared to her childhood friends, her life had been far more complicated and difficult.

Paramount Hospital.

Dominic Blackwood drove Evelyn Sinclair to her appointment.

"Drive safely," Evelyn said as she closed the car door.

Dominic watched her slender figure disappear through the hospital doors before making a call. "Contact Dr. Whitmore immediately. There's a lung cancer patient named Sinclair requiring special attention."

Entering the hospital, Evelyn felt uneasy.

When her father had liver cancer years ago, she'd only learned of it after he was hospitalized.

This unfamiliar process left her unsettled.

The sprawling hospital complex, built during wartime with thick concrete walls, felt labyrinthine.

"Miss Sinclair?" The receptionist greeted her unexpectedly. "For Mr. Robert Sinclair?"

Evelyn nodded in surprise.

"Right this way." The receptionist led her courteously to a specialist's waiting area.

Evelyn knew Dominic had arranged this.

Olivia Kensington arrived moments later. "Has Uncle Robert come yet?"

Evelyn shook her head.

Her father had insisted on coming alone, clearly wanting to avoid potential conflicts with Victoria and Sophia.

"Don't look so worried," Olivia said helplessly. "Some things in life we can't change."

Five years ago, Evelyn had watched her father suffer through liver cancer. Now lung cancer threatened him anew.

But Evelyn had learned resilience through hardship.

At ten-thirty, Robert called.

"Evelyn, I won't arrive until one. You should return to work first."

"I'll wait," Evelyn insisted.

Olivia, overhearing, suggested, "Let's get coffee outside. Better than sitting in this depressing place."

They took the stairs to avoid crowded elevators.

On the third-floor landing, they encountered Sophia Montgomery looking distressed, with Patricia Kensington speaking urgently to her.

"Mom? What are you doing here?" Olivia asked sharply.

Sophia glared at Evelyn before storming toward the OB-GYN department.

Patricia grabbed her arm. "Marie, you can't be angry at an innocent child! It's Langdon family blood!"

Olivia's expression darkened. "Go ahead, I'll catch up."

Evelyn continued downstairs, wanting no part of Langdon family drama.

Sophia's tearful voice carried clearly. "Aunt Patricia, it's not that I don't want this baby, but Nathan refuses to acknowledge it! He says it's caused too much harm already!"

The unspoken accusation toward Evelyn hung heavily in the air.

Patricia's voice rose indignantly. "My foolish son was deceived by that scheming woman! You're both victims here!"

"If it were your decision, what would you do? How can my son reject his own flesh and blood? That shameless woman should be the one suffering, not you!"

The public confrontation drew curious onlookers.

Olivia took one look at her delusional mother and distressed sister-in-law before slapping Sophia hard across the face.
###Chapter 69

A sharp slap echoed through the room.

Olivia Kensington screamed at the same time, "You're dead, girl! How dare you hit your sister-in-law?! What if you hurt the baby in her stomach?"

"I'd rather die than carry this child..."

Sophia Montgomery's tears might have been real—or maybe they were fake. After uttering those words, she stormed out, clutching her reddened cheek.

Patricia Kensington didn’t even have time to scold her own daughter. She rushed after Sophia, desperation in her voice.

"Sophia, slow down! You're carrying my grandchild! I'll let you decide! You said you don’t feel secure after marriage, that even having a baby doesn’t guarantee anything. So tell me—what do you need to feel safe?"

Anxious to keep her future grandchild, Patricia chased after Sophia like a woman possessed.

"Is this witch ever going to stop? Does she want to ruin our family that badly? All this drama just to force my parents into buying her a house?"

Evelyn Sinclair exhaled sharply, grinding her teeth in frustration.

Her own mother was being manipulated by a conniving gold-digger.

As she descended the stairs, Evelyn muttered under her breath. "How could my idiot brother fall for this she-devil? After rich men used and dumped her, she had the brains to target a fool like him. She better stay away from me unless she wants another beating."

Fury burned through her. She wanted to tear Sophia apart.

Outside the hospital, a milk tea shop provided temporary refuge.

Evelyn slumped into a chair, whispering bitterly, "I warned Nathan to stay away from Sophia when he went abroad. But no—he didn’t listen. From friends to lovers, and now she’s pregnant."

Olivia sighed, lowering her head helplessly.

At eleven, Dominic Blackwood called.

Evelyn glanced at Olivia before answering, her voice quiet.

"Are you with someone?" His deep voice rumbled through the phone.

"Yeah." She wasn’t used to talking to him in front of others. Less than a day into their relationship, she still didn’t know how to act.

"Have you eaten?"

"I ordered, but it hasn’t arrived yet. I’m with Olivia."

Olivia mouthed from the side, Is that our boss?

Evelyn nodded.

Dominic asked about the hospital situation. He wanted to meet her, but Evelyn explained her father hadn’t arrived yet. It would be too shocking for Robert Sinclair to see him like this.

Reluctantly, Dominic backed off.

At one in the afternoon, Robert finally arrived.

Thanks to Dominic’s connections, the hospital staff treated him like royalty. The private ward was the best available, with a dedicated male nurse, a female nurse, and a top specialist overseeing his case.

When Robert changed into the hospital gown, he hesitated. "Eve, this..."

"Dad, a colleague knows someone here, so..." The excuse sounded weak even to her.

Robert didn’t press further.

The examination began, forcing Evelyn to step outside.

Olivia leaned against the wall, whispering, "You didn’t tell him about Dominic?"

Evelyn shook her head, sinking into a chair. "If he knew, he’d refuse treatment until he got answers. He’d assume my boss is toying with me."

"Honestly..." Olivia hesitated, then continued, "Your dad’s being extreme. If what Sophia’s mother said is true, your mom left him for a rich man. That’s why he hates them. But not all wealthy guys are heartless players. Unless your mom was tricked—and your dad knew."

Evelyn stayed silent.

She always suspected her father knew more than he let on.

But she never asked. His health was fragile, and over time, her curiosity about her biological mother faded.

They sat in silence. Olivia pulled out her iPad, offering one earbud. "Watch this. Distract yourself."

Evelyn rarely watched dramas.

After a few minutes, she yanked the earbud out, horrified. "This is immoral! A brother and sister in a relationship?"

"What? No!" Olivia paused the show. "They’re not related by blood. You missed the first episode."

Reluctantly, Evelyn kept watching.

Robert’s tests lasted two hours. More were scheduled for the next morning.

Seeing him confined to a hospital bed twisted Evelyn’s heart.

At three, Olivia was called back to the office.

Once her father was settled, Evelyn left to handle personal errands before working overtime to compensate for her absence.

Abigail Thornton knew about her relationship with Dominic, but their department head didn’t. Work remained separate from her private life—so tasks piled up.

Evelyn didn’t complain.

By 7:30 PM, the office was empty.

The city lights glittered outside as she rubbed her temples and headed to the pantry for tea.

A noise made her freeze.

Usually fearless, the deserted office felt eerier than an empty home.

Footsteps approached—steady, masculine.

She set the cup down, turning just as a solid body pressed her against the counter.

A searing kiss landed on her neck.

"You’re here?" She hadn’t expected him.

Alexander and Isabella went to his uncle’s. How’d he get back so fast?

"Let’s get married now." Dominic’s lips claimed hers.

Evelyn melted into his warmth. In the cramped pantry, only the sound of their ragged breaths and the slick slide of lips filled the silence.

Her knees weakened. She clung to his shoulders, her timid fingers tracing the hard planes of his waist.

The kiss deepened, turning feverish.

As his hands roamed, her mind blanked. A taut string inside her threatened to snap.

"Ah—" She arched, overwhelmed.

When his mouth trailed lower, she gasped.

"No... not there..."

Her moan was swallowed by another kiss.

Her body trembled, pleasure coiling tight.

His breath hitched. "Do you want it?"
###Chapter 70

Evelyn's mind snapped back to reality at Dominic's words. She shoved him away forcefully.

She managed to slip from under his body when his attention wavered.

Dominic's dark eyes burned crimson. Every inch of him radiated scorching heat. With predatory grace, he closed the distance between them in two strides.

His powerful arms encircled her waist, spinning her around until they stood chest to chest. After stumbling backward, he pinned her against the deep burgundy armchair.

"Changed your mind?" His husky whisper sent shivers down her spine as his overwhelming desire enveloped her completely.

Evelyn couldn't deny her attraction to this man since their relationship began. But that didn't mean she was ready to cross this line so soon.

"Mmm..."

Her attempted protest died against his demanding lips. The persistent suction made the base of her tongue ache.

The pantry echoed with their passionate exchange. In the dim lighting, Dominic looked more dangerously alluring than ever.

She drowned in his intoxicating scent - a mix of expensive cologne and masculine musk. The sexual tension between them crackled like live wires.

"I... still have... reports to finish..." The mention of work made him growl in frustration. Before she could continue, he lifted her effortlessly from the chair.

Without breaking contact, he pressed her against the wide industrial cooler.

Condensation seeped through her blouse, chilling her bare skin beneath.

Dominic molded his body against hers, leaving no space between them. His rough hands explored every curve through the fabric.

When he reached her most sensitive areas, he showed no restraint.

Evelyn gasped as the air rushed from her lungs. Her fitted dress became his next victim - torn away with impatient hands.

Dominic's control hung by a thread. Years of pent-up desire threatened to consume them both. She fit perfectly against him, so soft where he was hard.

"Don't fight it, darling..." His strained voice betrayed his desperation as he held her firmly in place.

She felt his arousal pressing insistently against her thigh. The intimate contact made her tremble.

Between feverish kisses, Dominic unbuckled his belt with one hand.

The cold metal buckle brushed her stomach.

"Too fast..." Evelyn wasn't inexperienced - she'd been intimate before. But this intensity overwhelmed her.

They'd only been together officially for a day. Was this normal progression?

Dominic alternated between gentle nips and punishing bites along her neck. Each touch sent electric currents through her body.

When he suddenly spun her around, she barely had time to register his flushed face and heaving chest before facing the cooler again.

His scorching palms branded her skin. She felt like prey caught in a predator's trap.

"You'll enjoy this, Evelyn..." His promise vibrated against her neck.

His calloused hand slid lower, igniting trails of fire across her stomach.

Panic and anticipation warred within her. She whimpered against the cold surface, her entire body trembling.

Dominic worshipped her neck with open-mouthed kisses. His ragged breathing filled the small space.

"Please... stop..."

She couldn't handle his size. Though not her first time, his sheer magnitude overwhelmed her.

The veins in Dominic's arms stood out in stark relief as he restrained himself. Seeing her distress, he reluctantly slowed.

Turning her gently, he captured her lips in a searing kiss meant to soothe. But her body only grew more responsive.

Tears welled in Evelyn's eyes as pleasure and pain blurred together. She raked her nails down his back, surrendering completely.

Dominic kissed away her tears, silently vowing to claim her in every lifetime. "Did I hurt you? Should I call a doctor?"

She shook her head, avoiding his piercing gaze.

"Rest for now," he murmured, tucking a loose strand behind her ear.

"My reports..."

Dominic understood her stubbornness. He gathered her belongings efficiently before taking her hand. "Come with me."

Her flushed cheeks betrayed her lingering arousal as she followed obediently.
###Chapter 71

Their fingers intertwined as they moved through the corporate halls, descending in the elevator until they emerged into the night air.

Dominic held the car door open for Evelyn. Once she settled inside, he turned away, lighting a cigarette with a troubled expression.

The crisp evening wind played with his sharp features, yet couldn't cool the fire burning beneath his skin.

From their first encounter, she'd ignited something primal in him. He recalled spotting her petite frame at the basketball courts - that delicate face stirring protective instincts he never knew he possessed. She'd been so slight, almost fragile-looking, like she hadn't been eating properly.

Yet as days passed, it was this underdeveloped girl from the neighboring middle school who occupied his thoughts, not the curvier high school girls throwing themselves at him.

Small towns tolerated teenage romance more than cities. Teachers kept watch, but not with A City's oppressive scrutiny. The temptation to pursue her grew unbearable.

One Friday dusk, he followed Evelyn walking home. Lost in her own world, she never noticed the tall high schooler shadowing her steps. As they neared her house, vicious whispers reached his ears.

"Old man Robert's lost his mind promising Evelyn to Theodore Wilson. Even if my boy couldn't find a wife, we'd never accept that Sinclair girl..."

"Doesn't take after her father at all. Must've inherited everything from her mother - in every way!"

"Exactly! She'll probably turn out just as unstable. Who'd marry a madwoman? What if she runs off with some rich man two years into marriage?"

"My son said she's already seducing wealthy classmates for free meals - a little temptress in ninth grade!"

That day Dominic understood Evelyn's perpetual silence.

The neighbors' cruelty wasn't hidden. He heard every word, and Evelyn must have endured this daily.

Though he wanted to claim her, he considered the consequences. After witnessing the street's venom, he reluctantly stepped back.

Not because he believed their slander about her becoming like her supposedly promiscuous mother.

He refused to worsen her reputation by association.

She deserved purity, not more gossip.

His own background was complicated enough - wealth, power, college courses already mastered. He'd repeated grades just to stay in that judgmental town longer. Rumors couldn't touch him, but they'd destroy her.

The self-conscious girl never noticed his lingering gazes, even when teachers did.

Later, he learned her father had remarried and moved to A City, inexplicably leaving his daughter behind. As an outsider, his opinion meant nothing.

The urge to rescue her grew daily, but reality intervened. Taking her away meant confronting his parents first.

Two dependent teens together would be labeled reckless elopers.

She'd become exactly what the neighbors predicted - a gold-digger fleeing with a rich boy.

Abandoning that fantasy, Dominic focused on establishing himself, becoming someone she could truly lean on.

If only she'd hurry up and grow older.

That five-year age gap stretched like decades.

At nineteen, drunken nights at friends' houses exposed him to adult films. Learning about intimacy, his mind conjured forbidden images of that delicate girl...

His possessiveness intensified.

Until his grandfather abruptly pulled him from school that winter, sending him away without explanation.

As he gained independence in subsequent years, his first act was arranging discreet protection for Evelyn.

Finally, she reached adulthood.

Moving to A City to live with her father and stepmother brought some happiness, though shadows remained. Robert treated her well, and A City High's students proved kinder.

Then his informant reported a college boy showing Evelyn special attention - weekend study sessions at his home, claiming his sister was Evelyn's classmate.

Before Dominic could investigate, news came: Robert had liver cancer.

That afternoon, Evelyn left school crying silently, tears streaking her cheeks unnoticed.

Dominic waited at the gates in his Bentley after cutting a meeting short. She walked right past his offered tissue, consumed by her father's diagnosis.

When she finally registered his presence, a distracted "thank you" was all she offered before rushing to the hospital.

Robert's treatment required substantial funds. Some sick opportunist introduced a fifty-year-old man to Evelyn - offering half a million if she'd bear his child.

Dominic's face twisted in disgust hearing his priceless girl reduced to a transaction.

Now she was finally, openly his.

If her tightness hadn't restrained him, he'd have buried himself completely inside her, marking every cell with his devotion.

"What are you thinking about?" Dominic asked as they left the corporate tower for his hotel.

Evelyn shook her head.

The exclusive suite felt intimately familiar, clearly his private domain. She opened her laptop to work, though she'd have preferred finishing at the office or home. Dominic had insisted on her company after hours.

Searching her bag for a ruler, she was suddenly lifted onto the bed by the balcony door.

"Let me see where I hurt you," he murmured, fingers working at her dress buttons. He remembered forcing his way despite resistance, worried he'd caused damage.
###Chapter 72

Evelyn's cheeks, which had just returned to their normal color, flushed crimson once more.

"I'm fine," she murmured.

She attempted to wriggle free from Dominic's embrace, her delicate brows knitting together. The heat radiating from his body made her nervous - afraid he might lose control again. But her struggles proved futile against his strength as he pinned her against the bed's edge.

His hand traveled downward.

Her eyes widened in alarm, uncertain of his intentions.

A sudden coolness brushed her thighs.

The sound of fabric tearing made her gasp.

Trapped beneath his smoldering gaze, Evelyn found her lips captured once more in a searing kiss. Dominic pressed his muscular frame against her, his mouth moving with relentless hunger.

Fear twisted her stomach as she anticipated the familiar pain, her hands pushing weakly against his chest.

What Dominic did next made Evelyn's blood rush to her face.

He examined her.

To his relief, she bore no injuries from their earlier encounter - only temporary discomfort remained.

"Don't...don't look," she pleaded, desperately tugging the blanket to cover herself. The thought of being so exposed made her want to disappear.

Dominic's thorough inspection confirmed she was unharmed. Guilt would have consumed him had he hurt her.

His large hands skimmed over her pale thighs, sending tremors through her exhausted body. Another moan escaped her lips as his kiss deepened...

Mortification seeped from every pore.

Evelyn felt ready to faint.

"Let's try something different," Dominic murmured, his voice thick with desire. "I'll make sure you enjoy it this time."

Her eyes flew open at his bold touch. Immediately, she squeezed them shut again, teeth sinking into her lower lip as her entire body tensed.

Her fingers clutched at his arms, wrinkling his expensive suit.

Toes curling in embarrassment, she twisted the sheets into knots beneath her.

Dominic lay beside her, still fully dressed in his tailored suit and polished shoes - the picture of daytime professionalism. Only the pressure of his muscular frame against hers and the demanding press of his lips betrayed his true intentions.

"Mmm...ah..."

Soon, Evelyn lost herself completely, her consciousness floating away under his skilled touch.

Her body arched against him, her restless legs tangling the sheets.

A sudden tension gripped her.

"Stop...please..."

Shame flooded her as her body responded shamelessly to him.

Within minutes, Evelyn reached her limit. Sweat dampened her forehead as she writhed, her moans muffled against the silk sheets.

"Finished already?" Dominic's deep voice vibrated against her skin, rich and intoxicating.

Evelyn trembled violently.

As pleasure overwhelmed her, she lost all awareness, her oversensitive body reacting to even the lightest touch...

After what felt like hours of passionate kisses, Dominic finally released her.

The sound of running water came from the bathroom as he washed his hands. His long fingers worked methodically, the soap suds highlighting their strength and precision.

Dominic studied the two fingers that had pleasured her, desire darkening his eyes. Reluctantly, he wiped them clean.

Returning to the bedroom, he found Evelyn hastily dressing. He pulled her close for one last scorching kiss.

When their lips parted, a silvery strand connected them briefly.

Evelyn barely remembered getting into his car.

She'd insisted on not staying the night - Olivia would never let her hear the end of it. Yet here she was.

Was it his irresistible charm? Her own loneliness?

The black Range Rover pulled over. Dominic entered a 24-hour convenience store, heading straight for the women's section.

The cashier gaped at the striking man who'd walked in, forgetting her customer service training.

A City had no shortage of handsome men, but none compared to this tall, broad-shouldered man with razor-sharp features. Even A-list celebrities paled in comparison.

"Eighty-five yuan," the cashier stammered when Dominic placed the underwear on the counter.

He tossed down a hundred-yuan note and left without waiting for change.

The cashier stared after him, clutching the money. That icy, aristocratic man had just bought...women's underwear?

The contradiction made her dizzy.

Back in the car, Dominic handed Evelyn the package.

"What?" Her weakened fingers fumbled with the box.

She couldn't meet his eyes throughout their silent exchange.

Dominic found her shyness curious. They hadn't even gone all the way - he'd merely used his fingers.

He couldn't wait for the day she'd take all of him.

Inside the box were three pairs of underwear in styles and colors she liked. He'd remembered perfectly.

Sitting there, Evelyn burned with humiliation. The pair she'd worn now lay in tatters at the hotel...

Olivia looked surprised when Evelyn returned.

"Finished your overtime? I thought your boss kidnapped you for the night," Olivia joked, taking Evelyn's bag and laptop.

"I need to shower." Evelyn hurried to the bathroom.

Olivia hummed along to her show, applying a face mask.

Exhausted and sore, Evelyn cringed at the memory of what she'd done.

She fell asleep within minutes of hitting the bed.

When her alarm rang at 3 AM, it felt like mere seconds had passed.

Unfinished work from last night remained. Without completing it now, she'd miss her morning deadline. As her laptop booted up, a notification appeared.

An email from an unknown address.

Opening it, Evelyn gasped. Dominic had completed her work for her...

Her fingers hovered over the keyboard.

After several aborted attempts, she settled on two simple words:

'Thank you...'

With no overtime needed, Evelyn slept two more hours.

Her 5 AM alarm signaled time to visit her father before work.

She left before Olivia.

The nearly empty streets held only 24-hour pharmacies and supermarkets. Passing one, Evelyn hesitated, then entered.

"Emergency contraception, please," she whispered to the cashier.

Last night, Dominic had...

The memory of his release burning her skin made her shudder.

Pregnancy couldn't happen.

After purchasing the pills, she lingered, considering another purchase - something for the swelling...there.

Too embarrassed, she left empty-handed.
###Chapter 73

At the Blackwood Estate.

The dining table was laden with an extravagant spread of traditional breakfast dishes.

Reginald Blackwood hadn't slept properly in days. The slightest noise would jolt him awake at night. His grandson Dominic seemed determined to make a spectacle of his late-night returns.

Every time Dominic's sports car roared into the garage after midnight, the entire manor would shake with the engine's growl.

It was impossible for the old man to ignore how Dominic practically floated through the halls with restless energy, bringing the scent of night air with him.

But that was precisely the problem. The workaholic CEO who used to live at the office had suddenly stopped working late. And he wasn't at home either. "So where does he disappear to every evening?"

"Last night he came home even later than usual!"

Reginald discreetly pulled his great-grandson aside for information. The honest child delivered troubling news.

"Great-grandpa, Daddy keeps tossing all night when he's home. Uncle Julian says it's bachelor's insomnia - some male hormonal condition. I don't really understand, but if Daddy keeps losing sleep like this, he won't stay healthy..." The boy scratched his head, genuinely concerned about his father's wellbeing.

Reginald patted the child's shoulder. "Your father's health is robust. That's not what worries me. What concerns me is..."

He didn't elaborate further to the child.

Fixing Dominic with a stern look over breakfast, Reginald demanded, "Is it true you didn't come home until dawn last night?" Dominic reluctantly sipped his fresh soy milk before setting down the bowl with finality.

An attendant immediately presented his pressed suit jacket.

After shrugging into it, Dominic announced, "I'm leaving for the office. Enjoy your meal."

The old man's grip tightened on his cane. 'This grandson of mine has lived like a monk for years - only ever at home or the office. Suddenly he's acting like some reckless playboy!'

He was tempted to drug Dominic and have him examined by a physician to confirm everything still functioned properly.

Julian had been attempting to tail his brother for days. But Dominic always shook him off within blocks, leaving Julian to return home empty-handed.

If Dominic was seeing someone respectable, why not bring her home? Why all this secrecy?

Finally catching Dominic at breakfast, Reginald had hoped for answers. Instead, his eldest grandson walked out without explanation.

The more Reginald thought about it, the more suspicious he became.

'Is the girl's background so unacceptable he can't introduce her? Or is Dominic just playing games with some poor woman's heart? That's not how a Blackwood behaves!'

"Hurry up and finish eating," Reginald barked at Julian. "Then take me to the office. I need to speak with your brother."

Julian nearly choked on his congee. 'Why do I always get caught in the crossfire?'

The twins exchanged nervous glances, greasy fingers clutching fried dough sticks. They dared not reveal Daddy's possible interest in Aunt Evelyn.

Margaret Lockwood couldn't resist commenting, "Father, need I remind you how your son behaved when he was alive? Dominic is Edmund's flesh and blood. The apple never falls far. Coming home at all hours reeks of keeping company with... certain types of women."

"Mother," Julian interjected sharply, "some thoughts are better left unspoken."

An uncomfortable silence fell.

Beatrice Lockwood set down her bowl. "I've finished. Excuse me."

The children puzzled over "certain types of women." Did that mean she was especially beautiful?

But the adults understood perfectly.

Edmund Blackwood had been notorious for his affairs. After marrying Margaret, his philandering only worsened.

He'd told Margaret to content herself with being the lady of the house and ignore his extracurricular activities.

After two childless years of marriage - during which she barely saw her husband - Margaret had snapped. She'd orchestrated a trap to expose his infidelity once and for all.

That night, she'd caught Edmund in bed with the very woman now sitting at their breakfast table - Beatrice Lockwood.

Beatrice came from humble beginnings. Back then, her family barely scraped by. But she'd climbed the Blackwood ladder, pulling her relatives up with her.

Margaret remembered Beatrice's childhood friend Genevieve Prescott, who'd married into a powerful military family. Beatrice had clung to that connection, leaving her first husband to hunt bigger game.

Thus the scheming club hostess - playing the innocent victim - had manipulated Edmund into abandoning his wife. All because she'd given him the son he craved.

Margaret knew a man like Edmund didn't love women - he loved heirs. The mother of his precious son was rewarded with luxury.

Though Margaret had fought and wept, she'd ultimately surrendered. Who had legitimized Beatrice's bastard? After bringing that boy home, the failing Blackwood Enterprises had been reborn as T Corporation - Dominic Blackwood's empire.

Perhaps this was heaven's punishment for Margaret's loyalty...

Sometimes she wondered - if she'd succeeded in killing Dominic years ago, how different might her life be?

Reginald went straight to the point when he stormed into Dominic's office. Brandishing his cane, he thundered, "The Blackwoods don't tolerate degenerates! You know what your father was! I won't let history repeat itself!"

"Grandfather," Dominic calmly pushed aside the threatening cane, "what exactly am I being accused of?"

Reginald's bushy eyebrows shot up. "You dare ask? You've been slinking home at dawn for weeks!"

Julian helpfully clarified. "Grandfather thinks you're seeing... professional companionship."

Dominic, now suspected of nightly escort services, stared blankly.

"If you're not doing anything shameful," Reginald pressed, "why haven't you brought this woman home?"
###Chapter 74

Dominic's expression clearly conveyed that if he wouldn't bring the woman himself, he should at least let them meet her.

Julian had always been fascinated by the psychology of a man like his brother who'd remained celibate for over five years. How could any healthy male function normally without female companionship? It defied all logic!

"Are you saying she's not good enough for us? Imagine how that would make her feel..." The elderly patriarch studied his grandson's face carefully, watching for any sign that Dominic might be one of those playboys who slept around but secretly looked down on their partners.

Dominic realized his grandfather had no other options left. The old man probably regretted not disciplining his own son better when he had the chance. Though that man didn't deserve respect, his grandfather remained the sensible one.

This interrogation was clearly born from desperation to see him married.

"She's easily frightened. I don't want you two scaring her away." Dominic casually picked up a document, implying it wasn't about hiding her from them, but protecting her from their overwhelming personalities.

The insulted grandfather and brother exchanged glances.

"She's delicate and reserved around strangers. Shy as a rabbit. But you two..." Dominic's disdainful gaze swept over them, his frown deepening.

The grandfather, who'd been ready to strike his grandson with his cane, suddenly remembered he was supposed to be the gentle elder. He lowered his cane awkwardly, clearing his throat as he composed his features back into kindly benevolence.

Julian, the instigator, couldn't resist adding, "If she's truly as timid as you claim, I'd wager you're the one terrifying her most..."

As a grown man with normal desires, Julian understood intimacy between couples. With his brother's pent-up energy from five years of abstinence and that formidable physique, any delicate woman would be devoured whole.

'Poor girl,' Julian thought. 'After a night with Dominic, would she even have strength left to function during daylight hours?'

Evelyn spent her morning hour at the hospital.

The taxi ride to her office was perfectly timed - neither late nor too early.

When she submitted her design work, the department head was thoroughly impressed. He praised her extensively, saying her work shone with professional brilliance far beyond a novice's level - more like a decade-long master's touch.

Evelyn suspected Dominic must be that master designer.

A message popped up from Abigail: "The department head loved your design! Consider your probation period passed."

Truthfully, Abigail knew Evelyn would stay regardless of her skills. When the CEO himself intervened, no one dared object.

Another message followed: "Guess who our best designer is?"

"Who?" Evelyn replied briefly, occupied with work.

"Our CEO, obviously! His designs grace buildings across five developed countries. Even our city center library is his work. After taking over the family business and cleaning up their mess, he stopped designing professionally." Abigail's rapid typing conveyed her excitement.

Evelyn stared at her screen in shock.

That stunning library she'd admired during her first subway exploration was Dominic's creation?

"Such a pity we'll never get to see his personal sketches," Abigail lamented in another message.

Evelyn reopened the design she'd submitted - the one Dominic had drawn for her last night. She studied it intently until her phone rang.

"Dr. Harrison?" Evelyn answered softly, stepping away from the main office.

The hospital needed Robert's ID card.

"I'll deliver it this afternoon," she promised.

After finishing her morning tasks, Evelyn skipped lunch and took a taxi straight to her father and Victoria's place.

Though she dreaded seeing Victoria, she had no choice. The ID was at home, and her bedridden father couldn't retrieve it himself. She'd have to endure whatever unpleasantness awaited.

En route, Evelyn tried calling Victoria.

"The number you have dialed is currently unavailable..."

Multiple attempts yielded the same result.

Gazing at the bustling streets outside her window, Evelyn scrolled through her contacts and called Sophia instead.

"Why call me? Did Dad die? Need us to rush to his funeral?" Sophia snapped, annoyed at the interruption during her mobile game.

Evelyn ignored the sarcasm. "Are you home? I need to pick up Dad's ID card."

"I'm here. Come get it." Sophia hung up abruptly.

Evelyn frowned, bracing herself for whatever awaited at that apartment.

Meanwhile, Sophia rose from bed thoughtfully and called Nathan. "You wanted to talk? Get to my place in twenty minutes."

Nathan was out with his team leader but rushed over immediately after her call.

His mother, desperate to keep her potential grandchild, had withdrawn cash to buy Sophia an apartment - down payment paid, property under Sophia's name. Nathan nearly went mad at his mother's reckless actions.

Though Patricia later regretted trusting the unreliable Sophia, the deed was done. Her only hope was pushing for a quick marriage and safe delivery of her grandchild.

Nathan had bombarded Sophia's phone with calls that night, only to be ignored. Now that she'd initiated contact, giving him a twenty-minute ultimatum, he had no choice but to comply.

Finding the door unlocked, Nathan entered to an empty living room and bedroom. Approaching the bathroom, he called, "You in there?"

"Come in," Sophia commanded.

Nathan frowned but opened the door.

Sophia stood fresh from her bath, skin glistening with frankincense-scented droplets. Her soft body pressed against him as her wandering hands explored purposefully.

"Excited already?" She sank to her knees.

Her warm mouth closed around him.

Nathan's eyes shut involuntarily as a groan escaped his lips. His hands tangled in her hair.

She gazed up through her lashes, ensuring his pleasure before pulling away.

"Hurry up. I need to return to work," Nathan urged impatiently.

Consumed by desire, he forgot to question Sophia's sudden change from cold indifference to passionate invitation. Only one thing mattered now.

Kneeling on damp tiles, Sophia's delicate fingers worked at Nathan's belt buckle, unfastening it with practiced ease before unzipping his trousers.
###Chapter 75

Evelyn pushed open the creaky apartment door, the familiar scent of mildew and cheap perfume assaulting her senses. The place hadn't changed in five years - same peeling wallpaper, same cracked floor tiles.

She remembered her first day here.

"Meet your sister Sophia," Dad had said, patting the smirking girl's shoulder. "She's older, so she'll take care of you."

That night, Sophia "accidentally" kicked her out of bed. The metal bed frame left a gash on Evelyn's forehead that still tingled when it rained.

The bathroom door rattled.

"Faster," Nathan Kensington growled. His belt buckle clinked against the tiles. "God, you're perfect..."

Evelyn froze. The frosted glass showed two writhing shadows.

"Tell me," Sophia purred between wet sounds, "who's prettier? Me or Evelyn?"

"You. Always you," Nathan panted. "Now don't stop—"

"Then why chase her in London?" Sophia's voice turned petulant. "If I'm so much better—"

"Because you're fucking untouchable!" Nathan snapped. "Out of my league. Had to settle for her."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her purse strap. Not from hurt - from the sheer predictability of it. Nathan's affection was as disposable as takeout menus.

She moved silently to her father's bedroom. The ID card lay exactly where he'd said - beneath Victoria Montgomery's silk scarves in the dresser. The scarves still smelled of that cloying Chanel perfume.

The bathroom moans crescendoed as Evelyn turned to leave.

"Got what I needed," she announced. "Don't let me interrupt."

The glass door shuddered as Nathan slammed against it. A choked gasp followed.

Sophia emerged wrapped in a towel, lips swollen. "Enjoy the show, slut? Heard you put on quite the performance yourself with Dominic Blackwood."

Nathan fumbled with his zipper, face flushed. "Eve—"

"Already soft?" Evelyn arched a brow. "And here I thought men in their twenties had stamina."

"You bitch!" Sophia lunged, but Nathan caught her wrist.

Evelyn smiled. "At least my man doesn't go limp when someone walks in."

Nathan's face darkened. He opened his mouth, but Sophia shoved him away. "Useless!"

The taxi ride blurred past storefronts. Evelyn leaned her forehead against the cool window. Nathan's words should have stung. Instead, they felt like removing a splinter - sharp, then numb.

Her phone buzzed.

"Family dinner tonight," Dominic's voice rumbled through the receiver. "My grandfather wants to meet you."

The line crackled with unspoken implications. Evelyn exhaled. "I'll be there."

She ended the call as the city lights began to flicker on, each one a tiny rebellion against the gathering dark.
###Chapter 76

"Wait..."

Evelyn hesitated, her mind swirling with concerns.

It was only their second day officially dating Dominic. Meeting his family for dinner felt too soon.

She wasn't mentally prepared.

The stark reality of their different social statuses weighed heavily on her. Dominic came from wealth and privilege far beyond her own.

"Don't overthink it." Dominic guessed her worries. "Our family backgrounds aren't that different. If you knew mine, you'd see we're quite similar."

His reassurance left no room for refusal.

Ever since Dominic's call, Evelyn felt an invisible weight crushing her chest. She wouldn't breathe easily until this dinner was over.

Her phone buzzed repeatedly - all calls from Nathan.

She didn't answer. Didn't decline.

Simply ignored them as if they never happened.

Strangely, she felt grateful to Sophia for staging those fake scenes.

Witnessing their passionate bathroom encounter finally revealed Nathan's true nature.

All lingering guilt evaporated.

While Evelyn prepared for dinner with Dominic's family, Reginald Blackwood bustled about excitedly. The old man acted more thrilled than during Lunar New Year celebrations.

"If all goes well, we might have another grandchild by next year!" Reginald babbled before swatting Julian with his cane. "Look at you! No fiancée, no girlfriend, no children! Useless! Go clean the house!"

"Dominic's bringing someone home at twenty-nine. Why rush me? I'm younger! And Grandpa, didn't you say you'd never replace your antique furniture?" Julian protested.

"Trying to kill me with your nonsense?" The cane came down again.

Back at the manor, Julian barked orders. Out went the coffee table. The sofa. The dining set. All replaced with sleek Scandinavian designs.

Even the prized antiques Reginald normally guarded were carefully packed away.

By four PM, the living room underwent a complete transformation.

Alexander returned from school, staring blankly at the unfamiliar space. "Grandpa? Where's our furniture?"

"Your father's bringing a lady tonight. Alexander, Isabella - listen carefully. Be on your best behavior." Wrinkles deepened as Reginald smiled, worried the children might dislike their potential stepmother.

"A lady?"

The boy exchanged glances with his sister.

"Grandpa, what's her name?" Isabella clung to the old man's leg, tilting her head upward.

"Her name..." Reginald frowned, recalling a bathroom phone conversation. "Something like...Eve?"

"Aunt Evelyn?" Alexander's eyes widened.

Amidst the bustling manor staff, the boy stood before his attentive great-grandfather. "We've been to Aunt Evelyn's place. She cooked for us. Dad insisted on staying over."

Isabella added, "First business trip together, all three of us slept in Aunt Evelyn's room."

Reginald's eyebrows shot up. "What? Your father slept with her immediately?"

Two small heads nodded vigorously.

"Dad's mean. He bullies Aunt Evelyn. Once made her cry." Alexander worried for Evelyn - marrying someone who bullied her seemed unwise.

Reginald gripped his cane, pondering his grandson's feelings. He remembered how his son Edmund pursued Beatrice, made promises, then broke her heart.

Even after Edmund's death, Beatrice still wept over the past.

The old man thought he knew his son, only to discover a scoundrel. Now he feared history repeating with Dominic.

Julian descended the stairs. "Where's Mother?"

A black Mercedes pulled up. Out stepped Margaret Lockwood, swaying unsteadily.

"Mom, daytime drinking?" Julian rushed to steady her, preventing a disastrous fall.

Margaret touched his face, smiling. "My handsome son. You're better than that woman Beatrice's boy."

"Let's get you upstairs." Julian knew drunken scenes never ended well.

Today was special. No disruptions allowed - especially not in front of Evelyn.

"I feel awful... Don't stop me!" Margaret suddenly struck Julian with her purse. "Taking their side now? Ashamed of your drunk mother? Look at me! I'm your real mother! That mistress Beatrice ruined me!"

"I know, Mom. Please rest. You'll get a headache." Julian coaxed.

Margaret nodded drowsily as he guided her upstairs.

Reginald sighed.

The twins exchanged glances before heading up to prepare.

Alexander showered, then raided Julian's room for hairspray. He frowned at the mirror, meticulously styling his dark locks.

"You look handsome, brother." Isabella twirled in her princess dress.

"Really?" Alexander blushed. "Stop embarrassing me!"
###Chapter 77

The children's footsteps echoed down the grand staircase as they spotted the sleek black Range Rover parked outside the estate.

"It's Daddy's car!" Isabella squealed with excitement.

"Aunt Evelyn, we missed you so much!" Alexander reached her first, wrapping his small arms around her waist.

Evelyn stumbled slightly from the impact but quickly regained her balance. She knelt to pinch Isabella's rosy cheeks. "I missed you both terribly."

Reginald Blackwood observed the heartwarming scene with satisfaction. His grandson's marriage prospects were looking brighter by the minute.

"Children, behave yourselves." Dominic's deep voice carried across the foyer as he stepped out of the vehicle. His stern gaze made both twins pout.

Isabella crossed her arms. "But Daddy, you hug Aunt Evelyn all the time! We saw you make her cry last week!"

Dominic's jaw tightened.

Evelyn's cheeks flushed crimson.

"So you're the famous Aunt Evelyn," Reginald chuckled, approaching with outstretched hands. "My grandson certainly has excellent taste."

The elderly gentleman looked dapper in his tailored gray trousers and checkered vest, every inch the distinguished patriarch.

Evelyn straightened immediately. "It's an honor to meet you, Mr. Blackwood."

"Nonsense! Come inside, my dear." Reginald ushered her toward the sitting room. "The children adore you already. That's half the battle won."

A maid began unloading gifts from the car - modest but thoughtful presents that pleased the old man immensely. Evelyn's practicality impressed him far more than extravagant gestures would have.

Julian descended the stairs after ensuring his mother was settled. "Well hello there, future sister-in-law! I'm the less impressive Blackwood brother."

Evelyn stood abruptly at the unexpected title. "Evelyn Sinclair. It's nice to meet you."

Dominic guided her to sit beside him, positioning himself as a protective barrier between Evelyn and his family's probing questions.

"How old are you, dear?" Reginald inquired.

"Twenty-four."

"Perfect! Dominic's five years your senior - ideal age difference." The old man produced a newspaper clipping from the coffee table drawer with suspicious ease. "Scientific studies prove couples with this age gap have the most stable marriages."

Julian rolled his eyes at his grandfather's obvious setup.

Alexander frowned at the adults' chatter. "Where's Grandmother Beatrice?" The boy looked absurdly formal in his miniature tuxedo, as if he were the one introducing a fiancée.

Julian ruffled his nephew's heavily gelled hair. "Used up my entire hairspray, didn't you? Careful or birds will start nesting in there."

Alexander shot his uncle a withering look, but Evelyn rescued him with a gentle smile, pulling him onto the sofa beside her. The boy smirked triumphantly at his father.

Reginald noticed Evelyn's questioning glance toward the empty chair. "Dominic's mother had a prior engagement at a fashion gala. Entirely my fault for rushing this meeting. She'll be home shortly."

Evelyn had seen Beatrice Lockwood in society pages - the woman attended every A-list event in the city. She opened her mouth to respond when tires crunched on the driveway gravel.

"Grandmother's home!" Isabella dashed to the door.

Beatrice Lockwood entered with effortless grace, her designer heels clicking against marble. "My apologies for keeping you waiting, dear. I wasn't informed about our special guest."

Evelyn rose quickly. "The pleasure is mine, Mrs. Lockwood. We arrived quite unexpectedly."

Beatrice embraced her warmly, but Dominic swiftly extracted Evelyn from his mother's arms. "Sit, Mother."

Reginald hid a smile behind his hand. His grandson's protectiveness spoke volumes.

"Evelyn, was it? I've heard so much about you from Isabella." Beatrice settled onto the sofa with perfect posture.

Before Evelyn could respond, a sharp voice cut through the room. "Enough of this charade!"

All heads turned toward the staircase where Margaret Lockwood descended in a floral qipao, her face contorted with rage. A glass of crimson juice trembled in her hand.

"You scheming witch!" Margaret hurled the liquid directly into Beatrice's face before slamming the empty glass onto a side table. "Thought you could hide me away, did you?"

Evelyn gasped, frozen in shock.

The maid rushed forward with towels, while Dominic remained impassive. The twins simply sighed, as if this were routine.

"Mother, please!" Julian grabbed her arm, but Margaret shook him off, reeking of alcohol.

Her wild eyes locked onto Evelyn. A chilling smile twisted her lips as she took in the newcomer's horrified expression...
###Chapter 78

"Are you... Dominic's girlfriend that he brought to introduce to us?" Margaret asked with tears in her eyes. "What's your family background like? If your future husband mistreats you after marriage, will your family be able to protect you?"

Evelyn didn't know how to respond.

When Julian introduced himself earlier, he'd mentioned being Dominic's half-brother, sharing the same father.

That likely meant this middle-aged woman wearing the custom Gi qipao had once shared a man with Dominic's mother, Beatrice.

Margaret staggered toward Evelyn with alcohol fumes surrounding her. "Be careful." Evelyn reacted swiftly, catching Margaret before she could fall.

Leaning against the sofa with Evelyn's support, Margaret frowned uncomfortably. "Judging by your appearance, you probably come from an ordinary family. Take my advice - don't marry into the Blackwood family."

"Go upstairs to your room!" Reginald stood abruptly, his voice thundering with anger.

"No!" Margaret's eyes burned with resentment as she glared at the old man. Alcohol always loosened her tongue, making her repeat the same bitter words. "Allison should be the one leaving! I was Edmund's first wife!"

Her jealous gaze shifted to Beatrice, finger pointing accusingly. "You shameless woman! Who are you trying to fool with that quiet act? Just a cheap club dancer who sold herself to men! How many men had you slept with before worming your way into the Blackwood family? Edmund must have been blind not to see the whore you really were!"

Evelyn glanced at Dominic nervously.

He sat composed on the sofa, cigarette between his fingers. Though his brows furrowed slightly, he made no move to intervene, simply taking a slow drag with closed eyes.

Evelyn suddenly recalled his words during their phone call: "Don't feel pressured. In terms of family backgrounds, I'm no better than you. If you look into my family, we're basically the same."

"Are you certain you want to marry into the Blackwood family?" Margaret grasped Evelyn's hand with drunken sincerity. "Child, the Blackwoods are indeed the most prominent family in this city. But marrying into such wealth is like entering an icy tomb. Your husband won't care for you, and your in-laws won't sympathize."

"And then there are the mistresses waiting to pounce. It doesn't matter how low-class they are - maybe some club dancer letting men grope her. Men will still cherish them like precious gems while expecting their wives to stay home obediently, even asking if they had fun with their whores!" Margaret's grip tightened painfully.

"This is beyond unacceptable!" Reginald's cane struck the marble floor sharply.

He turned to Evelyn with softened tone. "Evelyn, your aunt has had too much to drink. Pay no mind to her ramblings."

Evelyn met the old man's gaze silently.

"Don't think seniority gives you the right to side with your son's mistress against your daughter-in-law!" Margaret stood abruptly, shouting. "A fish rots from the head down!"

"Mother, if you must make a scene, choose another time!" Julian forcibly bear-hugged his struggling mother toward the stairs, calling for the nanny's assistance.

Upstairs, crashing sounds and Margaret's wails echoed through the manor. Julian never returned downstairs, likely staying to prevent further outbursts.

Dominic signaled Evelyn to take the children outside.

In the manor's flower garden at dusk, bees buzzed busily among blossoms. Isabella watched them curiously. "They're always buzzing. Aunt Evelyn, do they eat the nectar right away?"

Lost in thought, Evelyn didn't respond immediately.

"Aunt Evelyn?" Isabella crouched, peering up.

"Yes?" Evelyn snapped back to reality.

"What's a club dancer who lets men touch her? Why did Grandma Margaret say that about Grandma?" The innocent question hung in the air.

Evelyn knelt, embracing the small girl. She kissed Isabella's cheek gently. "When adults argue, we forget their words after. Let's count to three and forget everything, okay?"

"Okay!" Isabella closed her eyes happily. "One, two, three... Aunt Evelyn, I forgot everything!"

"Good girl." Evelyn hugged her tighter, reaching for Alexander who stood quietly nearby. "You'll forget too, right?"

The boy nodded, though his brows remained furrowed.

Evelyn felt no pity for the quarreling adults - only for these innocent children forced to witness such ugliness. Adults had every right to vent, but not at the expense of children's innocence.

Holding them close, Evelyn couldn't help wondering about her own child. Was their family environment equally toxic, or completely opposite - filled with happiness?

Dominic arranged for separate dinners that evening. Reginald didn't insist, merely suggesting they reconvene at a better time.

As Dominic exited with Beatrice, the children clung to Evelyn like koalas, making their preference clear.

"I'm sorry you had to witness that today. For what it's worth, I like you very much. Though I only know you as Evelyn - what's your full name?" Beatrice had cleaned up, regaining her usual elegant demeanor.

"Evelyn Sinclair," came the calm reply.

Beatrice's smile froze instantly. Her face darkened. "What? Sinclair? Did you say your surname is Sinclair?"

Evelyn nodded.

Dominic shot his mother an impatient look. "Problem with the surname Sinclair?" He found her excessive interest irritating. Evelyn was his choice - that should suffice. Bringing her here already showed more respect than his family deserved.
###Chapter 79

"It's nothing. Just an unusual last name." Beatrice Lockwood maintained her composure perfectly, though internally her thoughts were racing.

She repeated the name silently in her mind. "Evelyn Sinclair."

Dominic's mother studied the young woman before her. Evelyn barely glanced back, assuming this was just casual curiosity about her uncommon surname.

In her entire life, Evelyn had never met another person sharing her last name outside her immediate family. From elementary school through her professional career, she remained the only Sinclair anyone knew.

Beatrice watched as her son departed with Evelyn and the twins.

When their car disappeared down the driveway, Beatrice found herself alone in the manor gardens. After ensuring no servants were nearby, she retreated toward the poolside and dialed a number she despised.

"The number you have reached is unavailable..."

Her fingers trembled with increasing frustration as she redialed repeatedly, only to hear the same automated message each time.

Meanwhile, Dominic escorted Evelyn and the children to a newly acquired penthouse in the city's financial district. The 2,200-square-foot luxury residence boasted floor-to-ceiling windows with panoramic views.

"Father, why haven't we stayed here before?" Alexander explored every corner before turning to his father lounging on the designer sofa.

Dominic shrugged. "Purchased it yesterday."

"So we're never going home again?" The boy's question hung in the air.

"...The location's more convenient for work."

Alexander's eyes lit up with realization. "It's closer to our school too! When Uncle Sebastian drove us last week, we passed this building. The commute would be shorter."

Situated at the city's epicenter, the penthouse offered unparalleled accessibility. Alexander wasn't wrong - their prestigious academy was mere blocks away.

Dominic steepled his fingers. "What exactly are you suggesting?"

The boy gestured toward the three lavish bedrooms. "This place is huge. Aunt Evelyn could take one room, you and I share another, and Isabella gets her own space."

"No way!" Isabella's voice echoed from the bathroom where Evelyn was helping her wash up. "I want to sleep with Aunt Evelyn!"

Evelyn interjected gently, "I have my own apartment with six months' rent prepaid."

Dominic shot his son a withering glare.

Alexander immediately recognized his tactical error. "Did I just ruin your plans, Father?"

After drying Isabella's face, Evelyn crouched to the children's level. "Since this is on my commute, how about I come each morning to prepare breakfast and see you off to school?"

Alexander wanted to argue but understood pushing would backfire. They dined out that evening, and when midnight approached, Evelyn excused herself.

The newly relocated Alexander found sleep elusive. He wandered to the living room, activating the smart curtains with a remote. The city lights sparkled beyond the floor-to-ceiling windows as the boy frowned thoughtfully.

"Shouldn't you be asleep?" Dominic's voice startled him. The man lit a cigarette before joining his son on the balcony.

"Are you angry, Father?" Alexander ventured.

Dominic exhaled smoke without turning. "About what?"

"That Aunt Evelyn won't live with us?" The boy spoke with surprising wisdom. "You can't be selfish. Why should she care for a secondhand husband and his children?"

"A secondhand husband?" Dominic finally turned, arching one eyebrow. "Elementary school clearly can't start soon enough for you."

Alexander bit his tongue - just two more months until his enrollment. But he couldn't resist a parting shot before retreating: "You graduated Oxford with honors, yet you're nearly thirty and still single. I'll definitely do better."

Dominic's silence spoke volumes as the boy hastily locked his bedroom door.

The next morning, Olivia Kensington drove Evelyn to the hospital. "You're seriously playing stepmom already?" she teased. "Making meals for your boss's kids after visiting your father? How very domestic!"

Evelyn focused on unbuckling her seatbelt.

"Oh come on," Olivia pressed. "You're willingly caring for another woman's children. My dear, when exactly did you and Dominic... you know..."

Evelyn exited swiftly, slamming the car door behind her.

Olivia's eyes widened with realization. "You minx! So you have slept with him! When's the wedding?"

In the hospital room, Robert Sinclair brightened immediately at his daughter's arrival.

"Dad, how are you? I couldn't reach your phone."

The nurse discreetly exited as father and daughter spoke. "I meant to call you," Robert explained. "My phone died - just charged it."

Evelyn pulled up a chair, listening intently.

"Evelyn, about the Luojiazhen property demolition," Robert began before coughing violently. "The compensation agreement... cough... has been submitted..."

Evelyn immediately patted his back, ensuring he could breathe.
###Chapter 80

The coughing fit finally subsided. Robert Sinclair wiped his mouth with a trembling hand before speaking. "Evelyn...could you take a few days off? To visit Luojiazhen? Your grandfather's at the old house. Beatrice Lockwood might be going there too."

"Grandpa?" Evelyn's breath hitched.

"I thought he went to Japan with Aunt Gwendolyn. When did he return?" Her fingers tightened around the hospital bed rail.

Robert grasped his daughter's hand, his grip weak but urgent. Between shallow breaths, he explained everything. Just as he finished, the doctor entered for routine checks.

"I need to go, Dad." Evelyn kissed his forehead.

Robert nodded weakly.

Her mind reeled with the revelations about Grandpa as she exited the hospital. The sterile corridors blurred before her eyes.

Inside the ward, Robert extended his arm for bloodwork. His phone rang. Without checking the caller ID, he answered hoarsely, "Robert Sinclair speaking."

Beatrice Lockwood's voice crackled like dry parchment. "What's your daughter's name?"

Robert's entire body tensed. "Why do you care?" His fingers curled into fists.

The realization that it was Beatrice - the woman who'd never once asked about her own child - made his blood boil.

"Just tell me, damn it!" Beatrice shrieked.

"Evelyn Sinclair. It means 'light' because I wanted my daughter to shine bright, unlike you - a walking shadow!" Robert gasped for air between words. "Now what fresh hell are you planning?"

At Blackwood Manor, Beatrice's phone clattered to the marble floor.

Evelyn.

Her daughter's name was Evelyn.

Was this all some elaborate revenge plot?

"A twenty-four-year-old playing the innocent while scheming beneath that angelic face?" Beatrice's laugh turned manic. "You've fooled us all, Evelyn!"

Dominic Blackwood woke to Evelyn's call.

"I'm sorry - I promised to make breakfast, but something urgent came up. Please explain to Alexander and Isabella?" The line went dead before he could respond.

Since Vivienne Laurent hadn't arrived at Vivi Corporation yet, Evelyn called to request leave.

Thoughts of Grandpa - whom she hadn't seen in five years - made her hands shake. Tears spilled unchecked. A seventy-year-old man in failing health, abandoned in that crumbling town.

Grandpa had raised her from infancy.

He meant more to her than anyone - even her father.

In the taxi home, she made necessary calls - to Vivienne, Abigail Thornton, and finally Olivia Kensington, explaining she'd be away for several days.

Dominic's callback attempts met with a busy signal.

Evelyn booked the earliest high-speed rail ticket on her phone.

She packed essentials in ten minutes flat.

Years ago, Aunt Gwendolyn took Grandpa to Japan to escape Jennifer's toxicity. But when Gwendolyn's marriage collapsed, Grandpa found himself shipped back to China like unwanted luggage.

Evelyn seethed at her father's cowardice.

"How could you leave Grandpa in that dilapidated house? Is Jennifer Montgomery's comfort more important than your own father's wellbeing?"

The train station teemed with pickpockets. Evelyn clutched her bags protectively until safely boarded.

Work distracted her momentarily. Noise-canceling headphones created a bubble of focus.

Hunger eventually pierced her concentration. She nibbled a pre-packed sandwich absently.

Departing at 9:20 AM, she reached Luojiazhen by 11:00 AM. The unchanged station triggered a flood of nostalgia.

Tears pricked her eyes as she absorbed the familiar sights of her childhood hometown.

"Taxi! Five yuan per person!" A sun-leathered driver barked at disembarking passengers.

Evelyn shared a cab with three strangers.

Ten minutes later, she stood before the decaying two-story house.

Weeds sprouted between cracked bricks. Taking a steadying breath, she dragged her luggage through the rusted gate.

The front yard's overgrown grass showed recent trimming attempts. Inside, acrid smoke stung her nostrils.

There - Grandpa's hunched silhouette by the stove.

The old man coughed violently, eyes red-rimmed from smoke. Tear tracks gleamed on his soot-streaked cheeks. A bowl of rice and reheated vegetables sat neglected in the pot - the broth nearly evaporated from constant warming.

"Grandpa..." Evelyn rushed forward, embracing his frail frame.

The old man squinted through the smoke. "Who...?"

"It's me, Evie." She wiped his face tenderly with tissues, crying like a child. "Why didn't you tell me you were back? Even if Dad's sick, you still have me!"

"Evie?" Gnarled fingers touched her face wonderingly. "Robert said you're getting married. I didn't want to burden your new family." His clouded eyes searched hers as he patted her head. "My good girl...still so thoughtful."

Age-dimmed vision prevented him from recognizing how his granddaughter had blossomed.

"You could never be a burden." A deep voice resonated from the doorway.

Evelyn spun, tear-blurred vision clearing to reveal Dominic Blackwood silhouetted against the light. Behind him, a black Range Rover idled at the curb.

In her distress over Grandpa, she'd missed the vehicle's arrival.

Dominic stepped through the low doorway - his imposing height making the cramped space seem smaller. Their gazes locked. His dark eyes burned with quiet fury - anger at her for facing this alone, for not letting him share her burdens.
###Chapter 81

"He is..." Grandfather hesitated to voice his assumption. Getting it wrong would create an awkward situation.

Dominic entered with impeccable posture, his tailored suit accentuating his broad shoulders. He extended a hand in greeting while his other arm naturally encircled Evelyn's waist - a silent declaration of their relationship.

"Are you Nathan Kensington, the young man my son mentioned?" Grandfather smiled by the hearth. "I made sure to remember the name after Robert told me you've been together five years and are planning to marry soon."

Evelyn feared Dominic might correct him. "Grandfather, you've lost so much weight!" she interjected quickly. "Was Japan not to your liking?"

"Old bones shrink with age," Grandfather chuckled, straightening his hunched back as he moved toward a storage room with his fire poker.

After some rummaging, he produced two weathered stools, placing them on the kitchen floor. "Sit, young man. Our home lacks proper furnishings."

Evelyn eyed the rickety stools nervously, stealing a glance at Dominic. She worried he'd refuse.

But Dominic surprised her. Setting aside his usual aristocratic demeanor, he not only sat without hesitation but pulled her down beside him. "Join us," he said warmly. "Let's talk with Grandfather."

The elderly man settled onto his usual kitchen stool.

"I'll let you two chat. Need to get groceries." Evelyn pushed her luggage aside, retrieving cash from her bag. Her anxious eyes met Dominic's.

He gave an almost imperceptible nod of understanding.

"Be back soon." She smiled at Grandfather before leaving.

Passing through the brick courtyard, Evelyn noticed neighbors gathered nearby. She vaguely recalled some names from childhood.

To them, she'd always be the whore's daughter - a label she'd carried since birth.

The local market still sold fresh produce. Though the whispers had lessened over years, her return with Dominic had reignited old gossip.

"Is that Evelyn from the Sinclair place?" a middle-aged woman pointed discreetly.

Another answered immediately, "Has to be. Grown up, but still recognizable. That's little Evie alright."

"Times change. Who'd have thought the Sinclair girl would outshine my daughter who married a county policeman?"

"Mrs. Yates, your girl made the best match in town!"

"Only agreed because of the 200,000 betrothal gift and the 100,000 car he bought us. Money's all he's got!"

Someone interjected, "Your daughter married well. That Evelyn's probably some rich man's mistress. That car costs millions! Probably seduced him recently to show off."

"Just like her shameless mother who ran off with-"

Evelyn purchased vegetables, ribs, and seasonings. Returning, she found the gossips still gathered.

Inside, she saw Dominic holding a bowl of spoiled food, about to discard it despite Grandfather's obvious discomfort at the waste.

"Grandfather, this will harm your health," Dominic stated firmly, disposing of it decisively.

The old man sat silently.

Evelyn stood frozen in the doorway, groceries in hand, overwhelmed by an unfamiliar sense of security.

The impeccably dressed man moved through the shabby kitchen, his luxury watch glinting incongruously in the dim light. Noticing her return, he set down the chipped bowl. "What did you get?"

Touched by his adaptability - not complaining about the primitive cooking conditions - Evelyn began preparing dinner. Dominic had arranged for a gas tank delivery, installed within minutes.

"Keep Grandfather company. I'll handle this," Dominic offered, eyeing the dull kitchen knife warily.

"I'm fine. You should rest." Evelyn insisted, surprised by his culinary knowledge.

As she cooked, memories surfaced - childhood years preparing meals after school, weekends helping in fields before rushing home to cook over firewood. Those lean years had given way to better times abroad.

When the sweet-and-sour ribs were ready, she called them to eat. Grandfather beamed, eyes crinkling shut.

Dominic maintained his commanding presence, yet engaged the old man respectfully. Grandfather listened raptly, clearly approving of his granddaughter's choice.

"Enough talk. Come eat," Evelyn urged, setting the table.

New stools had replaced the rickety ones. Grandfather fretted about appearances. "Nathan, our humble town can't compare to the city. Try Evelyn's cooking." He served Dominic first with trembling chopsticks.
###Chapter 82

Evelyn clutched the bowls and chopsticks tightly. Her apologetic gaze met Dominic's across the wooden table.

Dominic probably despised Nathan. When Grandpa addressed him as Nathan, though it stung, he swallowed his pride for now.

"Grandpa, you should eat more." Dominic didn't correct the old man, instead ensuring he ate first. After serving Grandpa, he placed two perfect rib pieces on Evelyn's plate.

"Thank you." Evelyn picked at her rice grains, not daring to meet his eyes. She nibbled the rice before tasting the ribs he'd chosen for her.

That's when Evelyn noticed - the ribs Dominic selected for both Grandpa and herself were the choicest cuts. Single-bone portions with tender meat that fell right off.

He'd taken the tough backbone pieces for himself.

In this small town, butchers sold ribs with backbones attached - no fancy cuts here.

Evelyn selected a prime rib and placed it in Dominic's bowl. "You should eat too. Don't just serve Grandpa and me."

"Not hungry yet." He returned the rib to her plate.

Grandpa observed their interaction with keen eyes. The old man had lived seventy-odd years - he'd seen every type of person. He could spot genuine care from a mile away.

"My Evelyn grew up tough," Grandpa said, voice cracking. "Survived on bread scraps, wore other children's castoffs. Her father worked tirelessly while her mother... vanished after birth. This child endured hardships that shaped her. Thinking about it breaks my heart..."

Tears welled in the old man's eyes as memories surfaced.

"The granddaughter you raised surpasses any spoiled socialite. Don't blame yourself," Dominic said, his gaze lingering on Evelyn.

"Let's eat. No need for sad stories. I'm doing fine now..." Evelyn knew why Grandpa regretted things, but none of it was his fault. Or her father's. Only that woman who abandoned her at birth bore the blame.

Grandpa studied his grandson-in-law with wise eyes. "When I first saw your fine clothes and that luxury car outside, I feared you'd break my Evelyn's heart. I misjudged you."

Dominic steadied Grandpa's hand. "Actually, I need your help convincing Evelyn not to run from our marriage."

Grandpa's expression turned stern. "If my Evelyn dares jilt you, I'll personally break her ungrateful legs!"

Evelyn choked on her tea.

That evening, after a long day, Evelyn walked Dominic to the town's only hotel.

She nearly warned him about the modest accommodations, then remembered he'd lived here a year before. She bit her tongue.

Approaching the black Range Rover parked outside, Evelyn walked on Dominic's left. "I'm sorry about Grandpa calling you Nathan. Correcting him would raise questions he'd lose sleep over."

"As long as the grandson-in-law he sees is me, the name doesn't matter." Dominic's dark eyes burned with possessiveness.

A lone shop still had its lights on. Evelyn entered. "Do you sell phone chargers?"

The shopkeeper eyed their city attire warily. "What phone type?"

Evelyn's iPhone charger didn't fit Dominic's device. He showed his phone.

The shopkeeper didn't dare touch it. "We only carry Huawei and Xiaomi chargers here. Never seen a phone like that."

"Thanks anyway." They left empty-handed after checking several shops.

Evelyn guessed Dominic had rushed here without his charger. "Maybe you should drive back tonight? It's only two hours."

A man like Dominic had businesses to run. With his phone dead, no one could reach him.

Dominic's jaw tightened. The company would survive with Sebastian managing things. That's why he paid those exorbitant salaries.

"Nothing matters more than you," Dominic murmured, his deep voice curling around her.

Thankfully, the dim streetlights hid her flushed cheeks. "Let's get you settled at the hotel."

"And where will you stay?" Dominic asked as they reached the entrance.

Evelyn approached the front desk. "Your best room, please." She paid cash while Dominic produced his ID.

The clerk gaped at Dominic's A City residence card, then at the man himself - tall, imposing, his sharp features making the humble lobby feel like a throne room.

"I've given him our finest room," the clerk whispered.

Key in hand, Dominic guided Evelyn upstairs. Inside, he scanned the modest room before pinning her against the wall, caging her with his arms. "This place is dreadful. Let me stay at Grandpa's."

Evelyn glanced around. The hotel might be basic, but it beat Grandpa's crumbling house. "No space. We don't have enough rooms—"

Dominic silenced her with a searing kiss, hands gripping her waist. His tongue demanded entry as he backed her toward the bed.

"Don't—" Her protest died when he flipped her onto the mattress, his suit-clad body pressing down.

Just then, a woman's moans from the adjacent room made Evelyn freeze.

"You devil...When did you...come in...Ah!...Aren't you afraid...your wife...will find out...Ahhh!"

That voice—Victoria's voice!
###Chapter 83

"The owner's a friend of mine, so I got a spare key to your room..."

From what they overheard, the unidentified man Evelyn was fighting off had a wife. His family lived right here in this small town.

Evelyn's fingers clenched the bedsheet tightly.

Her heart ached for her father.

Dad had worked himself to the bone for over two decades to provide for Victoria and her daughter.

Yet now he lay in a hospital bed battling terminal illness while his wife Victoria betrayed him.

"You filthy pig..."

"Don't pretend you don't love it. At least I'm not some cancer-ridden weakling like your husband... Admit it... You know I'm better..."

"Ah... You're incredible... The best... Ahhh... Not so rough... You're going too deep..."

Too deep? I think you can take more!" The man's crude laughter echoed. "At your age, stop pretending... I can go deeper... You're not even that tight anymore... Only I can satisfy you..."

Evelyn felt bile rise in her throat.

"You know her?" Dominic whispered after hearing the commotion next door.

"She's... my stepmother."

Shame burned through Evelyn for both herself and her father.

Dominic pushed himself off her. Like magic, her wrinkled clothes smoothed themselves out instantly, restoring her composed appearance.

"Let's go." He wouldn't subject her to more of this filth.

Still breathless, Evelyn followed him out.

Earlier at the hospital, her father mentioned Victoria might return to town today.

"Wait outside," Dominic murmured, giving her shoulder a reassuring squeeze before approaching the front desk alone.

Evelyn had no choice but to sit on a moonlit bench outside.

Instead of taking the refund, Dominic placed a thick stack of cash on the marble counter. "Keep it."

Rooms in this town rarely cost over twenty dollars. With limited options, most guests haggled endlessly.

The owner eyed the money hesitantly. "You are...?"

Dominic handed over all the cash he'd just withdrawn. Lighting a cigarette, his dark eyes narrowed. "I need a favor."

After two minutes of waiting, Evelyn grew suspicious and went back inside.

"Checked us out," Dominic announced as he strode toward her.

"Why?" That meant either driving back to the city tonight... or staying at Grandpa's house with her.

When Dominic took her cold hands in his, he rubbed them warm. "Asked if any shops still sold bedding."

Grandpa's house only had one old blanket set.

The one she'd planned to use tonight was found damp in the taxi earlier, now drying in the yard.

Grandpa assumed his guest would stay at the hotel. Even as a future grandson-in-law, Dominic clearly came from wealth and wouldn't tolerate small-town poverty.

In the city...

Beatrice parked on a deserted street, repeatedly dialing her son's number.

"The number you have dialed is unavailable..."

She tried Sebastian instead.

"Sebastian, this is Mrs. Lockwood. Where's Dominic?"

"Apologies, Madam. Mr. Blackwood's personal affairs are confidential." Sebastian had received a call from his boss five minutes ago - from Evelyn's number.

Meaning Dominic was with Evelyn.

As for his whereabouts and return? No subordinate dared ask.

"Useless!" Beatrice hung up in frustration.

After fuming for minutes, she remembered her godson Adrian.

She dialed quickly.

"Adrian? It's Aunt Beatrice."

"Remember that blind date I arranged? You called her beforehand, correct?"

"Send me her number immediately."

Three minutes later, Evelyn's contact appeared.

Back in town...

The couple exited a shop with new bedding.

Dominic asked about Evelyn's stepmother.

Seeing no reason to hide it, Evelyn explained everything. "Dad probably meant Victoria wants Grandpa's demolition compensation. It's quite substantial."

"If your father refuses, she can't touch it, right?" Hearing Victoria's history, Dominic could imagine Evelyn's suffering under that roof.

Evelyn hugged a cartoon-printed pillow. "With Dad hospitalized, anger worsens his condition. Victoria knows I won't trouble him. She thinks Grandpa and I are easy targets."

Suddenly, commotion erupted from the hotel next door.

"You shameless whore! Stealing my husband! I'll skin you alive!"

Along with curses came the sound of tearing fabric.

A disheveled Victoria stumbled out, shocking Evelyn. 'Caught by the man's wife?'

Noticing Evelyn's stunned expression, Dominic smirked discreetly.

Evelyn stared at the scene.

Victoria's hair was being yanked by a muscular woman who cursed while groping under her skirt.

A brutal twist sent Victoria wailing to the ground.

The trembling man stood frozen in the doorway, clutching his clothes.

"Whore! I'll kill you first, then butcher him at home! At your age, squealing like a pig in heat! I'll cut out your tongue!" The woman rained blows as onlookers turned away.

Victoria's face swelled, mouth bleeding. Evelyn tugged Dominic's sleeve. "Let's go home."

He draped his jacket over her shoulders, guiding her toward the old house.

Inside, Grandpa said, "Evelyn, your phone's been ringing nonstop."

Dominic carried their new bedding to her room, determined to sleep there tonight.

Six missed calls from an unknown number.

When it rang again, she answered. "Hello?"

"Evelyn Sinclair? This is Dominic's mother!" Beatrice finally got through, voice sharp with fury.
###Chapter 84

The way Beatrice was speaking sent chills down Evelyn's spine. The shock was so intense that she forgot to respond properly.

"Where are you? I need to see you immediately, Evelyn Sinclair. We must have a serious conversation. It's for your own good," Beatrice demanded, her tone dripping with selfish urgency.

The last time they'd met at Blackwood Manor, Beatrice had been warm, even affectionate—calling her "Eve" like family. But now? Full name. Cold. Formal.

A memory flashed in Evelyn's mind—her five-year-old self, knees scraped raw from gravel after being pushed down by neighborhood kids. She'd run home sobbing, begging her grandfather to tell her why she didn’t have a mother like the other children.

That was the first time he'd ever used her full name.

Evelyn Sinclair.

His voice had been stern, his expression uncharacteristically grave. "You don’t have a mother. She didn’t want you. She threw you away for a life of luxury. If not for me, you’d have rotted in an orphanage."

Now, Beatrice was using that same tone.

What fresh horror awaited her?

"Can't we discuss this over the phone?" Evelyn asked, fingers tightening around her device.

"No. This isn't a phone conversation. You won't be able to handle it alone. I need to see your reaction—control the fallout," Beatrice replied sharply. Then, softer but no less threatening: "If you can’t control yourself, I will."

Evelyn's hands trembled.

"I can't meet tonight. I'm visiting my grandfather in his hometown. The earliest I can return is tomorrow." She couldn’t drag the old man back for a midnight drive—his health wouldn’t survive the strain.

A pause. Then Beatrice relented. "Fine. Tomorrow."

Evelyn moved to hang up.

"Wait." Beatrice’s voice turned icy. "Don’t involve Dominic. This stays between us. If you tell him? You’ll regret it. I promise you that."

The call ended.

Her grandfather shuffled toward her, cane tapping against the wooden floor. "Who was that? Your father?"

Evelyn forced a smile, guiding him back to his room. "Just rest, Grandpa. Tomorrow, we’re moving to A City. You’re living with me from now on."

The old man protested, but Evelyn was firm. She knelt, removing his shoes, washing his feet with warm water from a chipped basin. She dried them carefully, tucking him beneath the worn quilt.

"I won’t take no for an answer," she whispered. "You raised me. Now it’s my turn."

Outside, Dominic waited.

The night air was crisp, heavy with dew and the scent of wet grass. Evelyn hesitated. "Where will you sleep tonight?"

Before he could answer, the door creaked open. Her grandfather peered out, worry etched into his wrinkled face. "Young man, you should stay inside. The car’s too cold."

Dominic shook his head. "I’ll be fine. Brought a blanket."

Once her grandfather was settled again, Dominic pulled Evelyn close. His voice was rough against her ear. "Come outside with me."

She followed, heart pounding.

At the car, he turned abruptly, crushing her against him. His breath was hot on her skin. "I’m going insane without you."

Evelyn let him hold her, but dread coiled in her stomach. Beatrice’s call could only mean one thing: an ultimatum. Money? Threats? A classic rich-family ploy to tear them apart.

Reality was always uglier than fiction.

Dominic’s kiss was fierce, desperate—enough to steal her breath. She melted into him until the memory of her grandfather’s watchful gaze made her pull away.

"I should go," she murmured. "Need to pack his things for tomorrow."

As she twisted free, her hand brushed against him—hard, unmistakable. She jerked back, face burning.

The memory of his touch in the hotel suite flashed through her mind. Cheeks flaming, she fled inside without another word.
###Chapter 85

Dominic braced himself against the car hood, his sculpted muscles straining against the fabric of his tailored shirt. The morning chill did nothing to cool the fire burning inside him.

His jaw clenched as he reached for the glove compartment, retrieving a sleek silver case of cigarettes. The first drag burned his throat, but he welcomed the discomfort. Anything to distract from the relentless ache in his body.

Those obsidian eyes remained fixed on the dimly lit window across the street. The abandoned house offered no curtains to obscure his view. He watched until the light finally flickered out.

Sleep eluded Evelyn that night.

Dominic fared no better. Driving back through the quiet town streets, memories surfaced unbidden - both bitter and sweet.

By 5:15 AM, Evelyn gave up on rest. A pounding headache greeted her along with Allison's venomous words replaying in her mind. The nightmare still clung to her - Beatrice Lockwood's manic threats, the cold steel of a blade against her throat.

She folded the blanket with mechanical precision and sought out her grandfather.

"Up so early, child?" Reginald Sinclair's weathered face creased with concern. "You should sleep more."

"Same as always, Grandpa." Evelyn wrapped her arms around his frail shoulders. "I'm taking you home with me. Dad's away on assignment. You'll stay with me now."

The old man missed the shadows in his granddaughter's eyes. His gnarled hands patted hers. "Such a good girl. But an old man like me will only burden your new life."

"You're never a burden." Evelyn forced a smile, blinking back moisture. "Any man who can't respect family isn't worth marrying."

The front door creaked open. Dominic's imposing frame filled the doorway, breakfast bags in hand. Toast. Sausages. Simple fare that suddenly smelled divine.

"Let's eat, Grandpa." Evelyn knelt to help with his shoes.

The kitchen buzzed with quiet conversation. Dominic engaged Reginald with surprising ease while Evelyn picked at her food. Soon she excused herself to pack.

The luxury items surprised her - Prada luggage, premium toiletries. Clearly her aunt's husband had provided well before abruptly sending Grandpa back. The contrast between Japan's comforts and this crumbling town must have been jarring.

Outside, early risers gawked. "Off to the city, old man?"

"Taking Grandpa home," Evelyn answered curtly, recognizing the busybody neighbor.

The woman's shrill voice followed them. "Better not dump him like your aunt did! Thought she was too good for us after marrying rich. Typical Rayne women - all airs and no substance."

Evelyn ignored the jab, but Dominic's stormy expression promised retribution. She caught his arm. "Not worth it."

"Filthy peasants," he muttered.

Evelyn surprised them both by slipping her hands beneath his coat, seeking warmth. The impending meeting with Beatrice weighed heavier with each passing minute.

During the drive, Reginald's questions came rapid-fire. "Where's your father working again? He never mentioned traveling."

Dominic's gaze flicked to the rearview mirror as Evelyn faltered.

"Supervisory position," Dominic interjected smoothly. "Mostly office work with factory inspections. Good pay, light workload."

Reginald's relieved chatter filled the car while Evelyn mouthed a silent 'thank you' to the man who lied so effortlessly.

A City emerged after two tense hours. Olivia Kensington waited at the apartment Evelyn had arranged - though plans had changed. Olivia's mother had been swindled into buying property for Sophia Montgomery, necessitating her return home.

"Grandpa Reginald!" Olivia beamed. "Evelyn talked about you constantly in school. Cried every time she got homesick."

Once Reginald settled, Evelyn pulled Olivia aside. "You're really moving back? Why didn't you tell me?"

"I was about to when you left town." Olivia squeezed her shoulder. "This works out though - now you're not alone."

Evelyn's silence spoke volumes.

"What's wrong?" Olivia's perceptive gaze missed nothing.

After ensuring Dominic left for the office, Evelyn made her request. "Watch Grandpa for me? I have... an errand."

"Of course, but you're scaring me. What's happening?"

"Nothing." The lie tasted bitter. "I won't be long."

Twenty minutes later, Evelyn faced Beatrice Lockwood across a café table. The older woman's designer clothes and perfect makeup contrasted sharply with Evelyn's sleepless pallor.

"Shall I tell you about your real mother?" Beatrice's crimson lips curved. "No need for suspense - you're looking at her."
###Chapter 86

"What did you just say?"

Evelyn's face froze.

Beatrice must be joking.

Perhaps that woman truly despised her to the core and wanted to tear Dominic away from her. But this?

This was beyond absurd.

"I said, you're my daughter. Was I unclear?" Beatrice lifted her coffee cup, took a sip, and met Evelyn's gaze with an icy stare.

"Which means you can't be with Dominic."

Evelyn's hands clenched beneath the table, her palms slick with sweat.

She had never told Beatrice about losing her birth mother as a child. How does she know? Did Dominic tell her?

Her mind spun.

She remembered Beatrice was the mistress who destroyed Margaret Lockwood's marriage to Edmund. The woman who stole another woman's husband and took her place.

Growing up, Evelyn had heard the whispers—how her mother ran off with a wealthy man who could give her a better life.

The pieces fit.

But so what if they did?

The world was full of women who became mistresses. That didn’t make Beatrice her mother.

Evelyn shook her head violently. No. She refused to believe it.

Beatrice struck again, aiming for the weakest point. "Eve, I never asked your father's name until you told me your surname was Sinclair. That day, the moment you said it, I knew."

Her voice was eerily calm. "I thought you knew. I thought you were seducing Dominic to punish me for abandoning you and your father."

A twisted smile flickered across Beatrice's face before vanishing.

"But it seems you had no idea. You weren’t with him for revenge."

Evelyn couldn’t breathe. This felt like the day the doctors said her father had liver cancer—a truth too cruel to accept.

"Stop lying," she hissed. "This is pathetic. Only a child would fall for this."

"Pathetic?" Beatrice arched a brow. "Do you think I became Mrs. Blackwood by spouting nonsense?"

Evelyn faltered.

Beatrice had schemed her way into Edmund’s life and secured her position as the Blackwood matriarch. A woman like that didn’t need cheap lies.

And Dominic—sharp, calculating Dominic—would see through any deception.

The realization hit like a blade.

Her body turned to ice.

Was Beatrice really her mother?

Evelyn sat paralyzed, struggling to steady her racing heart. After ten minutes, she gave up. She grabbed her bag and stood.

"Wait." Beatrice’s voice cut through the air.

Evelyn froze.

Beatrice tossed cash onto the table, then strode over, her heels clicking against the floor. "Get a grip. Handle this like an adult. And for God’s sake, don’t drag Dominic down with you."

Evelyn looked up, tears blurring her vision.

Beatrice stood composed, as if she’d just commented on the weather. No guilt. No remorse.

Was this woman truly her mother?

Evelyn wiped her face. Why had she expected anything else? A mother who abandoned her infant wouldn’t suddenly grow a heart.

The taxi ride to Paramount Hospital was a blur.

Evelyn sobbed silently, her tears falling unchecked.

Images flashed—Dominic in high school, tall and untouchable. Dominic interviewing her, asking strange, personal questions. Dominic confessing his love, claiming he was finally free to be with her.

Dominic’s hands on her skin.

Her stomach twisted.

"Miss, are you okay?" The driver eyed her warily.

She didn’t answer.

At the hospital entrance, Beatrice caught up, gripping her arm. "Pull yourself together. Unless you want your father to drop dead from shock."

Evelyn yanked free, glaring.

Then her phone rang.

Dominic’s name flashed on the screen.

Her hands shook. She couldn’t answer. Couldn’t speak.

The tears kept coming.
###Chapter 87

"You can't answer the phone like this." Evelyn didn't need to glance at the screen to know who was calling.

Olivia's head dropped as tears streamed down her face.

"Come on, wipe your tears and follow me." Evelyn couldn't offer comfort. She pulled out tissues and handed them to Olivia—the only small kindness she could manage.

Olivia refused the tissues. She inhaled sharply, swiped the tears from her cheeks, and stepped into the hospital.

A crying woman walking through a hospital wasn’t unusual. People glanced but didn’t stare. Grief was common here.

The elevators were quiet in the afternoon.

Soon, Olivia reached her father’s floor.

"I need the bathroom."

She couldn’t let her father see her like this—red-eyed, broken.

Evelyn waited silently outside.

Inside, Olivia splashed cold water on her face. The mirror reflected her swollen eyes, her trembling lips. She couldn’t steady her breathing.

When she emerged, Evelyn warned, "If you don’t want your father’s condition to worsen, you need to pull yourself together."

Olivia almost snapped. Tell me, how?

She walked past Evelyn and entered the ward.

The nurse excused herself when she saw the patient’s daughter arrive.

Evelyn followed, her presence darkening Robert’s expression.

"Dad," Olivia whispered.

Robert’s glare at Evelyn held pure hatred. The look of a man betrayed by the woman he once loved.

Olivia already knew. If Evelyn dared to say it, the truth was irreversible.

"I came to tell you something," Evelyn announced, stepping forward. "I never planned to disrupt your lives, but fate brought me to Evelyn. She’s remarkable. I adore her."

Her smile was plastic as she draped an arm over Olivia’s shoulders. "Imagine my shock when I learned her last name was Sinclair. My own daughter, grown up. Since we’ve reunited, I think it’s destiny. With you unwell and the old man just back from Japan, Evelyn needs support. A mother like me won’t hurt."

Olivia didn’t pull away. She couldn’t risk her father seeing the cracks.

Robert studied them both, baffled by Evelyn’s sudden maternal claim. But if his daughter didn’t object, he wouldn’t interfere.

"Fine. Talk. I’ll wait outside." Evelyn squeezed Olivia’s shoulder—a silent warning. Don’t mess this up.

Alone, Robert hesitated before speaking weakly, "Evelyn, come here. I need to ask you something—"

"Dad, don’t." Olivia couldn’t bear to relive the abandonment through his words.

Silence was all she wanted.

She’d never cared about her biological mother—until now.

Acknowledging Evelyn wasn’t the issue.

"Think it through," Robert murmured. "When I’m gone, at least you’ll have someone."

Olivia finally lifted her head. "The neighbors said my mother left with a rich man after having me. Grandpa said the same. So why does she have a son four years older than me?"

The puzzle piece clicked.

Robert’s face confirmed he knew. "Your mother wasn’t single when we met. She’d been hurt before. Had a child. The father refused responsibility."

His voice turned bitter. "Later, I learned the man was powerful. Wealthy. Your mother gave him a son."

He didn’t finish.

The ending was obvious. Every fear had come true.

The illegitimate son was claimed. The mother returned to wealth, leaving the man who’d healed her behind.

Olivia didn’t remember returning home.

She moved like a ghost, mechanically cooking dinner for Grandpa and Olivia.

Olivia eyed her over a bite of rice. "Did you lose your mind?"

"No. Eat." Olivia forced a smile.

"Ugh, don’t. You look worse smiling than crying." Olivia knew something was wrong. It had worsened since afternoon.

They stayed quiet for Grandpa’s sake.

After dinner, Olivia washed dishes, head bowed.

Olivia hovered. "You look like you’ve been crying."

"Dad’s condition…" Olivia deflected.

"Really?" Olivia wasn’t fooled.

Terrified she’d break, Olivia finished the dishes and gritted her teeth. "Goodnight."

Olivia was moving back home tonight.

Grandpa rocked on the balcony, chatting with a new bird Olivia had bought.

Olivia held back until she couldn’t. She shut the living room door behind Olivia, then collapsed against the bathroom door, sobbing.

The lock turned.

The door opened.

A weary man stepped in.

Dominic wore a suit, his usual icy demeanor sharper. Keys dangled from his fingers—car keys, and the house key Olivia had taken.

Face-to-face, Olivia’s tears fell faster.
###Chapter 88

"Your friend gave me her key." Dominic's deep voice broke the silence as he held up the key.

Evelyn glanced at him, her eyes still puffy and red from crying. She nodded slightly to show she understood.

Dominic took two steps forward, concern etching his features. But when she flinched, he immediately retreated, putting distance between them.

She was avoiding him.

And he had no idea why.

Just last night, in that small town, she had melted into his embrace, responding eagerly to his kisses. This morning, though restrained by the presence of her grandfather, she hadn't acted so distant.

But now?

She wouldn't answer his calls.

He'd been forced to leave a meeting early—something unheard of at Blackwood Corporation—just to come find her.

Olivia had stopped him outside her apartment. "Mr. Blackwood," she'd said hesitantly, "I know you and Evie are involved, but... she's been acting strange today. Did something happen between you two?"

He hadn't known how to answer.

Now, standing in her living room, he watched as Evelyn avoided his gaze.

"What are you doing here?" Her voice was flat, emotionless.

She wasn't ready to talk. Not about this. Not yet.

Just then, her grandfather shuffled in from the balcony, his cane tapping against the floor. The old man blinked in surprise. "Dominic? Why are you standing by the door? Come in, sit down."

Dominic nodded and moved to the sofa.

Evelyn remained frozen in place.

"Evie, get Dominic some water," her grandfather instructed.

Reluctantly, she obeyed.

When she returned with the glass, Dominic reached for it—and caught her wrist instead.

She jerked back as if burned.

His grip tightened.

Her grandfather, oblivious to the tension, excused himself. "You two talk. I need to rest—that car ride tired me out."

Once they were alone, Dominic pulled her into the kitchen.

Evelyn finally looked up at him, her expression guarded. "I don't like this."

His jaw clenched.

"Your arrogance, your control—I hate all of it." Her voice cracked, tears welling in her eyes. "These past two days? They meant nothing. I just needed someone—anyone—to make Nathan regret what he did."

Dominic's grip turned painful.

"You were convenient," she continued, forcing a bitter laugh. "A powerful CEO, the perfect weapon to humiliate him. But now that he's marrying that woman, now that they're having a child... I realized how pointless it all was."

A tear slipped free. "I wanted them dead. I wanted myself dead. Nothing else matters—not even you."

Dominic's voice was ice. "You expect me to believe that?"

She didn't answer.

He leaned closer. "I don't care who you loved before. The only thing that matters is that I love you now."

Evelyn shuddered.

The kitchen felt suffocating, filled with the scent of him—cool, masculine, intoxicating.

She wanted to run.

But a traitorous part of her whispered: What if Beatrice isn't really his mother?

The thought was ridiculous.

Dominic was too sharp, too calculating. If Beatrice wasn't his birth mother, he would have known.

Wouldn't he?
###Chapter 89

Dominic couldn't decipher Evelyn's thoughts. That uncertainty sent panic coursing through him - he'd always believed they shared an unspoken connection in their relationship.

"Come here," he murmured, extending his arms and drawing her into his embrace.

The instant his large hand made contact with Evelyn's back, she shuddered violently. Each finger felt like a branding iron searing her skin.

"Let go. Don't touch me..." Her voice emerged hoarse and drained.

The woman in his arms lacked even the strength to struggle free.

Dominic tightened his hold. His lips began a slow descent from her forehead, trailing across her cheeks before finally claiming her mouth.

When their lips met, Evelyn let out a choked sob.

Dominic froze instantly, his body rigid. She could feel his rapid, heated breath against her lips.

"If you do this again, I'll vanish completely from your life tomorrow." Evelyn's threat came from a place of desperation.

Cornered and exhausted.

Dominic suppressed his burning desire for her. He shut his eyes, enduring her ultimatum.

She didn't even grant him the chance to speak.

Dominic was naturally domineering and decisive, his approach to everything unyielding and ruthless - especially when the woman he loved beyond reason demanded he stop.

How could he possibly stop?

At Blackwood Manor.

Seeing his father return, Alexander trailed after the tall figure, timidly reminding, "You promised Isabella and me you'd take us to the movies tomorrow."

Dominic remained silent, retreating to his bedroom.

Alexander lingered at the doorway, watching his father head straight for the shower. The stormy mood was palpable, so the boy wisely avoided provoking further trouble.

The next day.

Isabella bounded excitedly into the car with Alexander following closely.

Glancing at the silent man in the backseat, Alexander pressed his lips together. He wanted to ask about post-movie plans - would they eat out or return home for lunch?

One adult, two children.

The driver navigated the vehicle.

Alexander felt deeply dissatisfied. The best father-son bonding involved Dad driving, not some chauffeur. This arrangement made their family of three seem distant rather than close.

Settling into his seat with a pout, Alexander concluded he'd never understand workaholic adults.

"Mr. Blackwood, which cinema are we going to?" the driver inquired.

Alexander also looked curiously at his brooding father, wondering about their destination.

"Check the booking page." Dominic spoke as if just remembering their plans.

The driver pulled over to check movie listings.

Isabella remained oblivious, happily humming to herself while Alexander's small brow furrowed. His expression darkened at his father's apparent indifference.

In his haste, the driver only noted the movie title before confirming the theater location.

Blackwood Corporation owned numerous industries, including major cinema chains.

Arriving at the shopping plaza theater, the manager personally escorted them inside.

The stone-faced adult intimidated the manager into only addressing the children.

Isabella and Alexander entered with their snacks.

The massive IMAX theater stood empty except for them.

"Life?" Alexander munched popcorn as the title appeared on screen.

Isabella watched intently.

"How do people float like that?" she asked about the weightless astronauts.

Her questions met silence. The sole adult sat statue-still, legs crossed, his handsome features frozen in icy detachment.

Thirty minutes later, piercing sobs echoed through the cinema.

The frowning man turned.

"Isabella, don't cry. It's all fake." Alexander leaned forward to comfort his hysterical sister.

The movie's monstrous creature had grown bloodthirsty, devouring humans whole - terrifying imagery for adults, let alone a child.

Dominic finally rose, removing popcorn from his daughter's mouth before scooping her up and striding out.

The waiting driver immediately opened the car doors upon seeing his employer's return.

Outside the theater, Isabella calmed somewhat, though tears still clung to her lashes as she clung to her father's neck.

Back home.

Beatrice descended the stairs. "Back so soon? I thought you were seeing a movie."

"Isabella got scared and wanted to leave." Alexander's expression remained flat.

He shot a sad look at the girl now released by his aloof father before muttering, "Some adults don't understand what's appropriate for children."

Beatrice glanced at her son smoking in the courtyard.

She guessed Evelyn had either ended things or dropped another bombshell.

Given Dominic's mood, Beatrice suspected Evelyn hadn't revealed their blood relation. That truth would have triggered far more destructive rage.

Julian descended, towel-drying his hair.

"Who upset my favorite nephew?"

"Take a wild guess." Alexander shot a pointed look at the smoking figure in the courtyard.

"Who angered your father?" Julian followed the boy's gaze.

Dominic's rigid posture radiated fury.

"How should I know?" Alexander slumped onto the sofa with a pout.

Julian approached his brother cautiously. "Trouble with my future sister-in-law?"

Dominic's intense gaze remained fixed on the courtyard gate.

"The harder you try to please someone, the deeper they can hurt you. Lasting relationships require compatibility and mutual attraction - not force." Julian chose his words carefully.

Though he'd only met Evelyn briefly, her gentle nature was obvious.

She contrasted sharply with his long-abstinent brother whose passions ran dangerously deep.

Julian could easily imagine Dominic's advances being rejected - explaining both his foul mood and taking it out on the children.
###Chapter 90

Evelyn visited the hospital first thing in the morning before heading to T Corporation.

At noon, her phone buzzed with an incoming call from Beatrice.

"Did you hear Dominic's in a terrible mood today?"

"Not my concern." Evelyn's fingers tightened around her phone. Even after all these years, Beatrice's voice still made her skin crawl.

The older woman's tone dropped to a whisper. "You need to understand what's at stake here."

"Breaking his heart would hurt him for months. But telling him the truth? That pain would last a lifetime."

Evelyn let out a bitter laugh. "I wonder if Dominic should feel grateful or cursed to have a mother like you."

She ended the call and slammed her phone onto the desk.

Abigail observed the interaction from her workstation, immediately recognizing Evelyn's dark mood.

Evelyn stood abruptly to print some documents.

As the printer hummed to life, her mind spiraled. How could Beatrice be her biological mother? Even the most heartless animals showed more compassion to their offspring.

There was a saying - even the most vicious tiger wouldn't eat its own cubs.

Beatrice wasn't trying to devour her, but forcing her to swallow this unbearable pain felt just as cruel.

No comfort. No support. Just cold warnings.

"Are you going to take those?" Abigail appeared beside her, eyeing the finished printouts. "You seem distracted."

"Bad night's sleep." Evelyn grabbed the papers without meeting her colleague's eyes.

She didn't care if Abigail believed her. Right now, work was the only thing keeping her from drowning in dark thoughts.

When lunch hour arrived, Evelyn gathered her things to return to the hospital.

Abigail suddenly called out, "Evelyn, wait! The executives need these documents immediately. Mr. Blackwood specifically requested them."

Evelyn didn't turn around. "Sorry, I have to get to the hospital. My father's doctor needs signatures."

Abigail hesitated. She couldn't argue with a medical emergency, but the thought of delivering bad news to Dominic made her stomach churn.

At the hospital entrance, Evelyn collided with an unexpected trio - Olivia, Patricia, and Sophia.

"Well, if it isn't my darling stepsister." Sophia clung to Patricia's arm despite showing no visible pregnancy. "Your father's still alive? I thought cancer would've finished him off by now."

With the house secured and a Blackwood heir in her belly, Sophia had shed all pretense of civility. She wanted to humiliate Evelyn publicly, knowing no one would let Evelyn retaliate here.

Evelyn regarded her with detached amusement. After everything she'd endured recently, Sophia's petty insults barely registered.

She leaned close, whispering just for Sophia's ears: "You should check on your mother's wellbeing when you have time. Wouldn't want my father receiving news about some whore's death."

"My mother?" Sophia's face went slack with shock.

Evelyn was already walking away when Sophia shrieked, "What did you mean by that? Come back here!"

"Disgraceful behavior," Patricia clucked, patting Sophia's arm. "Trash will always be trash."

Olivia, who'd only come to prevent Sophia from extorting more money from Patricia, smirked. "Evelyn's right though. Her father beat cancer once. Meanwhile, accidents happen suddenly..."

"Are you cursing my mother?" Sophia whirled on her.

"Don't fight," Patricia pleaded. "She's family!"

"Family my ass!" Sophia jabbed a finger at Olivia. "Take your friend's side all you want, but how dare you wish death on my mother?"

A sudden breeze swept through the hospital courtyard.

Olivia smiled sweetly. "Fine, since you insist - 'A gentle wind blows today, a mistress passes away.' There, I made it rhyme for you. Hope that satisfies your trashy standards."

Evelyn was already in the elevator when her grandfather encountered trouble back at their apartment.

Two scar-faced thugs cornered the old man carrying his birdcage. "You live around here, old timer?"

"My granddaughter rents the place," he answered nervously, not wanting to cause trouble.

One man nodded. "Lucky for you we're feeling generous. Your careless walking made me swerve and scratch my car. Pay us $1000 and we'll forget this happened."

"One thousand?" The old man paled. The beat-up car's paint had clearly been peeling for years.

When Evelyn's phone didn't answer, they checked his emergency contact card - where Dominic had wisely added his own number yesterday.

The thug dialed with growing interest as someone picked up.

"We've got your grandpa here. He damaged my car. How about you come settle this compensation in person?"
###Chapter 91

Dominic Blackwood hurried from his office to the neighborhood where Evelyn Sinclair and her grandfather lived.

The sleek Range Rover came to a stop at the gated entrance. The moment he stepped out, one of his sharp-eyed subordinates approached.

"Mr. Blackwood, the situation has been contained. The individuals involved have been detained, and the vehicle has been towed away."

"Good." Dominic's response was curt as he strode toward the shaken old man.

Behind him, his subordinate hesitated, unsure whether to follow.

The police had already taken the two scar-faced men away. The traffic department had cleared the wrecked car from the scene. But the crowd from the neighborhood still buzzed with excitement, surrounding the elderly man.

Dominic reached him, helping him up with a firm grip. "Grandpa, it's all taken care of."

"I'm so sorry for the trouble... I couldn't reach Evelyn, so those people called you instead..." The old man wheezed, guilt weighing heavily on him. He hated being a burden.

"Don't apologize. It's fine." Dominic's tone softened slightly. His priority now was getting the old man home safely.

He gave a brief nod to the two neighborhood women who had assisted earlier, then picked up the birdcage. With one hand steadying the old man and the other holding the cage, he guided him upstairs.

Behind them, the women whispered in admiration.

"Look at that son-in-law! Handsome, drives a luxury car, and handled everything before he even got here. That family must have done something incredible in a past life!"

Meanwhile, Evelyn had been at work all afternoon, her phone silent. She had no idea what had happened to her grandfather.

At the end of the day, she called him.

Before he could speak, she asked cheerfully, "Grandpa, what do you want for dinner? It's been ages since we had fish. Should I fry some for you?"

Instead of his usual warm reply, another voice answered—deep, aged, and unfamiliar.

"Evelyn, it's me—your other grandpa. Dominic's grandfather."

She froze mid-step on the busy downtown sidewalk.

How was her grandfather with Dominic's family?

A car honked sharply.

"Sorry!" She waved apologetically at the driver, then hurried toward the subway station, gripping her phone. "Where is my grandpa—?"

"Come for dinner tonight. Dominic's still at the office. You two can return together. That's settled—I'm hanging up now!" Old Master Blackwood sounded pleased as he ended the call.

Evelyn stopped again, completely baffled.

Just then, a black Range Rover pulled up beside her.

She turned and met Dominic's cold, unreadable gaze through the window. A lump formed in her throat.

"Get in." His voice was flat.

She didn’t move. "Why is my grandfather at your place?"

Silence.

"Answer me!"

He said nothing.

"Don’t think you can manipulate me like this. I don’t care if he stays with you forever." She refused to back down.

Dominic always had a way of controlling her. But this time, she wouldn’t let him.

"Fine. I’ll take care of him for the rest of his life, then." His voice was icy as he rolled up the window. The car sped off, leaving her standing there, stunned.

Forty minutes later, exhausted, Evelyn arrived home.

The moment she stepped inside, her phone rang.

Her grandfather’s voice was stern. "Evelyn, what’s gotten into you? Why didn’t you leave with Dominic after work? What kind of game are you playing? I’m ordering you to come over right now!"

"Grandpa!" She had no idea what Dominic had told him, but it clearly painted her as the unreasonable one.

"If you don’t come, I’ll take a taxi back to the small town. I’ll pack up and leave tonight." The threat was clear before he hung up.

At Blackwood Manor, the staff bustled about preparing dinner.

The two elderly men sat in the garden, engrossed in a chess game.

Old Master Blackwood chuckled. "Young people these days aren’t like us. Dominic is responsible, but those two just can’t seem to get along. He says he doesn’t know what he did wrong..."

"It’s Evelyn’s fault," Old Man Sinclair declared, moving a chess piece. "She’s usually sensible, but young love has its bumps. When she gets here, I’ll set her straight."

"No need for that. We should mediate, not scold. Don’t be too hard on my future granddaughter-in-law." Old Master Blackwood sounded genuinely concerned.

Old Man Sinclair relaxed.

At least the Blackwoods accepted Evelyn.

When he had arrived earlier, the shock of "Nathan" becoming "Dominic" had nearly given him a heart attack.

But after hearing the full story, he understood.

Nathan had cheated, betrayed her, even gotten another woman pregnant. That scum would never touch his granddaughter again.

Dominic, though—he was different.

A corporate chairman, young and accomplished. He’d followed Evelyn to that small town, even slept in his car for her.

No man would endure that unless he truly cared.

Nearby, Dominic stood with a cigarette in hand, discussing work on the phone. Behind him, the twins glared at their father, still furious about the horror movie incident.

Old Man Sinclair smiled. His granddaughter had found a man of substance.

When Evelyn finally arrived at the manor, the twins rushed to her before she even stepped inside, clinging to her legs like magnets.

Dominic crushed his cigarette, his expression darkening. "Let her go. Who said you could hug her?"

Evelyn ignored him, bending down to comfort the children.

"Why are you crying?" She noticed Isabella’s tears.

The little girl buried her face in Evelyn’s shoulder, sobbing.

Alexander stood stiffly beside them. "Daddy lost his mind. He took us to see Life without checking what it was. Isabella had nightmares. She’s still scared."

Evelyn’s heart ached. She kissed Isabella’s cheek, holding her close.

The little girl cried harder, clinging to her neck. "Aunt Evelyn, I don’t want Daddy anymore."
###Chapter 92

Evelyn Sinclair never imagined Dominic Blackwood would take their twins to see a horror film like Life.

Though she hadn't watched it herself, she'd seen colleagues and former classmates posting about its graphic violence and disturbing scenes. Many called it downright revolting.

Evelyn shot Dominic a sharp glance but remained silent. Cradling little Isabella in her arms, she lowered her head and entered the Blackwood estate.

Isabella rested on Aunt Margaret's shoulder, yet somehow sensed her father's presence as they passed. The toddler lifted her head to stick her tongue out at him.

Upstairs on the balcony, Beatrice Lockwood observed the scene below with a stormy expression.

Hadn't she explicitly warned that girl to stay away from Dominic? Why was Evelyn here again? The audacity!

They looked like some happy family of three!

After composing herself, Beatrice smoothed her features and descended.

The two elderly gentlemen in the garden also witnessed the entrance scene.

Reginald Blackwood chuckled in relief. "I've waited nearly five years for this moment."

"At our age, nothing matters more than seeing the children happy," Reginald Sinclair remarked, moving his chess piece to capture his opponent's.

Despite losing the game, the elder Blackwood couldn't stop smiling.

The scene unfolding was simply too perfect.

Margaret had barely stepped inside when the child leaped into Evelyn's arms, clinging like she'd missed her mother terribly after a long separation.

Meanwhile, Dominic stood nearby with his usual aristocratic bearing, though unconsciously he'd shed his CEO demeanor, transforming into nothing more than a stubborn husband who refused to admit his mistakes.

"Evelyn's here?" Beatrice greeted with forced warmth as she reached the foyer.

Evelyn froze mid-step.

Beatrice addressed the still-smiling elders, "Evelyn, come with me. I have something for you. Last time we met, I was in a rush and couldn't give you my small token."

Evelyn finally looked up at the mention of a "small token."

She suspected this was merely an excuse for a private conversation.

"Madam, no gifts necessary!" Reginald Sinclair interjected, unwilling for his granddaughter to accept anything valuable before marriage.

"Nonsense!" Reginald Blackwood waved off the objection. "We consider Evelyn family. This is between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law."

The gravity of the statement silenced further protest.

Isabella wriggled down from Evelyn's arms to join her brother Alexander on the swings.

Upstairs, Beatrice produced an exquisite diamond-encrusted jewelry box.

"I acquired this at a charity auction for six million," she said, presenting it. "Now it's yours."

"I can't accept something so valuable." Evelyn's refusal wasn't politeness - she wanted Beatrice to get to the point.

Beatrice smirked. "It could fetch five million if resold. Still not interested?"

Evelyn found Beatrice's expression unbearable. "If you've nothing else to say, I'll leave." She turned on her heel.

Twenty minutes later, Beatrice found Evelyn in the kitchen pouring water for Isabella.

"My apologies," Beatrice said without sincerity. "I assumed you'd appreciate jewelry."

Evelyn set down the glass. "After abandoning your family to marry into wealth, you've lived luxuriously for decades. Yet you still behave like some nouveau riche social climber."

Beatrice's jaw clenched at the insult.

"How dare you judge me?" she hissed. "Watch your tongue before you become a laughingstock!"

"At least I wouldn't abandon my child to chase money." Evelyn dropped the bombshell she'd carried for years.

The words released decades of pent-up resentment.

This woman didn't deserve respect.

Beatrice, unused to such humiliation, sneered, "If you're so principled, why come here today? Don't pretend you're not after our wealth."

Evelyn closed her eyes against her mother's venom. She thanked God she hadn't inherited Beatrice's contempt for the less fortunate.

If not for Grandpa, she'd never have come.

She couldn't let him know the truth - it would devastate him.

Without another word, Evelyn walked out.

"Stay away from Dominic," Beatrice called after her. "Name your price!"

Outside, Dominic was "playing" with the children - if one could call it that. He'd dismissed the attendant pushing the swings to take over himself.

Isabella, initially angry with Daddy, forgave him when he started pushing her.

Until he pushed too hard.

The swing soared terrifyingly high.

The child's terrified wails startled everyone - the chess-playing grandfathers and Evelyn with her water glass.

No one knew what possessed the man. With his considerable strength, he'd forgotten children have limits.

Dominic stopped the swing with one hand and reached for his trembling, sobbing daughter.

"No more playing with Daddy!" Isabella cried between hiccups.
###Chapter 93

Dominic's mind had been elsewhere, barely registering the children's presence.

Yet he knew staying near his daughter would inevitably bring him face-to-face with Evelyn again.

Evelyn approached, casting Dominic a fleeting glance before kneeling to wipe the little girl's tears.

Isabella immediately clung to Evelyn's legs.

Scooping the child into her arms, Evelyn comforted her. When she turned and saw Dominic's conflicted expression, she couldn't resist saying, "If you can't handle children, perhaps you should stick to what you're good at."

These twins were nearly the same age as her own children.

The thought of her kids being treated so coldly by their father made her stomach twist.

Dominic remained impassive, studying his daughter's features that bore such striking resemblance to Evelyn's. "Who are you to lecture me on parenting?" he murmured. "An outsider might mistake you for their mother."

Evelyn shot him a sharp look.

Dinner unfolded with both patriarchs presiding. Beatrice Lockwood joined them while Dominic took his seat opposite. The twins deliberately chose spots beside Evelyn, ignoring their father entirely.

Alexander strained to grasp a rib with his tiny hands, chopsticks trembling before finally succeeding. He proudly deposited it in Evelyn's bowl. "Aunt Eve, this is for you..." His smile radiated pure maternal affection.

Abandoned by his own family, Dominic served himself a rib but left it untouched.

"Dominic!" Reginald Blackwood's voice cracked like a whip across the table.

Though nearing thirty, Dominic would always be a grandson first. He recognized the reprimand in his grandfather's tone.

Evelyn's worst fear was materializing.

Dominic selected another rib, placing it in Evelyn's bowl. With meticulous care, he deboned a second piece, leaving only succulent meat. "Enjoy," he said smoothly.

"Thank you." For Grandfather's sake, Evelyn maintained the charade.

The act worked - Reginald Sinclair beamed, raising his glass to toast the Blackwood patriarch.

Evelyn divided most of her rice between Isabella and Alexander. When the nanny noticed, she quickly refilled Evelyn's bowl.

"That's too much," Evelyn protested.

"Eat what you can," Dominic interjected smoothly. "I'll finish whatever you leave."

The nanny smiled. "Miss Sinclair, this rice is exceptional. Please enjoy."

Evelyn accepted the bowl reluctantly.

Some couples shared meals intimately; others couldn't bear to touch each other's leftovers. Their relationship defied categorization.

Hadn't she made her position clear? Dominic's performance felt excessive.

Would he truly eat after her?

Despite lacking an appetite, Evelyn cleaned her plate to spare him humiliation. The idea of the illustrious Dominic Blackwood consuming her scraps was absurd - he'd more likely toss them in the trash.

Beatrice contributed only hollow pleasantries throughout the meal.

Evelyn strategized how to minimize contact between the grandfathers. Their continued association meant more forced interactions with Dominic.

She recalled her teenage infatuation - how completely he'd captivated her. From their recent proximity to the shocking revelation of shared parentage, she needed distance to recalibrate.

If she couldn't view him as a half-brother, she'd treat him as a stranger.

Difficult, given his apparent regard for her. But not impossible.

After dinner, Reginald Blackwood announced, "Your grandfather will stay with me awhile. Two lonely old men playing chess and drinking tea."

Evelyn objected immediately. "We couldn't possibly impose."

How could she reduce contact if Grandfather lived here?

"Nonsense!" The elder Blackwood waved her off. "Are you suggesting I can't host properly?"

Dominic remained silent on the sofa, sipping tea with characteristic detachment.

Beatrice added, "Let the old men enjoy each other's company." Her saccharine tone turned Evelyn's stomach.

"Dominic, drive Evelyn home," Reginald ordered.

Evelyn grabbed her purse. "I'll call a ride. He's undoubtedly busy."

Ignoring her, Dominic retrieved his keys and headed for the garage.

Reginald's sharp eyes missed nothing. The rift between his grandson and Evelyn clearly persisted. Keeping Reginald Sinclair here would buy time.

Elsewhere, Nathan Kensington retreated to his room after work.

Olivia knocked. "Dinner's ready, jerk!"

Patricia scolded, "Mind your tongue, girl!"

Nathan exhaled cigarette smoke, rolling up his light blue sleeves. Squinting at his screen, he typed: 'No photos yet, but we work together. I'll get candid shots tomorrow.'

UserA replied: 'No pics of your own girlfriend? Sus.'

Nathan typed: 'Ex-girlfriend. We were too busy going out for photos. Trust me - pure and gorgeous.'

UserB offered: 'Get pics tomorrow. If she's hot, I'll trade you a night with my daughter-in-law for a night with your ex. Deal?'

Nathan tapped ash into the tray, hesitating before replying: 'Deal.'

UserB added: 'First time's awkward, but once you feel that rush? Addictive. Soon you'll beg us to fuck your women. Cuckolding is crack!'

Olivia barged in as Nathan slammed his laptop shut.

"Why so sneaky?" she demanded. "Doing something disgusting?"

"Design project." Nathan smirked, securing the laptop in his bag. "Can't have you stealing my ideas."
###Chapter 94

Evelyn stepped out of her apartment, heading straight for the kitchen.

Olivia followed closely behind, announcing she'd wash her hands in the bathroom first.

Once certain her brother was seated at the dining table, Olivia crept back into his bedroom.

She grabbed the laptop bag, fingers fumbling with the lock. The security mechanism refused to budge without the passcode.

The bag's material proved unusual - no ordinary fabric that scissors could slice through.

"What's this sneaky bastard hiding?" Olivia seethed, tempted to smash the device against the wall.

Night had descended.

Dominic's black Range Rover glided through the bustling city streets.

His sharp profile looked even more severe under the stark contrast of his black suit and white shirt. That perpetual air of detachment clung to him like a second skin.

Evelyn sat silently in the passenger seat.

"Mind if I smoke?" Dominic's request came with polished courtesy.

His politeness put Evelyn in an awkward position. "Do whatever you want, Mr. Blackwood," she replied stiffly.

The intimacy they once shared had evaporated into this strained formality.

Dominic's mood had been foul all evening. As he lit his cigarette, they hit a red light.

The halted car amplified Evelyn's discomfort.

Halfway through his cigarette, the light turned green. Dominic's grip tightened on the steering wheel. "Anything you want to say to me?"

A chill ran down Evelyn's spine. "Did you take my grandfather to Blackwood Manor? When will he return? Or should I come get him—"

"I didn't force him to stay," Dominic cut in, his tone grim. "That's his decision."

The implication was clear - he bore no responsibility for the old man's choices.

Evelyn refused to escalate things further. If this was ending, it should end cleanly.

When they reached her apartment complex, Dominic pulled over.

Before exiting, Evelyn steadied herself. This was it - severing ties with a relationship that never should have been.

Staring straight ahead, she forced out the words: "Let's make this clean. We're officially over."

The car door slammed behind her before she could see his reaction.

Dominic remained motionless, watching through the windshield as that slender figure disappeared into the building. His knuckles turned white against the steering wheel.

The apartment greeted Evelyn with hollow silence.

Dominic had become like an abnormal growth on her heart - something that shouldn't have been there, something society deemed unethical.

So she'd cut it out.

Now her heart bled freely.

Would time heal this wound or let it fester?

Evelyn dropped her bag and collapsed onto the sofa, leaving the lights off. Moonlight provided the only illumination.

A headache pounded behind her eyes, but closing them brought no relief.

When she opened them again, a cigarette case and lighter on the coffee table caught her attention.

She recognized Dominic's preferred brand.

'If he came to pick up Grandpa, he must have left these here...'

Childhood memories surfaced - lighting her grandfather's pipe, asking when she'd be old enough to smoke.

"Girls don't smoke," Grandpa had said, patting her head. "It's bad for your health, remember that, Evie."

Yet he'd taken several deep puffs afterward.

Twenty minutes ago, Dominic had sat in that same torment. While she'd stared out the window, he'd smoked to suppress his emotions.

'Does it really help?'

On this lonely, heartbroken night, Evelyn found herself reaching for his cigarette.

The first drag made her cough violently.

Smoke filled her mouth and nose.

It brought no comfort - only intensified the ache.

By the time she finished the cigarette, tears streamed down her face.

"Dominic, that's enough..." Julian snatched the nearly empty rum bottle.

Getting drunk to numb pain - something a man of Dominic's pride and intellect would normally never do.

Dominic didn't fight for the bottle.

His trembling hands lit another cigarette instead.

To him, Evelyn was like water to a parched man - her sweetness secondary to how she sustained him, revitalized him.

Rain began pattering outside.

Julian scanned the hotel suite. No women in sight - not even staff. Should he stay with this emotionally shattered man?

"Should I call Evelyn?" It seemed the only solution.

Perhaps she held the key to this situation.

Julian dialed her number.

When she answered, he rushed out: "Evelyn? It's Julian! My brother's had too much to drink, can you—"

She cut him off mid-sentence.

After listening briefly, Julian hung up with a sigh. He wouldn't call again.

Evelyn's words echoed: "From now on, his affairs don't concern me. Don't ask why - I don't know either. Goodbye."

Then the line went dead.
###Chapter 95

"Evelyn told me that..." Julian hesitated. He couldn't bring himself to reveal the truth, yet no plausible lie came to mind that could deceive his sharp-witted brother Dominic.

His words trailed off into uncomfortable silence.

Dominic crushed his cigarette violently into the ashtray. Snatching his car keys, he moved to leave.

"You're in no condition to drive after all that whiskey! You'll hate yourself tomorrow!" Julian had never seen Dominic this intoxicated. For the first time, he feared his brother might actually crash.

"If you need to go somewhere, I'll call the driver."

After a tense moment, Julian successfully pried the keys from Dominic's grip.

The city streets had turned into rivers under the relentless downpour.

Beneath the stormy night sky, Dominic refused both the driver's assistance and Julian's company. He walked alone through the deluge, arriving at Evelyn's apartment complex completely drenched.

At her door, he rang the broken doorbell repeatedly - first once, then twice, three times...

The cheap rental unit had substandard fixtures, including a malfunctioning doorbell. The exterior light would flash red when pressed, but no sound reached inside.

The elderly neighbors across the hall, still awake, sensed movement outside. Peering through their door, they saw a striking figure - a tall man in an expensive suit and leather shoes, his chiseled features accentuated by the dim hallway light. The luxury watch on his wrist and the latest smartphone in his hand marked him as someone important.

Yet this distinguished man stood soaked to the bone, reeking of alcohol and rainwater, looking utterly wretched.

"My apologies for disturbing you." Even drunk, Dominic retained his manners, offering a polite apology rather than throwing his weight around.

"No trouble at all. Are you looking for someone?"

The neighbors recalled two young women had recently moved in opposite them, though only one remained now - the kind girl who'd brought her ailing grandfather from the countryside.

"Yes." Dominic nodded stiffly, his imposing frame filling the narrow corridor.

Under the flickering hallway lights, surrounded by plumbing service flyers, the bespectacled woman in her fifties studied the drenched man. "Your girlfriend?"

Dominic nearly nodded, then remembered Evelyn's parting words: "Let's make a clean break." The gesture died halfway.

Calling her an ex-girlfriend might make him seem like some obsessed stalker.

"My ex-wife." The title felt painfully accurate.

"Ex-wife? I didn't know she was married." The woman's tone turned gossipy. "When did you divorce? You're living separately already?"

Dominic's jaw tightened. "This afternoon."

"Well, take your time. You're both young. If there's still love, you'll work it out." The husband pulled his curious wife back inside.

As their door closed, the woman sighed over her romance novel. "That felt just like a movie scene. I hope those two work things out."

Her husband, a fan of stand-up comedy, scoffed. "You don't know their story. Maybe he cheated."

"Impossible." Her eyes shone with romantic certainty. "That man's entire being radiates love. Deep, drowning love."

"Keep reading your novels," he muttered, reaching for his headphones. "I need some comedy to wash this drama away."

Early next morning, Olivia called Evelyn.

"Sure you don't want a ride? It's on my way."

"No, I'm heading to the hospital." Evelyn answered on speakerphone while washing her face, keeping the phone on the sink to hide her puffy eyes.

"Eat breakfast. Take care." Olivia hung up while driving.

Evelyn finished washing up and gulped down half a glass of water. Too drained to cook, she planned to grab bread and milk from the corner store.

As she grabbed her bag, the cigarette box on the coffee table caught her eye. Every corner of that package held her attention. Last night's crying session while smoking had provided unexpected relief.

When her entire being drowned in that acrid smoke, the pain had momentarily receded...

She pocketed the cigarettes and lighter.

Opening her door, she immediately recognized that familiar tobacco scent. Looking up, she met eyes even more exhausted than her own.

Dominic stood there, hands in pockets, his tall frame blocking the doorway. A nearly finished cigarette dangled from his lips, his bloodshot eyes terrifying in their intensity.

Evelyn steadied herself for ten full seconds before stepping out.

If she meant to cut ties, she had to commit. Otherwise, all this suffering would be for nothing.

That line could never be crossed. Whatever existed between them had to end here. Few dared violate nature's moral boundaries.

The only path was retreat, no matter how tempting his presence. She had to keep moving backward.

Dominic barred her exit. Without warning, his solid frame pinned her against the hallway wall.

Evelyn had no idea how long he'd been waiting, but he still wore yesterday's clothes.

"What are you doing? We're over."

Those words ignited something in him. Flicking away his cigarette, he seized her face and kissed her with desperate, bruising intensity.

Evelyn fought violently. His touch conjured Beatrice's face, those damning words...

"No... Stop..." She couldn't budge his immovable, furious form.

The cigarette between his fingers still burned, its acrid smoke curling toward her ear...

When Dominic finally released her, the coppery taste of blood filled his mouth. Evelyn had bitten his tongue hard during their struggle.

Still trapping her against the wall, he studied her with those exhausted, bloodshot eyes. His voice emerged tender yet commanding. "What happened? Weren't we good just two days ago?"

"That doesn't matter now. I told you - two days ago, I didn't know Nathan got that woman pregnant..." The lie tasted bitter, but her red-rimmed eyes betrayed her true feelings.

Dominic brushed her tear-stained cheek with his thumb, voice rough. "I'm sorry. In twenty-nine years, you're the only one I've ever loved. I have no experience with this. I messed up."

He searched her face. "A lifetime is long. But meeting the wrong person is worse than being alone forever. Are you absolutely certain we're... wrong for each other?"
###Chapter 96

"We're not meant for each other." Evelyn forced herself to meet his piercing gaze, her voice steady.

Only this way would her words carry weight.

The past two days had left her emotionally drained, her eyes now permanently shadowed with sorrow. That lingering sadness gave her declaration an undeniable authenticity when she spoke with such conviction.

Dominic studied her face. His dark eyes still burned with that familiar intensity, but now they held something else—a chilling undercurrent, like crushed ice mixed with fire. The conflicting emotions in his gaze made anyone who saw it deeply uneasy.

"I need to get to work." Evelyn sidestepped his outstretched hand and headed straight for the elevator.

The doors slid open immediately. She stepped inside without looking back.

As the elevator descended, she struggled to steady her breathing, forcing herself to inhale slowly.

She forgot to grab breakfast on the way and arrived at the hospital on an empty stomach.

The VIP ward where Robert had been staying, along with the specialist assigned to him, had all been arranged by Dominic. Now, Evelyn informed the hospital staff that she could no longer afford such luxury.

With her current salary, it was impossible. Most of her savings had already been drained.

Robert was transferred to a general ward, but he didn’t mind. In fact, he seemed relieved.

Sitting by his bedside, Evelyn held his hand as he looked at her with quiet understanding.

"People talk about equality," he said softly, "but the truth is, our worlds are too different. The rich and the poor don’t mix well. I just want you to live a good life, work hard, and never compromise yourself for anyone."

"I know." Evelyn understood his unspoken concern. He probably thought she’d been involved with a wealthy man for financial support.

Honestly, Robert had been worrying about it for a while.

The VIP ward, the top specialist at Paramount Hospital treating his lung cancer—it all pointed to someone powerful backing his daughter.

And powerful people were usually men.

If it had been a woman, a benefactor, Evelyn would have introduced her by now so he could thank her properly.

The fact that she hadn’t brought this person to meet him suggested she was ashamed.

Not because the man was unattractive, but because the financial gap between them was too vast to explain.

Robert knew his illness had been a heavy burden on his daughter. He didn’t pry into her personal life—she was 24, an adult capable of making her own choices.

When he was moved from the VIP ward to the general ward, he felt a sense of relief. It likely meant Evelyn had ended things with that wealthy man.

Whether it had been a fling or something more serious, it was better this way. Relationships with such financial disparities rarely lasted.

After settling her father in, Evelyn went to fill out the necessary paperwork.

The doctor consulted the hospital director, who immediately called Sebastian.

Sebastian was still at home—it wasn’t yet time to leave for work. He frowned when he answered. "Why the sudden request to change wards?"

"Ms. Sinclair said she and her father can no longer afford the premium care. She’s requesting a transfer to the general ward," the director explained.

"Give me two minutes. I’ll check with Mr. Blackwood." Sebastian hung up and dialed Dominic’s private number.

No answer.

He tried again. Still nothing.

Frustrated, he called Blackwood Manor.

"Blackwood residence," the housekeeper answered.

"This is Sebastian. Is Mr. Blackwood available?"

In the living room, Beatrice set down her morning paper and glanced at the housekeeper. "Who is it?"

"Mr. Whitmore."

Beatrice rose and took the phone. "Sebastian, why are you calling so early?"

"Madam, it’s urgent. I need to speak with Mr. Blackwood."

"Dominic isn’t well. He came home this morning with a fever. Tell me what’s wrong."

Sebastian hesitated. Is Ms. Sinclair just a fling? Would his mother disapprove?

After a brief pause, he lied. "It’s a company matter."

Beatrice didn’t involve herself in business affairs. "I’ll have him call you when he wakes."

Once the call ended, Sebastian phoned the hospital.

"If Ms. Sinclair insists on the transfer, proceed as she wishes."

Evelyn left the hospital and rushed to the office.

Life demanded she split herself in two—one half for work, the other for personal struggles.

When she arrived at the design department, she spotted Nathan lingering near the reception desk, pretending to fiddle with his phone as she stepped out of the elevator.

He looked up. Their eyes met. Neither spoke.

"Morning," Nathan said, unusually polite.

Evelyn ignored him and walked straight to her office.

She sat down, powered up her computer, and buried herself in work.

Nathan slipped into the men’s restroom, phone in hand.

A female intern at the reception whispered to another, "Does Nathan still have feelings for Evelyn? I just saw him taking secret photos of her!"

"Even though they broke up, they still work in the same department. He sees her every day—why sneak pictures? I don’t get it." The other intern shrugged and returned to her tasks.

Inside the restroom, Nathan blurred the office background in the photos to avoid recognition, leaving only Evelyn’s figure visible before sending them to his group.

The first shot, taken as she exited the elevator, captured her from the neck down.

The second, snapped as she entered her office, showcased her silhouette—the curve of her waist, the sway of her hips.

Nathan smirked as responses flooded in.

Anonymous User A: Damn, new guy, your ex is fine. Office hottie, huh? That bodycon skirt—I’d rip it right off. She’s got a killer body. Mouthwatering.

Anonymous User B: I’ve been with User A’s wife. Total lolita. Was shy at first, now she’s addicted to cheating. You should try her—she’s got skills.

Nathan exhaled a cloud of smoke, typing: Tonight. Bring your wife. I’ll set it up.

User A: Deal. My wife’s always ready. When do I get your ex?

Nathan replied: Two days. Department welcome party. After drinks and karaoke, I’ll make sure you get your chance.
###Chapter 97

Dominic finished his arrangements and strode back to his office.

Work was the last thing on his mind. His gaze kept drifting toward Evelyn.

At lunchtime, he caught her wrist in the hallway. His eyes burned with desperation. "We need to talk. Just five minutes."

"There's nothing left to say."

Some relationships ended so badly that friendship was impossible.

"Don't push me—" His pleading tone turned sharp.

Evelyn yanked her hand free and walked away.

Abigail left the office first, scrolling through emails as she headed to the cafeteria. She spotted Evelyn and joined her.

"If we nail this project, our value will skyrocket."

"Even mine?" Evelyn was still a rookie, but ambition burned in her chest.

"Especially yours. Talent gets rewarded here."

Reward. The word sent a jolt through Evelyn.

Her father's cancer treatment was bleeding them dry. Money didn't fall from the sky—she had to earn it.

That's why she stayed at T Corporation.

Starting over elsewhere would take too long. Every second counted.

"How's your dad?" Abigail slid her drumstick onto Evelyn's tray.

"I'm dieting," Abigail lied when Evelyn tried to refuse.

Evelyn had lost weight. Stress had hollowed her out in just days.

After summarizing her father's condition, Evelyn's mind raced. Her father had mentioned savings in Victoria's account—but getting it would be a battle.

She had to try.

Across the cafeteria, Dominic sat by the window, hidden from cameras. He pulled out his phone and booked a luxury suite.

Then hesitated.

What if the people online were scammers?

He messaged a contact in the group instead, arranging a meetup at an unfinished apartment—his and Sophia's future home.

Excitement thrummed through him.

He left work early, hailing a cab to the empty apartment.

The call came before he finished his first cigarette.

A sweet, girlish voice purred through the line. "I'm at the gate. Let me in..."

Five minutes later, they stood face-to-face in the bare living room.

"I love places like this," the woman murmured, her gaze roaming. "So... thrilling."

Dominic wasn't experienced, but he craved adventure.

Soon, the empty walls echoed with moans.

"Am I better than your wife?" she gasped.

Dominic didn't answer—just lost himself in the heat.

Meanwhile, Evelyn dialed Victoria.

The call connected—a miracle in itself.

When Evelyn explained the situation, Victoria exploded.

"That bastard should just die! I don't have a cent left—he bled me dry!"

"My father gave you 100K last month. I'm not asking for all of it—just enough to save his life. I'll pay you back."

Victoria laughed coldly. "That money's mine now. Why don't you beg your friends instead? Oh wait—you don't have any."

The line went dead.

Evelyn stood frozen outside the subway station, numb.

The city buzzed around her, full of smiling strangers. She'd once dreamed of a simple life like theirs.

Now, she was drowning.

Her phone rang again—an unknown number.

"Hello?"

"Aunt Evelyn, I—" Alexander's small voice trembled. "Grandpa's coughing blood!"

Evelyn's blood turned to ice.

She didn't wait for the subway.

Hands shaking, she flagged down a cab and gave the driver the Blackwood estate address.

Inside the mansion, Alexander glared at his perfectly healthy grandfathers and hung up.

Upstairs, Dominic stepped out of the shower, oblivious to the chaos brewing below.

The cab sped through the city, carrying Evelyn toward a lie—and a confrontation she wasn't ready for.
###Chapter 98

Alexander's voice trembled as he confessed, "I just... saw him coughing up blood," before abruptly ending the call.

Evelyn's fingers shook with urgency as she redialed from the backseat of the taxi.

The phone vibrated again in Alexander's small hands just as he was about to return it to Uncle Julian. His wide eyes darted between the two elderly men.

Julian had saved the contact as "Sister-in-law Evelyn" - clearly referring to Aunt Beatrice.

"Answer it," Reginald Blackwood commanded his great-grandson.

Alexander stood like a child caught stealing cookies, nervously pressing the answer button. "H-hello Aunt Beatrice... Are... Are you close?"

"I'm almost there. Tell me honestly, how's Grandpa's condition? Does he need emergency care? Put an adult on the phone!" Evelyn's mind raced with whether to call an ambulance. Blood in vomit never meant anything good.

With both grandfathers mouthing instructions, Alexander switched to speakerphone. "The family physician is examining him now. Great-grandfather arranged it. He's still... still in the bedroom... Please hurry!"

His small finger stabbed the end call button like it burned him.

"Excellent performance!" The two scheming elders patted the boy's head with approval.

Alexander's heart hammered against his ribs. He'd never deceived kind Aunt Beatrice before. The guilt gnawed at him, but the grandfathers' combined pressure had been overwhelming.

Meanwhile, Nathan Kensington finished embarrassingly fast - barely seven minutes.

His weapon had already surrendered.

"That's it?" The seductive woman traced circles on his chest with painted nails, clearly unsatisfied.

This wasn't his wife. She was experienced, uninhibited - no wonder he'd lost control so quickly.

"Round two?" Nathan suggested, unwilling to waste this rare opportunity. There would be other chances, but why wait?

Between work stress and Sophia's constant demands, he needed this escape. A chance to reclaim his masculinity.

With another man's wife in his arms, he began again.

"Ah! Slower..." Her bare back scraped against the rough concrete wall, pain mixing with pleasure. "Oh god... you're better than my husband..."

The thrill of adultery sent electricity through Nathan's veins.

This forbidden excitement fueled him beyond imagination.

"Who's better? Say it!" Nathan stopped abruptly, demanding validation.

"You! Definitely you!" The woman begged through tears. "Please... don't stop..."

His ego swelled. "You'll get everything!"

Afterwards, Nathan rinsed off with a garden hose while his lover dressed.

She picked up his discarded phone. "What's the passcode?" Her coy smile didn't reach her eyes.

Nathan hesitated. This was just physical. No need to share personal details.

She took the phone into the bathroom anyway.

Suddenly feeling like a teenager again, Nathan pulled her back for another round.

His aching muscles protested, but he gave in to desire. This time, he surrendered his passcode too.

Their arrangement was purely physical. No strings attached. No personal entanglements.

As she scrolled through his photos and messages, she smirked. "Your girlfriend's pregnant?"

"Just a fling," Nathan corrected, massaging his sore back.

"How far along?"

"About eight weeks."

"I know people interested in... special arrangements." She batted her lashes. "The referral fee is substantial."

Nathan scoffed. "Seriously?"

"These opportunities don't come often." She pressed closer. "You're clearly not committed. Otherwise, why would you be here with me? Think about it. I'll handle everything."

Nathan felt no love for Sophia - that much was certain.

After tonight's escapade, his perspective had shifted. Life was meant to be enjoyed.

Though he doubted Sophia would agree.

"She'd never go for it."

"There are ways to... persuade her." The woman's smile turned predatory. "Just say yes, and I'll take care of the rest."

Nathan remained silent.

"I'll take that as agreement." She kissed his cheek and forwarded Sophia's photos to her own device.

Perfect for marketing material.

Meanwhile, Evelyn arrived at Blackwood Manor.

A maid escorted her upstairs.

Alexander stood by the bedroom door like a guilty puppy, unable to meet her eyes.

"Grandpa! What happened?" Evelyn rushed to the bedside where Reginald Sinclair lay weakly.

The elderly man appeared deathly pale beneath the blankets, forehead glistening with sweat.

Reginald Blackwood sighed dramatically. "Thank heavens the doctor stabilized him. Too much stress caused his blood pressure to spike."

Evelyn murmured her thanks.

Her grandfather's health had been declining naturally with age, but this seemed sudden.

"Let's get you to the hospital." Evelyn saw her chance to remove him from the Blackwood estate.

"Absolutely not!" Reginald Blackwood interjected. "The doctor said any movement could be dangerous. Bed rest only!"

Evelyn's shoulders slumped in defeat.

She couldn't possibly keep imposing on the Blackwoods after her breakup with Dominic. The thought made her cheeks burn with shame.

"Fetch a damp cloth for your grandfather," Reginald Blackwood ordered.

This was Dominic's bedroom.

Originally, Reginald Sinclair wanted to fake his illness elsewhere, but Reginald Blackwood insisted - reconciliation required the right setting.

Dominic remained hidden in the bathroom's soundproof interior.

Unaware of his presence, Evelyn pushed open the bathroom door without hesitation.

And froze.

Dominic had just finished showering. He stood there, completely nude, water droplets glistening on his toned physique.

Every inch of him was on full display.
###Chapter 99

"Excuse me, I...had no idea you were in here..."

Evelyn's eyes flew shut the moment she saw him. She spun on her heel to leave immediately.

Slamming the bathroom door behind her, she shot both grandfathers an accusing look for failing to warn her about Dominic's presence. Heat flooded her cheeks.

The elderly men exchanged knowing glances. Having witnessed decades of romantic entanglements, they understood that intimacy - whether physical or visual - was essential for relationship progression.

No stimulation meant no fantasies. No fantasies meant no development.

Reginald Blackwood deliberately ignored Evelyn's discomfort, casually pulling up a chair to peel apples for Reginald Sinclair.

Evelyn stood frozen outside the bathroom, trapped in unbearable awkwardness.

When Dominic emerged in his robe, he walked right past her.

The tall, imposing figure strode directly to his massive bed. The loosely tied robe revealed glimpses of his sculpted abdomen with every movement.

Evelyn retrieved a damp towel and began wiping her grandfather's face. "Are you feeling better now?"

"Much improved...though my health keeps declining." The old man felt guilty about deceiving his granddaughter, but having committed to the charade, he couldn't back out now.

Noticing his dry lips, Evelyn said, "Rest, Grandpa. I'll get you some water."

"Bring Dominic a glass too," he added quickly. "I don't think he's had anything to drink all morning."

Evelyn remained silent. Since her grandfather was recuperating here under the Blackwoods' care, fetching water was the least she could do.

She returned with two glasses moments later.

After helping her grandfather drink, she approached Dominic's bed with the second glass, hesitating.

Dominic lay sprawled across the enormous bed in nothing but a dark robe - one knee bent, the other leg stretched out, arms behind his head. The pose would put magazine models to shame.

From Reginald's vantage point, his grandson looked positively indecent.

Not a single button fastened. Just two loose ties at the waist that barely maintained decency.

Reginald coughed pointedly. "Must you parade around half-naked? Have some decency!"

Dominic's eyes flew open as if noticing Evelyn for the first time.

She quickly set the glass down and averted her gaze.

"Could you bring me a blanket?" Dominic's deep, husky voice resonated through the luxurious bedroom.

"The cupboard has plenty," Reginald interjected. "Fetch one to cover that disgraceful display."

Evelyn glanced at the man on the bed - his closed eyes, furrowed brows, pale lips. Clearly unwell.

"No wonder he's feverish," Reginald tattled. "Out all night in the rain after drinking himself senseless."

Evelyn retrieved a gray blanket from the cupboard.

As her fingers closed around the soft fabric, she remembered - how long had Dominic stood outside her door last night? That morning, she'd smelled rain clinging to his clothes when he hugged her.

No surprise he'd fallen ill after such exposure.

After draping the blanket near him, Evelyn returned to her grandfather's side.

Dominic lay motionless, breathing evenly as if asleep.

"Is my brother sick?" Julian Blackwood's voice preceded his entrance. Dressed in racing gear, he pulled off his gloves as he entered.

His gaze lingered meaningfully on Evelyn, though she couldn't decipher its significance.

"Completely wasted, stood in the rain all night outside someone's door," Julian embellished shamelessly. "Lucky to be alive."

Evelyn bowed her head, guilt twisting inside her.

Yet she knew such discomforts were temporary. She just wished time would hurry up and erase this awkwardness.

"What's this blanket for?" Julian asked.

"To preserve your brother's modesty," Reginald lamented. "In my day, such exhibitionism would earn public scorn!"

Julian promptly adjusted the blanket over the "patient's" lap.

"What's the fuss? He's wearing underwear. Besides, Evelyn's seen it all before," Julian teased, watching the color drain from Evelyn's face.

Old Man Sinclair observed his granddaughter's reaction closely. That blush confirmed his suspicions - these two had been intimate for some time.

He suddenly fantasized about Evelyn carrying Dominic's child. At seventy, he wouldn't need to feign illness much longer if that happened.

Beatrice Lockwood returned mid-morning to an empty house. "Where is everyone?"

"Upstairs in Mr. Dominic's room," the housekeeper answered.

"But he's ill! Why disturb him?" Beatrice hated anyone bothering her recuperating son.

"The elder Mr. Sinclair vomited blood earlier. The doctor just left," the housekeeper whispered.

"Vomited blood?" Beatrice froze.

She'd never met Robert's father properly. Years ago, when Robert took her to meet his parents in that provincial town, she'd turned back at their gate and caught the first taxi back to the city.

That single act cemented her reputation as a gold-digging snob in her father-in-law's eyes.

Now the old man might die in their home?

Beatrice hurried upstairs to assess the situation.
###Chapter 100

Evelyn clenched her fists, forcing herself to stand tall despite the fear creeping up her spine.

She had endured decades of suffering. Nothing could shake her now.

As she ascended the stairs toward Dominic's room, the extra bed immediately caught her attention.

Reginald Blackwood sat beside Evelyn on the edge of the mattress.

"What happened to Grandpa Robert? I heard he coughed up blood." Evelyn's voice trembled as she set down her designer handbag.

"Hypertension. Stress made it worse. He needs complete rest and zero agitation. Another outburst could be fatal," Reginald explained, though his words seemed directed at Evelyn rather than Beatrice.

Robert Sinclair lay sleeping, his aged body requiring more rest these days. Missing his afternoon nap wasn't an option.

"Shouldn't he be hospitalized?" Beatrice Lockwood's brow furrowed.

"Hospitals stress him out. Our family physician is on call 24/7. Home recovery is better. Besides, he's too weak to be moved now," Reginald countered.

Beatrice shot Evelyn a pointed look. "Evelyn, come with me."

Evelyn had no choice but to follow Beatrice into the hallway.

Any confrontation would have to happen outside. The doctor's orders were clear - Grandpa couldn't handle any emotional distress.

The moment they cleared the doorway, Beatrice whirled around, teeth clenched. "What game are you and your grandfather playing? Convenient timing for his bloody cough after moving in here!"

"Do enlighten me on how to control someone's medical condition!" Evelyn's hands shook with rage.

How could a woman like Beatrice exist?

Beatrice jabbed a manicured finger at Evelyn. "You reject million-dollar jewelry. Refuse cash. But I see your scheme - playing the long game for the biggest payout! How shameless can you be, dragging your grandfather into this?"

After the tirade, Beatrice glanced around and hissed, "I hope your grandfather coughs up so much blood he chokes on it. Let's see you eat your words when you're collecting his corpse!"

"Have some decency. That man in there raised the son you abandoned." Evelyn's heart ached at having this woman as her biological mother.

If only she'd never discovered the truth.

"Evelyn! Your grandfather's awake!" Reginald called from the doorway.

Beatrice instantly transformed, her expression softening as she patted Evelyn's hair. "Almost done here, Father. Just comforting Evelyn."

Reginald smiled, pleased at their apparent harmony. This boded well for future family relations.

"Evelyn's speaking with her future mother-in-law outside," Reginald told the stirring Robert. "Beatrice can be domineering, but she's sweet to those she likes. They're getting along splendidly."

"Beatrice..." Robert rasped. "What was her maiden name?"

"Lockwood."

Robert frowned, recalling the woman who'd destroyed his son years ago. The name matched...

After the divorce, his son drowned in alcohol, endlessly ranting about Beatrice Lockwood abandoning him and their child for a wealthy man.

"The Blackwoods are filthy rich!"

The realization hit Robert like a truck. His forehead grew clammy, sweat turning icy. His trembling gaze shifted to the sleeping Dominic.

When Evelyn returned, she immediately noticed Grandpa's pallor and rushed to dab his forehead with a cool cloth.

At lunch, a wheelchair was brought for Robert.

Beatrice nearly choked when Robert kept stealing glances at her across the table.

Did he recognize her?

Impossible! He hadn't yesterday. Kevin must never have shown her picture. So why now?

Her venomous glare landed on Evelyn serving pasta. Had the little bitch blabbed?

Robert spoke haltingly before picking up his fork. "Our hometown's being demolished... for some tourist project. Shame... I wasn't done with Luojiazhen yet..."

Beatrice's heart stuttered.

Why bring up Luojiazhen now?

Reginald chuckled. "That place was economically depressed. Reconstruction will modernize it. At our age, we shouldn't cling to the past. Let the young rebuild."

Alexander piped up, "Great-grandpa! You know that place? Is it fun? Can we go?"

"Most our generation has been there." Reginald ruffled the boy's hair.

Robert turned to Beatrice. "What about your generation? Surely you've never visited some backwater like Luojiazhen...?"

Beatrice's cutlery clattered. She hid her shaking hands beneath the table, forcing a smile. "Never been. First I'm hearing of it. Though I'm sure such quaint towns have charm. From your description, the lakes and hills must make for excellent air quality."

Evelyn smirked as she fed Alexander and Isabella meatballs, listening to Beatrice's smooth lies.

"Evelyn, I've had pasta prepared for you and Dominic. He won't eat properly alone while ill," Reginald suggested.

Evelyn started to refuse when Robert clutched his chest, coughing violently. "Go... Don't... anger me..."

Grudgingly, Evelyn took the tray upstairs.

The plush carpet muffled her footsteps. Only her shallow breathing broke the silence.

As she reached the doorway, the tray nearly slipped from her grasp at the sight before her.

Dominic stood naked by the closet, his discarded robe draped over the rumpled bed. His muscular back flexed as he reached for a shirt, belt dangling from one hand.

Evelyn ducked behind the door, pulse racing. The image burned into her retinas - those powerful shoulders she'd once clawed in passion, that tapered waist she'd gripped...

"Seen it before, touched it before. Why the shy act now?" Dominic's cool voice sliced through her thoughts.
###Chapter 101

Dominic's tone held no flirtation, only pure derision.

Evelyn felt heat rise to her cheeks as she pressed herself against the wall behind the door. She squeezed her eyes shut, forcing herself to take slow, measured breaths.

"Get a grip, Evelyn," she mentally scolded herself. "What's wrong with you? How could you even entertain those thoughts about him?"

"You're seriously messed up."

"Have you forgotten what you are to each other now?"

"Wake the hell up!"

After wrestling with her conflicting emotions, Evelyn finally entered the room carrying the food tray.

Dominic stood by the window, now dressed in a charcoal gray shirt and black trousers that accentuated his imposing figure. The outfit made him appear even more unapproachable and cold.

His tired eyes, still heavy with sleep, flickered toward her as she entered. "You brought food?" His voice was ice.

Evelyn set the tray down carefully. "Your grandfather insisted. I couldn't refuse him."

Dominic methodically buttoned his cuffs, his gaze never leaving her. "Sit. You haven't eaten either - I noticed you barely spent any time downstairs before coming back up."

From the timeline, he knew Evelyn hadn't had time for a meal.

But Evelyn remained standing. "Take your time. I'm not hungry."

Dominic's brow furrowed as he watched her retreat to the study without another glance at the food.

Twenty minutes later, Evelyn returned to find the meal untouched.

In a normal relationship, she might have worried about him skipping meals. But they weren't normal anymore.

Whether he ate or starved wasn't her concern. Showing concern now would only send mixed signals.

She wordlessly removed the tray.

Downstairs in the kitchen, Evelyn explained the situation to the housekeeper, who simply nodded and began clearing the dishes without questions.

Noticing that Reginald Sinclair had finished his meal, Evelyn took him for a garden stroll. The smooth pavement made pushing the wheelchair effortless.

Halfway through their walk, the old man suddenly requested, "Fetch me some water, would you? And lend me your phone - I need to make a call."

Unsuspecting, Evelyn handed over her phone. "Of course, Grandfather. I'll get your water now."

"Good." Reginald watched his granddaughter leave before dialing.

Robert Sinclair knew his father was in A City, and about Evelyn's elaborate ruse. They'd coordinated their stories carefully to avoid slip-ups.

Time was short - Reginald spoke quickly when the call connected. "Robert, answer me this - was your ex-wife named Beatrice Lockwood? Is she currently in A City?"

Lying in his hospital bed, Robert immediately understood - his father must have encountered Beatrice and grown suspicious.

"Why hasn't she revealed herself?" he wondered before responding, "You're mistaken, Father. It was Julie Zimmer... My ex-wife's name was Julie Zimmer..."

Robert heard his father exhale in clear relief.

Back at Blackwood Manor...

Evelyn returned with the water to find her grandfather had already ended the call. A quick check showed he'd called her father, but the old man's calm expression suggested nothing amiss.

After settling Reginald upstairs, Evelyn called her father.

"What did Grandfather ask you?"

"He must have run into your mother. Asked if her name was Beatrice Lockwood. I told him his memory was failing - that your mother's name was Julie Zimmer..." Robert's sentence dissolved into coughing.

While he didn't oppose Evelyn reconnecting with her mother, he insisted on keeping it from Reginald.

Evelyn agreed immediately.

She couldn't risk upsetting either man's fragile health. Sitting alone on a garden bench, she contemplated next steps.

The only viable option was waiting until Reginald's condition stabilized - no more bloody coughs - before attempting to return home. Whether that meant home care or hospital observation would depend on his recovery.

The rumble of an engine interrupted her thoughts. A sleek black Porsche Cayenne - brand new - pulled up to the manor gates.

A man in his thirties emerged, immediately embraced by Beatrice. "Maxwell! We've been waiting for you to get out!"

"Get out?" Evelyn wondered. "From where?"

Maxwell Lockwood's sharp features softened with a smile. "Thank you, Aunt Beatrice. Where's Dominic?"

"Upstairs." Beatrice moved past him to hug a petite young woman, her face lighting up. "I barely recognize you, Yvette! How old are you now?"

"Nineteen," Yvette Prescott replied with dimpled cheeks. "Already graduated and starting work soon."

Their laughter echoed as the group ascended the stairs.

Evelyn remained in the garden, feeling like an unwelcome outsider in what should have been her home.

Then her phone rang abruptly.

"Get up here! Your grandfather's coughing blood again!" Beatrice's impatient voice demanded.

Evelyn's heart lurched. She dropped everything and raced upstairs.

But before reaching Reginald's room, Beatrice suddenly yanked her into another room.

"Why are you running around like a madwoman?" Beatrice demanded, studying Evelyn closely.

"My grandfather—" Evelyn began, then realized Beatrice had emerged from the study.

Inside, Dominic sat behind the desk, his expression glacial. Those piercing eyes locked onto her as she stood frozen in the doorway.

Beside him, the young woman from downstairs - Yvette - gazed at Dominic's jawline and throat with undisguised fascination.

On the sofa lounged Maxwell from earlier, legs casually crossed.

The realization hit - Beatrice had lied. Reginald was fine.

With theatrical enthusiasm, Beatrice pulled Evelyn forward. "Yvette here won't stop talking about marrying our Dominic! I told her my son already has a girlfriend. Speak of the devil - here you are!"

"We've broken up." Dominic's deep voice cut through the room.

He frowned at his work, his expression darkening further.

Evelyn blinked in shock before nodding. "We just haven't told the grandfathers yet. I was worried they..."
###Chapter 102

Evelyn's heart sank when Dominic confirmed their breakup to his mother.

Beatrice Lockwood's face twisted in theatrical distress, though her eyes sparkled with hidden delight. "What happened between you two? Surely nothing so serious it can't be fixed?"

Evelyn turned on her heel, desperate to escape.

"Wait, darling!" Beatrice called after her with feigned concern. "Please don't tell the elders yet. The shock might be too much for their health."

Dominic's piercing gaze followed Evelyn's retreating figure.

Across the room, Maxwell Lockwood watched the scene unfold before shifting his attention to his cousin.

Beatrice discreetly wiped her hands before shooting Seraphina Prescott an encouraging glance.

Seraphina seized the opportunity, bringing Dominic a glass of water. "You must be thirsty after all this."

Dominic pinched the bridge of his nose, ignoring both the water and Seraphina's presence.

Maxwell strolled to the window, lighting a cigarette as he observed Evelyn pacing in the garden below.

Even from this distance, he could see the devastation on her face.

As someone well-versed in matters of the heart, Maxwell recognized the invisible wounds Dominic's words must have inflicted.

The cheerful chatter between Beatrice and Seraphina confirmed his suspicions - his aunt had only ever approved of the wealthy Prescott heiress as a potential daughter-in-law.

Finishing his cigarette, Maxwell announced his departure. "I have reservations at the wine bar tonight."

Seraphina disentangled herself from Beatrice. "Goodbye, Aunt Beatrice."

"You must visit again soon," Beatrice gushed. "I need your advice on my new skincare routine." She turned to her son. "Dominic, aren't you going to see them out?"

Dominic remained engrossed in a business call, merely waving them off.

"Don't forget our family gathering this weekend," Maxwell reminded before leaving.

Beatrice watched them descend the grand staircase before confronting her son. "Now that you're single again, perhaps you could consider Seraphina—"

"She's ten years my junior," Dominic interrupted. "If you want her as a daughter-in-law, you'll need to find another son."

Beatrice's face flushed with anger as Dominic made another call.

"Ten years is nothing! Your father remarried an eighteen-year-old!" When Dominic remained impassive, she added, "I've already promised Seraphina an internship at your company."

"The internship stands. Nothing more." Dominic lit a cigarette, his tone final. "I'm working. Don't bring this up again."

Beatrice stormed out, slamming the door behind her.

Meanwhile, Evelyn sat in the garden, her laptop open on the wrought-iron table before her.

She'd been granted extended leave to care for her ailing grandfather, though the circumstances weighed heavily on her.

"Evelyn Sinclair, was it?" Seraphina approached with outstretched hand. "We weren't properly introduced earlier."

Evelyn stood reluctantly. "Yes, nice to meet you."

Seraphina's gaze lingered on Evelyn's delicate hands with poorly concealed envy. "May I call you Evie? I'll be joining your department tomorrow. Aunt Beatrice says you're quite experienced."

"I'm still learning myself," Evelyn demurred.

Seraphina turned to Maxwell. "Shall we go?"

Maxwell offered Evelyn a curt nod before they departed.

Evelyn remained in the garden until dusk, dreading the inevitable awkwardness of facing Dominic again.

As mosquitoes began swarming around her laptop's glow, she gathered her things and retreated indoors.

Old Master Blackwood noticed her insect-bitten arms immediately. "I told you to come inside earlier!"

Young Alexander burst in with homework questions but rushed out upon seeing Evelyn's condition, returning moments later with ointment - only to collide with his father in the hallway.

"Where are you going in such a hurry?" Dominic's stern voice carried down the corridor.

"Aunt Evie got bitten by mosquitoes! I'm bringing her medicine," the boy explained.

Dominic confiscated the ointment. "Finish your homework. I'll deliver this."

Alexander gaped as his father strode toward Evelyn's room, the medicine clutched in his hand.
###Chapter 103

Dominic entered the bedroom just as Evelyn was straightening the sheets.

His gaze darkened when he saw her preparing the foldable bed. Without a word, he tossed a tube of ointment onto the mattress.

Evelyn paused mid-motion, her eyes catching on the medication. The label read "For infant and toddler mosquito bites."

Reginald Blackwood adjusted his reading glasses and peered at his grandson. "How did you know Evelyn got mosquito bites?"

Dominic remained silent.

"You should apply that quickly in case they're venomous..." Reginald Sinclair began recounting to everyone present. "When my poor granddaughter was little, she got bitten by a forest mosquito on her eyelid. The swelling was terrible - it got infected and inflamed. If her father hadn't returned home to take her to the city for treatment, she might have lost that eye."

"It wasn't that serious." Evelyn interrupted, uncomfortable with her grandfather sharing personal stories.

Dominic stood near his king-sized bed with his back to both grandfathers and Evelyn.

The master bedroom spanned nearly 70 square meters. His bed occupied the innermost corner while Reginald Sinclair's temporary bed sat beneath the platform where a dark sofa used to be.

Evelyn had no choice but to sleep on the foldable single bed to care for her grandfather. After making it up, she noticed only a thin, scratchy blanket was provided.

Being in the Blackwood residence, she didn't dare rearrange things. The rough fabric would have to do for one night - hopefully her grandfather would recover enough to leave tomorrow.

"Dominic! Where are your manners? Get Evelyn a proper blanket from the closet immediately!" Reginald Blackwood scolded.

Evelyn looked up. "That's not necessary, Grandfather Blackwood. This is fine."

Truthfully, the thin blanket had fallen from Dominic's bed earlier - the same one she'd used to cover his lower body...

As Evelyn insisted it was fine, Dominic strode toward the walk-in closet with his long legs.

When she'd retrieved the blanket earlier, she'd needed a chair. He simply reached up effortlessly with one hand.

Soon, a soft new blanket covered the foldable bed.

"Finish making the bed later. Apply the ointment first." Reginald Blackwood observed the awkward tension between the young pair.

Evelyn took the ointment and headed for the bathroom to avoid further discomfort around Dominic.

Passing him, she murmured a quiet "thank you" without meeting his eyes.

Once the bathroom door closed, both grandfathers fixed their gazes on the tall, imposing Dominic.

Reginald Blackwood approached anxiously, hands clasped behind his back. "Must you always wear that icy expression? Is this how you treat your future wife? At this rate, you'll die a bachelor!"

"Don't blame Dominic entirely," Reginald Sinclair interjected. "Evelyn shares some responsibility too." He'd noticed his granddaughter maintaining careful distance from Dominic since their arrival.

"Go help her with the ointment. Those bites look painful." Reginald Blackwood hissed through clenched teeth, his frustration mounting.

When the bathroom door opened, Evelyn was applying ointment to her shoulder. Dominic entered silently, closing the door behind him.

Evelyn hastily pulled her shirt up to cover herself. Flustered, she avoided his gaze. "If you need the bathroom, I'll leave."

As she moved to pass him, Dominic caught her arm effortlessly.

Compared to his muscular frame, Evelyn seemed petite and fragile. Suddenly trapped between his body and the marble sink, she glared up angrily. "What are you doing?"

Dominic ignored her question. Instead, he squeezed ointment onto his fingertip and scanned her skin for bite marks.

"I can do it myself." Evelyn reached for the tube.

Dominic held it just out of reach, his dark eyes locking onto hers until she relented with a small sigh.

Her pale skin made the angry red bites stand out starkly. As the cool ointment soothed the itch, Evelyn focused on steadying her traitorously racing heartbeat.

Finding two more bites on her shoulders, Dominic didn't hesitate to slide her shirt aside.

Evelyn stiffened.

"Stop squirming. Would you prefer I restrain you?" His cold gaze met her startled one.

Evelyn glanced nervously at the door. "If Grandfather told you to help, you can pretend. I can manage."

She tried again for the ointment.

"How did mosquitoes bite you through clothing?" His eyes lingered on her skin. For five long years, he'd believed only he'd marked that porcelain skin.

The realization sparked unexpected jealousy.

Evelyn found the bites already feeling better. "You've never been bitten? Mosquitoes bite through fabric all the time."

"Never," Dominic stated matter-of-factly.

Evelyn blinked.

Perhaps his icy demeanor repelled even insects.

After treating all visible bites, Evelyn quickly adjusted her clothing, leaving only her neck and arms exposed.

"Your legs?" Dominic's gaze dropped to her form-fitting work skirt.

She shrank back instinctively.

"I'll handle my legs." She made another grab for the ointment.

Dominic held firm.

Their eyes met - her wary ones locked with his unreadable dark gaze.

While she'd accepted his help with hard-to-reach spots, applying ointment to her legs was something she could easily manage alone.
###Chapter 104

"Sit." Dominic's voice was low and commanding, his expression stormy.

Evelyn refused to comply.

They were no longer together. Intimacy like this was inappropriate now.

Grandfather would be stable by tomorrow. Just ten more hours.

Ten hours was nothing. A good night's sleep would make it pass in a blink.

"Sit." His grip tightened as he yanked her down.

He knew she wouldn’t scream—not with both grandfathers right outside. His large hand clamped around her ankle, trapping her on the closed toilet seat.

"We’re over. You said it yourself. This isn’t right." She kept her voice steady, appealing to his logic rather than fighting him physically.

Dominic ignored her, squeezing ointment onto his fingers before pressing it to the mosquito bites on her calf.

Evelyn hissed, jerking her leg back instinctively.

The ointment was cold. His touch burned. The contrast made her skin prickle with discomfort.

He glanced up at the sound.

She bit her lip, embarrassed by her reaction. But the sensation—his fingers tracing her skin—sent shivers racing through her.

She forced herself to stay still.

The bathroom was dim, only the vanity lights casting a glow. Dominic’s sharp features looked almost blurred in the low light.

His hands were elegant, fingers long and precise.

A memory flashed—his hands on her that night in the hotel suite.

Her breath hitched.

Stop.

She dug her nails into her palm, shaking her head. This wasn’t her. She wouldn’t let desire cloud her judgment.

Breathe. Remember what you are to him now.

Dominic worked methodically, rubbing the ointment into her skin until it absorbed before applying more.

Her bodycon skirt had ridden up.

Too much skin exposed.

Too many bites.

"Spread your legs." His voice was rough.

"What?"

Her eyes flew open, panic flaring.

He met her gaze, unflinching. "You’re bitten there too."

Before she could react, he lifted her skirt, baring her thighs.

"Dominic—" She tried to yank the fabric back down.

His hand clamped over the material, holding it in place. He leaned in, breath hot against her cheek. "Keep fighting me, and this skirt tears."

Her pulse spiked.

His eyes were dark, dangerous.

Why was he like this?

"Your mother knows we’re done. The only ones who don’t are our grandfathers. And you—you’ll have someone new soon. Shouldn’t you save this for her?" The words tumbled out, desperate.

Dominic didn’t respond. His fingers worked between her thighs, applying ointment with slow, deliberate strokes.

Evelyn’s face burned.

She squeezed her legs together.

His gaze turned molten. Lips pressed tight, throat working.

"I’m leaving." She couldn’t stay. Not when every second tempted her closer to sin.

But as she stood, her movement sent his hand sliding higher—

Dominic seized her shoulders, crushing her against him. His mouth crashed down on hers.

She pushed at his chest, but he didn’t budge.

His kiss was relentless—biting, licking, claiming.

Her body betrayed her, heat pooling low despite her protests.

"Don’t—"

He only kissed her harder, hands roaming.

A moan slipped free before she could stop it. She bit his lip, wrenching her face away. "Let me go or I’ll scream."

She was panting, ponytail frayed, skin damp with sweat.

Dominic stilled.

His eyes were wild, chest heaving. For a long moment, he just stared at her, thumb brushing her cheek.

Then he released her.

"Be rational. We can’t do this," she whispered.

His jaw clenched.

That same intensity—that same tenderness—flickered in his gaze.

Evelyn Sinclair, twenty-four, all grown up but still so achingly pure.

And he wanted her.

"Until you marry someone else," he said hoarsely, "I’m not letting go."

The man who’d coldly ended things in the study now defied his own words.

He turned abruptly, splashing water on his face at the sink.

Evelyn stood frozen.

When he finally faced her again, his expression was unreadable.

She couldn’t meet his eyes.

Dominic left without another word.

She stayed in the bathroom until her grandfather called for her.

By the time she emerged, Dominic was gone.

"Dominic left," Reginald Sinclair said, watching his granddaughter’s searching gaze. "Drove off somewhere."

She exhaled. Maybe he’d gone to his usual hotel suite to give her space.

She collapsed onto the foldable bed, exhausted.

Meanwhile, Dominic stood in her apartment, unlocking the door with the keys Olivia had given him.

The ointment had smeared on her skirt during their encounter.

She’d need fresh clothes.

He opened her closet—

And froze.

Lingerie. Neatly folded. Delicate.

His fingers twitched.
###Chapter 105

Dominic selected a lace-trimmed ivory bra and matching panties with tiny cartoon prints for her.

Back at the Blackwood estate, Reginald had already retired for the night. His labored breathing echoed louder than any young man's in the silent bedroom where even a feather's drop would sound like thunder.

Evelyn found sleep elusive, twisting the sheets in restless agitation.

She mentally rehearsed tomorrow's crucial conversation about leaving with Grandpa.

Once they left, should she care for him at home or arrange hospital admission?

If hospitalized, which facility? Certainly not the same one where Dad was recovering.

As she agonized over these decisions, the crunch of tires on gravel startled her.

A vehicle entered the estate at this ungodly hour. "Dominic returning? Or perhaps Julian?" she wondered.

Five minutes later, measured footsteps ascended the stairs - deliberate, authoritative.

When the door creaked open, Evelyn burrowed deeper under the duvet, recognizing Dominic's presence instantly.

His cologne preceded him, cutting through the darkness as he approached.

The covers lifted gently, exposing her feigned slumber.

Evelyn prayed he wouldn't notice her fluttering lashes or the tension in her limbs. Nighttime encounters with him always left her nerves frayed.

Dominic placed a shopping bag beneath her bed with deliberate quietness.

Seizing the moment, Evelyn rolled over dramatically, draping one arm across her face. The movement was too calculated, betraying her wakefulness.

Dominic braced one hand against the mattress, fingers threading through her tousled locks. His whiskey-warm breath ghosted over her ear as he murmured, "Picked up fresh clothes and underthings for you. Change into them tomorrow."

His midnight voice sent electric currents down her spine.

These nocturnal moments were dangerous for them both. She mentally reinforced her resolve - tomorrow, she'd take Grandpa away no matter what.

The inevitable separation loomed.

He'd said he'd only release her when she married. Fine. She'd work harder, care for her family, and find a husband.

This forbidden attraction would destroy them both.

As she bit her lip to stifle emotion, hot tears dampened her lashes. Dominic hovered closer, his restrained exhales warming her skin.

He lingered like a man starved before finally pressing cool lips to her cheekbone in a lingering kiss.

"Sleep well," he rasped before retreating.

Evelyn tracked his movements - the shower running, clothes rustling, bedsprings creaking. Then sudden stillness near her bedside.

Peeking through slitted lids, she saw him standing sentinel in the darkness.

Exhaustion eventually claimed her just before dawn.

At seven, Evelyn awoke to find Dominic's bed empty. "He's out running," Reginald informed her as she stretched.

After freshening up, she approached Grandpa's bedside with water, forcing cheer into her voice. "How are you feeling today? Should we go home or to the hospital?"

Her smile felt brittle under his scrutiny. "That's the fakest grin I've ever seen," he observed.

Heat flooded Evelyn's cheeks at being caught.

Settling beside him, she explained carefully, "Dominic and I aren't married. Staying here too long would raise eyebrows."

She braced for his anger at feeling like an outsider, but Reginald simply nodded after consideration. "We'll go home today. No hospital."

Relief made her beam. "Whatever you say, Grandpa."

"Aunt Evelyn! I brought pancakes!" Alexander burst in wearing a crisp white shirt, sunshine-yellow shorts, and pristine sneakers.

Dominic followed, his gaze catching Evelyn's radiant smile. Something primal stirred in his chest, tugging at his lips until he schooled his expression.

"Eat while they're warm!" Alexander thrust the box forward eagerly.

Selecting a bunny-shaped pancake, Evelyn asked, "Did you eat already?"

The boy nodded vigorously. "Daddy says food trucks are dirty, but today he bought some! He even let me bring these for you."

The gesture warmed Evelyn more than she'd admit.

Earlier that morning, Dominic had watched a couple reconcile over rabbit-shaped pancakes. The girl's delighted smile had sparked an idea.

Now, emerging from his shower, he found only a confused Alexander. "They left," the boy pouted.

Dominic dressed swiftly, storming downstairs with thunderous intensity. He intercepted Evelyn helping Reginald into a taxi. "Put him in my car," he commanded the maid.

Evelyn suppressed a wince at his grip, whispering, "Not here. Everyone's watching." She steeled herself. "My roommate's setting me up on a date this afternoon. I took the day off."

Meeting his smoldering gaze, she twisted the knife. "If things go well... marriage might happen soon."
###Chapter 106

Evelyn Sinclair was desperate to escape Dominic Blackwood's presence. She hastily arranged a blind date, seriously considering marriage to a man she barely knew but thought might be tolerable.

Dominic's fury erupted uncontrollably. His piercing gaze locked onto her. "Am I just some disposable toy? Is this how you choose to discard me?"

Under his intense stare, Evelyn's nerves frayed. She shook her head, fabricating lies. "You're not disposable... but someone like you was never what I truly wanted. I only used you to soothe my wounded pride. After getting revenge on Nathan, my conscience won't let me continue. Unless..." Her voice trembled. "Unless you're content being my puppet forever?"

To Evelyn, Dominic had become far more than just a means to an end.

They'd shared meals, worked side by side. Though professionalism prevented public displays of affection between employer and employee, she'd cherished their stolen moments.

Yet now she forced herself toward other men, deliberately seeking a suitable replacement. This painful charade served dual purposes - convincing both Dominic and herself that their relationship had no future.

"If you've already started using me," Dominic's voice dropped dangerously low, "why not continue for a lifetime?"

His words carried the weight of a solemn vow.

"A lifetime is too long," Evelyn countered bitterly. "Meeting the wrong person is more terrifying than lifelong solitude - your own words to me. I know my flaws better than your idealized version of me. If we married, would I become your trophy wife? What if Nathan makes another demand and I betray you? What if I sleep with him for revenge against his mistress?" A single tear escaped as she spoke.

She exhaled sharply, resisting the urge to wipe the tear away, painfully aware of the watching grandfathers nearby.

Despite her efforts, more tears fell. Though they stemmed from heartbreak over ending things with Dominic, her words told a different story: "Even now, remembering my five-year relationship with Nathan being stolen still burns. If she took my boyfriend, shouldn't I take her husband?"

Evelyn's eyes reddened as she delivered this final performance.

Yet even if the entire world believed her act, Dominic never would.

"I'll let you take my grandfather to the hospital," she conceded stiffly. "But this is the last time." With a curt nod, she turned away.

Reginald Blackwood and Old Man Sinclair observed the tense exchange intently.

As Evelyn approached Dominic's car, she'd schooled her features into careful neutrality. Old Man Sinclair, seeing his granddaughter enter the car without visible distress, assumed their quarrel couldn't be too serious.

"Leaving now, Blackwood!" Old Man Sinclair called cheerfully as Dominic joined them in the vehicle.

"Get well soon," Reginald Blackwood smiled warmly. "Then have Dominic bring you back for our chess matches." He waved until the black Range Rover disappeared from view.

During the hospital trip, Evelyn focused obsessively on her phone, avoiding Dominic entirely.

Noticing this, her grandfather chided gently, "Evelyn, don't be so cold. Forgive her, Dominic - she's always been temperamental."

Dominic's eyes flicked to them in the rearview mirror. "It's fine," he replied evenly.

Evelyn was actually messaging a classmate about the blind date arrangement.

At their recent reunion, she'd reconnected with several former classmates on social media - those she deemed decent people.

Days after the event, group chats buzzed with activity, including one classmate's insistence on setting her up.

Evelyn dared not reveal her involvement with Dominic, fearing their shock. She'd initially demurred, claiming work left no time for dating.

Now, she'd make time - no matter what.

Last night, she'd finally messaged her classmate about meeting the proposed match.

Since then, her phone hadn't stopped buzzing with praises about the man.

'I'd never set you up with someone unworthy. He's my boyfriend's close friend - perpetually single, excellent lifestyle, wonderful temperament. Why haven't I introduced him to others? Because those girls would just take advantage of his kindness!' the classmate gushed.

'Thank you,' Evelyn replied mechanically. 'I'll consider him seriously after we meet.'

'My pleasure! Nothing brings me more joy than seeing two quality people unite,' came the enthusiastic response.

Evelyn stared blankly at the meeting details saved on her phone, mentally retreating.

She deliberately ignored Dominic's presence, forcibly redirecting her thoughts to Beatrice Lockwood's face whenever memories of him surfaced.

This painful reminder reinforced why their relationship couldn't continue.

Dominic pulled up at Silver Hospital's entrance.

Lost in thought, Evelyn had forgotten to specify their destination. Yet Dominic had anticipated this, deliberately avoiding Paramount Hospital.

"Thank you for bringing us," Evelyn said stiffly while helping her grandfather exit. She avoided Dominic's gaze, seeing only confusion reflected there.

"I have commitments," Dominic said curtly. "I won't accompany you inside."

"Understood." Evelyn nodded, guiding her grandfather toward the hospital entrance without looking back.

Dominic drove away immediately.

The sound of departing tires marked Evelyn's resolve to erase their brief relationship from memory and start anew.

Registration, examinations, and waiting for results consumed half their day.

By early afternoon, Evelyn returned her seemingly healthy grandfather to her apartment.

"Just some bloody phlegm," the old man muttered guiltily. "The cancer's gone - surely it's nothing serious..."

Evelyn didn't believe he'd feigned illness.

"Grandfather, I'll return to make dinner. I have errands now - will you be alright alone?" She knew she couldn't constantly hover between work, social obligations, and caretaking.

Perhaps later, with more savings, she could hire help.

At least while her grandfather remained mobile and lucid, caregivers couldn't easily take advantage.

"Go on," he waved her off, settling comfortably before the television.

Reassured, Evelyn departed.

Her phone rang as she reached the street.

An unknown number.

"Evelyn Sinclair speaking," she answered.

"Ms. Sinclair! Come quickly! Young Master Alexander has had an accident!" The nanny's panicked voice pierced through.
###Chapter 107

"An emergency? What's going on?" Evelyn's voice trembled with alarm.

"He... He's threatening to jump from the balcony... Says he doesn't want to live anymore!" The nanny sobbed into the phone. "Ms. Sinclair, please come quickly!"

Evelyn took a steadying breath. "Put him on the phone."

The nanny called out for Alexander.

As Evelyn stepped outside her apartment building, the nanny's panicked voice came through again. "Young Master refuses to speak. He insists on seeing you in person."

"Calm down, he won't jump." Evelyn tried reasoning with the hysterical woman. "Teenagers jumping over exam results? Adults over debts? Sure. But a five-year-old? That's new."

The nanny hesitated before replying, "Very well, Ms. Sinclair. I'll check on him again."

Evelyn ended the call.

"If the little troublemaker acts up again, call his father. Or grandmother. Or grandfather. Or uncle..."

Plenty of responsible adults available.

She'd just extracted her grandmother from Blackwood Manor. No way was she walking back into that lion's den over a child's tantrum.

At Blackwood Manor...

Alexander crossed his arms when the nanny relayed Evelyn's response. "So Aunt Evie doesn't care if I die?" His lower lip trembled dramatically.

"It's not that she doesn't care, it's just..." The nanny suddenly realized how ridiculous this scenario was. What child actually jumps off buildings?

Besides, Young Master had an entire family to handle his dramatics.

Alexander huffed in frustration.

Downstairs, Julian spotted his nephew's antics. "Shouldn't you be in school?" he asked casually.

"Summer vacation, Uncle," Alexander deadpanned, giving him the most withering look a five-year-old could muster.

Julian grinned. "Then why aren't you outside playing? Since when did window-gazing become your hobby?"

Meanwhile, Evelyn had reached the subway when her phone rang again. Unknown caller this time.

She answered warily. "Evelyn Sinclair speaking."

"Ms. Sinclair! It's the Blackwood family nanny again! He's really going to jump! I'll show you!"

Before Evelyn could respond, her screen switched to video mode - revealing Alexander perched precariously on the third-floor balcony railing.

His small frame looked terrifyingly unstable on the narrow ledge.

One wrong move and those tiny limbs would be no match for the hard patio below, awning or not.

"Stay back or I'll jump!" the boy wailed dramatically.

The nanny's terrified face filled the screen. "What do I do? If anything happens to him, I'm finished!"

"Are there no other adults home?" Evelyn demanded.

The nanny shook her head frantically. "After you left, Reginald Blackwood went for tea. Beatrice Lockwood is at her spa appointment. Mr. Blackwood's at the office. None of them are answering! But Young Master only wants you, Ms. Sinclair."

"Give him the phone. I'll talk sense into him."

As the nanny moved forward, Alexander shouted, "No! Don't come near me! She abandoned us..."

Suddenly, Isabella's sweet voice piped up unexpectedly. The nanny gasped - the phone clattered to the ground. Through the blurry screen, Evelyn saw a small figure toppling from the ledge.

The impact sound made Evelyn's blood run cold.

She dropped everything, flagging down the first taxi she saw. Her words tangled as she gave the Blackwood Manor address. Fingers shaking, she kept redialing the nanny's number.

"The number you have dialed is currently unavailable..."

The call wouldn't connect, but she kept trying until the taxi pulled up to the manor gates.

Upstairs...

The nanny peered out the window. "She's here! She came!"

Julian verified Evelyn's arrival before turning to Isabella. "Open wide, princess."

NovelDrama.Org owns this text.

The little girl obediently tilted her head back.

Infant eye drops made her lashes glisten with manufactured tears.

After dosing his niece, Julian turned to his nephew. "Rub your eyes until they're red. I'm hiding - Aunt Evie can't know I'm here." With that, he ducked out of sight.

The nanny ushered Evelyn inside.

"Thank heavens he only broke one leg," the nanny said as they climbed the stairs.

Evelyn stared at her in disbelief. 'Only a broken leg counts as lucky now?'

Entering Alexander's room, she found Isabella clinging to her brother, face streaked with (artificial) tears, looking utterly heartbroken.

"What did the doctor say?" Evelyn approached the bed, guilt twisting her stomach at the sight of Alexander's casted leg.

If she'd come immediately, this wouldn't have happened.

"Aunt Evie..." Isabella released her brother, arms outstretched.

Evelyn scooped up the "distraught" girl, voice thick with emotion. "Don't cry, sweetheart. This is all my fault."

Alexander had intended to guilt-trip Evelyn further, but seeing her genuine distress softened his resolve. "I'm the one who got hurt," he pouted. "Do you like Bella more than me?"

The unexpected vulnerability shattered Evelyn's composure. Her eyes welled up as she looked at him.

"I'm hungry, Aunt Evie... Want your super cheesy mac and cheese," Alexander added, stomach growling on cue.

"Do you have any boxed macaroni?" Evelyn asked the nanny.

The woman nodded conspiratorially. "Mr. Blackwood bans it, but I've hidden some for their cravings."

Evelyn carried Isabella to the kitchen.

The "injured" boy on the bed grinned, giving the nanny a triumphant thumbs-up.

Evelyn's special cheesy mac technique soon filled the air with rich aromas. The nanny suddenly paled. "Ms. Sinclair... Mr. Blackwood's home. If he finds out about the hidden mac and cheese, I'll be fired..."
###Chapter 108

Isabella gasped when she heard the nanny's words. She rushed to hug Evelyn, her tiny hands trembling. "What do we do? Daddy's home."

The nanny wrung her hands nervously, casting pleading glances at Evelyn.

"Tell him I brought it," Evelyn said firmly.

"Thank you, Ms. Sinclair. My boys are still in school—I can't lose this job." The nanny glanced toward the hallway, her fingers twisting in her apron.

Evelyn nodded.

The scent of instant mac and cheese filled the kitchen. There was no hiding it now. Even if she tossed it, Dominic would know.

Might as well own it.

Dominic Blackwood had been raised with silver-cutlery standards. Even during his time in the countryside, he'd never touched processed food.

Wealthy kids lived by different rules.

His lingering feelings for her were a mess—one that wouldn't clear until she married someone else. Stubbornness kept him holding on.

Evelyn didn’t understand his obsession. Maybe it was just novelty.

If a man who despised junk food saw her feeding it to his kids, surely he’d snap. Rage. Realize how beneath him she truly was.

Alexander sat on the bed, engrossed in his handheld console. His little fingers mashed buttons triumphantly.

"Broke your leg?"

A deep voice cut through the room.

Alexander jerked his head up. The console nearly slipped from his grip.

It was a gift from Uncle Julian. If it broke, Daddy wouldn’t replace it.

Games were "a waste of time," according to Dominic.

He lunged to save the device, clutching it protectively before shutting it off.

Dominic loomed over the bed, his gaze dropping to the cast on his son’s leg. "Why the stunt?"

"I... I wanted to see Aunt Evelyn."

"So you jumped?" Dominic’s jaw tightened. Julian’s call had sent his heart into his throat—until he learned the fall mats made it harmless.

Alexander ducked his head. "I’m sorry, Daddy."

"Next time, use your words." Dominic ruffled his hair before turning away.

The nanny hurried out of the kitchen as Dominic approached. "Mr. Blackwood."

He nodded, his attention locked on Evelyn.

She was scooping mac and cheese into a heat-safe bowl, careful not to burn small hands.

When she turned, she nearly collided with him.

Awkwardness thickened the air. She’d left that morning—yet here she was, cooking junk food for his kids.

No good explanation existed.

"What’s this?" His gaze dropped to the bowl.

"Instant mac and cheese. Extra cheese." She took full blame.

The nanny hovered, torn between relief and dread. Would Mr. Blackwood rip into Ms. Sinclair?

Evelyn was young—fragile, even. How would she handle his temper?

The nanny would’ve crumbled already.

Then Dominic said, "Got enough for me? I’m hungry."

The nanny froze.

Had she misheard?

The man who treated junk food like poison—who banned it from his home—wanted some?

Evelyn blinked up at him, speechless.

She’d expected fury. Not... this.

Her throat went dry. She was on his turf now. One wrong move, and his temper could detonate.

Was this a trap?

"Daddy, there’s another pack!" Isabella piped up. If Daddy liked it, maybe he wouldn’t scold anyone. "Alexander and I can share. You can have your own."

Dominic eyed the bowl in Evelyn’s hands. "Give it to them. Then make mine."

Evelyn stood frozen before carrying the food to Alexander’s room.

The nanny set up a bed tray, murmuring warnings about hot food.

Evelyn patted the twins’ heads. "Eat slow."

Then she forced herself back toward the kitchen.

"Extra cheese," Dominic said before she entered.

Sunlight softened his sharp features, but anger still simmered in his eyes—leftover from their morning clash.

Evelyn exhaled and ripped open another packet.

A man like Dominic could have anyone. Why fixate on her?

The answer was obvious: he wanted what he couldn’t have.

She grabbed a clean bowl and boiled water.

Cheese powder bloomed in the air as she stirred.

The microwave hummed. Sixty seconds never felt so long.

Then his voice cut through the silence. "Why skip the blind date?"
###Chapter 109

"I should get going. He's still at work." Evelyn spoke quickly, glancing at the microwave as it beeped.

Dominic stood a few steps behind her, his jaw tightening at the way she mentioned another man.

Someone new was entering her life.

Evelyn forced herself to focus on the mac and cheese, refusing to let her emotions spiral.

She followed the online recipe carefully.

After the timer went off, she added another packet of seasoning, stirred, and popped it back in for two more minutes.

When it finished, she mixed in the cheese and microwaved it one last time.

Dominic watched her, lost in a fantasy.

In his mind, they were newlyweds. She was his wife, rushing home at lunch just to cook for him.

Evelyn didn’t notice.

Her attention was fixed on the dish.

This wasn’t the usual instant version—she was making it properly.

When the final minute ended, she stirred the melted cheese gently.

As she worked, she suddenly felt him too close.

Uncomfortable, she reached for the bowl—and yanked her fingers back with a hiss.

"Where did you burn yourself?"

His hands closed around hers before she could react.

Evelyn twisted away. "It's fine. Not that hot."

Dominic frowned but released her.

The nanny winced, realizing she'd forgotten to give Evelyn oven mitts. She busied herself elsewhere, pretending not to notice.

Dominic grabbed a kitchen towel and pulled the bowl out himself.

"Transfer it to a different dish," Evelyn said, eyeing his hands—pale, strong, unbothered by the heat.

Her pulse skipped.

"The mac and cheese is done. If that’s all, I should leave."

She hurried to the bedroom, grabbed her bag, and said goodbye to the twins.

"Aunt Evie, you’re leaving already?" Alexander’s voice wobbled. "Did Daddy scare you off? I can lock him in his office!"

Evelyn smiled weakly. "He’s your father. I’m not family."

"Then become family! Marry Daddy so you can be our mom. Or—" He brightened. "Grandma can adopt you!"

Evelyn’s chest tightened.

Beatrice adopting her? Impossible. She was already her real mother—not that Beatrice would ever admit it.

And marrying Dominic? Equally impossible.

"Rest well. I’ll visit again soon." She forced a smile and left, her expression crumbling the second the door closed behind her.

She had to get out.

Every time she stepped into their world, she sank deeper. She needed to escape before it was too late.

Her Uber wasn’t here yet when her phone buzzed.

A message from her roommate: Just gave your Facebook to my boyfriend’s friend. He’ll add you—chat with him!

Evelyn replied with a simple Okay.

A friend request appeared moments later.

The guy’s profile picture showed a clean-cut man in glasses, a white T-shirt, and a light gray button-up. Mid-twenties.

Hey, this is Harrison.

Hello, I’m Evelyn.

...You seem down-to-earth.

Do I? Small talk with a stranger made her tense.

I can tell. I know a bit about psychoanalysis.

They messaged until her Uber arrived.

They’d planned dinner, but Harrison grew eager. When he learned she was free, he left work early to meet her.

Evelyn had no choice but to head straight to the café he’d chosen.

In the car, she steeled herself. If they clicked, she’d take this seriously. If he wasn’t picky, neither would she be.

Back at Blackwood Manor...

Alexander pushed his half-eaten mac and cheese away, miserable.

The nanny watched sadly. Most kids resisted stepmothers—but these two were begging for one.

As long as it was Aunt Evie.

Why couldn’t Mr. Blackwood and Ms. Evelyn make it work? The nanny didn’t dare guess. Maybe Evelyn knew she wouldn’t fit in their wealthy world. Maybe she feared being trapped in a loveless marriage.

If one wanted it and the other didn’t, that was that.

As she cleared the dishes, Dominic walked in. She stepped aside.

"Aunt Evie ran away because of you!" Alexander accused.

Dominic grabbed his car keys. "Aunt Evie’s busy. She’s on a blind date."

The twins exchanged looks.

"Blind date? What’s that?"

"It’s how you find a husband," Isabella explained. "Aunt Lily said she did it at Christmas."

Alexander scratched his head. "But what about Daddy?"

Isabella huffed. "Aunt Evie doesn’t like Daddy."

She glared at him for not trying harder.

Alexander wrestled off his fake cast, shoved on slippers, and bolted downstairs.

Dominic’s Range Rover was pulling out when the boy planted himself in front of it.

Eyes wide and pleading, Alexander pouted. "Daddy, bring Aunt Evie back. I waited five years to find someone I want as my mom. If you don’t get her, just run me over."
###Chapter 110

Dominic's fingers tightened around the steering wheel. A cigarette dangled between them, its smoke curling into the air. He didn’t flick the ash—instead, he waved his son over with that same hand.

Alexander trudged toward the car, oblivious.

Dominic studied him with an unreadable expression. "Do you really think she’d become your mother just because you asked?"

The boy scratched his head, confused. Then realization hit. His lips puckered into a pout. "Oh. She doesn’t want us."

Dominic exhaled smoke, watching the horizon. His jaw tightened.

Now that his son wasn’t blocking the driveway, the sleek Range Rover pulled away.

Alexander slumped onto the living room sofa, kicking off his tiny slippers with a sigh.

Julian emerged from his hiding spot, eyebrows raised. "What’s with the long face?"

"Aunt Evelyn doesn’t want to be our mommy." The words came out like a deflated balloon. His whole body sagged, as if he’d just been told Christmas was canceled.

Julian processed this like an adult. Translation: Evelyn was still furious with Dominic. Cold war still ongoing, then.

If a child’s desperate stunt hadn’t fixed things, Dominic was clearly messing up. How hard is it to apologize to your woman?

"Stop moping. Blame your father—he’s emotionally stunted."

Julian had planned to spend the day lounging, but now? Mission: Fix His Brother’s Love Life.

Alexander’s eyes lit up with hope.

Julian suddenly felt the weight of responsibility.

"Do you know where Evelyn lives?" He’d drop the kid at her doorstep. She wouldn’t turn away a heartbroken child.

"She moved. I don’t know the new place."

"Fine. I’ll find out. You’re on your own—your dad’s useless." Julian pulled out his phone.

Alexander scratched his neck. "Aunt Evelyn’s on a blind date."

Julian froze mid-dial. "What? Who told you that?"

"Daddy did..."

A car engine rumbled outside. Both turned.

A black Bentley SUV parked in front of the manor. Out stepped Sebastian, polished in a tailored suit.

He nodded at Julian before addressing Alexander. "Young Master, where would you like to go today? Name it, and I’ll take you."

Julian gave his nephew a meaningful look.

"Um... I want..." Alexander hesitated, then caught on. "I want to see Aunt Evelyn."

Sebastian stiffened.

Dominic’s orders had been clear: Take the kids wherever they want—except to Evelyn.

But the boss rarely indulged his children. And Evelyn was the only woman who’d ever held his interest. Surely bending the rules wouldn’t hurt...

"Of course," Sebastian said carefully. "But do you have a meeting spot?"

Alexander shook his head, eyes pleading.

Julian pulled Sebastian aside. "You know my brother—emotionally constipated. He and Evelyn are in a standoff, and he won’t budge."

Sebastian’s eyebrows shot up. The boss is in a cold war?

And Julian kept calling her Evelyn. That meant Dominic had introduced her to the family. They must really like her.

As a loyal subordinate, Sebastian knew his duty.

"I’ll handle it." He turned to Alexander. "Let’s go find Aunt Evelyn."

"But I don’t know where she is." The boy bit his lip. "She’s on a blind date..."

Sebastian nearly choked. She’s dating while fighting with the boss?

He dialed Abigail.

"Evelyn from your department—where is she right now?"

"She’s off today. Why?"

"Find her exact location. Call me back." He hung up.

Meanwhile, at a steakhouse...

Harrison Wells had just settled into his seat, menu in hand, when Evelyn’s phone rang.

"Mind if I take this?"

"Go ahead." Harrison smiled.

Abigail’s voice crackled through. "Evelyn, where are you? The department needs to send you something—just need your location."

Evelyn gave the address without suspicion. Just a work errand. No big deal.

She had no idea what was coming.
###Chapter 111

The sleek Bentley SUV glided smoothly along the winding highway.

In the backseat, two children sat quietly.

Isabella clutched a juice box, taking small sips occasionally.

Dominic glanced at the rearview mirror, observing the children. Beside them sat a Paw Patrol-themed suitcase.

Alexander had packed it himself, looking every bit the runaway.

Dominic sighed. Handling corporate crises was easier than dealing with his boss's family drama.

He debated whether to inform Mr. Blackwood about this situation.

After careful consideration, Dominic decided to assess Evelyn's reaction first before reporting anything.

"I'm never going back. What about you?" Alexander asked his sister.

"Me neither. The orphanage would be better than that house." Isabella shuddered remembering the constant arguments between their grandmothers.

The only person they'd miss was Great-grandfather Reginald.

Dominic massaged his temples. Even his Harvard MBA hadn't prepared him for this.

At the bistro...

Evelyn found Harrison surprisingly pleasant company.

An ordinary accountant, he dressed simply but neatly - refreshingly normal after her experiences with the Blackwoods.

"Since we both work downtown, maybe I could give you rides sometimes?" Harrison offered tentatively.

When Evelyn didn't respond immediately, he flushed. "Too forward? Sorry, I'll take it slower."

Evelyn smiled. "No, it's fine."

Harrison's ears turned pink at her acceptance.

Their conversation lulled into comfortable silence until the waiter arrived with their salads and steaks.

Just as Evelyn looked up to thank the server, she spotted three familiar figures entering.

Dominic stood at the host stand while the twins dragged an oversized suitcase, scanning the room.

Evelyn's stomach dropped.

"Excuse me," she murmured, heading for the restroom.

Harrison, oblivious, began cutting Evelyn's steak.

Alexander's sharp eyes found his target near the bathrooms.

Years of etiquette training warred with desperation. He abandoned his suitcase and sprinted toward Evelyn.

"Aunt Evie!" The boy collided with her legs.

Evelyn knelt, smoothing his hair. "Sweetheart, what are you doing here?"

"Uncle Sebastian brought us." Alexander's dark eyes welled with tears.

Evelyn's heart ached. The children's affection touched her deeply, but their father... that bridge was burned.

"Let's get you home," she coaxed.

"No! You can't date him! You belong with Daddy!" Alexander's voice rose.

Two women exiting the bathroom shot disapproving looks. "Some mothers," one muttered.

Evelyn checked her watch. Five minutes was too long for a bathroom break. She couldn't abandon this date - not when her colleague had gone through such effort to arrange it.

"Shh, I'm not dating. It's a business meeting," she fibbed.

Alexander sniffed. "Promise? Then we'll wait quietly over there."

Evelyn agreed reluctantly. Sending them away would only cause a scene.

Returning to the table, Evelyn found her steak neatly portioned. "Thank you," she said absently.

"You look pale. Are you unwell?" Harrison asked concerned.

"Just tired," Evelyn deflected.

Nearby, the twins settled at an adjacent table. "Miss? May we have menus?" Isabella asked politely.

Evelyn tensed, expecting chaos. Instead, the children behaved impeccably - if one ignored their bizarre conversation.

"A child without Mommy is like a weed," Alexander sighed dramatically.

"At least weeds grow strong," Isabella countered. "We're like... like wilted flowers."

Harrison glanced at the well-dressed children curiously. They looked nothing like neglected orphans.

An hour later, Harrison received a work call. Evelyn encouraged him to leave, claiming she needed to wait for a colleague.

As Harrison departed, the restaurant doors swung open violently.

A towering figure in an immaculate black suit stormed in, his icy glare making servers scatter.

The twins immediately ducked their heads.

Evelyn turned just as Dominic entered behind his employer, witnessing Mr. Blackwood's wrath firsthand.

In one swift motion, Dominic scooped up Isabella while Mr. Blackwood seized Alexander's arm.

"No! Help me, Aunt Evie!" Alexander wriggled free and latched onto Evelyn's legs, sobbing hysterically.
###Chapter 112

The moment Alexander threw himself at Evelyn, she lost her balance and tumbled onto a cushion.

No matter how much she tried to steady herself, her heart pounded wildly. The rapid thumping in her chest betrayed just how nervous—how terrified—she really was.

"Waaah!" Alexander wailed, his small frame trembling. The sight of him, so tiny and desperate, twisted Evelyn's heart.

She patted his back gently, her gaze lingering on the thick bandage wrapped around his knee. The faint stains of blood had been visible from the moment she spotted him.

At least the cast was off. That meant the injury wasn't too severe.

"Are you hurt?" Harrison asked, his voice tight with concern.

Thankfully, he'd reacted fast enough to cushion her fall.

When Harrison turned his attention to the child, he was about to intervene—to tell the boy that if he had a problem, he should take it up with his father, not cling to a stranger.

But before he could speak, his phone rang.

"Mr. Yates," Harrison answered.

The voice on the other end was sharp, impatient. "Harrison, are you trying to get fired? Do you have any idea what time it is?"

"Go. I'll handle things here."

Evelyn was flustered, her pulse still erratic. She'd heard Harrison's manager yelling through the phone.

Harrison hesitated, his eyes searching hers. "Call me if you need anything."

She nodded.

As Harrison left, he shot a glance at the boy's father—Dominic Blackwood—who stood nearby, his expression dark.

Dominic's brows were furrowed, his gaze locked onto his stubborn son, who refused to let go of Evelyn. After a tense moment, Dominic turned away, dragging his reluctant daughter with him.

The little girl kicked her feet, protesting.

Harrison knew better than to interfere. As unsettling as the scene was, it wasn't his place. He stepped outside to hail a cab.

Just as one pulled up, he caught sight of Dominic forcing his daughter into a sleek Bentley SUV before storming back into the restaurant.

Harrison slid into the taxi, stealing one last glance through the restaurant's pristine floor-to-ceiling windows.

Dominic was striding toward the table where Evelyn sat. Without hesitation, he reached down and yanked his son away from her.

The taxi pulled away.

Harrison exhaled in relief. At least the father had taken control.

"I won't go! I don't want to go with you! Never! You're heartless, Daddy!" Alexander thrashed wildly, his strength surprising for his size.

Evelyn watched helplessly, her heart aching. Her gaze darted to the street outside—Harrison was gone.

She was grateful Mr. Yates had called him away when he did.

Otherwise, she had no idea what Alexander might have blurted out.

In this life—and every life after—she would never, ever have anything to do with Dominic Blackwood again. Her future was set.

A waiter approached, carefully righting the table Alexander had knocked askew.

Evelyn grabbed her bag.

As the staff cleared the table, she headed to the register.

"The gentleman already paid," the cashier informed her with a polite smile.

Just then, Dominic re-entered the restaurant, Alexander still in his arms.

A bright yellow SpongeBob suitcase sat near the counter.

Dominic snatched it up with his free hand, his movements sharp. Not once did he look at Evelyn.

She slipped away without a word.

"Aunt Evie, save me! I don't want to go! I don't want to live with Daddy!" Alexander's voice cracked as he kicked violently, smearing dirt onto Dominic's expensive suit.

His tiny hand reached for her, his sobs wrenching.

The restaurant staff exchanged glances. Clearly, the boy knew her—why else would he call her "Aunt Evie"?

Dominic's jaw clenched as he took in his son's pitiful state, then flicked a cold glance at Evelyn, who stood frozen two meters away. His patience snapped.

"If you don’t stop this," he growled, "I’ll put you up for adoption."

Alexander sniffled. "I wish you would."

Evelyn wasn't indifferent. She just refused to get involved. She didn't want to see, hear, or think about them.

But thoughts didn't always translate to actions fast enough.

As she turned to leave, she kept her head down, pretending she hadn't heard a thing.

The boy's injuries were his father's responsibility.

"Aunt Evie... don't you love me anymore?" Alexander's broken cry shattered her resolve.

Dominic, furious, hurled the suitcase to the ground. The lock shattered on impact.

Alexander wrenched free and bolted toward Evelyn.

"Aunt Evie, please don't go!"

She tried to walk away, but before she could, tiny arms wrapped around her leg.

When she turned, Alexander was on his knees—he'd fallen in his haste. His left knee and arm were scraped raw.

Evelyn gasped. His right knee was already injured. Now both legs were bleeding.

She crouched and gathered him into her arms.

Her vision blurred as she stared at his tear-streaked face. She loved this child. Once, she'd dreamed of marrying Dominic and raising his children as her own.

But...

Afraid she might cry, she pressed her forehead to his, avoiding his watery gaze. "Don’t ever do this again," she whispered.

She couldn't take him.

He wasn't an orphan. Isabella and Alexander belonged to Dominic.

"Aunt Evie... you won't leave us, right?" Alexander sniffled, bravely ignoring his bleeding knees.

Evelyn shook her head—just slightly. She didn’t want to hurt him further.

Inside the restaurant, whispers followed.

"Did you see that? She walked away from the rich guy for the working-class one?"

"Rich doesn’t mean kind," another waiter countered. "He’s got two kids. Who wants to be a stepmom? Plus, did you see how he threw that suitcase? No woman wants a temper like that."

"Or maybe he’s just embarrassed. His son prefers her over him, and she’s with another man. That’d bruise any guy’s ego."

"...Fair point."

The two waitresses exited the bathroom, still murmuring.
###Chapter 113

Evelyn noticed the small boy clutching Aunt Evelyn's skirt hem as she returned to her station. His wide eyes stared fearfully at his towering father. Dominic Blackwood's icy gaze studied the child hiding behind Evelyn.

She knelt to gather Alexander's belongings - two pairs of shoes, his favorite dinosaur toothbrush, a wristwatch, and several crumpled shirts and shorts. Carefully, she repacked everything into the yellow suitcase.

The broken lock caught her attention. "Excuse me, do you have any tape?" Evelyn asked the cashier.

"Just a moment." The woman rummaged through drawers before producing a roll.

Evelyn secured the damaged suitcase with thick layers of tape. It wouldn't last, but at least the boy's things would stay contained for now.

"Aunt Evelyn," Alexander whispered, "can I stay with you? I'll pay rent." He remembered her refusing his summer camp request because she needed to work. He didn't want to burden her.

Dominic's voice cut through. "With what money?"

Alexander swallowed hard. "My Christmas money...and piggy bank savings." He'd calculated it carefully - enough to support himself for ten days away from home. School fees, meals, clothes - he could stretch the funds until his next birthday. His sister Isabella would be better off staying with the Blackwoods.

Evelyn returned the tape and found Alexander still clinging to her bag strap. "Sweetheart, go home with your father," she pleaded, cupping his face.

Dominic took his son's hand. "We're leaving. No more nonsense." His gaze flickered to Evelyn as she tucked hair behind her ear.

"But Aunt Evelyn said she's working, not dating!" Alexander protested, hoping to clear the misunderstanding.

Dominic's piercing look made Evelyn want to explain her white lie, but he simply turned away, dragging Alexander along. The boy stubbornly maintained his grip on Evelyn's bag.

The trio exited the restaurant under the staff's watchful eyes. "Why can't I meet men like that?" sighed the bathroom gossip. "They're either fictional or taken."

Sebastian Whitmore entered, collecting the yellow suitcase. The waitress sighed again. "If I can't have the father, I'll take the assistant. So ruggedly handsome..."

Sebastian loaded the suitcase into the Bentley RV. He glanced between his stoic boss and the comical sight of Alexander - one foot in the car, one foot out - still desperately clinging to Evelyn.

"I'll visit soon," Evelyn promised.

Alexander wrapped one arm around his father's leg while maintaining his death grip on Evelyn. "Don't lie! My friend's mom said that too. She bought him shoes and toys before leaving. Seven years later, he can't even remember her face."

Evelyn nearly pointed out she wasn't his mother, but recognized the futility of logic with an upset child.

Sebastian intervened. "Ms. Sinclair, why not accompany Mr. Blackwood to drop off the children? You can calm them and still make dinner for Old Master Sinclair."

Alexander's grip tightened. Tears welled in his eyes as he looked up pleadingly.

"The young master's injuries need proper cleaning in this heat," Sebastian added pointedly.

Evelyn relented. Between morning's visit and now, one more trip to Blackwood Manor wouldn't matter. In her distraction, she'd completely forgotten about the flash drive. Remembering en route, she called Abigail.

"Actually, I've arranged someone else to handle it," Abigail said.

Evelyn exhaled in relief.

The luxurious RV featured a compact kitchenette and plush seating. Dominic sat stiffly with jasmine tea - known for stress relief - while Alexander poured some for Evelyn and the remnants for his father.

Isabella and Alexander nestled against Evelyn on the sofa, eventually dozing off. Upon arrival, Sebastian carried Alexander inside, summoning the family doctor.

When Evelyn moved to hand Isabella over, the girl clung like a koala. "I'll take her," Evelyn offered, carefully exiting the vehicle. Dominic's hand briefly protected her head from the doorframe before discreetly withdrawing.

After settling the children, Evelyn prepared to leave. Dominic waited by the door, cigarette between his lips. As she emerged, he seized her wrist. While she struggled, he removed the cigarette, cradled her head, and crushed his body against hers in a searing, desperate kiss.
###Chapter 114

Evelyn's breath hitched.

Dominic had completely lost his mind!

They were at Blackwood Manor where his grandfather could return any moment.

Other family members and staff might walk in at any second to witness this madness.

But what terrified her most was being kissed by... Beatrice's biological son.

He was her...

'No. This is wrong.'

'It's too twisted.'

"Stop! Let me go!" Evelyn twisted violently, shoving against his chest.

His demanding mouth chased hers, swallowing her protests. When she gasped, he deepened the kiss, claiming every inch with possessive strokes.

His masculine scent overwhelmed her, making her skin prickle with warning signals.

Pinned against the wall, she fought harder as his body pressed closer.

But Dominic overpowered her easily. His darkened gaze locked onto her lips again, leaving no space between them. Her struggles only fueled his anger.

While his teeth grazed her swollen lips, his cigarette-holding hand caged her head. The struggling made the cigarette butt scrape against the wall, sparks flying.

With his free hand, he yanked off his tie.

As his mouth ravaged hers, she felt her wrists being captured.

Horror dawned when she realized his intention.

"What are you—"

The silk tie wound around her wrists in brutal loops. He secured the knot with terrifying efficiency, rendering her hands useless.

Instinct screamed at her to flee.

Dominic simply lifted her like a ragdoll.

Her kicks accomplished nothing.

He carried her toward the bedroom like a predator with its prey. Any attempt to scream was silenced by his crushing kisses, leaving only muffled whimpers.

The moment he tossed her onto the bed, she bounced on the plush mattress.

Before she could scramble up, she heard the decisive click of the lock.

She knew exactly what came next.

"Don't do this. I'll press rape charges," Evelyn threatened, finally managing to sit up.

When Dominic turned from the door, she made a desperate dash for escape.

Hopeless, but she had to try.

His gaze darkened as he unbuttoned his shirt with one hand while intercepting her. He pinned her back down effortlessly.

Trapped beneath him, Evelyn panted like a cornered animal.

Dominic studied her tear-filled eyes before abruptly sitting up. His expression turned dangerously cruel as he yanked her blouse upward.

The AC's chill kissed her exposed skin.

"No, please don't—" Her plea ended in a whimper when his mouth found her collarbone.

"Ah! Ngh—" Shame burned through her as unwanted sounds escaped.

He ignored her protests.

The manor stood empty, the children asleep. Soundproof walls and humming AC ensured privacy.

If anyone heard anything, they'd assume Dominic was... occupied.

Then she spotted the fruit knife on the nightstand.

Leftover from when she'd cut fruits for Reginald during his recovery.

When Dominic finally released her bruised lips, tears spilled freely. "Am I just your plaything? Some stress relief toy?"

Her sobs grew louder.

Since resistance failed, she switched tactics.

Dominic thumbed away her tears, jaw clenched.

Suddenly, he pulled her upright, pressing their foreheads together. "Do you really hate my touch that much?" His voice grated.

"Yes."

"You seemed to enjoy it at the hotel." His lips brushed hers. "I still remember your moans."

Evelyn's breathing faltered. Cheeks burning, she lied through clenched teeth, "I prefer Nathan's touch—"

The explosion of rage was instantaneous.

She regretted her words as he dragged her off the bed, slamming her against the wall. She should've kept sweet-talking him...

Face pressed to the wall, she could only watch helplessly as his tie-restrained hands twitched.

Dominic's heated breath scorched her neck.

Too furious for words, he gripped her waist, lips at her ear. "Let's hear you scream for me then."

"Dominic! Would your grandfather approve? Your children?" Her blouse hung open, skirt wrinkled.

His tongue traced her earlobe. "You're the only one who needs to know how depraved I am."

"Mmm..." The dual sensation of wet heat and tobacco scent short-circuited her brain.

An involuntary shiver betrayed her.

He caressed her flaming cheek. "Inexperienced girls always cry from pain, don't they?"

His thumb brushed her swollen lips. "These pretty lips have never begged for more, harder..."

Memories from five years ago flooded his mind.

Evelyn bit her lip, eyes squeezed shut. It was true—she'd never uttered those words to any man, not even during her contractual pregnancy.
###Chapter 115

"Let me show you what real pleasure feels like." Dominic's fingers slid beneath the hem of her blouse.

His calloused palms burned against her bare skin as his lips traced the curve of her neck.

The scent of her shampoo intoxicated him.

Evelyn turned her face away, breath ragged. "You won't stop until you get what you want, will you?"

Dominic answered with actions rather than words.

The tight fabric of her pencil skirt bunched around her waist as he lifted it.

Every inch of her was exposed to his hungry gaze. A predator admiring his prey.

Fireworks exploded across her skin with each deliberate kiss moving lower. She bit her lip, torn between resistance and surrender.

The paring knife on the kitchen island caught her eye.

Half of her mind fixated on the blade while the rest succumbed to involuntary moans. Her hips bucked against her will.

She inched toward the counter during their heated struggle.

Dominic's teeth grazed the delicate skin of her shoulder as his belt buckle clinked open.

The leather strap hit the floor with a thud.

The rasp of his zipper sent panic through her veins. She scrambled for the knife.

"No...stop..." Her protest came too late as he thrust against her.

His iron grip on her hips promised bruises tomorrow. She struggled harder, fingers finally closing around the cool metal handle.

Her pulse thundered in her ears as she turned and slashed blindly.

The blade found its mark with a sickening tear.

Silence.

Dominic stared at the crimson stain spreading across his pristine white sleeve.

Evelyn's hands shook violently. The knife clattered to the floor.

His fingers dug into her chin, forcing her to meet his smoldering gaze. "Should've aimed lower if you really wanted to stop me," he growled, pressing her palm against his hardened length. "Or do you still crave what only I can give you?"

Tears streaked her makeup as she trembled like a cornered rabbit.

Alexander rubbed sleep from his eyes, padding through empty rooms in search of Evelyn.

He found his father in the living room, a doctor bandaging his wounded arm.

"Daddy!" The boy clung to Dominic's leg, wide-eyed. "What happened?"

Dominic's jaw tightened. He said nothing.

"Where's Evelyn?" Alexander pressed.

"Married someone else. She'll be another child's mother now." Dominic stood abruptly, striding toward the garage.

Alexander's tiny feet slapped against marble as he chased after him. "Daddy, wait!"

He caught Dominic's pant leg just as the car door opened. "Please fight for her! I want Evelyn to be my mommy!"

Dominic looked down at his son's pleading face. "What's so special about her?"

"She's pretty and kind and makes the best mac and cheese!" Alexander counted on small fingers. "And she reads stories better than anyone!"

"Plenty of women can do those things." Dominic slid into the driver's seat. "And mac and cheese is junk food."

"But you ate three bowls!" Alexander blurted.

The nanny had told him how Dominic devoured every bite Evelyn made.

Evelyn scrubbed her skin raw in the shower.

At the grocery store, her hands moved mechanically while her mind replayed those terrifying moments.

She cooked dinner for her grandfather on autopilot, barely tasting the food.

When the old man fell asleep, Evelyn finally cracked.

Alone in the dark, she fished out a forgotten pack of cigarettes. The first drag burned her throat, but the discomfort grounded her.

Between coughs, a horrifying realization struck her.

Right before she stabbed him, she'd felt him against her.

She might need emergency contraception.

Evelyn curled into a ball, muffling sobs into her knees. "Stupid, stupid, stupid," she chanted, hating her body's traitorous response.

Tomorrow. She'd get the pill tomorrow.

The office coffee machine hissed as Abigail approached. "New girl started today. Yvonne Prescott. Says she knows you." She rolled her eyes. "Showed up two hours late like she owns the place."

Evelyn stirred her tea silently.

"Don't forget the company party tonight," Abigail added with a pointed smile. "I'll drive you."

Unseen behind them, Nathan eavesdropped.

Back at his desk, his fingers flew across the keyboard: Location unchanged. My ex will be there tonight - exactly your type. Don't chicken out.
###Chapter 116

Evelyn had lunch with Abigail in the staff cafeteria.

Yvette only arrived at work after their lunch break had ended.

"Sorry, I bought a tie for my boyfriend yesterday. The traffic was terrible when I delivered it to him this morning, and then again on my way here," Yvette announced to her colleagues, settling into her seat with a smug smile.

Evelyn glanced up at her.

Abigail discreetly texted Evelyn: What's the deal with Yvette?

Not wanting to stir unnecessary drama, Evelyn replied honestly: Dominic's mother adores her and treats her like a future daughter-in-law. But I don't know the specifics of her family background.

Abigail read the message and shot Evelyn a surprised look.

Evelyn returned to her work without another word.

A moment later, realization dawned on Abigail. She turned back to observe Yvette, who was now idly examining her manicure. What an airhead, Abigail thought. No way someone like Dominic would ever fall for her.

She was certain that as long as Dominic had functioning eyes, he'd never marry a spoiled rich girl like Yvette.

Work finally ended.

A little past five, the department filed out behind their manager, heading toward the exit.

Abigail ushered Evelyn into her car.

As she buckled her seatbelt, Abigail glanced outside. "If we hadn't moved fast, I bet Yvette would've come over. Not for me, though—for you."

Evelyn followed her gaze.

Sure enough, Yvette had been approaching, but when she saw Evelyn getting into Abigail's car, she scowled and turned back toward her own vehicle.

"Be careful," Abigail warned. "Don't let that entitled princess manipulate you."

Evelyn nodded.

They had barely driven off when Abigail's phone rang.

"Hello?" she answered through her Bluetooth headset.

"Abigail, is Evelyn with you? Turn around. The venue we booked got canceled. Ms. Prescott reserved a more upscale place. I’ll send you the new address."

The manager hung up.

A moment later, Abigail checked the message and grinned. "Well, well. Our little rich girl is feeling generous. We’re going to the most exclusive private club in the city!"

She made a U-turn at the intersection.

"Order the most expensive thing on the menu when we get there," Abigail told Evelyn. "Might as well enjoy it. In seven years at this company, this is the first time I’ve gotten this lucky."

At the club, Abigail parked and they headed inside.

Each department had their own private room, and the assigned locations had been texted to everyone.

Abigail and Evelyn made their way upstairs to their designated space.

Yvette had arrived long before them and was already holding court with a group of younger female colleagues.

"You all seem so sweet and innocent," Yvette was saying, sipping her water. "When I was studying abroad, I met so many gold-diggers. They’d dress up and crash parties just to 'accidentally' bump into wealthy heirs. Always wearing knockoff bags and cheap clothes." She sighed dramatically. "But I never exposed them."

One of the girls gushed, "Yvette, you’re so kind! I would’ve called them out immediately."

Yvette smiled sweetly. "Then there’s the worst kind—the ones who pretend to be simple. They wear jeans and no makeup, acting all innocent, just to trick some clueless rich guy into falling for them."

"Seriously?" someone gasped.

"Of course," Yvette said, her gaze flicking pointedly toward Evelyn.

Abigail, listening from the sofa, narrowed her eyes. Years in the corporate world had sharpened her instincts—Yvette was clearly targeting Evelyn.

"If a simple girl catches a rich man’s eye, it means she has something special," Abigail cut in, moving to sit beside Yvette.

Yvette scoffed. "Special? Please. When two people come from completely different worlds, the only thing she could possibly offer is a pretty face."

Abigail smirked. "Funny how natural beauty is so rare these days. Must be frustrating for those who need layers of makeup to look presentable."

Yvette’s face darkened.

She clenched her jaw and stayed silent.

The manager, a woman who preferred to stay out of petty squabbles, ignored the exchange. She had no interest in mediating between Abigail and Yvette—especially since Yvette’s family connections made her untouchable.

Instead, she picked up a microphone. "Everyone, listen up!"

The music was too loud for normal conversation.

"Where are the drinks? We’re running low!" she called out.

Nathan stood. "I’ll get them. I’ll ask the waiters to bring enough glasses too."

The manager nodded approvingly. She appreciated efficiency.

Nathan counted heads and left.

Five minutes later, waiters filed in with trays of champagne.

Glasses were distributed.

The manager gave a short speech—mostly about welcoming Yvette. Her tone made it clear Yvette was someone important, though she carefully avoided specifics.

Flattered, Yvette smiled demurely.

She already had plans. Once she secured her position—and Dominic—the first person she’d eliminate was Abigail.

Anyone who sided with Evelyn was an enemy.

The manager also acknowledged Evelyn and Nathan for their good performance during their first month.

"Let’s toast!" she announced.

Glasses clinked.

After finishing her drink, the manager laughed. "Enjoy yourselves! And again, thank Yvette for this generous treat."

Meanwhile, at Blackwood Manor...

At the dinner table, Julian leaned toward Dominic. "I heard the design department’s party involves heavy drinking tonight. Aren’t you worried Evelyn might drink too much and that scumbag Nathan will take advantage?"
###Chapter 117

"Ex-boyfriend?" Alexander was stabbing his steak with a fork. He froze mid-bite when his uncle spoke.

His head snapped up, eyes narrowing.

Evelyn blinked rapidly, her long dark lashes fluttering like butterfly wings under the harsh dining room lights.

Under the twin stares of his niece and nephew, Julian cleared his throat awkwardly. "Yes, ex-boyfriend. The guy Evelyn dated before your father came along..."

He suddenly felt an icy glare piercing through him. Looking up, he met Dominic's stormy expression, the man's injured arm resting stiffly on the table.

Both children immediately turned their questioning gazes toward their father.

"Working alongside her ex? What a disaster!" Margaret Lockwood chimed in with a sneer.

These past few days, Margaret had been practically banished from the estate - shuffled off to play bridge with her society friends or exiled to the countryside cabin.

She wasn't stupid. She knew exactly why.

Beatrice's precious son had found himself a woman, and during that disastrous first meeting, Margaret had witnessed the entire messy family drama unfold.

Now they wanted her out of the way to maintain some illusion of domestic bliss whenever that Sinclair girl came around.

Margaret swallowed her rage. But discovering that Beatrice's potential daughter-in-law had an ex working in the same company? This was too good an opportunity to pass up.

Beatrice sat rigidly across from her.

When their eyes met, Beatrice nearly blurted out that Dominic had already broken things off with Evelyn.

But the family patriarch remained unaware of this development, so Beatrice bit her tongue, maintaining her composed facade.

The elderly Reginald Blackwood finally broke his silence. "Julian, care to explain this situation?"

Julian shot a nervous glance at Dominic. It wasn't illegal to have an ex, was it?

"Evelyn studied abroad and had a relationship during that time. It lasted barely a year before they both returned and coincidentally ended up at our family company," Julian explained hastily. "Turns out the guy was a cheating bastard who—"

"Who what?" Reginald's bushy eyebrows drew together.

Every eye at the table fixed on Julian.

Dominic abruptly set down his utensils. "I'm finished. Excuse me."

"—who cheated with Evelyn's half-sister," Julian finished in a rush.

Margaret's eyes lit up with malicious understanding. "So Dominic and Evelyn have only known each other for what, a month...?"

Once Dominic left, Margaret felt emboldened. "Father, we must be cautious about who we allow into this family. We can't repeat Allison's mistake. If not for Dominic's efforts to restore our reputation after that scandal, the Blackwood name would still be mud. Imagine if the press discovered Zachary's wife was a—"

"Enough!" Beatrice slammed her fork down so hard it bounced off the table.

Margaret merely smirked. "Did I strike a nerve? Everything I said was factual. The children should learn early about the real snakes in this family. About who's truly deceitful and shameless in this household!"

"I'm done." Alexander pushed his plate away.

"Me too." Isabella followed her brother's lead.

Instead of heading upstairs, the twins made a beeline for the gardens.

Anywhere was better than this toxic dining room.

Meanwhile, at the private club...

Evelyn couldn't hold it any longer. The private suite's restroom was occupied, so she ventured out to find the general facilities.

Yvette Prescott followed like a shadow, waiting until Evelyn entered a stall before slamming her palm against the closing door.

"Stop avoiding me. We need to talk."

Evelyn looked up calmly, though her pupils dilated slightly. "I'm not avoiding anyone."

"I'd rather not waste breath on scheming trash like you, but you leave me no choice," Yvette hissed. "I've dealt with countless gold-digging bitches. Even though Dominic dumped you, you need to disappear. Resign. Do it now, and I might throw you a designer handbag or two as consolation."

"Finished?" Evelyn's voice remained steady. "Then get out."

Yvette shoved harder against the door. "You'll do as I say, you pathetic—"

Other women exiting nearby stalls gave Yvette odd looks but quickly averted their eyes, washing their hands in silence.

A janitor entered to mop the floors.

Evelyn smiled coolly. "Ms. Prescott, someone as magnificent as you shouldn't lower herself to confront someone as insignificant as me."

"What?" Yvette's voice pitched higher. "You're disgusting! What does he even see in you?" She carefully avoided saying Dominic's name aloud.

"Perhaps he's tired of perfection," Evelyn mused, fingers moving to unbutton her skirt as if preparing to undress right there. "Maybe he finds my... vulgarity refreshing."

Yvette recoiled, letting the stall door slam shut. She leaned against the tiled wall outside, shaking her head. "And here I thought I had real competition. What a joke. Trash like you gets discarded without any effort on my part."

She yawned dramatically. "Know your place, peasant. You'll never belong in our world. What do you even have to offer? Your thrift store wardrobe? Your broken home? Your embarrassing parents?"

The janitor aggressively mopped near Yvette's designer heels. "Move."

"Ugh! Disgusting!" Yvette shrieked, jumping away from the mop. "This is why I hate poor people!"

Back in the club, Nathan Kensington texted his group chat while searching for Evelyn.

He couldn't ask others about her whereabouts directly—if anything happened to Evelyn after his friends' "prank," suspicion would fall on him first.

After thirty fruitless minutes, Nathan began to worry she'd passed out drunk somewhere.

He finally replied to the group: 'Looking for her, don't worry.'

Outside the club's entrance, a sleek black Bentley sat idling, its customized license plate broadcasting wealth and power.

Sebastian Whitmore emerged, ushering two children toward the entrance.

"Daddy, aren't you coming?" Alexander asked knowingly. The boy saw right through his father's aloof act—Dominic cared more about Evelyn than he'd ever admit. Before entering, the clever child decided to give his father one last chance.
###Chapter 118

The man in the luxury motorhome wore a tailored black suit with a crisp white shirt. His fingers flew across the keyboard as he analyzed the financial reports flashing across his screen.

"Changed your mind about going in? We can leave now if you want," Dominic Blackwood said without looking up from his laptop.

Little Alexander immediately clung to Sebastian's leg. "Uncle Sebastian, take me inside!"

Sebastian chuckled and ruffled the boy's hair.

The motorhome's tinted windows provided complete privacy as it idled illegally at the club's entrance. The doorman eyed the vehicle's diplomatic plates but knew better than to approach.

Other luxury cars were forced to wait behind the imposing vehicle. Their wealthy owners glanced curiously at the motorhome before entering the club, recognizing the unspoken power it represented.

Dominic's sharp jawline tensed as he stared at the screen without seeing it. The dim interior lighting accentuated his stern expression. Only the occasional flicker of his watch's face revealed his growing impatience.

Twenty minutes had passed since Sebastian entered the clubhouse. Evelyn still hadn't emerged.

Upstairs in the VIP lounge, Nathan Kensington cursed under his breath.

His phone buzzed incessantly with angry messages from his so-called friend.

'You promised me that girl tonight! I already let you have my wife last week!'

'Answer your damn phone!'

'One more hour without her and you're out of the group!'

Nathan typed a frantic reply: 'She disappeared! I looked away for one second and she vanished!'

The response came instantly: 'Then ask your coworkers! There's hundreds of people here - someone must have seen her!'

'Do you know how suspicious that would look? This is the top company in our field! I need this job!' Nathan's fingers trembled as he typed.

The reply made him flinch: 'I don't give a damn about your job! I took Viagra an hour ago and if I don't get relief soon, I'm coming to find you instead!'

Nathan was typing another excuse when Yvette Prescott stumbled around the corner, nearly spilling her coffee.

Her designer dress was wrinkled, mascara smudged beneath her tired eyes. The internship party had dragged on too long for the exhausted socialite.

"Whoa there!" Nathan caught her as she swayed. The coffee left a dark stain down her blouse.

Yvette blinked slowly. "M'fine..." Her words slurred as she collapsed against him.

Nathan's mind raced. This wasn't part of the plan. He'd meant to drug Evelyn, not the boss's niece. But with Evelyn missing and his friend demanding results...

He scooped Yvette up, loudly proclaiming for any witnesses, "I told you not to drink so much! What would you do without me?"

His impatient friend waited in the private suite, towel already discarded when he saw Nathan's message with Yvette's photo. The furious reply contained only two words before the threats started.

Meanwhile, Abigail Thornton searched desperately for Evelyn. She turned to Sebastian waiting outside the ladies' room with the children. "This is the last place to check. Wait here."

Isabella patted her brother's hand. "Aunt Evelyn will be okay."

Sebastian had called Abigail immediately upon arriving. Her panic matched his when she admitted Evelyn had vanished from their private room. Both Nathan and Yvette were mysteriously absent too - the two people who'd made Evelyn's life miserable.

Abigail's calls yielded nothing. Yvette had sneered, "Why would I keep track of that nobody?" Nathan claimed he hadn't seen Evelyn either.

Now Abigail burst from the restroom, face pale. "I found her! She's passed out in a stall! I can't wake her up!" She wrung her hands. "Mr. Whitmore... you'll have to carry her out. I can't move her alone."

Sebastian's hand froze on his phone. He wouldn't dare lay hands on Dominic Blackwood's woman.
###Chapter 119

Abigail rushed back to the restroom after informing Sebastian about the situation.

"Evelyn! Wake up!"

No matter how hard she shook or called, Evelyn remained unconscious, her head lolling to one side without response.

Panic gripped Abigail's heart.

Outside, Sebastian immediately notified his boss.

"Uncle Sebastian, can I go in?" Alexander fidgeted anxiously, unable to enter the women's restroom.

Sebastian shook his head. "Wait for your father. You can enter with him."

Each passing second felt like eternity as Alexander stared at the elevator doors.

Isabella slipped past Uncle Sebastian and darted into the restroom.

Following Abigail's voice, she found Aunt Evelyn slumped on the floor. The little girl crouched down, wrapping her chubby arms around Evelyn's neck. Her face crumpled as tears began falling.

"Aunt Evie...waaah..."

While trying to rouse Evelyn, Abigail had to comfort the sobbing child simultaneously.

Dominic arrived and located the restroom.

Sebastian led the way but remained outside.

Hearing footsteps, Abigail looked up to see her grim-faced boss entering. His sharp eyes scanned each stall before finding theirs. Relief washed over her when Mr. Blackwood lifted Evelyn from the floor without hesitation.

Somehow, having a powerful man like her boss take charge made everything feel manageable. Evelyn would be okay now.

Abigail gathered Isabella and followed them out.

"Find out exactly what happened!" Dominic ordered Sebastian before heading to the elevator.

Sebastian handed Alexander to Abigail. "Do you have a driver's license?"

She nodded quickly.

Sebastian gave her the car keys. "Take the children down to the car." Understanding he needed to investigate, Abigail assured him, "Don't worry, Mr. Whitmore." She ushered the twins toward the elevator. "Come on, let's catch up to Daddy."

Sebastian located the club manager.

After explanations, the manager immediately arranged access to security footage.

Meanwhile, in another club room...

Nathan dragged Yvette inside and tossed her onto the bed. Turning to his friend, he apologized, "My bad, she got away. Next time? There'll definitely be a next time."

His friend handed Nathan a beer. They clinked bottles and drank.

"Next time then," his friend said. "Not my type anyway. Could find dozens like her for pocket change."

Nathan froze mid-sip.

"Your problem now." His friend clapped Nathan's shoulder, laughed, and left.

Alone, Nathan stared at Yvette uncertainly.

She didn't interest him. Honestly, girls like Yvette were a dime a dozen - typical influencer types with nothing special.

Approaching the bed, Nathan intended to remove her shoes, cover her with a blanket, and let her sleep it off. Tomorrow he'd claim she got drunk and he'd kindly gotten her a room.

But when his fingers brushed her ankle, heat flared behind his eyes. His gaze traveled up her calves against his will.

From her thighs, his eyes rose further.

Yvette's short skirt had ridden up dangerously.

Nathan released her ankle, staring at her rising and falling chest. He pulled her upright.

Yvette remained limp, completely unresponsive. An evil thought took root.

His phone vibrated.

Nathan checked the message from his friend: 'Took Viagra for your ex but got blue-balled. Now you get to suffer like I did.'

Even with a woman present, that strong a dose wouldn't be satisfied quickly.

Generally, Nathan hated the idea of being drugged into nonconsensual sex.

In the security room...

Sebastian saw Yvette being carried off by Nathan.

He recognized Yvette but didn't care enough to intervene, assuming it was a consensual hookup.

The footage showed Yvette entering the restroom with Evelyn. What happened inside remained unclear.

Fortunately, a cleaner had entered.

Sebastian questioned her.

The cleaner recounted hearing the rich girl verbally abusing the poorer one at length.

"Can you swear to this?" the manager pressed seriously.

Any incident here could force the club's immediate closure if T Corporation's CEO demanded it.

The cleaner nodded firmly. "Every word's true."

The picture became clearer.

Downtown...

In the luxurious penthouse near corporate headquarters...

Abigail stood in the living room.

Evelyn slept in the bedroom, watched over by the twins sitting vigil on the floor as if she were their birth mother. Dominic hovered protectively, his intense gaze fixed on Evelyn's face.

"She'll wake by morning. Likely ingested a modified sleeping pill," the doctor tactfully diagnosed.

The twins sighed in relief at the news.

Hearing movement in the bedroom, Abigail called Sebastian instead of disturbing them. Whispering her update, she asked, "What now?"

"Don't disturb the family. Drive the doctor back. Leave the Bentley at your place tonight - I'll collect it tomorrow."

Abigail gasped. "A Bentley RV? At my place? If anything happens to it-"

Sebastian had already hung up.

Frustrated, Abigail tossed her phone onto a cushion.

Alone with Evelyn and the twins, Dominic loosened his tie and glared at the children. "Go wash up and sleep in your rooms, or I'll have Uncle Sebastian take you back to the estate."

"Daddy," Isabella asked innocently, tugging his pants, "are you sleeping with Aunt Evie tonight?"
###Chapter 120

Dominic remained silent, giving a single nod.

"But I want to sleep with Aunt Evelyn too." Isabella gazed up at her father with pleading eyes, her tiny fingers clutching the hem of his shirt.

To Isabella, Daddy had always been the strictest adult she knew - his rules were absolute.

Alexander paused at the doorway, overhearing his sister's request. He shook his head at her naivety. Daddy would never share what was his, especially not Aunt Evelyn.

"Alexander, take your sister back to her room." Dominic's tone softened slightly when addressing his daughter, but remained firm with his son.

Without protest, Alexander grabbed Isabella's chubby hand. "Bedtime," he declared, leading her away.

Once the children were gone, Dominic shrugged off his suit jacket. He braced his hands against the mattress, studying the unconscious woman before him.

Isabella's bedroom.

"Shower first. I'll wait." Alexander adjusted the water temperature before ushering his sister inside.

Both children had been raised to be independent. Their custom-designed bathroom allowed them to manage their own routines.

Ten minutes later, Isabella emerged wrapped in a pink unicorn towel. She padded over to her brother, who wordlessly began blow-drying her hair.

The warm air lulled her into drowsiness.

Just before bed, Isabella remembered her promise. "I need to call Uncle Julian!"

She clumsily dialed the eleven digits on her bedside phone. The line connected after two rings.

"Hello?" Julian answered.

"Uncle Julian! It's Isabella..."

"Isabella? Are you with your father? Did you find Aunt Evelyn?"

"We found her! But she won't wake up. She's in Daddy's room now. The doctor came too." Isabella relayed everything in meticulous detail.

Julian's grip tightened on his phone. Something was wrong.

But if the doctor had come and gone, Evelyn must be stable.

"Alright, sweetheart. You and your brother get some sleep now." He moved to hang up.

"But Aunt Evelyn's hands are freezing! I wanted to sleep with her to keep her warm, but Daddy said no." Isabella lowered her voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "He said he'd sleep with her instead. How can I trust him to take care of her properly?"

Julian burst into laughter. "Your father is perfectly capable of keeping her warm! If Aunt Evelyn's cold, trust me - he'll make sure she's toasty."

Recognizing his niece's concern, Julian quickly defended his brother. "Don't you want your father to marry Aunt Evelyn? For her to become your mommy?"

"Yes!" Isabella nodded vigorously.

"Then you shouldn't interrupt their alone time. Starting tonight, pray every day that they'll share a bed soon - just like I do." Julian continued his persuasive speech until Isabella finally understood. She hung up with a satisfied grin and drifted off to sleep.

Master bedroom.

Dominic filled the bathroom sink with steaming water. He submerged a white washcloth, ignoring how the heat scalded his fingers as he wrung it out.

Returning to the bed, he carefully wiped Evelyn's face, neck, and collarbone. The motion required him to lift her shirt slightly.

His gaze inadvertently dropped to the rise and fall of her chest, the soft curves barely concealed beneath thin fabric.

Methodically, he cleaned every inch of her.

Finally, he removed her clothes and deposited them in the hamper.

Night deepened.

After showering, Dominic checked on both children. Satisfied they were asleep, he turned off the lights and locked the bedroom door.

Evelyn now wore his pajamas - black with silver pinstripes.

He'd positioned her on her left side, facing away from him.

Dominic took the right side of the bed, creating distance. He knew his limits - and the temptation her unconscious form presented.

Sleep eluded him.

Evelyn's dark hair fanned across his pillow, her scent enveloping him. The oversized pajamas did little to conceal her slender frame.

Unable to resist, Dominic pulled her against his chest, her head resting on his shoulder.

The moment his hands met her soft skin, his breathing grew ragged.

Finally, he flipped her onto her back, studying her makeup-free face. Her lips, though pale, looked irresistibly full.

He claimed them in a searing kiss.

Her dry lips soon grew moist under his attention.

Dominic grew bolder, tracing the seam of her lips with his tongue.

When the kiss left him painfully aroused, he deepened it, plundering her mouth with single-minded intensity.

Evelyn remained oblivious - until the sleeping pills wore off at 4 AM.

Consciousness returned with a dull ache in her abdomen. She gasped, noticing the heavy arms encircling her.

Morning light filtered through undrawn curtains, revealing the familiar skyline of Dominic's penthouse.

Why was she here?

Memories surfaced in fragments - the office party, one beer, Yvette's confrontation...then nothing.

Panicked, she wrenched free from the embrace.

The sudden movement woke Dominic. "You're awake." He rose effortlessly, pouring himself a glass of water.

After draining half, he filled another and offered it to her.

Their matching pajamas highlighted the contrast between them - his muscular frame filled out the dark fabric, while she appeared delicate, almost childlike in comparison.

Anyone seeing her like this would be tempted to pinch those flushed cheeks.
###Chapter 121

Evelyn stared at the glass of water, her throat inexplicably parched.

Dominic had kissed her relentlessly through the night, leaving her lips swollen and dry.

She grabbed the glass and drank greedily. Setting it down, she swung her legs off the bed.

As she moved toward the bathroom, a sudden thought made her pause. She turned—

Before she could ask about her clothes, his arm snaked around her waist, pulling her flush against him. His other hand tangled in her hair as he crushed his mouth to hers.

She fought him, her fingers scrabbling at his arms—then froze.

Something wet. Sticky.

She looked down. Blood smeared her fingertips.

His dark robe hid the stain well, but now that she saw it, the metallic scent filled her nostrils.

His kisses grew wilder, trailing from her lips to her throat. Her hands trembled, stained crimson.

A hollow ache spread through Evelyn's chest.

He was insane. Desperately, helplessly insane.

His mouth moved lower, branding her skin.

Then he shoved her onto the mattress.

She stared up at him, eyes wide with despair. A silent plea shimmered in their depths.

"Why stop now? Had your fill?" Her voice cracked.

Dominic's chest heaved. He knelt over her, gaze icy. "I'll never get enough of you."

His hand clamped around her ankle, yanking her legs up.

She cried out as he pinned them beside her head.

Humiliation burned through her. No escape.

His robe fell open.

Her breath hitched at the sight of him—hard, demanding.

"Want revenge on Nathan?" Dominic snarled. "Using me to hurt him?" He thrust into her without warning.

Evelyn gasped, teeth clenched. Her body shook. "Just finish it. You always take what you want anyway."

Last night's betrayal still haunted her. She'd been so careful—never accepting drinks, keeping her distance.

Yet here she was.

Exhaustion weighed her down.

All she wanted was her father's health, her grandfather's smile, a normal life.

But normalcy was a luxury she'd never have.

For the first time, death seemed peaceful. An end to the torment.

Though hell surely awaited her after what she'd done with Beatrice.

"Get out." The words were rough, final.

The weight lifted as Dominic stood. He stalked to the bathroom. "Never come back."

Alone, he lit a cigarette. Smoke curled around his clenched jaw.

Memories tormented him—her pliant body beneath his hands, so different from her defiant wakefulness.

He finally understood: stolen pleasure held no sweetness.

He wanted her willing.

Evelyn hadn't expected to leave unscathed. Not with his volatility.

Dominic emerged minutes later, ignoring her as he stepped onto the balcony.

She searched for her clothes, only to find them soaked. Spotting a plastic bag, she stuffed them inside.

The pajamas would have to do. She belted the robe tightly, ensuring no skin showed.

At least it covered more than her ruined dress.

Shoes in hand, she fled.

The slam of the door jolted Alexander awake.

"Aunt Evelyn?" He bolted up, finding his father on the balcony, grip white-knuckled on the railing.

That pose meant trouble.

Great-grandfather's words echoed in his mind: When Grandpa died, Daddy didn't cry. How could he? Grandpa had two wives—Grandma Beatrice the mistress, Grandma Margaret the betrayed.

Daddy's life was tangled in their mess.

Love and hate warred inside him.

Great-grandfather said Uncle Julian shouldn't blame Daddy—he hadn't chosen his birth.

Alexander often overheard family fights.

"Without Dominic, the companies would've crumbled under your incompetence!" Great-grandfather had shouted at Grandma Margaret. "Julian's too soft for business!"

"The Crawfords owe me!" she'd screamed back. "Especially Beatrice and her bastard!"

"Dominic owes you nothing!" Great-grandfather's voice broke. "I know what you did! That 'accident' when he was in high school? The hitman warned Beatrice instead. My grandson lived by miracle!"

Alexander carried these secrets like stones. Each day, his heart ached more for Daddy.

He wanted Daddy to marry Aunt Evelyn—to end the lonely dinners, the chain-smoking, the hollow silence.

When Dominic returned, Alexander studied him.

"Daddy... Aunt Evelyn left, didn't she?" The boy trailed him anxiously.

Dominic shut the bathroom door on the chatter.

But something caught Alexander's eye—a small box on the floor.

He picked it up, squinting at the label. "Le-vo-nor-gest-rel? Emergency contraception..."

Frowning, he pushed the door open. "Daddy, is this yours or Aunt Evelyn's?"
###Chapter 122

Dominic heard his son mumbling loudly outside the bathroom. The words "emergency contraception" stood out sharply.

He snatched the small rectangular box from Alexander's hands. Staring at the medication, Dominic's mind flashed to the wound on his arm - the one Evelyn had given him yesterday.

He had touched her, yes. But it was nothing more than anger-fueled retaliation. In the end, he couldn't go through with it.

Alexander and Isabella finished washing up and waited obediently by the door, shoes on, ready for breakfast with their father.

Sebastian had been waiting downstairs for ages with the Bentley idling behind him. With Dominic's injured arm, Sebastian took on all assistant duties now.

Despite the injury, Dominic still carried his daughter as they exited. Sebastian opened the car door so his boss could settle the child inside.

The moment they drove off, Sebastian spotted the tail.

"We'll discuss it at the pancake house." Dominic was already working on yesterday's unfinished business on his laptop.

Sebastian obeyed, ignoring their pursuer.

They arrived at the twins' favorite breakfast spot.

Dominic emerged with a child in each arm. The shop owner recognized them immediately, greeting them warmly and holding the door open.

Sebastian parked and followed them inside.

Several meters away, in a white Volkswagen, a scantily clad woman in the backseat aimed her camera equipment at the pancake house while her driver scrolled through his phone.

Sebastian rapped sharply on their window. "What do you think you're doing?"

Both paparazzi jumped, too focused on Dominic Blackwood and his children to notice anyone else.

"Get out or I call the police." Sebastian's tone left no room for argument.

They complied immediately.

The driver was just hired help, but he'd worked with paparazzi long enough to consider them friends. "Easy there," he said, stepping between Sebastian and the woman. "No need for threats."

Dealing with caught photographers was always messy. Wealthy targets often destroyed equipment on the spot. The temperamental ones sometimes threw punches.

"Which publication?" Sebastian demanded.

"New Magazine," the woman said. "Doubt you've heard of it. And I have permission to photograph Mr. Blackwood today."

Sebastian frowned. "Permission from whom?"

The reporter dialed a number. "Maxwell? It's me. Your cousin's assistant is causing problems... Yes... Okay, I'll hand you over..." She passed the phone to Sebastian.

Maxwell's voice was sleep-rough. "This is Maxwell Lockwood, Dominic's cousin. Let her work. I'll call Dominic myself, so don't worry about it."

"Goodbye." Maxwell hung up and tossed his phone onto the hotel nightstand.

The clatter woke the woman beside him.

Sophia groaned awake, blinking sore eyes. The unfamiliar man walking toward the bathroom made last night come rushing back.

Nathan had called her drunk last night. "Sophia, I can't drive. Can't find my DD. Come get me?"

She hadn't wanted to go until she heard a woman's voice in the background.

After all her effort to secure Nathan as her fiancé, she couldn't risk losing him now. Next month, her mother would receive the Luojiazhen demolition money. Then she and Nathan would wed.

But at the club, she'd been mistaken for someone else before finding Nathan. Dragged into a VIP room, surrounded by wealth and power, Nathan suddenly seemed... small.

Among those men stood last night's companion.

Despite carrying Nathan's child, despite extorting a house from his mother as a wedding gift, despite their impending marriage, she'd yielded to temptation.

She'd always dreamed of being a wealthy wife.

Years abroad ended in failed relationships. Returning home to steal Evelyn's boyfriend had been her last resort. At least Nathan could afford a house and car.

Marrying him beat marrying some penniless loser.

Sophia rose naked, spotting men's trousers on the floor. As she hung up the suit jacket, a business card fell from the pocket.

Maxwell Lockwood. Company. Phone number.

She pocketed it.

The shower stopped. She slid back into bed, feigning sleep but leaving one breast exposed.

"Still pretending?" Maxwell saw right through her.

Before she could react, he flipped her over and gripped her hips.

She winced.

"Trying to seduce me?" His voice was flat as he entered her without preamble.

"No... It hurts..." She wanted this, just... gentler.

Maxwell wasn't gentle. Each thrust felt punishing.

She soon writhed in pain, fingers twisting the sheets.

When pleasure finally came, he withdrew abruptly. "Disappointing." He turned away.

Sophia reached for him, then froze at the bloodstains beneath her.

Her stomach cramped violently.
###Chapter 123

"Ahh! Someone help me! Please!"

Sophia screamed when she saw the blood pooling beneath her.

Maxwell adjusted his freshly pressed suit, the one his assistant had delivered that morning. He lit a cigarette, exhaling slowly before dialing a number. A sly grin curled his lips as he spoke. "You should understand my cousin's position. When I was locked up, her brother looked out for me. Now that I'm out, I owe him. And well... turns out her sister is a real piece of work."

Sophia stood frozen in the crimson puddle, watching as Maxwell ignored her completely—ignored the blood, the mess, everything. He simply finished his call, opened the door, and walked out without a backward glance.

Panicked, she grabbed her phone. Dead.

She fumbled to turn it on, fingers shaking as she dialed emergency services.

Just then, the door swung open again.

A woman stepped in—the same secretary from the club entrance last night, the one who had mistakenly let her in and led her straight to Maxwell. Behind her were two men.

The secretary's gaze flicked to the bloodstained sheets, cold and detached. "Get her dressed. Put her in the car."

The men moved toward Sophia.

"What—what are you doing?" She scrambled back.

The secretary smirked. "Cooperate if you want to live. Or stay here and bleed out. No one will hear you scream."

Trembling, Sophia clutched her aching stomach, her face ghostly pale as they dragged her into the waiting car.

Hospital.

The anesthesia dragged her under.

When she woke, groggy and disoriented, the doctor delivered the news with clinical detachment. The baby was gone.

"Should I notify your fiancé?" the secretary asked, twisting the knife deeper.

Sophia lay limp on the bed, her abdomen throbbing.

But the real agony came with the doctor’s next words—words that shattered her completely.

She would never carry a child again.

Nathan and Patricia arrived soon after.

Nathan was eerily calm compared to his mother, who fluttered around like a panicked hen.

If he had been willing to hand Sophia over to his so-called friends, then he clearly didn’t care what happened to her.

And why would he? He had no feelings for her. Their relationship was a farce, built on mutual deceit.

Patricia stormed into the room and struck Sophia across the face.

Slap!

Sophia jolted awake, pain flaring.

"You—you forget your meds again, you psycho?" she spat, glaring at Patricia through bleary eyes.

Patricia hit her again, then swung her handbag like a weapon, raining blows down on her.

"Disgusting! You whored around and killed my grandchild!" Patricia sobbed between strikes, her grief morphing into rage.

Regret burned through her. She never should’ve paid for that house.

T Corporation.

Evelyn’s phone buzzed—her mother. She slipped away to the empty pantry.

"Stop crying," Evelyn hissed. "It’s over. Learn from it and move on."

"My grandbaby—"

"Your grandbaby?" Evelyn scoffed. "Let’s be real. With Nathan’s track record, who knows whose it really was?"

Patricia stood at the bus stop, clutching her handbag, the truth of her daughter’s words sinking in.

She couldn’t be sure.

Two days. That’s all she’d wait before forcing that little gold-digger to pay back every cent.

The bus rolled to a stop at a red light near a bustling mall.

A sale was happening—middle-aged women chattered excitedly about discounts.

Patricia peered out the window.

And froze.

There, handing out flyers under the scorching sun, was Evelyn.

"Wait—let me off!" She shoved past the protesting driver and hurried toward the mall.

She watched from behind an ad board, snapping a photo and sending it to Olivia.

What’s going on?

Olivia replied instantly. Her dad’s still sick. She’s drowning in debt. What else is she supposed to do?

"But her sugar daddy—"

Olivia cut her off. What kind of sugar daddy makes his girl pass out flyers in this heat? You think a thousand-dollar serum fixes sun damage?

Patricia stared at Evelyn, guilt twisting in her gut.

She’d been so wrong.

She forwarded the photo to Nathan.

Listen to me. Get her back. I’m sending you her location.

T Corporation Building.

Dominic finished his last meeting, his presence commanding as always. He had to leave soon—his uncle was hosting a welcome feast for Maxwell.

At the Lockwood estate, little Isabella sprinted toward her granduncle, giggling as he scooped her up.

Meanwhile, in the backyard, a relative’s child splashed in the pool.

Maxwell ordered his assistant to supervise.

The man obeyed, stripping down and diving in.

His phone buzzed on the ground.

Maxwell glanced at the screen.

Evelyn Sinclair. Here’s her location. My bad you didn’t get to have fun with her last night. Want to pay her a visit?

Attached was a photo of Evelyn, flyers in hand.

Maxwell saved the image, deleted the message, and pocketed the phone.

Keys in hand, he headed for the door—just as Dominic walked in with Alexander.

For the first time, Maxwell really looked at the boy.

He’d been in prison when Alexander was born.

Now, studying him, something clicked.

The kid looked… familiar.

Like the girl in the photo.
###Chapter 124

Alexander, nestled in Granduncle Frederick's arms, peeked at Maxwell who had been staring intensely at him.

The little boy blinked in confusion, feeling slightly intimidated by the unfamiliar gaze. He quickly buried his face against Granduncle's shoulder, seeking comfort.

The prolonged attention made Alexander visibly uncomfortable.

"Come here, give your uncle a hug!" Maxwell extended his arms toward the child.

Alexander didn't recognize this man and disliked the strange look in his eyes. He stubbornly kept his face hidden, refusing the invitation.

Frederick chuckled and explained, "Alexander, this is your uncle Maxwell."

"But I've never met him before," the child thought, peeking again at the intimidating man with sharp features.

"He's family, my own son. Don't be scared - if he dares upset you, I'll personally deal with him," Frederick assured before transferring the reluctant boy into Maxwell's arms.

Maxwell held the squirming child securely.

Alexander shot a pleading look toward his father Dominic, desperate for rescue from this uncomfortable situation.

Carrying Alexander, Maxwell approached where Dominic sat with Isabella on his lap. "Perhaps it's time I settled down and started a family too," Maxwell mused aloud.

Alexander studied his so-called uncle's face before asking bluntly, "You're not married?"

Maxwell chuckled. "No, just like your dad here. Seems no one wants us old bachelors." His smile didn't reach his eyes as he carefully examined every feature of the child's face - from the shape of his eyebrows to the curve of his chin.

After completing his inspection, Maxwell glanced meaningfully at Evelyn.

Dominic's gaze darkened as he watched his distant relatives. Casually, he asked, "Which distant cousin is connected to that female paparazzo?"

Still studying Alexander's face, Maxwell answered absently, "She's just the sister of a prison friend who helped me. Tried giving them money after my release, but she refused. Wants to make it big in the paparazzi world instead - aims to be the country's top female paparazzo."

Alexander listened intently, puzzled why this strange uncle kept staring at him even while speaking.

"Since money didn't interest her, she chose fame. Admirable dedication, though not my type," Maxwell continued, pinching Alexander's cheeks. "Then I thought - you've never had any scandals, and your assistant blocks all attempts to photograph your private life."

He gave Alexander's face another squeeze. "This kid's adorable," Maxwell remarked before releasing him and leaning back. "Exposing the mighty T Corporation CEO's private life would skyrocket her career overnight. Guaranteed fame in the industry."

Dominic raised an eyebrow. "If she's not your type, what kind of woman is?"

Earlier, Dominic had received a call from Frederick. The old man wanted to express his sorrow over the difficult years during Maxwell's imprisonment, how it aged him prematurely.

Finally seeing his son free, Frederick only wished for Maxwell to reform and settle down. At over thirty, it was time to abandon reckless ways. Marriage, he believed, would set his son on the right path.

Direct persuasion proved ineffective - too much pressure might drive Maxwell away completely. As a last resort, Frederick enlisted Dominic's help.

Dominic, himself unmarried, felt hypocritical giving marital advice. But when Maxwell broached the subject himself, Dominic considered his uncle's hardships over the past five years.

Maxwell, still studying Alexander's face, seemed to be thinking of a particular woman. He raised an eyebrow at Dominic. "Planning to introduce someone based on my preferences?"

"Care to share them?" Dominic sipped his tea elegantly.

"No specific type. Why don't you suggest someone? Preferably good with children," Maxwell said casually. "I like kids. Heard twins require specific genes - since our family has none, I'd need a woman with that trait."

Alexander perked up, proud that he and Isabella were twins - proof of their mother's excellent genes.

Dominic's fingers traced the teacup rim. His expression remained neutral, but his thoughts drifted to over five years ago.

When he learned Evelyn carried twins, he'd been mid-signature on an important document. The news from Margaret made him abandon the signature halfway.

He knew pregnancy's challenges, especially for an eighteen-year-old first-time mother carrying twins. His interest deepened. Behind the scenes, he fulfilled every spousal duty - though she remained unaware.

He never intended to force her. Yet circumstances dictated their path. Had she not become pregnant by him five years ago, she'd be suffering under another man, bearing his children to pay her father's medical bills.

His actions stemmed from both selfish desire and genuine concern. While providing treatment funds and a liver donor, he satisfied long-buried yearnings.

That Evelyn bore him twins filled him with quiet pride whenever he remembered.

"Forget it. You're clearly distracted," Maxwell noted, correctly guessing Dominic's thoughts had wandered to the twins' mother.

Alexander huffed in relief as the annoying uncle finally left.

Maxwell headed to the garage, entered his Porsche Cayenne, and sped away without explanation.

Frederick immediately called. "What nonsense is this? Everyone came to celebrate your release! How dare you leave?"

"Be back soon," Maxwell replied curtly before hanging up.

Thirty minutes later, he arrived at the mall from the photograph. Parking haphazardly, he approached Evelyn distributing flyers.

"Hello, if you have time, please take a look. Thank you," Evelyn repeated mechanically to passersby. One recipient remained stationary after accepting her flyer.

She looked up in surprise.

"Oh, it's you. If I recall correctly, you're Dominic's... ex-girlfriend?" Maxwell feigned coincidence, offering a charming smile.
###Chapter 125

Evelyn glanced up at Maxwell and instantly recognized him.

When Grandfather suddenly collapsed at Blackwood Manor last week, he had stayed to recuperate. During that time, this man and Yvette had been holed up in Dominic's study with him.

Given Evelyn's unfavorable impression of Yvette, she'd immediately pegged Maxwell as trouble too.

Just then, a pedestrian walked by. Evelyn ignored Maxwell and handed the flyer to the stranger instead. "Excuse me, if you have a moment, please take a look. Thank you."

Maxwell studied her intently.

Evelyn wore a simple cotton tee knotted at her slender waist, paired with mid-length denim shorts. The casual outfit made her look like a college student still finishing her degree.

"Shouldn't you be at work today?" Maxwell asked, forcibly dragging his gaze away from her tantalizing waistline.

Evelyn kept distributing flyers as she answered bluntly, "No."

The truth was she did have work - unfinished designs waiting at home. But since T Corporation didn't require clocking in today, she'd sneaked out for this side gig.

Flyer distribution paid little, but a few days' earnings would cover Grandfather's monthly heart medication. Her salary couldn't even begin to cover Father's lung cancer treatments.

She reserved nights for T Corporation's design work, leaving days free for part-time jobs like this.

Maxwell stood motionless yet commanding. "For a moment I thought you'd quit after breaking things off with Dominic."

Evelyn handed another leaflet to a passerby, unfazed. "He doesn't strike me as the vindictive ex type."

Maxwell's lips curved slightly.

She continued her work.

He left without another word.

Minutes later, the vanished Maxwell reappeared holding a water bottle.

Evelyn arched a brow at this uncharacteristic gesture from the usually aloof man.

"Your lips look parched. Drink." He offered it.

Evelyn shook her head politely. "Thank you, but I'm fine."

Stumped, Maxwell stood awkwardly holding the water, his handsome features unreadable.

"How does this pay? Hourly or per flyer distributed?" He eyed the thick stack in her hands curiously.

A middle-aged woman wearing a sandwich board nearby chimed in knowingly, "Per flyer. Payment comes after the whole stack's handed out."

Maxwell nodded at her.

The woman returned to her post.

Observing closely, Maxwell noticed Evelyn's fatal flaw - she handed each flyer with earnest sincerity. But on this crowded street saturated with promoters, most passersby rejected hers out of sheer annoyance.

At this rate, she'd be here until tomorrow.

"Let me help." Maxwell snatched over half her stack.

Evelyn blinked at the ten flyers remaining in her hand.

This man's audacity stunned her - appearing unannounced, asking odd questions, buying water, now hijacking her job? What was his game?

"Thanks, but I've got this." She reached for the flyers.

Maxwell's height advantage proved insurmountable. Even on tiptoes, Evelyn couldn't reach the stack he'd lifted tauntingly overhead.

"The faster these go, the sooner you eat. What's the problem?" His indulgent gaze swept over her.

Two passing girls whispered loudly, "Now that's a boyfriend! Would your trust fund baby ever help you like that?"

Evelyn heard every word.

Meanwhile, Maxwell had already advanced a dozen meters, distributing flyers with startling efficiency. Where Evelyn met rejection, girls actually approached him shyly for flyers.

Within minutes, his stack vanished.

Maxwell shrugged helplessly at Evelyn.

Her workday had abruptly ended. All that remained was collecting her meager pay from the supervisor - a stern fifty-something woman whose sole job seemed to be glaring at workers.

When handing over the day's wages, the woman scoffed, "With a rich boyfriend driving a Porsche, why steal jobs from the needy? Don't come back tomorrow!"

Evelyn opened her mouth to explain, but the woman had already turned away.

Just like that, she'd been fired.

Swallowing her anger, Evelyn crossed to a noodle shop. She hadn't drunk water all morning.

Hunger gnawed at her, yet the mere smell of food turned her stomach. After six hours under the scorching sun, weakness threatened to overwhelm her. She forced down some noodles - she'd need energy to stay angry.

Maxwell followed.

"Stop following me. I don't know you." Her thin face looked pinched with irritation.

"That changes if we share a meal. This place looks good. Can't we call a truce?" His attempt at charm rang hollow.

"You eat here. I'll go elsewhere." Not daring to provoke him further, she opted for retreat.

Evelyn turned to leave.

"Wait."

Maxwell caught her arm. "I just want to be friends, not devour you."

"Sorry, I'm not interested in friendship." Especially not with wealthy men connected to Dominic.

His grip didn't loosen.

She tried pulling free, but his hold was iron. The struggle proved too much - her vision blurred, the setting sun swimming before her eyes until darkness swallowed everything.

Maxwell's brow furrowed as he caught the collapsing Evelyn. Scooping her up, he carried her to his parked Porsche Cayenne.

His phone rang.

Irritated, he snapped, "Make it quick!"

"Uncle, Granduncle wants to know when you're returning?" Alexander's reluctant voice came through - clearly pressured into calling by the old man who despised speaking to his wayward son.

Glancing at the unconscious woman in his backseat, Maxwell studied her delicate features. "On my way. And I'm bringing you a new aunt."
###Chapter 126

"An aunt? What aunt?" Alexander asked, standing beside Granduncle with a puzzled frown.

Granduncle Frederick and Grandaunt Eleanor's eyes instantly sparkled with hope.

Had their stubborn nephew finally found love? Was he bringing home a woman to introduce to the family?

Tears welled up in the elderly couple's eyes as they exchanged glances. Years of worry seemed to melt away in that moment. Their boy was finally settling down.

Perhaps those years in prison had changed him for the better after all.

Granduncle had initially forced Alexander to make that call. He'd even whispered instructions to turn on speakerphone. The obedient boy complied.

When the speaker activated, Maxwell's voice came through clearly. "Don't worry, she's a stunning woman. You'll adore her."

Hearing their son speak so warmly about this mystery woman confirmed their suspicions - he must be truly smitten.

"Alright, Uncle Maxwell. We'll be waiting for you and the beautiful aunt." Alexander ended the call politely.

Grandaunt Eleanor practically vibrated with excitement. "Sh-should I p-prepare something?"

"Absolutely."

Granduncle Frederick composed himself, stroking his chin thoughtfully. "First impressions matter. Find something special to gift her. If nothing suitable, we'll give an exclusive shopping card."

"I'll search immediately." Grandaunt turned toward the staircase.

"Wait!" Granduncle stopped her abruptly.

She paused mid-step.

"Remember - no interrogations about her background, appearance, or personality. Understood?" He feared his wife's enthusiasm might scare the girl away.

"As long as she's breathing, I won't complain." Grandaunt chuckled before hurrying upstairs.

Frederick had never concerned himself with Maxwell's romantic choices. His son had always been particular about women. Before prison, Maxwell and Julian were notorious for their escapades with starlets.

Frederick had tried lecturing his son about responsibility, to no avail. Sending him to prison had been the last resort.

Now, he could only hope those dark days were behind them.

Within minutes, news of Maxwell bringing home a girlfriend spread through Lockwood Manor like wildfire.

The Lockwood elders had watched Maxwell grow up. They'd always pitied the troubled boy, so this development brought genuine joy.

Grandaunt Eleanor rummaged through her jewelry collection. Most pieces were antique heirlooms - not exactly a young woman's taste.

Six years prior, Maxwell had gifted her an exquisite diamond necklace from abroad. Though she adored it, the modern design didn't suit her age.

She'd joked at the time, "I'll save this for your future wife." Now, she retrieved it with trembling hands.

A female relative squeezed Eleanor's shoulder. "Your hardships are ending. Maxwell bringing her home means this is serious."

Tears threatened again. "He's never introduced anyone before. Only ever saw his flings in gossip columns."

"This one will be your daughter-in-law." The relative patted her hand. "Wedding bells soon! Perhaps she's already carrying your grandchild!"

Eleanor's face lit up at the possibility.

The household waited twenty agonizing minutes.

Each passing second stretched the elderly couple's nerves. They longed to meet this potential daughter-in-law.

When the Porsche Cayenne finally roared up the driveway, it moved with unusual urgency. Instead of parking properly, it screeched to a halt at the main entrance.

Two servants nearly got hit, scrambling aside in alarm.

Frederick and Eleanor exchanged worried glances.

'An accident?'

'Please, no emergency!'

Maxwell leapt out, swiftly opening the rear door. His suit jacket obscured the woman's face as he carried her inside. Onlookers only glimpsed long raven hair and pale, slender legs.

"Call the doctor to my room. Now!" Maxwell barked at a stunned maid.

The servant nodded frantically, pulling out her phone under his intense glare.

Frederick approached. "What's happened?"

"I-I don't know. He just ordered the doctor to his room," the shaken maid stammered.

Eleanor placed a steadying hand on Frederick's arm. "Let me investigate."

Frederick nodded but stayed put. Their strained father-son relationship made him hesitant to intrude.

Speculation buzzed among the gathered family.

A teenage girl giggled. "Maxwell has excellent taste! Even covered up, you can tell she's elegant. Not some tacky social climber."

Another agreed. "When serious, he knows wife material. May he always cherish her this way."

Alexander slammed his juice glass down sharply.

"Have you lost your mind?" Dominic's calm demeanor cracked.

"Oh, so you do hear things around you?" Alexander retorted like a miniature adult. "I'm bitter! Uncle Maxwell found someone, but you? Can't even win Aunt Evelyn. Hope I inherited less from you, or I'll end up a lonely thirty-year-old too."

Dominic pretended not to hear. His mind wandered to memories of Evelyn's rosy lips and delicate features. For a moment, his stern expression softened before he forcibly schooled it back to neutrality.
###Chapter 127

Alexander had no interest in speaking with Daddy anymore. He grabbed a towel to dry Isabella's tiny fingers as she splashed joyfully by the poolside.

"You shouldn't get your hair wet. Little ladies must stay proper." Alexander sighed. Between his strict father and overprotective older brother, life wasn't easy for a five-year-old.

Kneeling by the water's edge, he carefully patted his sister's damp curls while secretly wishing for a mother's gentle touch. Since infancy, he'd dreamed of Mommy returning for them.

He used to imagine that even if she didn't reconcile with Daddy, weekend visits would be enough. But now? His hopes had shifted completely.

These days, Alexander only wished Daddy would marry Aunt Evelyn instead. Then Isabella could enjoy the fairy-tale childhood every little girl deserved.

"Is that... Yvette?" someone gasped, pointing toward the manor gates.

Alexander turned to see a cherry-red convertible rolling up the driveway.

A garishly dressed middle-aged woman preened to her companions. "My Yvette just returned from Paris last Thursday. Straight into a prestigious job at Blackwood Enterprises! Started working younger than I ever did."

Mrs. Prescott strutted forward as her daughter emerged from the sports car.

Yvette scanned the gathering with practiced grace as she approached. When her mother reached her, she hissed through clenched teeth, "What were you thinking wearing that gaudy chain? You look like a lottery winner! All those fashion magazines I sent you—wasted!"

"I did study them!" Mrs. Prescott protested.

"Enough. You're embarrassing me," Yvette snapped before transforming her expression. She floated toward her aunt with outstretched arms. "Darling Aunt Eleanor! You look positively radiant—I barely recognized you!"

"You always know just what to say," the older woman tittered, wrinkles creasing around her smile. "Your mother mentioned you've started working?"

Yvette's gaze flickered toward where Dominic sat observing his twins. "At Blackwood Enterprises," she murmured with calculated shyness.

Though Dominic remained quietly focused on his children, his presence electrified the room. Society girls watched him hungrily, too intimidated to approach.

Eleanor followed Yvette's gaze and connected the dots. "My clever niece! Landing at Blackwood right after returning? I'll expect wedding invitations soon."

Yvette's demure nod confirmed the unspoken assumption. Among the elite, her infatuation with Mr. Blackwood was an open secret.

By dinner, whispers had snowballed into outrageous claims. "Dominic Blackwood will move heaven and earth to marry Yvette Prescott."

A rival socialite scoffed into her champagne. "Yvette? My daughter is far prettier!"

"Between a 27-year-old tycoon and a 19-year-old debutante, who do you think he'd choose?" her companion smirked.

The older woman sniffed. "Youth alone won't secure the Blackwood name. We'll see about that."

Meanwhile, Yvette was desperately trying to charm Alexander and Isabella.

Sebastian had arrived ten minutes prior, anticipating his employer might need to indulge in social drinking. As Dominic's assistant, safeguarding the twins was his priority.

Those seeking Dominic's favor usually had business agendas. But those targeting his children? Their motives ran deeper.

Like Miss Prescott currently fawning over the twins.

Sebastian observed silently.

Alexander focused intently on his handheld console while Isabella watched, mesmerized. Yvette hovered awkwardly, unfamiliar with the game.

After several failed attempts to engage them, she pulled out her phone. "Try this popular game!" she offered brightly.

Alexander barely glanced at the screen.

Sebastian intervened immediately. "Ms. Prescott, Master Alexander's games are specially curated. Mr. Blackwood doesn't permit mature content."

"What nonsense! Games are games!" Yvette's mask slipped as she snapped at Sebastian. "You're not my father—stop lecturing me!"

Sebastian realized why Yvette remained an outsider among elites. Such vulgar outbursts explained everything.

"Come along, children," he said, dismissing her.

Alexander adjusted his baseball cap, one headphone dangling as he gripped his game. Taking Isabella's hand, he hurried away from the witch-like woman.

The spectacle hadn't gone unnoticed.

Yvette had hoped to demonstrate her imminent engagement by bonding with the twins. She knew better than to approach Dominic directly—their lack of chemistry would be obvious.

But now? Her carefully constructed image lay in ruins.

During the Lockwood family dinner...

Three hours had passed since Maxwell carried his girlfriend upstairs. The doctor had departed long ago—clearly the situation wasn't dire, or Maxwell and his parents wouldn't be entertaining guests.

Yet Dominic's aunt and uncle kept shooting him peculiar glances. Their knowing looks prickled his curiosity. Just who was Maxwell's mysterious girlfriend?
###Chapter 128

"I need to excuse myself for a moment." Dominic finished his glass of merlot, placed the crystal stemware down with deliberate grace.

He offered a polite nod to the assembled guests before turning on his heel with practiced elegance.

The dinner party thrived in the climate-controlled grand hall, a stark contrast to the chilly evening outside where frost already kissed the windows.

Sebastian noticed his employer ascending the staircase and immediately shepherded the twins toward the same direction.

"Uncle Sebastian, why are we going up?" Alexander asked without looking up from his handheld console, tiny fingers still mashing buttons. His wide innocent eyes blinked curiously.

"To find your father." The assistant kept his explanation deliberately vague.

Once upstairs, Sebastian had the children sit on plush chairs near the landing while they slipped on their shoes. "Wait here. Your father stepped away briefly."

Alexander nodded obediently.

He'd wait however long it took for Daddy to return.

"But Uncle Sebastian, I don't want to leave yet." Isabella pouted, mistakenly assuming their departure was imminent.

"You can discuss staying longer with your father when he returns." Sebastian offered a temporary compromise.

Soon the twins became engrossed in their game again.

Sebastian's gaze swept the empty upper corridor of the Lockwood estate.

He couldn't be certain which room his employer had entered.

Perhaps it truly was just a bathroom visit.

Yet Sebastian trusted his instincts implicitly. Earlier, Dominic had been stealing repeated glances toward the upper floors before excusing himself. Something about his behavior felt... intentional.

Just then, Yvette Prescott appeared at the stairwell.

"Ms. Prescott, that's far enough." Sebastian extended an arm to block her path.

"Good dogs know when to get out of their master's way." Yvette sneered with undisguised contempt.

Downstairs, she'd been making overtures toward Dominic's children until Sebastian deliberately removed them from her reach. Humiliated in front of the other guests, she'd vented to her overseas friends via text.

One particularly vicious friend suggested treating the assistant like the hired help he was - a mere servant to be ignored.

Sebastian remained unmoved. "Then consider me a very bad dog, Ms. Prescott."

Yvette glared at this human obstacle. Through gritted teeth she hissed, "Do you have any idea who you're speaking to? My father's company is finalizing a major deal with Blackwood Enterprises! When I marry into this family, you'll regret this insolence!"

"I'm simply performing my duties, Ms. Prescott." His tone remained impeccably professional even as his stance stayed firm.

Yvette's eyes darted toward the upstairs bathroom, her foot tapping impatiently.

This was her moment.

Her overseas friend - a self-proclaimed seduction expert - had laid out the perfect plan: Feign drunkenness, "accidentally" stumble into the bathroom, and let nature take its course. If Dominic resisted, she could claim intoxication. If he succumbed... well, that solved everything.

Her menstrual cycle provided the perfect alibi. A few well-timed winces, some strategically placed blood, and she could claim virginity loss. Dominic would have no choice but to take responsibility.

If only this infuriating assistant would move!

Sebastian observed the scheming glint in her eyes. "Angering Mr. Blackwood would render any... alliances meaningless, Ms. Prescott."

Upstairs in the guest suite...

Evelyn's consciousness returned in slow, painful increments. Her eyelids felt leaden, her eyeballs burning as if scorched by fever. Her parched lips stuck together.

Fragmented memories of the roadside incident surfaced gradually.

As full awareness returned, she tensed - where was she? Hospital? Home?

With great effort, she fluttered her dark lashes open, immediately sensing an intense gaze upon her. That familiar scorching presence made her breath hitch even before her vision cleared.

Their eyes met in mutual shock.

Evelyn's surprise came from finding Dominic at her bedside. Why was he here?

Then realization struck - Maxwell and Dominic were cousins. If she'd fainted, Maxwell might have brought her here. That made logical sense.

But Dominic's expression...

Only ten percent surprise. The remaining ninety percent was something far more complex, his gaze so intensely inscrutable it made her skin prickle.

When Evelyn broke eye contact first, she noticed her ears burning, the pale skin turning rosy.

Dominic continued his blatant appraisal, his stare bordering on predatory.

As Evelyn attempted to sit up, the screen of Dominic's phone caught her attention. Before she woke, he'd been searching something online.

The search results glared back at her: "Had unprotected sex multiple times with girlfriend who didn't take morning-after pill. Pregnancy chances?"

Evelyn's fingers curled into fists. Of all the things...

Then she noticed the follow-up question below, and her pulse skyrocketed.

The physician's response appeared beneath: "High probability of conception. Emergency contraception strongly recommended."

Dominic's gaze traveled from her clenched hands to her flushed cheeks. His mocking drawl cut through the silence. "My, my Evelyn. Quite the busy little social climber, aren't you? From my bed to Maxwell's in record time. I clearly underestimated your... talents."

Evelyn scrambled upright despite the dizzying headrush, teeth gritted against the vertigo.

She wouldn't explain. Wouldn't tell him Maxwell had accosted her on the street, that she'd tried to refuse, that the fainting spell wasn't some ploy.

Because this was what she wanted, wasn't it?

For Dominic to think her wanton. Unworthy.

So be it.
###Chapter 129

The air in the bedroom was thick with tension when Evelyn finally located her phone.

Her screen lit up with a flood of notifications the moment she powered it on.

Harrison had texted: "Eve, what time are you finishing work? Dinner tonight?"

Her fingers flew across the screen to reply.

After sending the message, Evelyn refused to glance at Dominic standing by the bed. She took a steadying breath, turned the doorknob, and stormed out with feigned anger.

The bedroom door clicked shut behind her. Evelyn found herself in what appeared to be Maxwell's sprawling estate.

The clinking of glasses and murmur of conversation drifted up from downstairs - some sort of cocktail party in full swing.

Scanning the hallway, she realized the only exit was through the main entrance below. She tiptoed toward the staircase, holding her breath.

"Ms. Sinclair?" Sebastian's voice startled her as he ascended the stairs, catching her peering down from the second-floor landing.

Their eyes met. "Hello, Mr. Whitmore," Evelyn managed awkwardly.

Understanding dawned on Sebastian's face - now he knew why his boss kept glancing upstairs and had abruptly left the party. But why was Evelyn in the Lockwood manor?

Sebastian was perceptive. Circulating through the party, he'd overheard the gossip.

Rumors swirled that Maxwell had finally brought home a real girlfriend, though the poor girl had fainted from heatstroke.

The doctor had administered an IV - Sebastian noted the telltale mark on Evelyn's left hand.

It wasn't his place to question his boss's personal affairs. "Most guests downstairs are influential figures, Ms. Sinclair... Leaving now might be... complicated."

Evelyn wished for invisibility, but reality offered no such escape.

"Aunt Eve?" Alexander bounded up the stairs, game controller in one hand, adjusting his headphones with the other, dragging his sister along.

The twins charged toward her.

Predictably, they latched onto her legs.

No game could compete with Aunt Eve's presence.

"I'll be downstairs," Sebastian murmured before discreetly exiting.

"Aunt Eve, where's Daddy?" Isabella peered up, tiny fists clutching Evelyn's skirt.

Stuck on the staircase with two clinging children, Evelyn saw only one solution - return them to their father.

When she opened the door, Dominic stood silhouetted against the French windows - one hand in his pocket, the other massaging his furrowed brow.

His gaze snapped to her when she entered with the children.

"I have plans. Stay with your father," she told the twins, attempting to pry them loose.

But the clever children recognized abandonment when they saw it.

"I want Aunt Eve!" Isabella pouted, wrapping her arms around Evelyn's neck, her eyelashes fluttering against Evelyn's cheek like butterfly wings.

Dominic made no move to help, allowing his daughter to cling tighter.

Evelyn's phone chimed again.

Harrison's reply: "I'll pick you up."

"No need. Send the address. I'll take an Uber," she typed quickly.

His response came instantly: "I insist. That's what boyfriends do."

"Rush hour traffic is terrible," she countered.

Alexander read over her shoulder. "Aunt Eve, why does he say he's your boyfriend?" His voice trembled. "I thought Daddy was your boyfriend."

Evelyn kept her eyes down, avoiding Dominic's gaze. "Harrison is my actual boyfriend."

"What about Daddy?" Isabella asked.

"Your father is my employer." Evelyn forced a smile, patting Isabella's pale cheek.

Alexander turned tragic eyes to his father. "Daddy, is that true?"

Evelyn began disentangling small hands from her body, steeling herself against their heartbroken expressions.

Dominic watched coldly. When his children's eyes welled with tears, he thundered, "Stop!"

Evelyn froze mid-step.

The twins' sobs caught in their throats as their father strode toward them.

Evelyn turned, meeting Dominic's fathomless gaze.

"Why should I stop?"

Before she could react, Dominic closed the distance, pinning her against the door, his mouth crashing down on hers.

The kiss burned.

He claimed her lips with possessive intensity.

The world stilled. Her pulse roared in her ears, drowning out everything but the sinful sound of their mingled breath.

She shoved against his chest.

Dominic only deepened the kiss, his breathing growing ragged against her skin.

When he finally released her, he turned to the children. "Aunt Eve isn't anyone else's girlfriend. She's mine." His thumb traced her swollen lips.

The twins' tears transformed into joyous leaps and twirls.

"No, I'm not—" Evelyn's protest died as Dominic reclaimed her mouth.

This kiss was restrained - a father's consideration for young eyes - but no less devastating.

Isabella clapped. "Daddy kissed Aunt Eve!"

Beyond the children's sightline, Dominic cradled Evelyn's face, kissing her until her lips bloomed crimson. This woman had borne his children. She belonged to him.
###Chapter 130

Dominic refused to use the children as leverage against Evelyn.

A true relationship should begin with marriage in mind. Once vows were exchanged, that bond should last forever.

Yet he found himself trapped in an impossible situation.

Their connection had started all wrong. He never got the chance to properly court her, to confess his feelings. Instead, they'd jumped straight to parenthood with twins!

Whenever she resisted him, he could simply reveal the children's true parentage and force her hand.

But what kind of love would that be? If she only married him for the sake of the children, would she ever truly choose him? Would she sacrifice her freedom just to stay with Alexander and Isabella?

That kind of marriage would be tainted from the start.

Her resentment would drown out any affection he might earn.

It wouldn't be love keeping her by his side - only obligation to their children.

He couldn't force her like that.

As he'd told himself before, he wanted her to choose him willingly.

In the bedroom, the two adults stood locked in tension while the twins clung to their father and "Aunt Evelyn's" legs, creating a deceptively harmonious family scene.

Footsteps approached from upstairs.

"I searched the entire house for Dominic," Eleanor Lockwood's voice carried down the hall. "Victor just told me he saw him come up here."

Frederick Lockwood's tone turned serious. "So what if he came upstairs? What trouble could he possibly cause?"

Sebastian Whitmore trailed behind them, sweating bullets.

The past two minutes had thrown him completely. Listening to his boss's aunt and uncle, he couldn't make heads or tails of the situation.

Rumors were spreading through the Blackwood estate that Maxwell had brought home a disheveled, pale young woman - quite beautiful apparently - who'd fainted and needed an IV.

That had to be Evelyn.

But Sebastian knew his boss had feelings for Evelyn.

Dominic had even brought her to meet his family, who'd approved of her.

Everything had been going so well. Why was Evelyn suddenly Maxwell's girl now? Some misunderstanding? Or was this Evelyn's doing?

Baffled, Sebastian followed the older Lockwoods upstairs, worried about potential conflict.

Downstairs.

Maxwell entered from the courtyard and asked his uncle, "Where are my parents?"

"Upstairs. Both of them," came the reply.

Maxwell headed up.

On the second floor, he heard his mother's voice.

"Dominic, let me be clear. Background means nothing. Evelyn is a wonderful girl who's won my heart. I won't have you pressuring her."

"Or I'll have my future daughter-in-law resign from your company."

Maxwell stepped into the bedroom.

All eyes turned to him.

"Take the children downstairs," Dominic ordered Sebastian.

Sebastian nodded and quickly ushered the confused twins away.

In the tense bedroom, Dominic fixed Maxwell with a dark stare.

Evelyn grabbed her bag and hurried out without looking up. Passing Maxwell's mother, she muttered, "It's a misunderstanding. There's nothing between me and your son."

Eleanor frowned and shoved her son toward the door. "What are you waiting for? Go after her!"

Maxwell turned and chased Evelyn down the stairs.

Eleanor nudged Frederick, signaling him to speak.

Frederick addressed his nephew still standing in the bedroom. "Dominic, your generation is more educated than ours. More open-minded. You shouldn't stand in Evelyn and Maxwell's way. Let them love freely - it's progress beyond our old-fashioned thinking."

"Exactly," Eleanor agreed. "Dominic, Evelyn didn't choose her ordinary background or career path any more than she chose her family. Meanwhile Maxwell has his own... complicated history. I can't promise he'll make a good husband, but Evelyn is certainly worthy of him."

"I asked Maxwell," Frederick lied smoothly. "He's the one pursuing Evelyn." He feared Dominic might think Evelyn had seduced his cousin.

Dominic turned to face them. "I never said Evelyn wasn't worthy of Maxwell."

"Then..." Eleanor hesitated. "Are you saying Maxwell isn't worthy of Evelyn?"

Dominic's expression darkened.

Knowing her son well, Beatrice Lockwood didn't try to defend him. She raised her hand solemnly. "I swear on my life that if Evelyn marries into our family, she'll never regret it!"

At a loss, Dominic simply waved them off and hurried downstairs.

In the courtyard.

Yvette Prescott froze when she saw Evelyn.

Watching Maxwell chase after her, she thought, 'What the hell? Why is Maxwell so frantic?'

'Has he fallen for Evelyn too?'

'Is this just another fling for him? Or is he actually serious this time?'

As Dominic prepared to leave, he nearly collided with Maxwell returning alone - clearly having failed to stop Evelyn.

Maxwell smirked at Dominic in the driver's seat. "Didn't mean to cause confusion, but everyone assumes she's my girlfriend now. Too late to explain. Besides, you two are over. She fainted on the street today - I was just being a Good Samaritan."

Dominic's glare could have frozen hell over. He hit the gas and sped through the estate gates.

Maxwell watched the car disappear, then felt a tap on his shoulder. Turning, he found Yvette holding a wine glass.

"Maxwell, are you really interested in Evelyn?" Yvette pursed her lips.

Maxwell studied the various women in the distance, then the 19-year-old before him. None stood out - he couldn't even guess their ages. He gave Yvette a tired nod. "More than I've been interested in any woman before."

Yvette hated hearing others praise Evelyn.

"It's always what you can't have," she sneered. "I know how men think. Maxwell, do you actually want to marry her?"

Maxwell raised an eyebrow. "What fantasy are you spinning? Trying to clear Dominic's ex so you can marry into the Blackwood family?"

"Just answer me. If you want to marry Evelyn, I can make it happen." Yvette was desperate to remove the Evelyn obstacle.

Evelyn could marry anyone - preferably Maxwell. Once tied down, Dominic would finally be Yvette's.
###Chapter 131

Evelyn's mind was racing.

In the elite circles of A City, who was the most unapproachable bachelor? Not the playboys nor the fickle aristocrats. Without question, it was the notoriously aloof Dominic Blackwood.

His indifference toward women was legendary.

Evelyn had to admit she'd had countless opportunities to get close to Dominic over the years. Yet they remained practically strangers.

But she took comfort knowing no other woman had fared better.

Except for that anomaly - Evelyn Sinclair.

Evelyn couldn't comprehend why someone as ordinary as Evelyn had captured Dominic's attention! Whatever tricks Evelyn had used, she needed to eliminate this problem immediately.

Her plan was to tarnish Evelyn's reputation completely.

The ideal scenario would be seeing Evelyn trapped in a miserable marriage with some worthless loser. But that wasn't practical.

Maxwell Lockwood's family was wealthy and influential. Once Evelyn married into the Lockwoods, she'd be forced into obedient domesticity - the perfect wife, subservient to her in-laws and husband.

No more opportunities to seduce Dominic.

Moreover, Maxwell and Dominic were cousins.

If Evelyn dared to flirt with her husband's cousin, she'd be inviting public disgrace.

Maxwell's status would become Evelyn's shackles, preventing any further advances toward Dominic.

Even the slightest hint of impropriety would brand Evelyn a moral degenerate.

The more Evelyn considered it, the more perfect the plan seemed.

City Center - Fourth Ring Road.

Dominic's black sedan emerged from the villa district onto the highway.

Ahead, a Lockwood family car maintained steady speed, tailing Evelyn.

Dominic accelerated sharply, executing a perfect parallel park that blocked the road.

The Lockwood driver immediately stopped. "Mr. Blackwood? Is there a—"

"I'll take her home. It's on my way." Dominic's piercing gaze left no room for argument.

The driver explained that Miss Sinclair had refused Maxwell's offer, insisting on taking a taxi. Not wanting to upset her, Maxwell had discreetly arranged surveillance for her safety.

Dominic found this protective approach absurd.

According to the driver, Maxwell had insisted, "Follow her taxi until she's safely home."

As if every cab driver posed a threat.

"Understood. Thank you, Mr. Blackwood." The driver acquiesced, reasoning that Dominic was family - close enough to Maxwell to ensure Evelyn's safety.

After dismissing the Lockwood vehicle, Dominic approached the slender figure walking ahead.

Hearing a horn, Evelyn instinctively moved aside without looking back, lost in thought.

The persistent honking continued.

Having already reached the sidewalk's edge, Evelyn finally turned.

Dominic's black Range Rover roared past, startling her so badly she nearly fell against the guardrail.

The car screeched to a halt.

Dominic emerged, his tailored black suit and casually unbuttoned shirt revealing his chiseled collarbone. When he approached, Evelyn immediately averted her gaze.

"Not a single taxi passes here. Planning to walk back to the city?" His low voice carried unmistakable anger.

He reached for her hand, but she swiftly evaded, clasping them behind her back.

Her refusal was clear - she wouldn't enter his car, just as she'd rejected Maxwell earlier.

To make Dominic give up, she was willing to marry quickly. But not to Maxwell Lockwood - their worlds were too different. Marrying into wealth promised only a lifetime of struggle.

Most importantly, Maxwell was Dominic's cousin.

Harrison Wells kept texting, clearly interested. His straightforward manner aligned with her modest background.

She couldn't disappoint Harrison.

Wind rustled through roadside trees as Evelyn met Dominic's gaze briefly before walking past him.

If she grew too tired, she'd find another way home.

Dominic's expression darkened as he watched her retreat. In two strides, he seized her waist.

"Let go!" Evelyn struggled against his iron grip.

Ignoring her protests, Dominic dragged her to the car and retrieved an elegant tie box from the backseat.

He removed a pristine gray tie and bound her wrists behind her back.

"Dominic, you're insane!" Evelyn's eyes reddened with panic - this was the second time he'd restrained her.

Dominic discarded the unused tie box into a roadside bin. The year-old gift from some aunt meant nothing.

Next, he silenced her with a monogrammed pocket square.

Helpless, Evelyn could only shake her head and kick futilely.

"Shaking your head? Admitting you were wrong? That seducing Maxwell was a mistake? That cheating on me with my own cousin was unacceptable?" Dominic interpreted her movements.

The pocket square muffled Evelyn's protests.

Her phone vibrated.

Dominic retrieved it from her bag.

Harrison's message appeared: 'Found this romantic dessert café girls love. Hope you'll enjoy it too.'

Dominic's entire demeanor turned glacial, his handsome face stormy.

He gripped Evelyn's chin, forcing her terrified gaze to meet his.

"Does your boyfriend know you might be carrying my child?"
###Chapter 132

Evelyn desperately wanted to explain to the madman that their previous encounter couldn't possibly result in pregnancy.

The silk tie gagging her mouth made speech impossible.

Dominic's frantic internet search and the doctor's response flashed through her mind. That medical professional had warned about potential conception even from precursory intimacy.

The slim chance terrified her.

Exhaustion from recent days clouded her memory. Had she taken the morning-after pill? She'd purchased it, stashed it in her purse...

But the actual consumption remained a blur.

Never in her wildest dreams had Evelyn imagined fearing an accidental pregnancy. Carrying Dominic's child would be her ultimate nightmare. A living sin.

Hot tears spilled before she could stop them.

"Why are you crying?" Dominic's voice softened as he noticed the moisture tracing her cheeks. His dark expression lightened slightly.

Evelyn stared wordlessly until his lips brushed her eyelids.

She flinched at the unexpected warmth.

His mouth trailed downward, catching each salty drop. "What did you expect?" His voice roughened. "You walked into my life then vanished. Did you think I'd simply let you go?"

Silent sobs shook her frame.

"Attraction in that small town was manageable," he confessed, throat working. "But this...this consuming need to possess you? I can't fight it."

She ducked her head, hiding behind a curtain of hair.

Dominic exhaled sharply. "Forget it."

Releasing her, he turned away to light a cigarette.

The nicotine failed to soothe. If anything, it worsened his mood.

The drive home passed in heavy silence.

At her apartment complex, Evelyn exited without looking back. Her eyes burned from unshed tears.

"Grandfather?" She called upon entering.

No response.

She checked each room. Empty.

Her call went straight to voicemail.

The doorbell interrupted her panic.

Expecting her grandfather, she flung open the door to find a deliveryman holding an elegant pastry box.

Her stomach dropped.

This came from the very restaurant whose pastry chef had supposedly left. The one Harrison had taken her to tonight.

Who sent this?

More urgently - where was Grandfather?

Abandoning the mystery dessert, Evelyn rushed downstairs to search for her missing family.
###Chapter 133

Evelyn searched for Grandpa for almost an hour.

Still, he was nowhere to be found.

Panic clawed at her chest.

Returning to the empty apartment, she realized with a sinking heart that he had vanished without a trace.

His cane was missing too. Had he taken it when he left?

But Evelyn knew Grandpa only used his cane for long distances.

Her steps heavy, she entered his bedroom.

Just before her date with Harrison, Grandpa had been perfectly fine.

Yet at dinner, he'd said solemnly, "Living too long isn't always a blessing. I'm becoming nothing but a burden to you..."

Did he run away?

Evelyn dismissed the thought immediately. Grandpa would never do that.

Opening his closet, she scrutinized the contents. She couldn't recall how many outfits he'd brought to the city. Some might be missing, but the disarray suggested hasty packing.

Did he really leave on his own?

Her hands trembled as she dialed her estranged aunt.

Even if Grandpa had left, he wouldn't go there.

"The number you have dialed is not in service..."

The robotic voice confirmed her aunt had changed numbers long ago.

Next, she called her father.

Robert sounded normal, exchanging pleasantries before reminding her to rest well for work tomorrow. His usual script.

Clearly, he knew nothing about Grandpa's disappearance.

All evidence pointed to one conclusion: Grandpa had left to stop being a burden.

As anxiety tightened its grip, Evelyn spotted a food box by the doorway.

Inside lay a card with a romantic design.

No sender's name.

Her pulse quickened.

Standing slowly, she stared at the desserts for a full minute before realization struck.

Dominic had intercepted her after she left Maxwell's estate.

He must have seen Harrison's text about the trendy dessert shop.

How had Dominic reacted?

Cold. Stern. Unreadable.

But when his petty side emerged, it rivaled teenage jealousy.

She didn't need to guess who sent these.

Grabbing her purse, Evelyn rushed out while calling Dominic.

No answer.

After multiple attempts, her phone displayed: Call cannot be completed.

In the elevator, a thought crystallized. Dominic took Grandpa. He's probably sipping tea with Reginald Blackwood right now.

Last time, Dominic had "rescued" Grandpa from imaginary thugs before whisking him to the Blackwood manor.

Hailing a cab, Evelyn watched the city lights blur past.

A melancholy truth settled in her heart: Dominic would make the perfect partner—attentive, devoted.

But fate had other plans for them.

Still no answer from Dominic.

The Blackwood manor was her next stop.

"Wait here," she instructed the driver upon arrival.

The butler answered, surprised. "Ms. Sinclair?"

"Is my grandfather here?"

His reply shattered her fragile hope. "He isn't."

"Then is Dominic home?"

"Master Dominic, Young Master Alexander, and Young Mistress Isabella are all out."

Beatrice appeared, her expression frosty. "Why are you here?"

"None of your business." Evelyn turned away, unwilling to endure another confrontation.

Beatrice watched the departing cab, then summoned the butler. "What did she want?"

"She asked about her grandfather and Master Dominic."

A missing grandfather? Beatrice's lips curled. How interesting.

Downtown, Evelyn reasoned the twins must be with their father at the penthouse.

Still no contact with Dominic.

Security barred her entry until she pleaded, "My grandfather's missing. It's urgent."

They allowed her to use the intercom.

"Evelyn here. Let me up." She spoke first, voice strained.

A pause. Then Dominic's low reply: "Come up."

The elevator ascended.
###Chapter 134

The elevator doors slid open with a soft ding.

Behind Evelyn, the building concierge addressed the man standing at the penthouse entrance. "My apologies, Mr. Blackwood. The young lady claimed to know you."

Dominic gave a curt nod.

The concierge retreated immediately.

Evelyn's fingers twisted together as she studied the imposing figure before her. "Have you seen my grandfather?" Her voice came out smaller than intended.

She was the one who'd demanded they go their separate ways. Yet here she stood at his doorstep in the dead of night, seeking his help.

The irony burned her cheeks. But desperation left no room for pride.

Dominic finished tightening the belt of his silk robe. "What's happened to your grandfather?" His sharp gaze lifted to meet hers. "Has he gone missing?"

She searched his face - the faint crease between his brows, the genuine confusion in his dark eyes. He truly didn't know.

Her knees nearly buckled. Without a word, she turned and stabbed the elevator button with shaking fingers.

Dominic caught the way her breath hitched. In three long strides, he crossed the marble foyer and hauled her back inside.

The world tilted as he deposited her onto the leather sofa, caging her in with his arms. "Start talking," he commanded, voice rough with concern. "Now."

Tears welled in Evelyn's eyes.

A soft shuffling sound interrupted them. From the hallway emerged two sleepy children - Isabella clutching a stuffed polar bear, Alexander with his slippers on the wrong feet.

"Bed. Now." Dominic didn't even turn around.

Alexander pouted but obediently guided his sister back to their rooms, casting worried glances at "Aunt Evie" over his shoulder.

Evelyn tried to smile for them. Failed.

Her phone chimed - Olivia's voice message: "No sign of your grandfather. What's going on? Where are you? I'm coming over!"

Dominic snatched the device. "False alarm," he replied tersely before pocketing her phone. His expression darkened. "Get changed. We're leaving in five."

She had no choice but to wait.

The man emerged minutes later in his customary tailored suit, looking boardroom-ready despite the late hour. As they exited the building, whispers followed them.

"Lovers' quarrel?" the night receptionist murmured.

The senior concierge snorted. "More like a kept woman pushing her luck. That's Dominic Blackwood - do you really think he'd settle for some plain Jane?"

"Plain?" The receptionist arched a brow. "That woman's got cheekbones you could cut glass with. I'd kill for her bone structure."

Dominic's Range Rover purred to life at the curb. He rolled down the window. "Subway's closing soon. Unless you plan to blow your savings on cab fare all night?" His gaze dropped meaningfully to her worn handbag. "Your father's medical bills won't pay themselves."

The barb struck true. Every penny she earned went toward her father's treatments and grandfather's care. She was drowning.

Evelyn slid into the passenger seat in silence.

"Have you contacted all his friends?" Dominic navigated the empty streets with practiced ease.

"If I can't reach them, neither could Grandpa." She pressed her forehead against the cool window.

Dominic called Reginald Blackwood next. The old man knew nothing. Hanging up, Dominic gripped the steering wheel tighter. "We'll file a police report."

For normal citizens, missing persons cases required a 48-hour wait. But Dominic had Sebastian Whitmore handle it with one phone call.

After combing through her apartment and the surrounding neighborhood with no success, Evelyn's teeth began chattering. Whether from cold or fear, she couldn't tell.

The police found nothing on the neighborhood's patchy surveillance cameras.

"Could he have returned to Willowbrook?" Dominic asked suddenly.

Evelyn turned, eyes shimmering with unshed tears. In the pale streetlight, she looked heartbreakingly fragile.

Dominic captured her icy hands in his. "We'll drive there now." His thumb brushed her knuckles. "You need to rest."

She didn't protest when he draped his suit jacket over her shoulders.

"Sleep," he ordered, lighting a cigarette and cracking the window. The nicotine would keep him alert for the long drive.

Evelyn closed her eyes. But sleep wouldn't come. Instead, she wrestled with the dangerous warmth spreading through her chest at his nearness.

"Still awake?" Dominic's voice cut through the darkness.

She met his profile in the dashboard glow. "I was thinking... maybe I should consider you as an older brother figure."

The cigarette ash scattered as Dominic barked a laugh. "An older brother?" His smirk was predatory. "Tell me, little sister - do brothers usually fantasize about bending you over every flat surface?"
###Chapter 135

Evelyn's face burned with warmth.

The car interior grew thick with unspoken tension.

Curled up in the passenger seat, she found Dominic's presence strangely comforting.

After much deliberation, Evelyn decided this sense of security came from their familial bond.

Being near her brother grounded her. That logic seemed sound - siblings often felt this way.

Her eyelids grew heavy.

Relief washed over her as sleep claimed her. Psychologically, viewing him as family made their alone time less morally ambiguous.

Dominic pulled up to a toll booth. Glancing sideways, he noted the woman curled against the window. The past days had drained her - poor appetite, sleepless nights, even fainting spells. Finally, rest came.

The Range Rover maintained steady speed. Dominic checked frequently, reassured by her deep, even breathing.

Small town roads proved bumpy. Evelyn awoke stiff and disoriented, blinking at unfamiliar surroundings.

Fingers clutching his suit jacket, she murmured, "I didn't mean to fall asleep."

Dominic navigated a turn toward her house. "Why apologize for sleeping?"

Evelyn hesitated.

He'd driven through the night to help find her grandfather. The journey must have been tedious without conversation.

A City.

Maxwell returned home well past midnight.

Frederick Lockwood jolted awake at the sound of tires on gravel.

He nudged his sleeping wife. "Eleanor. Wake up."

Eleanor Lockwood blinked groggily. "Is that Maxwell? What time is it?"

"Exactly." Frederick fumed. Their adult son remained beyond parental control.

Eleanor checked the clock. Far too late.

Before jail, Maxwell kept these hours regularly. His reckless lifestyle had finally caught up with him.

"I'll handle this." Eleanor slipped on her robe, preventing what would surely become a physical altercation.

Frederick punched his pillow in frustration.

Eleanor intercepted Maxwell at the foot of the stairs.

"Trouble sleeping? Shouldn't you prioritize beauty rest at your age?" Maxwell quipped, attempting to pass.

"Stop right there." Eleanor's voice cracked.

Maxwell turned.

Mother and son locked eyes. Eleanor's contained unshed tears. "Must you kill us with worry? No wonder Dominic scorns you. He wouldn't even bless your courtship with his secretary! Tell me - beyond your looks, what redeeming qualities do you possess?"

Maxwell had always been handsome. Eleanor once took pride in this.

Now she saw how his beauty attracted women, turning him into an irresponsible playboy.

Given the choice, she'd have preferred an ugly son. Dominic - Beatrice's disciplined, accomplished son - remained her secret envy.

Beatrice Lockwood, Frederick's sister, had never been Eleanor's friend. She'd always viewed Beatrice as a social climber.

This dislike extended to Dominic.

"Let Dominic live his life. Why should I care for his respect?" Maxwell, sober, frowned.

"You dare ask?" Eleanor nearly shrieked. Gesturing to where society's elite had gathered earlier, she hissed, "Everyone here moves in the same circles. This afternoon, Beatrice skipped our event for some trivial fashion show. Do you know how we're mocked?"

She'd never confess these insecurities to Frederick - he'd call her petty.

Maxwell noted his mother's crow's feet, her bitterness. After a pause, he said, "Get some rest. I don't need anyone's blessing. I'll marry Evelyn for you."

As Maxwell ascended, Eleanor exhaled in relief.

The small town.

Dominic examined the gate's iron lock. No signs of disturbance.

High walls enclosed the dark, ladderless yard.

No lights shone within.

"Your grandfather hasn't returned," Dominic told Evelyn, turning.

Evelyn stood motionless. Her silence twisted his heart. He pulled her close, pressing lips to her forehead.

"Let's wait for police updates," he soothed.

Soft sniffles broke the night's stillness. Dominic tilted her chin up - tears streaked her cheeks.

"Don't cry." Unskilled at comfort, he crushed her against his chest, stroking her hair. He wished he could absorb her completely.

Evelyn feared the worst for her grandfather.
###Chapter 136

Evelyn sobbed in Dominic's embrace until the night grew silent around them. Her body ached from exhaustion, a dull throb pulsing through her abdomen and lower back.

It was a familiar discomfort. One that visited her monthly like clockwork.

Except this time, it arrived weeks ahead of schedule.

Stress always wreaked havoc on her system. Irregular cycles were just one of many consequences when a woman pushed herself too hard.

She pulled away abruptly, wiping at her damp cheeks. The sudden absence left Dominic's chest hollow.

"Should we return to A City or keep searching?" His deep voice cut through the darkness. "Does your grandfather have relatives here?"

Evelyn shook her head. If Robert had truly run away, he wouldn't return to familiar places. The realization sent fresh panic coursing through her veins.

Dominic stepped closer, smoothing her disheveled hair. "No news is good news. If something happened, authorities would know by now."

She searched his face, finding unexpected comfort in his certainty.

"Trust me." His thumb brushed away a stray tear.

Evelyn nodded, repeating the words like a mantra. If she said it enough times, maybe it would become true.

"Let's head back." His hand settled on her shoulder, guiding her toward the Range Rover.

She hesitated. "Wait here. I need to buy something from the market. Alone."

The moon cast eerie shadows as she hurried toward the dimly lit store. She couldn't risk staining his pristine leather seats. Not when things were about to get worse.

Dominic stood sentinel by the car, his silhouette cutting a striking figure against the night. When Evelyn disappeared from view, he crushed his cigarette and followed.

The outdated market showed no signs of life. Evelyn fumbled with her phone's flashlight, searching for a doorbell.

"Looking for this?" Dominic's knuckles rapped sharply against the glass.

A groggy voice called from within. "Who's there at this hour?"

"We need supplies," Evelyn answered quickly before Dominic's intimidating tone could scare the owner.

The door cracked open, revealing a suspicious middle-aged woman. "You're not from around here."

Evelyn slipped inside while Dominic waited. She grabbed what she needed and paid quickly.

"May I use your restroom?" Evelyn asked.

"Absolutely not!" The woman shoved her out unceremoniously.

Dominic caught her as she stumbled, his sharp eyes noting the package she tried to conceal. He plucked it from her grasp with ease.

"Your cycle started?" No preamble. No embarrassment.

Evelyn's cheeks burned. "How do you always—"

"Know everything?" He returned the pads with a stern look. "You need rest. Pushing yourself will only make it worse."

He guided her toward the only guesthouse in town, his grip firm yet gentle. After securing a room, he stood guard outside the bathroom.

"We'll stay tonight. Sebastian has men watching both properties. We'll know immediately if your grandfather surfaces." A white lie to ease her worry. "Besides, I'm too tired to drive safely."

Evelyn had no energy to argue.

While she showered, Dominic arranged for toiletries and warm food. When the owner asked about dietary restrictions, his response was matter-of-fact.

"She's menstruating. Prepare accordingly."

The woman blinked, then nodded approvingly. Her husband received an earful about Dominic's thoughtfulness compared to his own shortcomings.

The hot porridge soothed Evelyn's cramps. Though sharing a bed felt intimate, exhaustion overrode her hesitation. She trusted him implicitly—especially with Robert missing.

By 3 AM, she'd curled instinctively toward Dominic's warmth. Her body, chilled from hormonal changes, sought his heat unconsciously.

Dominic remained awake, his large hand slipping beneath her shirt to cradle her aching abdomen. The gentle pressure eased her discomfort as she slept.

He wouldn't sleep tonight. Not while she needed watching over. Not while danger might still lurk in the shadows of this forgotten town. His vigil would last until dawn, ensuring her safety with every measured breath.
###Chapter 137

Evelyn slept until seven in the morning.

The small town mornings were just as noisy as the city. The guest house stood mere meters from the main street, allowing every early vendor's shout to drift straight into her room.

She blinked awake slowly, taking in the sparse guest room. Only the narrow bed and open windows furnished the space, the air conditioner left off. Despite the discomfort of her period, she'd slept more peacefully than in weeks.

Her phone showed 7:15 AM when she checked.

Where was Dominic?

The landlady passed her in the hallway. "Up early, dear? Your husband's outside smoking."

Evelyn nodded automatically. Of course she meant Dominic.

After freshening up, she planned to grab breakfast before returning to the city. With Grandpa not in town, there was no reason to stay longer.

Yesterday's panic had given way to logic. Grandpa wouldn't have run away. If he'd wanted to ease her burdens, he wouldn't have vanished without a word - that would only worry her more.

No, he must be lost. Or worse... She couldn't finish the thought.

Dominic's words echoed: "No news is good news."

He returned from his smoke as she checked out. They walked to a nearby breakfast stall together.

He ordered without consulting her: "One unsweetened soy milk, one with two sugars."

The stall owner chirped an acknowledgement.

Dominic sat across from her, drawing stares. In this poor town, his tailored suit and polished shoes marked him as foreign as a magazine celebrity. The morning crowd - retirees, early risers, schoolchildren - couldn't look away.

Evelyn kept her head down, sipping through her straw. This stall hadn't changed since childhood, when Grandpa brought her here. Same owners, same taste.

Same two sugars in her soy milk.

Had Dominic guessed? Or was it coincidence?

"Can you finish those?" He nodded at her untouched donuts.

She shook her head. He wordlessly took and ate them.

The soy milk tasted nostalgic. What if she'd grown up with Dominic? As a Sinclair, a Blackwood, even an orphan - how different would their lives be?

With a brother like him, she'd have no shortage of eager sisters-in-law. And any suitor of hers would face his exacting standards...

"What's on your mind?" Dominic watched her over his breakfast.

"I was imagining if you were my brother-" she began earnestly.

His frown cut her off. "Are you suggesting incest?"

She clamped her mouth shut.

Why did she keep casting him as family? The melancholy in his eyes wondered if she had some unspoken kink.

A young couple sat nearby with a squirming infant. The husband fetched pudding while his wife struggled with the wriggling baby.

"Quit staring," the wife chided, then followed his gaze herself. The child nearly slipped free before she recovered. "Honestly, are you part eel?"

The husband kept sneaking glances. They looked familiar...

A middle-aged neighbor settled it. "Isn't that the Sinclairs' Evelyn? Back again?"

The couple exchanged looks. The husband had thought the man resembled his old classmate Dominic Blackwood, but the commanding presence intimidated him from saying hello.

If that was Evelyn Sinclair, then...

"Remember me? You gave me a basketball in high school," the husband ventured.

Both looked over.

Twenty minutes later...

Evelyn stood in the high school yard, memories flooding back. She'd spent countless afternoons peering over this wall, watching Dominic dominate the basketball court.

"I wasn't sure at first," the young father admitted. "But when Auntie said it was the Sinclairs' Evelyn, I knew. Are you two married now?" His smile mixed excitement and awkwardness at reuniting with his now-wealthy classmate.

His wife leaned in. "Yes, how did you two end up together?" She clearly imagined some romantic waiting-for-her-to-grow-up story.

Dominic nodded. "Married with two kids."
###Chapter 138

"Two? That's impressive! You've already had two children..." The woman holding the toddler stared at Evelyn in disbelief. "You don't look like you've given birth at all! I never would've guessed—a mother of two!"

Evelyn forced a tight smile.

Before leaving the small town, Dominic pulled his former teammate aside for a private conversation.

His expression was grave as he spoke in low tones. The other man, still holding his child, listened intently before nodding twice in understanding.

The drive back to A City passed in silence.

Exhausted, Evelyn dozed off again in the passenger seat.

Once they reached the smoother city roads, Dominic slowed the car, careful not to jostle her awake. She slept soundly until they arrived at his penthouse.

A sharp cramp tore through her abdomen, jerking her awake.

Evelyn gasped, pressing both hands against her stomach. Her face drained of color as beads of sweat formed on her forehead.

Dominic, who'd just finished a cigarette outside, threw open the car door at the sight of her distress.

"What's wrong?" His hands framed her pale face. "Are you in pain?"

Evelyn could only nod weakly, eyes squeezed shut against the throbbing ache.

"Let's get you upstairs." Without hesitation, he moved to lift her.

She resisted.

"I can walk."

"Don't argue," he warned, voice hardening. "Or I'll recall Sebastian and every police officer searching for your grandfather."

The threat worked instantly.

Nothing mattered more than finding Grandpa.

As an ordinary citizen, she had no power—no special access or privileges. Only men like Dominic Blackwood could bend the system to their will.

That was the harsh reality.

The penthouse had every luxury, but Dominic stood helpless in the kitchen, staring at pristine appliances that had never been used.

His phone rang.

Sebastian's name flashed on the screen.

"Report," Dominic answered.

Two updates. First, Mr. Sinclair still hadn't been located. The police ruled out accidents or foul play since no matching reports had surfaced. As instructed, the missing person alert would air on morning television. Now they waited for tip calls about the reward.

Second, the sleeping pill incident had been traced back to Evelyn's ex, Nathan Kensington.

Dominic's expression darkened at the name. "Have him arrested."

"I'll coordinate with the police immediately," Sebastian confirmed, recognizing the dangerous edge in his boss's tone.

The neighborhood where Evelyn rented was in chaos. Middle-aged women who'd witnessed Grandpa's last encounter with local thugs kept asking if there'd been any leads.

As Sebastian prepared to hang up, Dominic suddenly asked, "Did your ex-wife ever suffer from menstrual cramps?"

A pause. "We divorced because she claimed I wasn't attentive enough, so... no, I wouldn't know."

Dominic was about to end the call when Sebastian spotted Abigail's car approaching. "There's a woman here with firsthand experience. Should I ask her?"

"Only if the methods actually worked for her." Dominic refused to trust random internet advice that might worsen Evelyn's pain.

Sebastian approached Abigail's parked car, phone in hand. The moment she stepped out, he cornered her. "Have you ever had severe period cramps?"

Abigail blinked. "What?"

Sebastian showed his phone. "Mr. Blackwood needs to know."

She nodded.

"What remedies actually helped you?"

Abigail quickly listed what had worked for her personally. As Sebastian relayed the information, Abigail looked ready to cry. "Every woman's different! What if it doesn't work for Evelyn? Will Mr. Blackwood fire me?"

Sebastian gave her a look but said nothing.

Back in the penthouse, Dominic returned from the supermarket with supplies.

He mixed brown sugar with vodka, stirred until dissolved, then lit the mixture aflame. Once the flames died, he carried the steaming bowl to the bedroom.

"Drink this. Now."

Evelyn, now ghostly pale, eyed the concoction with distrust. "Just give me painkillers."

"Pills are a temporary fix. You'll just need more next time." Without waiting, Dominic took a sip himself, then captured her lips, forcing the warm liquid into her mouth.

It tasted vile, but he made sure she swallowed every drop.

When the bowl was empty, he propped a pillow beneath her hips.

Both fully clothed, he leaned against the headboard, cradling her against his chest. Periodically, he rubbed his hands together to generate heat before pressing his warmed palms to her icy abdomen—just like the previous night.

Evelyn watched through tear-blurred vision as he worked to drive the chill from her body.

A sob tore from her throat.

She didn't know if hiding the truth was merciful or cruel.

When she'd learned they were related by blood, the revelation had shattered her. The person who'd told her had been vicious.

Allison had inflicted deep wounds—mental scars that still burned.

She couldn't bear for Dominic to suffer the same torment.

So she alone carried this sin.

"We've crossed a line," Evelyn whispered hoarsely. "We've gone too far..."

Dominic continued massaging her abdomen. "What line?"

The weight became unbearable. She pushed away, staggering to her feet. She couldn't rely on him anymore.

He caught her arm. "Where are you going?"

Dominic sensed an invisible barrier between them. Until he destroyed it, she'd never find peace.

Anger simmered beneath his skin, but he refused to unleash it on her.

Even when she'd blamed Nathan for keeping them apart, he'd never believed it.

Nathan was trash, but Evelyn wasn't foolish enough to let that stop her.

"I need to check on the search for Grandpa." She avoided his gaze. "Cramps won't kill me. I'll manage."

The door clicked shut behind her.

Dominic's eyes burned crimson.
###Chapter 139

Evelyn stepped onto the subway platform.

The entire walk from Dominic's penthouse to the station, she resisted looking back. Yet she could feel his presence trailing behind her like a shadow. The man couldn't help worrying about her.

The train rattled through the underground tunnels, stopping at multiple stations before reaching her stop.

She exited onto the platform.

Home.

Evelyn spotted the police cars first, then Sebastian standing near them. As she approached, he stubbed out his cigarette and turned toward her.

For a moment, he seemed surprised she wasn't with Mr. Blackwood.

"Thank you for everything, Mr. Whitmore." Her gratitude was genuine, her voice thick with emotion.

Sebastian wasn't accustomed to verbal thanks. His job involved shadowy tasks that rarely warranted appreciation. "Don't thank me. Thank Mr. Blackwood." He always gave credit where it was due.

"Evie!" Abigail emerged from a car, clutching her laptop.

Evelyn lifted her gaze.

Sebastian nodded toward Abigail. "Go upstairs with Evelyn."

Understanding flashed in Abigail's eyes. With Evelyn's grandfather missing, she knew her friend needed support.

She'd been helping Sebastian until learning Evelyn was with their boss. "Come on, let's go up. Leave this to Mr. Whitmore."

The apartment door creaked open, revealing an unnaturally silent space.

"Make yourself comfortable." Evelyn gestured to the sofa before disappearing into the kitchen to boil water.

Abigail's fingers flew across her keyboard. "Grandpa will be fine. Don't make yourself sick with worry."

Evelyn's gaze landed on the empty rocking chair where Grandpa used to sit.

Her body ached from the emotional exhaustion of the day.

When Abigail finished working and went to check on Evelyn, she found her curled into a fetal position on the bed - a wounded creature seeking shelter.

Abigail stayed the night.

Morning brought relief from the cramps.

Evelyn woke first and moved quietly to the kitchen. The sound of clattering pans roused Abigail, who blinked at the unfamiliar surroundings before remembering where she was.

Eggs cracked against a bowl. Vegetables met a sharp blade.

The winter chill seeped through the windows. Evelyn's thoughts spiraled - was Grandpa warm enough? Was he safe?

Distracted, the knife slipped.

Blood welled from her finger before the pain registered.

Abigail dropped her toiletries when she saw crimson dripping onto the cutting board. "Jesus Christ!" She grabbed Evelyn's hand, inspecting the wound.

"I'll get gauze," Evelyn murmured numbly.

"How could you be so careless?" Abigail knelt, wrapping the injury with practiced hands. "I get that you're worried, but this isn't healthy. Grandpa's old. We all face losing our elders eventually."

Tears pricked Evelyn's eyes.

Abigail softened. "Let the police handle it. Come to work - distraction might help. Maybe Grandpa will be home when we return."

Evelyn nodded. She couldn't neglect work - not with her father's medical bills piling up.

T Corporation buzzed with morning activity.

The elevator carried them to the design floor.

"Why are there police here?" Abigail spotted two uniformed officers in reception.

A colleague opened their mouth to gossip, but the department head's door swung open. "Abigail. My office. Now."

No time for rumors.

Inside the glass-walled office, their boss looked harried. "Can your team take over Nathan's project?"

Abigail's pulse jumped. This was a major account. "Absolutely."

"Good. Management will arrange the handover."

Abigail bit back her questions - her boss's mood was clearly foul.

The police remained when she exited.

Nathan arrived moments later.

The officers moved swiftly, cuffing him the moment he set down his laptop. Gasps rippled through the office.

Evelyn looked up just as Nathan broke free.

His manacled hands swept the contents of her desk into her face.

"Cooperate!" The officers tackled him.

"Has he lost his mind?" a colleague whispered.

Abigail rushed over. "You okay?"

Their department head emerged, scowling at the scene. "Abigail, take your team upstairs. The CEO wants a meeting."

Abigail squeezed Evelyn's shoulder. "Come on." She hoped Mr. Blackwood would provide the comfort she couldn't.

Evelyn blinked back tears, gathering her laptop. She took a seat in the back corner of the conference room.

A hush fell over the room.

"Mr. Blackwood is here."
###Chapter 140

Evelyn's cheeks bore faint crimson marks that stood out starkly against her pale skin.

Abigail sat closest to Dominic in the conference room, clutching a signing pen so tightly her knuckles turned white. She avoided eye contact more than usual today.

The air conditioning blasted at full power, yet when Dominic's expression darkened, the temperature seemed to drop further. An invisible frost spread through the room, freezing everyone's expressions.

"What happened to your face?"

His calm question sliced through the tense silence.

No one dared respond.

With their department head absent, Abigail swallowed hard and explained, "A male colleague suddenly lashed out and struck Evelyn across the face with a stack of folders."

Evelyn lifted her head during this formal meeting. "It's nothing serious. Thank you for your concern, Mr. Blackwood."

Abigail's heart skipped a beat at Evelyn's distant tone.

She risked a glance at Dominic's face. The handsome features twisted with barely contained fury... No, this was beyond anger. Pure rage.

"Nathan?"

After an agonizing silence, Dominic spoke the name.

The room nodded collectively.

Dominic's eyes darkened further as he addressed everyone in a dangerously low voice, "Anyone who drugs female colleagues during company events will face the full consequences."

The female employees remained composed while innocent male colleagues trembled.

One man's actions - Nathan's - had tainted them all.

Dominic's icy gaze swept across the male employees. "Those who wish to spend time behind bars may continue such behavior in my company."

Abigail exhaled in relief.

Perhaps Mr. Blackwood would finally release Evelyn from this torment.

The meeting ended abruptly.

Previously, the CEO never held direct meetings with design department staff. Occasionally their department head might see him, usually bearing the brunt of Dominic's anger.

Since Evelyn joined, the entire design department had become the company's punching bag. They saw their formidable CEO almost daily now.

As employees filed out, another team walked with slumped shoulders.

Dominic needed an outlet for his fury.

Though only Nathan had committed the offense, the entire team suffered collateral damage. Collective punishment.

None dared question their boss's wrath. They bowed their heads, silently cursing Nathan. How dare that bastard drug a colleague? His actions caused this uproar, resulting in each receiving individual reprimands.

Most humiliating? These senior employees - old enough to be grandfathers - endured scolding like misbehaving children without uttering a word in defense.

Rumors said wealthy men had twisted psyches. A powerful, unmarried billionaire like Dominic Blackwood must harbor the most perverse mind.

Best not provoke him further.

As Evelyn prepared to leave, Sebastian stopped her at the conference room door. He'd been sent on a mission - failure wasn't an option.

Abigail noticed and immediately abandoned her protégé, secretly hoping Evelyn would soon find herself securely in Dominic's grasp - whether in his pocket or between his teeth.

What would he do to her on her second day...?

Evelyn nodded numbly and followed Sebastian upstairs.

After delivering her and setting out a first aid kit, Sebastian departed.

Dominic pulled the motionless Evelyn into his arms.

She startled upright. "I thought this was work-related."

"Are women always this inconsistent?" Dominic rose, retrieving antiseptic and cotton swabs. He moistened a swab, pulled her close, and gently dabbed at her cheek marks.

His breath cooled the stinging marks as he worked.

The burning sensation gradually faded under his ministrations.

Evelyn relaxed slightly, allowing the treatment.

Only their breathing filled the office. Dominic lowered his head. "Why so docile now? Imagining me as your brother again?"

Evelyn flushed crimson.

"Tell me, is this some fetish? Do you enjoy...transgressing moral boundaries?" Dominic's free hand settled on her waist. Before she could react, he pulled her close, closing his eyes as he captured her lips. His breathing grew ragged as he deepened the kiss. "I can play the brother role..."

Evelyn shook her head. 'Not like this...'

She never wanted this.

She meant an actual blood-related brother.

Not these twisted games he imagined.

"My face hurts. Please..." Evelyn couldn't continue. Words only worsened things. She struggled against his embrace and kiss, desperate to escape this cage.

Back in design, Abigail noticed Evelyn's return and suppressed a smile.

Dominic worked miracles. Evelyn had left in despair but returned with flushed cheeks and swollen lips.

Evelyn forced herself to focus until quitting time.

She might have been the first to bolt from the office, crossing to the subway before rush hour.

Her phone rang persistently before she noticed.

Answering an unknown number, she froze.

Panicked scanning revealed an approaching Porsche Cayenne. The caller hung up.

Maxwell rolled down the window. "Get in. I might help find your grandfather."

Evelyn's body went numb, mind blank.

Maxwell clearly knew Grandpa's whereabouts. Yet that "might"...

"If you're bored, find someone else to torment." Evelyn gripped her phone tightly, fighting for composure.

Maxwell paused, large hands on the steering wheel. He lifted two passports. "Yours and mine. If I said I got yours from your grandfather, would you believe me?"

Seeing the passports, Evelyn's grip trembled.

Maxwell displayed hers.

It was authentic.

"Though I have Civil Affairs Bureau connections, we should arrive before closing to avoid inconveniencing them." Maxwell exited swiftly, embracing her like a dutiful husband. His tone hovered between affection and threat: "Defy an ex-convict, lose the grandfather who raised you."

Evelyn gritted her teeth, struggling against his grip, regarding him like a monster.

Maxwell maintained his hold. "I need a wife, and time's short. Either we register our marriage by six, or collect your grandfather's corpse after. Your choice."
###Chapter 141

The steel in Maxwell's voice left no room for doubt—he wasn't joking.

Evelyn's entire body broke out in a cold sweat under his piercing gaze.

"You took my grandfather?" she choked out.

Maxwell studied her panicked, hate-filled eyes. "Obviously. Who else would sneak an old man away?"

Their eyes locked in a silent battle.

Tears spilled as Evelyn lashed out like a wild animal, desperate to escape. "You vile, disgusting criminal! Kidnapping is a felony!"

His large hands clamped around her fragile frame, stopping her flailing limbs. "What do you know about felonies, little girl? You're barely out of diapers."

When she finally stilled, he shoved his phone in her face.

A video played.

The angle suggested a hidden camera, but the subjects were clear—Maxwell and her grandfather, chatting like family.

"Grandpa, Evie didn’t want you knowing she collapsed from exhaustion. Play along when she wakes up, okay?" Maxwell grinned, hoisting the old man’s suitcase.

Her grandfather nodded gratefully before leaving with him.

The neighborhood CCTV had conveniently malfunctioned—no footage existed of the abduction.

Another video loaded.

Her grandfather gagged and tied to a pole. A thug slammed an iron rod beside his head—the deafening clang made the old man whimper.

Evelyn's hands flew to her mouth. "I'm calling the police—"

"Go ahead." Maxwell smirked, checking his watch. "It's 5:10 PM."

Before she could react, he hurled his phone onto the road. A truck crushed it instantly.

"No evidence, no crime," he said, releasing her. "Almost six o’clock. Choose: collect Grandpa’s corpse… or marry me."

He turned to leave.

Evelyn grabbed his sleeve. "What about the law?"

Maxwell chuckled. "Laws are made by men. And I haven’t technically killed anyone… yet." His smile turned feral. "But are you willing to bet Grandpa’s life on that?"

"You’re a monster."

"Worse exist." His gaze darkened. "5:20 PM. Decide." He seized her trembling hand.

Blackwood Enterprises

Dominic exited his office, dialing Evelyn as his Range Rover left the garage.

"The number you have dialed is unavailable—"

He tried Sebastian instead.

"Sir, Ms. Sinclair never returned to her apartment."

"Break down the door. Call me back."

He hung up, speeding toward Alexander and Isabella’s extracurricular class.

The Grand Marquis Hotel

Frederick Lockwood greeted last-minute guests, shooting his wife a look. "Did it have to be tonight?"

Eleanor Lockwood beamed. "Our son is finally marrying. I couldn’t wait!"

Nearby, Beatrice Lockwood embraced her sister-in-law. "I missed Maxwell’s prison-release party, but a wedding? Perfect timing!"

Eleanor’s smile turned smug. "Funny how he proposed right after you scolded him for being single at thirty."

Beatrice bit her tongue as Frederick pulled her aside. "Where’s Dominic?"

Before she could answer, tiny voices echoed through the hall.

"Great-Uncle!"

Alexander and Isabella sprinted in, stealing the spotlight.

Hotel Lobby

Maxwell strode inside, marriage certificates in one hand, Evelyn’s limp wrist in the other.

The elevator doors closed.

"Cheer up," he murmured, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. "Grandpa’s safe at the hospital. After dinner, I’ll take you to him."

The doors opened.

He dragged her toward the private hall, icy air blasting them as the doors swung wide.

Before Evelyn could process the sea of faces, Maxwell slammed the certificates onto the table and announced:

"Meet my wife—Evelyn Sinclair."
###Chapter 142

"Aunt Evelyn..."

Evelyn heard the voice and lifted her gaze.

It was Alexander.

The Blackwood family had even invited the Lockwoods...

The private dining room was lavishly decorated. Every seat at the round table was occupied. She recognized some faces, while others were strangers. The table groaned under the weight of exquisite dishes and rare vintage wines.

Isabella's rosy cheeks peeked out from behind a tower of desserts.

Her eyes inevitably drifted toward Dominic's suddenly stormy expression. Evelyn immediately felt suffocated, as if dark clouds were pressing down on her. She lowered her head and tried to pull her hand free from Maxwell's grip.

Instead of releasing her, Maxwell pulled out a chair while keeping his arm firmly around her waist. "Sit next to my mother," he ordered.

The two marriage certificates lay on the table, their crimson hue as glaring as fresh blood.

"From now on, we're family, Evelyn. Don't be afraid. No matter what happens, I'll always be here as your mother."

Eleanor Lockwood's words were clearly directed at her son—a warning not to mistreat Evelyn. They were also meant for Dominic, reminding him that Evelyn was no longer just his subordinate but now his cousin's wife.

He was expected to treat her with the respect due to family.

Around the table, the other guests murmured polite congratulations, but their voices trailed off awkwardly.

The atmosphere grew increasingly tense.

"I need to use the restroom."

Evelyn stood abruptly and left the private room.

She had never felt more humiliated in her life.

Yet Dominic's family being present was the least of her worries. Her grandfather's safety remained her top priority. Maxwell had shown her a video of her injured grandfather being rushed to the hospital.

She still didn't know which hospital he'd been taken to.

Searching every medical facility in the city would be impossible.

Marrying this devil might condemn her to a miserable existence, but she had no other choice...

Back in the private room.

Beatrice noticed Isabella's sticky fingers and sighed. "Isabella, look at your hands. Come, let's wash them."

The little girl's chubby fingers were coated in dessert crumbs.

They exited the private room and headed for the nearest restroom.

Inside the bathroom.

Evelyn tensed when Beatrice entered with Isabella.

"Wash your hands properly, darling." Beatrice attended to the child first. As she helped Isabella, she shot Evelyn a sharp glance. "Did you and Maxwell really get married?"

"Yes."

Evelyn saw the shock and fury flash across Beatrice's face.

Beatrice bit back whatever she wanted to say in front of the child.

It was true she'd demanded Evelyn stay away from her son, but she never imagined the girl would attach herself to his cousin!

She'd prayed daily for Evelyn to marry someone far away—preferably overseas. If marriage wasn't an option, then a fatal accident would have been equally satisfactory!

Instead, Evelyn left the Blackwoods only to join the Lockwoods.

Rather than disappearing, she'd moved closer.

Beatrice took her granddaughter back to the private room.

Evelyn followed shortly after. She couldn't hide forever. She needed to endure this dinner so she could see her grandfather sooner.

Upon returning, she nearly collided with Alexander, who was holding a backpack. He was telling his sister, "Isabella, we're leaving."

"Aunt Evelyn... Can you come and—"

Isabella didn't finish.

He'd been about to say, "Aunt Evelyn, can you come stay at Daddy's place tonight?"

But before he could complete the sentence, Dominic's large hand clamped over his mouth. "You've got crumbs everywhere. Such a messy eater." Dominic held his daughter with one arm, frowning as he wiped her face with his thumb.

Eleanor interjected quickly, "Dominic, if you need to leave, please don't let us keep you!" She was eager to see the cold man depart so Evelyn could relax.

Maxwell guided Evelyn back to her seat. "I'll see them out."

Soon, the three Blackwoods had left.

Evelyn exhaled in relief.

Outside the hotel.

Maxwell opened the car door and ruffled Alexander's hair. "You're doing a great job looking after your sister, champ."

Alexander helped Isabella into the car before asking, "Uncle, why did you call Aunt Evelyn your wife?"

"Next time you see her, she'll be Evelyn Lockwood," Maxwell explained patiently to the boy. His gaze lingered on the child who bore such a striking resemblance to Evelyn.

In the hotel lobby, a business associate spotted Dominic and approached to chat about recent real estate developments in the city.

Dominic wasn't in the mood for business talk. His mind was still reeling.

Maxwell continued entertaining the children outside until they realized Dominic was occupied and returned upstairs.

Dominic drove back to the Blackwood estate instead of his apartment.

He left the twins in the care of their great-grandfather and the nanny.

As Dominic grabbed his suit jacket to leave, Alexander asked in confusion, "Daddy, Uncle Maxwell said Aunt Evelyn will be called Evelyn Lockwood next time. Is that true?"

Dominic paused for only a second before walking out without a word.

Both Reginald Blackwood and the nanny exchanged startled glances.

The nanny hurried to collect the children's bags, keeping her mouth firmly shut. 'Ms. Evelyn had such a good relationship with all three of them. What could have happened?'

Reginald beckoned his great-grandson over. "Come tell me what's going on."

Alexander repeated everything he'd heard.

Suddenly, he felt sorry for his father...

At nearly ten that night, Maxwell finally took Evelyn to see her grandfather.

The old man had minor injuries but remained unconscious, his mental state fragile.

Evelyn didn't notice when Maxwell left.

She only wished he'd stay gone.

She kept vigil by her grandfather's hospital bed all night. The next morning, exhausted, she called Abigail to request leave, unsure if it would be granted.

"Take care of your grandfather first," Abigail said immediately. "The project handover is still in progress. Don't worry about rushing back."

"Thank you."

Evelyn was deeply grateful for her colleague's understanding.

After a week at her grandfather's bedside—interspersed with visits to handle her father's medical bills—Evelyn checked her nearly depleted bank account and knew she had to return to work.

Design Department.

"Evelyn, you're back?" A female colleague looked up from her work. "Your team's in a meeting on the top floor. If you hurry, you might catch the summary."

Evelyn nodded her thanks. Without stopping to organize her desk, she grabbed her laptop and headed upstairs.

By the time she reached the top floor, her teammates had already left via another elevator. Finding the conference room empty when she knocked, she pushed the door open quietly.

Knowing the project handover had occurred days ago and all critical information would have been shared in this meeting, Evelyn didn't want to burden her team. She decided to review the meeting recording.

The recording equipment was in a side cubicle. As she approached with her laptop, she froze.

Dominic sat at the massive conference table, a cigarette between his fingers, his expression thunderous.

Their eyes met.
###Chapter 143

Dominic's gaze landed on her, but there was no visible reaction.

Evelyn hesitated, unsure whether to leave or stay. Then he frowned, stubbed out his cigarette in the ashtray, grabbed his phone, and walked out of the massive conference room.

The room had two exits.

He took the other one.

Evelyn stood frozen for what felt like an eternity before remembering why she was there.

She turned on the recording equipment, lowered the volume, and slipped on the headphones. The meeting's content was displayed on the projection screen. Her fingers flew across her laptop keyboard as she noted down key points while watching the playback.

By the time she finished transcribing the previous meeting, it was already past three in the afternoon.

Abigail had been waiting for her.

The moment Evelyn stepped out of the elevator, Abigail pushed a cup of coffee toward her. "Sebastian told me you found your grandfather."

Evelyn set the coffee beside her laptop and powered it on. "Thanks for helping with Mr. Whitmore. I owe you both a meal."

Abigail chuckled. "Why thank us? It's our job. The one you should really thank is Mr. Blackwood."

Evelyn's fingers stilled on the keyboard.

Abigail nudged her with an elbow, grinning. "So, how are you planning to thank him? A fun night in, maybe?"

Evelyn didn't move.

Noticing her tension, Abigail glanced down and saw Evelyn's fingers curled tightly. Her expression was troubled.

"What's wrong? Did you and the boss... fight?" Abigail asked, recalling Dominic's mood during the meeting earlier.

He hadn't seemed any different.

She mentally scolded herself for being naive. She'd assumed his irritation was because of Nathan drugging Evelyn.

But apparently, that wasn't the case.

"I'm not in a relationship with Mr. Blackwood," Evelyn said quietly, then added, "And... I'm married."

Abigail stared at her in silence.

Then she burst out laughing. "What kind of joke is that? Saying you're married is like my mom telling me she's not my real mother and that I'm actually the lost princess of Eldoria!"

"I'm not joking." Evelyn met her gaze steadily.

Abigail's smile faded.

Evelyn was married.

Evelyn. Married.

Abigail couldn't process it.

Then what was Dominic to her?

The powerful CEO of T Corporation, a man countless elite women dreamed of marrying—yet he'd never shown interest in any of them. His private life was spotless, untouched.

And yet, he'd fallen for a married woman?

The world had gone mad.

Abigail slumped back into her chair, trying to focus on work, but her mind wouldn't cooperate.

How could Evelyn be married while entangled with Dominic?

Was it an uncontrollable passion that blinded him? Or had Evelyn deceived him, playing innocent until he discovered the truth—hence his visible anger during the meeting?

Evelyn buried herself in work, looking exhausted.

Abigail studied her, struggling to reconcile the image of the sweet, hardworking Evelyn with someone capable of two-timing men. Had she misjudged her completely?

If you're free tonight, let's grab drinks. Abigail texted her, then added, Consider it repayment for guarding your place while waiting for your grandpa.

Evelyn agreed.

Near the end of the workday, Evelyn went to wash her coffee cup and ran into Olivia, who had just returned from an off-site assignment.

"I need to talk to you after work," Olivia said bluntly.

Abigail walked over. "Evelyn and I already have plans. If you don’t mind me tagging along, we can all go together."

Olivia didn’t dislike Abigail, so she nodded. "Fine."

At closing time, the three of them headed to a bar.

"First time here?" Abigail, clearly a regular, asked Evelyn as they settled in.

Evelyn nodded.

The waiter brought their beers.

Olivia popped the caps off and poured three glasses. She took a long sip before speaking.

"Evelyn never had the chance to go to bars before. After moving to A City, life just kept kicking her down. Her stepmother’s abuse, her father’s declining health... You name it, she suffered it. There’s so much about her you don’t know, Abigail. But I do."

Abigail watched Olivia take another swig. "Do you also know she’s married?"

Olivia choked.

Beer sprayed across the table.

Even Abigail was startled by her own bluntness, hastily handing Olivia tissues.

Olivia gaped at Evelyn.

"You're married? Since when? Who the hell did you marry?"

Her mind immediately jumped to the possibility of Evelyn secretly marrying Dominic.

"I just got the certificate a week ago. Let’s not talk about it. The only relationship I have with Mr. Blackwood is professional now." Evelyn had no intention of mentioning Maxwell to anyone.

Both Abigail and Olivia thought back to that week—

Wasn’t that when Evelyn’s grandfather disappeared?

Could her sudden marriage be connected?

Half an hour later, a dozen empty beer bottles littered the table.

Olivia clapped Evelyn on the shoulder. "I don’t blame you at all. My brother brought this on himself. In case you didn’t know... he was planning to..."

She couldn’t finish.

After her brother was taken to the police station, she’d gone with her parents. The officers had found disturbing evidence on his phone—messages, photos. Olivia had seen them. She’d finally realized how vile he truly was.

"What was he going to do to me?" Evelyn pressed.

"Forget it. It’s over now..." Olivia refilled their glasses.

Amid the bar’s mellow music, a phone rang.

"Whose is that?" Olivia checked before nudging Evelyn. "Pretty sure it’s yours."

Evelyn hadn’t drunk much—she was a lightweight—but she was already feeling the buzz.

She pulled out her phone. Unknown number.

She answered.

"Evelyn, I don’t care what you’re doing, but get home now." It was Maxwell’s mother—Dominic’s aunt. Her voice trembled with suppressed fury.

"What’s wrong?" Evelyn had no patience for that family’s drama.

"You’re seriously asking what’s wrong? Old Master Blackwood is at our doorstep, accusing us of kidnapping his granddaughter-in-law! Get back here and explain yourself! I can’t believe you’d pull this stunt!"
###Chapter 144

The Lockwood family manor.

Frederick stood on the second-floor balcony, his mood darkening by the minute.

Eleanor climbed the stairs, searching for her husband before finally spotting him.

"What are you planning to do?" Eleanor knew Frederick's temper. Normally composed, their son had a way of pushing him to his limits.

She was still his mother. No matter how reckless Maxwell was, she couldn’t help but shield him.

Frederick scoffed. "When your son gets back, let’s hear what brilliant excuse he has for Reginald."

Eleanor tensed. "Isn’t it obvious? You know him better than anyone. The priority isn’t his explanation—it’s calming Reginald down!"

As parents, they understood their son’s schemes all too well.

His sudden marriage announcement, the rushed certificate...

Then there was the day he brought Evelyn home—unconscious. She’d left without a word when she woke.

And the tension at the family dinner after their marriage.

Putting it all together, Eleanor saw the truth. This marriage wasn’t legitimate. Something was off.

Frederick turned sharply. "You expect me to cover for him? He’s in his thirties! I’m done cleaning up his messes. Reginald brought Alexander here demanding answers—how am I supposed to face him after this?"

Eleanor had no defense, so she redirected.

Her gaze dropped to the car parked outside, voice dripping with disdain. "Anyone would think your sister isn’t family. She just sits in the car like she’s above it all."

Frederick snapped, "Leave her out of this. This is about you and your son. You spoiled him rotten—this is your doing!"

"My doing?" Eleanor’s temper flared. "You’ve always resented him because he’s mine, not Genevieve’s. Face it—she chose a Provincial Secretary over you. And since her husband’s sterile, maybe you’d like to—"

She regretted the words instantly but couldn’t stop.

"Every time I mention your sister, you defend her. No wonder the Blackwoods want nothing to do with us. Do I look like I enjoy groveling to Reginald? Is he our dictator now?"

Their argument raged on.

Downstairs, an Audi pulled in.

Evelyn stepped out. Olivia, in the passenger seat, turned. "Don’t worry. We’re here."

"If anyone gives you trouble, call us," Abigail added, slurring slightly but still coherent.

They weren’t leaving Evelyn alone tonight. Olivia’s boyfriend and his Audi had come in handy.

Before Evelyn reached the manor gates, Beatrice intercepted her.

She’d stayed behind, waiting.

Leaning close, Beatrice hissed, "You ignored my calls. So tell me—what’s your game? First my son, now my nephew?"

Evelyn met her gaze. "Ask your nephew about his games."

Beatrice sneered. "Marrying your cousin? Disgusting. Is this how your family raised you?"

Evelyn’s voice was ice. "Maybe it’s the bad blood from my mother’s side." She brushed past Beatrice and entered.

She knew Maxwell was her cousin. But his threats left her no choice—she had to protect Dominic.

Their marriage had been built on coercion from the start.

Unless forced, she wouldn’t be alone with Maxwell again.

Once her father recovered, she’d leave this city for good.

A lottery ticket she’d bought today flashed in her mind. If she won, she could resign and disappear.

No more financial chains.

Inside, Reginald waited. Beatrice followed, taking a seat.

Frederick and Eleanor descended the stairs.

"Evelyn," Frederick began gently, knowing his son was likely at fault, "can you explain what’s happening?"

Evelyn faced the room’s scrutiny, silent under the weight of their expectations.

Seizing the pause, Eleanor pounced. "Reginald and Beatrice are here. Answer me honestly—you were Dominic’s girlfriend first. You even met the Blackwoods. No one in this family, including Maxwell, knew, correct?"

Evelyn saw the trap. Drunk but sharp, she recognized her mother-in-law’s betrayal.

"Maxwell isn’t here. I’ll speak when he is." She turned to leave.

"Aunt Evelyn!" Alexander sprinted over, tiny arms wrapping around her legs.

Reginald didn’t stop him.

Eleanor’s stomach twisted. How close had Dominic and Evelyn been? The sight of his son clinging to her—

Like lightning from a clear sky.

This girl was dangerous. If left unchecked, she’d ruin their family.

Evelyn looked down at the boy. She wanted to confess everything. But she’d extinguished Dominic’s anger—reigniting it would be catastrophic.

They stood there, a picture of mother and son.

The door creaked open. Evelyn thought it was Maxwell—

But the towering figure who entered was—

"Daddy! Take Aunt Evelyn home!" Alexander beamed up at his father, pink cheeks pleading.
###Chapter 145

Dominic stood at the doorway.

Evelyn wasn't certain if he'd positioned himself there deliberately, but his broad frame completely blocked her only exit. Just one door, yet his imposing figure created an impenetrable barrier...

Beatrice remained seated on the sofa in silence. She allowed the Lockwood family to speak first. Her brother Frederick had the floor, then his wife could chime in. On the Blackwood side, Reginald Blackwood dominated the conversation.

She barely had room to breathe, let alone speak.

Then her son, the head of their household, arrived.

Every person in the living room fell silent.

Beatrice wanted to expedite matters. No one desired Evelyn's removal more intensely than she did.

Finally unable to contain herself, Beatrice rose and moved toward the door to take charge. Addressing the two figures blocking the exit, she commanded, "Sit down. Maxwell should return shortly."

"Grandfather summoned me. What's the issue?" Dominic's composed voice cut through the tension.

He obeyed his mother, retreating to the living room sofa.

As he shifted, his long fingers left just enough space at the door.

A silent signal for her to escape.

Evelyn's lashes fluttered. She seized the doorknob, twisted it, and slipped through the opening.

Only Blackwoods and Lockwoods remained in the room.

Eleanor Lockwood could no longer restrain her emotions. Addressing the assembly with biting sarcasm, "At my age, I've encountered every manner of person. Normally I pride myself on spotting wickedness, but apparently I've grown blind!"

Frederick appeared bewildered by his wife's outburst.

Eleanor spoke for her absent son: "You all know Maxwell's usual taste in women - tabloid fodder. But girls like Evelyn seem harmless. Suddenly she appears before him, and now he's lost all reason. After mere days of acquaintance, she's convinced my son to marry her..."

Reginald Blackwood lifted his gaze. "Are you suggesting your son is the victim here?"

"What else-" Eleanor shot Reginald a venomous look before Frederick gripped her arm, silencing her.

Reginald turned to his seemingly indifferent grandson. "Dominic, were you aware Evelyn abruptly married Maxwell?"

Alexander also fixed his gaze on his father...

The Lockwood housekeeper served tea with practiced deference.

Dominic ignored his cup, lighting a cigarette instead. Raising an eyebrow, he revealed, "Evelyn's grandfather vanished mysteriously recently. We returned to her hometown to search, even involved the police. The night before her wedding, we shared a bed."

The old man's eyes widened in shock.

Frederick, his uncle, paled at the implication.

One his son, the other his nephew. What depravity was this?

Dominic exhaled smoke. "I'm equally curious why Evelyn rushed into marriage while her grandfather remained missing."

Reginald set down his teacup, appetite for tea vanished.

"Her grandfather's been found?"

"On her wedding night. He was hospitalized."

Dominic's penetrating gaze swept across the elders. His tone deliberately hinted at hidden truths.

He trusted his uncle and aunt's intelligence. After cleaning up Maxwell's messes for decades, they surely recognized their son's handiwork.

He wanted no dramatic confrontation - just a clear warning.

Evelyn might endure abuse silently, but he wouldn't.

Eleanor's arrogance evaporated, her hands beginning to tremble.

"The situation appears evident. I expect you'll discipline your son and clarify matters with Evelyn - and with us." Reginald rose stiffly, his cane striking the floor with finality.

Frederick escorted the Blackwoods out.

Eleanor remained behind.

The housekeeper hovered nervously in the kitchen doorway, not daring to clear the abandoned tea service.

When the Blackwoods had departed, Frederick lingered at the entrance before returning.

He pointed at the house phone. "Call that worthless son immediately! Tell him I've died and he must arrange my funeral!"

Eleanor hastily complied.

After hanging up, she sat nervously, strategizing damage control.

Over an hour passed.

A car's approach announced Maxwell's return.

CRASH!

The moment Maxwell entered, his father hurled the prized teacup at him.

That exquisite cup Frederick had begged a master artisan to create. Maxwell knew its value even during his imprisonment.

Now shattered at his feet.

His father's fury was unmistakable.

"Explain yourself! Why did Evelyn marry you?" Eleanor dragged her fuming husband to the sofa.

Maxwell frowned. "What other reason exists besides love?"

"Rubbish!" Frederick's neck cords stood out in rage.

"What did the Blackwoods tell you?" Maxwell poured tea with infuriating calm. "That I kidnapped Evelyn's grandfather to force marriage? Are you admitting it?" Frederick turned crimson, reaching for another cup.

"Stop!" Eleanor nearly wept. "Hear him out!"

Maxwell sipped tea, then met his father's gaze. "I didn't abduct her grandfather. That culprit will surface. But I did exploit his disappearance to claim Evelyn as my wife."

"You bastard!" Frederick lunged.

Eleanor restrained him. "He didn't break any laws! Didn't you hear?"

Maxwell rotated his cup, voice turning dark. "If not for prison, Evelyn might've been your daughter-in-law five years ago."

"What did you say?"

Eleanor tried extracting more about how to handle the Blackwoods, but Maxwell's words implied Evelyn bore responsibility, absolving the Lockwoods...

Maxwell stood. "Enough. My personal life is no longer your concern. Even my patience has limits."

"Where are you going?" Eleanor called as he departed.

"To collect my wife." Maxwell knew Evelyn would be at her grandfather's hospital bedside.

He drove straight there, bursting into the ward. The sight didn't surprise him. Alexander was present, as was the boy's father...

Seeing the intruder, Alexander defiantly kissed Evelyn.
###Chapter 146

Evelyn glanced up and locked eyes with Maxwell.

"How's Grandfather doing?" Maxwell didn't interrupt Evelyn and the little boy. He strode directly toward the hospital bed.

Silence answered his question.

Evelyn instantly tensed. The child clinging to her leg looked up and mouthed soundlessly, "Don't worry, Aunt Evie. Daddy's coming back soon."

Maxwell settled into the chair beside the bed, staring at the old man's scabbed face. Resentment churned in his gut. How dare they hurt him like this?

Yet without this injury, he wouldn't have leverage over Evelyn.

The moral dilemma twisted inside him. 'Does the end justify the means? Or is ruthlessness simply human nature? Soft hearts never win.'

Grandfather stirred awake.

"Maxwell...you came?" His voice rasped weakly.

"Grandfather." Evelyn rushed to adjust his pillows.

Maxwell leaned forward. "Forgive me. This wouldn't have happened if I'd been more vigilant."

He'd personally delivered the old man to the hospital, crafting his alibi from the beginning. The kidnapper's fabricated story matched perfectly - a revenge plot against Maxwell for reporting their boss's rape case.

Maxwell had studied the staged video. "Your grandson couldn't keep his mouth shut! Now you'll pay!" the actor had shouted.

"I don't blame you..." Grandfather murmured.

He meant Maxwell's decision to report the rapist - the right choice. But with Evelyn and Alexander present, he left it at that.

After ten minutes, Maxwell rose to leave.

Grandfather called to Evelyn, oblivious to her stiff posture by the window. "Evie, walk Maxwell out..."

She followed, needing to speak her mind.

Alexander kicked off his shoes and scrambled onto the bed. "Great-grandpa visited earlier. Daddy took him home before you woke up."

"Your great-grandfather came?" Old Man Sinclair looked startled.

The boy blinked Evelyn's large eyes. "He promised to bring chess tomorrow and beat you!"

At the elevator, Maxwell watched Evelyn turn away.

His voice dripped irritation. "This is how you see guests out?"

She'd followed intending to confront him, but what was the point? Reasoning with a snake was impossible.

Her phone buzzed.

An Instagram voice message from an unknown account.

Maxwell's voice purred through the speaker: "Did you have something to tell me?"

Evelyn scowled at her screen. When had he followed her? That day she fainted?

She deleted it.

Another message arrived. "You hesitated earlier. Wise choice. Had you mentioned divorce...well, let's say the hospital would've witnessed interesting scenes."

Then a third. "I told my parents I'm fetching my wife. Returning alone makes you look...ungracious."

"Why hasn't Dominic come for Alexander yet?" Grandfather asked his granddaughter still frozen by the door.

Evelyn blocked Maxwell's account. "Traffic," she lied.

She longed to confess everything - that Dominic wasn't her husband, would never be. But elderly minds resisted change.

Tucking in his blanket, she ventured, "Grandfather...Dominic and I...we're too different."

The old man studied her.

Evelyn glanced at Alexander. The boy deserved to hear this too.

"Of course there are gaps," Grandfather soothed. "But you love him, not his money, right?"

"I'm...done. Exhausted." The words burned her throat.

Tears welled despite her efforts.

Five-year-old Alexander caught her meaning. His lips trembled. "Daddy's really nice though..."

Evelyn knew once she explained properly, she'd never see Dominic, Isabella or Alexander again. The thought hollowed her chest.

The boy panicked, listing his father's virtues. "He's rich! Tall! Handsome! Good genes! His temper's just from work stress! He can't cook but—"

"Still not special," Evelyn cut in, hugging him tightly.

Alexander squirmed in her arms—then gasped. "Daddy!"

Dominic stood in the doorway.

"Down. Shoes on. We're leaving." He lifted his son, letting him struggle with one missing shoe.

As Evelyn packed Alexander's schoolbag, Dominic took it from her hands. His voice dropped dangerously low. "Do I need redeeming qualities to fuck you?"

She glanced at Grandfather, cheeks flaming. "Dozens. Which you lack!"

Money-making aside, the man was emotionally bankrupt.

She turned away.

His grip trapped her wrist.

Dominic's breath scorched her ear. "Tell me, darling...which of my...assets haven't you thoroughly enjoyed?"
###Chapter 147

Dominic's dark brows knitted together, his aristocratic features clouded with barely concealed irritation. Evelyn understood exactly what was troubling him.

"Would you mind keeping your hands to yourself?" She jerked her wrist away from his grasp.

To her surprise, his fingers clamped down harder instead of releasing her.

His piercing gaze turned glacial as it locked onto her trembling eyes. "How exactly should I address you then? As my dear cousin's wife perhaps?" The mocking edge in his voice sent chills down her spine.

Evelyn's temper flared at his words. "Call me whatever you like. It makes no difference to me."

Just as his grip threatened to crush her delicate bones, Grandfather's voice interrupted. "Evelyn, did you pack the children's school bags?"

Pain rendered her speechless. Only when Dominic finally loosened his hold did she realize how close she'd come to a broken wrist.

The predatory glint in his eyes reflected in her tear-filled gaze. Biting her lip, she wrenched free from his grasp...

"Say goodbye to your great-grandfather," Dominic commanded emotionlessly as they reached the doorway.

The little boy clutched his father's hand while waving with the other. "Bye Great-grandpa! Rest well. I'll...I'll visit tomorrow..."

"I'll look forward to it," the elderly man replied warmly.

Dominic led his son from the room.

Before the door closed completely, the child glanced back at Aunt Evelyn who hadn't followed. Walking down the corridor, he suddenly looked up. "Daddy, I think Aunt Evelyn is crying secretly."

Dominic didn't spare him a glance. "You're imagining things."

"But I'm not..." the boy insisted stubbornly.

The man's frown deepened.

Evelyn had braced herself for Grandfather's inevitable questions - why she suddenly cared about their social differences, why she ended things when everything seemed perfect.

Yet the old man asked nothing.

He simply lay quietly, refusing to burden his granddaughter with sighs or disapproving looks.

Harrison's text arrived just then.

After reading it, she adjusted Grandfather's blankets meticulously before slipping out, closing the door softly behind her...

Harrison waited at the hospital entrance.

"Is your family member hospitalized?" he asked with genuine concern when he spotted her. "My grandfather," Evelyn admitted without hesitation.

"Care for coffee?" He gestured toward a nearby café.

She nodded. A conversation was overdue anyway.

Inside the café...

Harrison ordered their usual drinks, remembering her preferences from previous dates.

The coffee took unusually long to arrive.

"What's wrong with your grandfather?" he inquired. "Just age-related issues. He'll be discharged soon," Evelyn deflected, unwilling to mention the kidnapping that would only alarm him.

Harrison fell silent, carefully analyzing her words, particularly "age-related issues"...

After a pause, he looked up. "Are you handling his care alone? Where are your parents?"

Their coffee arrived just then.

The server departed after setting down their order.

"My father..." Evelyn's fingers tightened around the scalding cup as if numb to the heat. "My father's hospitalized too. My mother left us right after I was born."

Harrison's coffee cup froze halfway to his lips.

Learning about Robert's condition left him speechless.

When the silence stretched too long, his expression darkened.

Eventually, Harrison stood and left without another word. Evelyn remained until the café nearly emptied before finding strength to leave.

Perhaps breaking up had been the right choice. Maybe they shouldn't have dated at all.

Early next morning...

After preparing Grandfather's breakfast, Evelyn headed to work.

On the crowded subway, her phone rang.

An unknown number.

"Hello? Evelyn Sinclair?"

A woman's voice.

"Yes, speaking." The hospital line subway was always standing room only. She gripped the overhead rail tightly.

"I'm Harrison's mother. We need to talk."

Evelyn stiffened. "Of course, Mrs. Wells..."

"My son came home drunk last night - something he's never done before. When we pressed him, the alcohol loosened his tongue. He told us everything about your...situation."

Though not domineering by nature, Mrs. Wells couldn't remain silent about Evelyn's unacceptable family circumstances. As Harrison's mother, she knew her kind-hearted son often overlooked people's flaws.

"His father and I believe you two should end this!"

"Ms. Sinclair? Are you listening?" The impatience was palpable.

Subway interference made responses difficult. Just as Evelyn opened her mouth to reply, the connection cut out.

When service restored, Mrs. Wells' tone had turned razor-sharp. "Your silence speaks volumes! Let me be clear - don't take advantage of my son's generosity. However much he earns, it shouldn't fund your dying father or ailing grandfather. Stop preying on decent people, you gold-digger!"

The line went dead.

Evelyn stood frozen as the dial tone echoed in her ears.

Just then, the train reached her stop.

Downtown crowds surged toward the exits. Before she could process the venomous words, the jostling mob tore a button from her blouse.

Emerging from the station, her phone buzzed with notifications.

A college friend had texted: 'Eve, interested in part-time work? I know a gig - we could partner up! Base $300/night plus commission, though the product's tricky... [Photo] Check if you're comfortable promoting these at a club. Don't worry - it's my friend's uncle's legit business. No creeps. Reply if interested!'

Evelyn responded: 'Sorry, was underground. Just escaped the subway crush.'

'So? Want to team up?' came the immediate reply.

Evelyn hesitated, staring at the knockoff "Durax" condoms in the photo. But money was money. Selling protection meant promoting responsible intimacy and women's health.

'Send details,' she typed.

As she hit send, the crosswalk signal turned green.

Stepping off the curb, her gaze drifted absently - then locked onto a figure exiting the subway ten meters away.

Margaret Whitmore - the woman who'd arranged her surrogate pregnancy five years ago!
###Chapter 148

Evelyn Sinclair crossed the busy intersection.

Margaret Whitmore observed Evelyn from a distance of about fifteen meters. The older woman chose a different crosswalk to traverse the street.

Evelyn wasn't heading to her office. Instead, she found herself secretly trailing Margaret.

Her job responsibilities, her projects - none of it mattered right now.

"Evelyn, what are you doing?" she muttered under her breath as she walked.

No clear answer came to mind.

She wouldn't admit the truth even to herself - that she desperately wanted to catch a glimpse of the child she'd given birth to five years ago. Just one look. That's why she'd instinctively followed Margaret, hoping to uncover more about the child.

Margaret reached the other side and strode purposefully toward the Blackwood Enterprises building.

Evelyn's gaze lifted to the corporate logo, her brow furrowing.

"Why would Margaret be going there?"

The answer eluded her.

Before she could reconsider, Evelyn followed Margaret inside. She maneuvered carefully through the revolving doors, keeping out of Margaret's line of sight.

The moment she stepped into the lobby, Sebastian Whitmore emerged from the elevator.

Margaret walked directly toward him.

Their easy familiarity was unmistakable. They clearly knew each other well.

Evelyn's grip tightened on her laptop bag.

At the elevator bank, Sebastian greeted Margaret warmly. "Mrs. Whitmore, what a pleasant surprise."

They entered the elevator together. "It's been too long," Margaret replied. "Walter and I have heard wonderful things about your work here."

Sebastian pressed the elevator button. "I owe everything to Mr. Harrison's mentorship. Though I must ask - what brings you here today? Is Mr. Harrison with you?"

"He's occupied elsewhere," Margaret deflected.

When the doors opened, Sebastian gestured for Margaret to enter first. "Next time you visit, please let me know in advance. I'll arrange transportation."

Margaret nodded politely.

But internally, she was troubled.

Five years ago, Dominic Blackwood had gained a son and daughter. Since retiring early with Walter to enjoy their golden years, they'd rarely appeared in public.

She'd only shown her face during that fateful transaction years ago.

If that young woman saw her now and made the connection... The truth about the Blackwood children could unravel.

Fortunately, Evelyn had seemed naive back then. A more calculating woman would have been disastrous.

The Blackwood family could handle financial demands. Their resources were vast.

But Margaret feared insatiable greed - demands beyond money. Unrealistic expectations.

If negotiations failed, the children would suffer most.

The worst-case scenario? Public scandal labeling Dominic's children as products of a shady surrogacy deal.

These concerns had kept Margaret and Walter in seclusion.

They rarely left home. When they did, private transportation was mandatory.

Yet today, Dominic had called with strange instructions: Take the subway. Arrive at 8:30 sharp.

Margaret hadn't questioned the order, though she could have taken a taxi or called a driver.

The morning subway commute had been brutal after years of avoiding public transit.

The girl who bore Dominic's children would be twenty-four now. Probably working, whether abroad or locally.

With countless subway lines and stations, the odds of an accidental encounter were astronomical.

Margaret straightened her posture as she exited the station, walking confidently toward Blackwood Enterprises.

On the top floor...

Margaret followed Sebastian into the CEO's office.

"Mr. Blackwood-"

Before she could finish, two small figures launched themselves at her from the sofa.

"Grandma Margaret!" they cried in unison.

"My darlings!" Margaret embraced them warmly. "Let me look at you both - so grown up and beautiful!"

Childless herself, Margaret had watched these twins grow. They visited her and Walter annually for holiday stays.

Dominic signed a document before looking up, his usual stern expression softening. "If you love Grandma Margaret so much, perhaps you should stay with her for a few days."

Margaret was still basking in the children's affection when Dominic's words registered.

Had she heard correctly?

Dominic reviewed another file without glancing up. "Didn't you two always want to ride the subway?"

Many things confused Margaret today. But one thing was clear: she'd be taking Dominic's children on the subway later.

Alexander looked at his father. "Really?"

Dominic met his son's gaze, something unreadable in his eyes. "Behave for Grandma Margaret."

"Thank you, Daddy!" the children chorused.

Dominic returned to his paperwork.

Alexander took Isabella's hand as they left with Margaret.

Outside the office...

Sebastian hesitated. "Shouldn't I arrange a car?"

"No need," Margaret said. "These two should experience the subway." She herded the children toward the elevator.

"Mr. Blackwood approved this?" Sebastian held the elevator door.

"Yes." Margaret had no time for questions. She needed to get the children moving.

Once outside, she'd call Walter about their unexpected houseguests.

Margaret pinched Isabella's cheek. "Grandpa Walter will be thrilled to see you both."

"I miss Grandpa," Isabella said sweetly.

Sebastian released the elevator button. The doors closed.

"Mr. Blackwood is letting them take the subway?" he muttered. "How strange."

Twenty minutes later, a meeting commenced in the conference room.

After the senior officer's presentation, he reported to the president's office.

Typically, Dominic showed little interest in project details.

But this project was different - a development in a small town that seemed personal. Dominic had insisted on reviewing certain elements himself. If necessary, he'd handle the design personally.
###Chapter 149

"The design team leader mentioned they have a new hire named Evelyn Sinclair." The senior executive adjusted his glasses. "Apparently Evelyn's hometown is the exact town where our new development project is located. I was hoping to get some local insights from her at today's meeting, but her supervisor said she called in sick..." His voice trailed off as he glanced nervously at Dominic.

To his surprise, Dominic Blackwood didn't look angry. A faint smile played at the corners of his lips.

A rare sight indeed.

In all his years at Blackwood Enterprises, this was the first time the executive had seen the CEO smile.

And it was because an employee had skipped work without notice.

Dominic's sharp gaze returned to the town's architectural plans.

Evelyn's absence didn't surprise him one bit.

Meanwhile at the subway station...

Evelyn purchased her ticket with trembling fingers.

Just ahead, Margaret Whitmore held the hands of two small children as they waited for their train.

Evelyn's face remained expressionless.

She'd seen Margaret follow Sebastian up to the executive floor earlier.

She hadn't dared follow.

That was Dominic's domain. Without explicit permission, no regular employee could enter the CEO's private territory.

During the agonizing wait for Margaret to return, a terrible suspicion took root in Evelyn's mind.

'Does Margaret know Dominic?'

'What's their relationship?'

Memories from five years ago surfaced. Margaret had been the personal housekeeper responsible for her employer's private affairs.

Living abroad all these years, Evelyn had tried to forget that chapter of her life. She'd seen enough bald wealthy men on Olivia's reality shows to numb the memories.

The past disgusted her. She hated her powerlessness, the cruel hand fate had dealt her.

Now seeing Margaret going to Blackwood Enterprises, meeting Dominic on the top floor... it all came rushing back.

Those long nights blindfolded, enduring the powerful thrusts, breathing in that distinctive cologne...

All of it matched Dominic.

But if she'd known it was him from the beginning, would she have believed it?

When Margaret returned with the children, Evelyn felt her blood turn to ice.

Alexander and Isabella clung to Margaret, calling her "Grandma Margaret."

The five-year-olds seemed completely comfortable with the older woman.

But this was all still speculation.

Back then, Margaret had told her she'd given birth to a girl...

Yet here were twins.

Standing behind them in the subway station, Evelyn's mind raced with torturous questions.

Had Margaret lied deliberately?

Had she intentionally said it was a single girl?

Evelyn tried recalling the size of her belly. Average, she thought. But with no frame of reference, how could she have known about twins?

At eighteen, she'd known nothing.

Every medical report could have been fabricated under the employer's orders.

Another thought struck her: 'If the employer was Dominic, why hide it?'

Those nights blindfolded, she'd never seen his face. Yet he'd seen every inch of hers...

The more she thought, the more exhausted she became. Doubts clouded her mind. Maybe Margaret's employer wasn't Dominic after all.

The train arrived.

Margaret ushered the children aboard.

Snapping out of her daze, Evelyn boarded with her laptop.

As the train moved, Evelyn peered through the crowd. A young man offered Margaret his seat.

"Subways are always so crowded..." Alexander looked around.

Evelyn ducked out of sight.

"Alex, when you grow up, can you drive trains? Then I can ride one this big every day," Isabella asked seriously.

Margaret smiled down at them.

After several stops, the carriage emptied considerably.

Margaret kept a watchful eye on the children while internally fretting.

These weren't ordinary children. They were the Blackwood heirs. Taking them on public transit felt reckless.

She knew she had to stay alert.

That Dominic allowed this at all was shocking. If Reginald Blackwood found out, he'd have a fit.

As the train grew emptier, Evelyn sat in the adjacent carriage.

She stole glances at Margaret and the twins.

Earlier, the children had behaved, remembering their father's warning not to trouble Grandma Margaret.

Now with space to move, they began playing.

"This carriage is mine! Rawr!" Alexander declared.

"No, Alex! You're the driver. I'm the passenger." Isabella pouted. "I wish Daddy would buy us a subway."

"It's not a sub—" Alexander stopped mid-sentence, spotting someone. "Aunt Eve?" He recognized her silhouette.

Isabella followed his gaze.

One stop from Margaret's destination, Evelyn stood as Alexander approached. Their eyes met—as did Evelyn's and Margaret's.

Margaret's guarded, shocked expression confirmed she remembered Evelyn.

"Alexander! Isabella! Come here!" Margaret panicked, grabbing their hands, fearing Evelyn might take them.

"Aunt Eve, what are you doing here?" Alexander asked casually while Margaret pulled him back.

"Going to work," Evelyn answered weakly, her eyes locked with Margaret's.

She forced composure. "Hello."

Margaret ignored the greeting, brows furrowed. 'Do they know this woman? How? Do they know she's their mother?'

'Does Dominic know they've met?'

The train stopped.

Evelyn smiled at the children before exiting.

They called after her, but Margaret held them back until the doors closed.

Evelyn sat on a station bench, overwhelmed.

No matter how she tried to calm herself, her thoughts spiraled.

Had she really borne two healthy children with her half-brother?

Impossible.

'Were Alexander and Isabella someone else's?'

She shook her head. More likely Beatrice had lied. Maybe she and Dominic weren't siblings at all...

'Alexander and Isabella. A.S. Evelyn Sinclair.'

The realization hit like a thunderbolt. How could she have been so blind?

There were no coincidences here.

Their names had been deliberately chosen.

Standing abruptly, Evelyn headed for the office. There was only one way to get answers—confront Dominic directly.
###Chapter 150

Evelyn boarded the subway heading to her office.

Her fingers trembled as she pulled out her phone, dialing Dominic's number against her better judgment.

She needed answers. Now.

"Sorry, the number you've dialed is unavailable."

"Why is his phone off?"

She tried again immediately.

Same automated response.

This was Dominic's private line. Only family and closest confidants had access to it.

He alone controlled when it was active.

Evelyn remembered his promise - this phone would always be on for her.

The memory burned. His lips tracing her jawline, whispering sweet nothings in her ear. Two passionate days that now felt like a cruel dream.

The train rattled toward downtown.

Evelyn clutched her laptop bag tighter, scrolling for Dominic's work number.

She knew the drill. His assistant Sebastian screened all calls. Only urgent matters reached Dominic directly.

First attempt - busy signal.

Second try connected.

"Sebastian Whitmore speaking."

Everyone in corporate circles knew Sebastian - the gatekeeper to the Blackwood empire.

"It's Evelyn Sinclair from design," she whispered, conscious of nearby passengers.

"Ms. Sinclair?" Surprise colored his professional tone. "How may I help you?"

"I need to speak with Mr. Blackwood."

Sebastian hesitated. "He's unavailable. Have you tried his personal line?"

"It's switched off."

A beat of silence. This was highly unusual.

"Mr. Blackwood left the office thirty minutes ago. His private schedule isn't my purview..." The unspoken message: I can't help you.

"Thank you anyway." Defeat weighted her words.

The call ended.

Underground, Evelyn scrolled through old contacts desperately.

The Blackwood family landline appeared like a beacon.

"Hello, is... Alexander's father home?" She caught herself last second.

The housekeeper recognized her instantly. "Ms. Evelyn? Master Dominic hasn't returned since morning."

"Never mind then." She hung up, cheeks burning.

Evelyn leaned against the subway wall, exhaustion pressing down. In this sea of strangers, she felt untethered, adrift without Dominic's anchoring presence.

Before returning to work, she detoured to Dominic's penthouse.

The concierge remembered her from last week's visit.

"Apologies, madam. The gentleman hasn't been home in days."

Evelyn nodded stiffly and turned away.

The office loomed nearby.

As she approached, she spotted Sebastian at the curb, accepting car keys from the valet.

"Mr. Whitmore!" She intercepted him.

He paused, assessing her frantic energy. "Yes?"

"Do you know Margaret Whitmore?" The question tumbled out. "I saw her with Mr. Blackwood's children this morning."

Sebastian's expression shuttered.

Margaret had handled Dominic's most sensitive affairs before retiring abruptly five years ago - exactly when the twins were born.

Evelyn pressed: "She worked for Mr. Blackwood previously, correct?"

Sebastian shifted uncomfortably. "I can't discuss Mr. Blackwood's private matters. Margaret was employed here but retired five years back."

The timeline confirmed everything.

"Thank you." Evelyn walked away mechanically.

In the elevator, Alexander and Isabella's faces flashed behind her eyelids.

Her children.

Tears spilled over as the truth settled in her bones.

Ten minutes ago, she'd been chasing Dominic across the city. Now Sebastian's careful words had answered every unspoken question.
###Chapter 151

Evelyn returned to the design department and powered up her laptop. The development plans for the small town appeared on her screen.

Dominic wanted to develop this forgotten place - a thought that had never crossed her mind.

According to local gossip, the town's redevelopment had been in progress for years now.

Demolition notices plastered most buildings.

"Are you okay? Can you focus on work?" Abigail messaged her.

Evelyn typed back, "I'm fine."

But the truth was far from it. Her mind kept drifting to those two adorable children - Alexander and Isabella. Their smiling faces haunted her thoughts.

After thirty minutes of distracted sketching, Evelyn stood to get water. Her thoughts turned to Dominic's unpredictable moods lately. Yesterday at the hospital, he'd humiliated her publicly. Would he still be in that foul temper when they next met?

The possibility depressed her.

She'd endure anything for those children. Their bright smiles pushed Dominic's stormy expression from her mind.

As she sipped water, Evelyn couldn't suppress a smile. At least the twins adored her.

Perhaps the bond between mother and child transcended logic - an invisible thread connecting them despite years apart.

"Why so happy? I thought you'd forgotten how to smile." Olivia entered the break room rubbing her temples. "That cheap wine last night gave me hellish headaches."

Evelyn kept her joy private. This miracle still felt too fragile to share.

Her world had been dark - Robert's cancer, her grandfather's kidnapping, being forced to marry Maxwell. Then suddenly, sunlight broke through the clouds.

Alexander and Isabella were her sunrise, her spring blossoms, her warm breeze.

Dominic's temper might still rage, but she hadn't abandoned hope of getting answers from their father.

Before clocking out, she tried calling him again.

"The number you have dialed is unavailable..."

At dusk, Evelyn left the office building.

The subway carried her to the hospital where she first checked on Robert's condition with the doctors.

In his ward, she arranged the vitamins she'd bought beside his bed.

The new caretaker - a woman in her forties - had already arrived.

Robert looked at her weakly from the hospital bed. "You hired help? Must be expensive..."

"It's affordable," Evelyn assured him. "We have no relatives here to help. Even if we did, they couldn't come daily. If I don't work, we lose our income."

The truth stung - she disliked entrusting her father to strangers. But quitting her job wasn't an option.

T Corporation paid reliably. Every month, her salary appeared like clockwork. Project bonuses came later, upon completion.

This current project could net tens of thousands - money for hospital bills, rent, food.

"Has your mother... contacted you?" Robert's question struck a nerve.

Evelyn met his gaze. "Dad, am I really Beatrice's daughter?"

He sighed, misreading her doubt. "Of course. She's changed, but... she's still your mother. When I'm gone, you'll need family."

Evelyn looked down.

She wanted to say she needed no such family, that she'd survived this long without maternal love. Now self-sufficient, she certainly didn't need that woman.

What kind of mother was Beatrice anyway?

While chatting, Evelyn discreetly searched: Can half-siblings produce healthy offspring?

The answer: No.

She wasn't concerned with morality, only the children's health.

One thing became clear - either she or Dominic wasn't Beatrice's biological child.

The Blackwoods weren't ordinary wealthy - they were elite. If they'd reclaimed an illegitimate child, DNA tests would have been exhaustive.

The conclusion formed: perhaps she wasn't Beatrice's daughter.

Not wanting to distress her frail father, Evelyn changed the subject. After visiting her grandfather and sharing dinner, she followed her classmate's directions to the night job.

At the club.

"You don't party much, do you? Drink this - keeps you awake." Her classmate handed her coffee.

Evelyn accepted it, staring at the pile of condoms before her...

After the product tutorial, they split up to promote in different VIP sections.

Evelyn entered her first room. Immediately, a guest snatched a condom from her case.

"Knockoff Durex? Isn't this illegal?"

"Sorry, wrong product." As instructed, she retrieved the items and retreated.

In the hallway, she eyed the row of luxury rooms ahead. Her classmate had taken the opposite wing.

Clutching the imitation products, Evelyn frowned. Part-time jobs either broke your back or your ethics.

Money didn't come easy.

Steeling herself, she approached the next VIP suite.

Dim lighting revealed men in designer suits playing poker, singing, drinking. Their affluent aura was unmistakable.

Evelyn took a deep breath. "Good evening. Would anyone require... protection products?"

A deep voice cut through the chatter. "What exactly are you selling?"

Her gaze snapped toward the speaker.

In the corner, a man lounged on crimson velvet, cigarette smoke curling around his sharp features. Dominic Blackwood's piercing eyes locked onto hers through the haze.
###Chapter 152

She'd spent the entire day searching for him.

Of all places, she never expected to run into Dominic here.

The situation couldn't be worse.

He was the wealthy, extravagant client. She was just an ordinary salesgirl.

Carrying her suitcase filled with contraceptive products.

Dominic exhaled a plume of smoke. His words drew every eye in the private room toward them.

These men were all his longtime companions.

Most had attended school with him since childhood.

The rest came from powerful families intertwined with the Blackwoods.

Nearly all were either married or in committed relationships.

Dominic stood alone among them - untouched by scandal.

Once, some fool had sent a beautiful young man to his bed.

The logic was simple: if Dominic didn't like women, perhaps he preferred men.

The humiliated boy returned defeated. If Mr. Blackwood didn't desire women, why reject him?

After years of observation, his friends concluded Dominic desired neither.

Perhaps he was asexual.

Perhaps his relentless focus on business left no room for romance.

A rare specimen among men.

Maybe that's why he'd found a woman to bear his children.

Yet now, Dominic was doing the unthinkable - engaging with a contraceptive salesgirl.

The poker player stood, removing his cigarette. "Whatever you're selling, come sit."

Just like that, Evelyn was ushered toward them.

"Sit beside him." The man gestured politely to the seat next to Dominic.

When she complied, he poured her water with the same care he'd show Alexander or Isabella.

He wasn't about to let this opportunity slip away.

After twenty-nine years, Dominic had finally shown interest in a woman.

A sight rarer than the dodo bird!

"Talk privately. Call if you need anything." The poker player discreetly closed the divider behind him.

Dominic's gaze remained obscured by smoke. "Show me what you're selling."

She remained motionless.

Silent.

After a moment, he reached over and opened her unlocked case.

Neat rows of products wrapped in garish packaging.

Each item sealed in waterproof plastic.

Dominic studied them, cigarette in hand. He pressed the burning tip against a package.

She thought he meant to point at an item.

When she realized he was burning her merchandise, she stayed quiet.

She knew his temper.

Knew his cruelty.

Knew the venom in his words when angered.

But when she pictured Alexander and Isabella's faces...

Her conclusions about Sebastian's information, while logical, lacked concrete proof.

Claiming his children as hers wasn't something to do lightly.

She needed to hear it from Dominic himself.

His gaze on the contraceptives held the weight of life and death decisions.

Smoke and the chill made his voice rough. "Does the Lockwood family know you're selling these?"

Evelyn knew conversation was impossible today.

Every word dripped with malice.

"If you're married to Maxwell, why peddle contraceptives in places like this? Does he neglect you? Are you that desperate for money?" Dominic's frown deepened.

"Sorry, but my boss prohibits chatting with customers. If you're not buying, don't waste my time." Evelyn stood, case in hand, ignoring the damaged packaging.

As she rose, Dominic caught her wrist.

Effortless.

His large hand engulfed hers. When she stubbornly refused to face him, his expression turned murderous.

One sharp tug sent her crashing against his chest.

Face to face with those lethal eyes, she froze. Her suitcase burst open...

Breath coming fast.

She struggled, but his arms were steel traps.

His cologne mixed with tobacco overwhelmed her. The confined space grew unbearably warm.

"If you want company, ask for a hostess... Plenty of beautiful women here..." Her ears burned.

Dominic ignored her, examining a box of condoms.

"You think gamblers care about protection?" He'd never used one himself.

Their proximity made her fair skin flush pink. His breath warmed her cheeks.

"Let me go..." Trapped, she braced against his broad shoulders, trying to push away.

The movement only made things worse.

Her squirming ignited him.

Studying her shy expression, he opened a box. "Explain the benefits."

Her cheeks burned crimson...

Dominic's gaze dropped to her lips. His voice turned dangerously seductive. "Obey me tonight, and I'll grant any request. Even never seeing me again. I keep my promises."

Evelyn stared in disbelief.

It felt like a trap.

Alexander and Isabella bound them together. Never meeting again was impossible.

She could never abandon her children - and she knew he felt the same.
###Chapter 153

At that moment, Evelyn couldn't bring herself to care about anything else.

Even recognizing it as a deliberate trap, she stepped forward without hesitation.

She already knew exactly what she would ask him.

Her burning questions were simple - were Alexander and Isabella truly her children?

And was Dominic the mysterious employer from five years ago...

"The primary benefits of this product include..." Evelyn awkwardly recited the script from her rushed thirty-minute training session. "Beyond contraception, condoms significantly reduce transmission risks for STDs like syphilis, gonorrhea, and HIV. They provide essential protection..."

Her mind swirled with those two crucial questions as she mechanically answered his earlier inquiries.

Dominic set aside the contraceptive and picked up another item instead.

The packaging boasted: "Long Distance Couples' Remote Control Massager."

The implications were unmistakable.

As a man, Dominic had zero experience with such devices.

"You sell these too? Quite the diverse inventory." His deceptively calm gaze held hidden blades of anger beneath the surface warmth. "Did your manager teach you how to demonstrate this for male customers?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together tightly, the momentary relief in her tension vanishing instantly.

She had no idea how to respond.

"Explain it to me," he commanded.

Evelyn stared blankly, avoiding his scorching gaze like a student caught unprepared. She haltingly recited from memory:

"This product... allows couples to... share intimacy despite physical distance..."

No, wrong phrasing. She corrected herself: "Experience pleasure together..."

"It features smartphone control with customizable vibration patterns... adjustable intensity and duration... lets partners connect from anywhere globally..."

By the time she finished stammering through the description, her cheeks burned crimson.

The flush spread from her face to her delicate earlobes, her expression caught between innocence and something far more provocative.

Dominic suddenly leaned in, turning the device over in his hands before whispering against her ear: "I'll take this one."

Her breath hitched. What could he possibly want with... that?

"Actually... this is designed for female use," she offered weakly, immediately regretting the clarification.

His voice dropped to a rough timbre: "I'm purchasing it for my wife to enjoy while I control it remotely. Unless you described it wrong?"

His... wife...

His masculine scent flooded her senses as heat radiated through their clothing, scorching her skin.

Worst of all, she could feel his growing arousal pressing insistently against her.

The sheer size terrified her - it might devour her whole.

Locked in his intense gaze, she stopped struggling, fearing any resistance might provoke him further.

Her eyes traced his lips, jawline, noble nose, and those penetrating eyes, recalling their previous encounters...

How she'd struggled to accommodate him...

Then her treacherous mind dredged up hazy memories from five years ago that suddenly felt vivid - her initial pain giving way to unexpected pleasure...

She mentally shook herself. Why was she remembering those moments now?

Was she really the type to fantasize about such things the moment she suspected their connection?

Evelyn refused to acknowledge that part of herself.

She tried to steady her breathing, but it came out in anxious pants instead.

The air between them crackled with tension, her ragged breaths seeming to taunt him.

"Why so breathless?" he teased knowingly, leaning closer until his lips nearly brushed hers.

His proximity made her pulse race uncontrollably. Swallowing hard, she stared at his devastatingly handsome features...

"I quite enjoyed your demonstration," he murmured, pulling back just as her anticipation peaked.

Dominic reclined leisurely on the sofa, visibly satisfied by her reaction. His large hand cradled the back of her head, fingers tangling in her silky hair as he drew her closer.

His smoldering gaze traced her flushed cheeks, parted lips, and the delicate collarbones peeking from her conservative uniform.

The part-time job required all female staff to wear schoolgirl outfits - though modest, the effect on male customers was undeniable.

Dominic had seen her in uniform before - during her pregnancy when she'd still been a student visiting the estate with Margaret.

As his hands tightened around her waist, pulling her flush against him, she placed a trembling palm on his chest. "You promised... if I obeyed, you'd grant my request."

"Is it the same request? That you'll only ever love Nathan in this lifetime?" Dominic ground out, clearly uncomfortable with the growing pressure against his slacks.

Evelyn shook her head.

"I want to ask..." Her racing heart stole her voice.

Perched on his lap, her pulse hammered so violently she could barely think.

'I need to know about Alexander and Isabella... who... who's their real mother?'

The question emerged far more cautiously than she'd intended.

After voicing it, Evelyn's heartbeat threatened to burst from her chest. She waited endlessly for his response before daring to look up.

His expression darkened.

Their heated breaths mingled in the scant space between them.

"Perhaps we should recreate that night properly," Dominic growled against her ear, "then you'll know exactly who bore my children."

The implication was unmistakable...

She had given birth to Alexander and Isabella. He was the man who'd claimed her that night.
###Chapter 154

Evelyn finally got the answer she needed. She took a deep breath, trying to steady herself. Minutes passed before she realized she was still sitting on Dominic's lap.

Her legs felt weak when she tried to move.

She couldn't stand up.

It was as if her limbs had turned to liquid.

Dominic's warm lips brushed against her ear. Each light kiss sent shivers down her spine. His hot breath made her skin tingle.

Her face burned. Her pulse raced.

She was paralyzed.

"Stop... please..." Evelyn gasped, yet her body betrayed her, melting into his embrace.

"Relax. We're alone here."

Dominic lifted her effortlessly, positioning her to straddle his lap.

The position was impossible. He was too... substantial. Her thin skirt provided no barrier.

She blushed furiously.

Noticing her discomfort, Dominic adjusted her slightly. This only deepened her embarrassment.

Face to face now, she saw the hunger in his dark eyes.

Looking down, she couldn't miss the obvious bulge in his trousers.

Evelyn swallowed hard. Her mouth went dry. She needed to escape.

"Stay still-" Dominic gripped her wrist, his other hand anchoring her thigh.

Even through fabric, the heat between them was undeniable.

His calloused palm grazed her ankle - a roughness earned from years of training and driving.

"Why run? Thinking of Nathan again? Does being with me make you feel guilty?" Dominic's expression darkened suddenly.

Nathan. Her first love.

The name stuck in Dominic's throat like a bone he couldn't dislodge.

And Maxwell was still her husband.

This woman tormented him endlessly.

Yet he couldn't stop wanting her.

Dominic's hand traveled slowly up her leg, pausing at her calf.

He playfully squeezed, making her muscles twitch. Evelyn instinctively rubbed her legs together for relief.

But this only pressed her calves against Dominic's thighs.

Fire ignited where they touched, spreading upward until his abdomen tensed.

Evelyn was still trying to figure out how to negotiate seeing Alexander and Isabella.

"Mmm-"

Dominic's mouth captured hers before she could speak.

Her eyes flew open. She pushed against his shoulders, but when she parted her lips to protest, he deepened the kiss.

It looked like she was welcoming him.

"Ah... nngh..."

Dominic claimed her mouth ruthlessly. She grew lightheaded. Her lips went numb from the assault.

When her breathy moans reached him, his hand slid higher up her thigh.

Evelyn's sensitive skin prickled at his rough touch.

"What are you doing?" She panted, dazed.

Coming to her senses, she broke the kiss abruptly.

Dominic's wandering hands had hitched up her skirt hem.

The air-conditioned room felt suddenly cold against her exposed skin.

How long had they been kissing?

No woman could think straight after Dominic's attentions.

His smoldering gaze dropped to where his hands rested. He frowned. "No safety shorts today?"

Their eyes locked. He looked furious.

Evelyn yanked her skirt down angrily.

"Why do you care?"

"Answer me." His tone was parental, scolding.

He remembered removing her safety shorts that first night at the manor. Since then, he'd expected her to dress modestly.

His possessive streak was uncontrollable.

Evelyn didn't explain it was her first day in this ridiculous uniform. She hadn't known about the short skirt.

Of course she'd take precautions normally. The city was full of creeps.

"Trying to tempt someone dressed like this?"

Dominic gripped her chin, forcing her to meet his glare.

He wanted to punish her. Make her remember this lesson.

What if another man saw her like this? Who would protect her?

"Cat got your tongue?"

His anger grew. His hand slipped beneath her skirt, finding soft curls...

Evelyn pushed back, face flaming.

She tried to remove his hand.

But Dominic growled, "Keep fighting me and you'll never see the twins again."

She froze instantly.

The children were his ultimate leverage.

Dominic's fingers explored further.

A phone lit up on the sofa nearby - Dominic's private line.

Evelyn noticed through her haze.

His skilled fingers tormented her, yet pleasure built despite herself.

"Your... your phone..." she managed between gasps. "It's ringing..."
###Chapter 155

Dominic's dark eyes gleamed with satisfaction as he studied Evelyn's flushed face.

His teeth grazed his lower lip in anticipation.

The vibration of Walter Harrison's name on his phone screen interrupted the moment.

Dominic reached for the device without breaking eye contact. "Hold onto me," he commanded in that deep voice that sent shivers down her spine. "Unless you want to fall."

Evelyn's legs trembled where she straddled him. One wrong move and she'd topple backward.

"Uncle Walter? Is everything alright?" Concern laced Dominic's tone as he imagined something happening to the twins.

Walter's voice crackled through the receiver.

Evelyn fought to regain composure, peeling herself away from the intoxicating haze Dominic created. She didn't care about appearances as she carefully lowered her feet to the floor.

The moment her skirt slipped from his grasp, the fabric cascaded back into place.

Avoiding his gaze, she gathered the scattered intimacy products with trembling fingers.

Her suitcase zipper sounded unnaturally loud in the charged silence as she packed.

Fingers flew to adjust her disheveled bra straps and smooth her hair.

The wrinkle-resistant fabric of her dress had held up remarkably well.

Considering what had nearly happened beneath it.

Dominic's voice cut through her frantic tidying. "Is Isabella's eye injury serious? Did you take her to the hospital?"

Evelyn whirled around, suitcase forgotten. "What happened to Isabella?"

Dominic's stained fingers rested motionless on his knees as he listened to Walter's report. Finally he stood, jacket falling perfectly into place. "I'm on my way."

The call ended with a sharp click.

Evelyn rushed forward like a frantic parent. "Tell me what's wrong with Isabella!"

Dominic turned under the harsh lighting, his tailored suit making him look every inch the dangerous aristocrat. "Weren't you in a hurry to sell those products?"

"The packaging is ruined..." Her voice trailed off as she glanced at the suitcase.

Truthfully, she just wanted to see Isabella with him.

She'd always cared for the twins, even when they were just her boss's children. Now knowing they were hers by blood made the worry unbearable.

Dominic moved to the sink, water cascading over his hands. "How will you explain the damaged merchandise to your employer?"

Evelyn remained silent. She couldn't afford to compensate the marked-up prices.

His reflection caught hers in the mirror as he applied soap. "Take my wallet. Settle your business quickly so we can collect Isabella together."

She froze.

"At this rate," Dominic warned, drying his hands, "you'll miss your chance to come."

Decision made, Evelyn approached. Her small hand dipped into his trouser pocket, deliberately ignoring the hard muscle beneath.

"Your wallet—"

"Suit jacket." He stood immobile, letting her retrieve it herself.

Damn.

Her touch reignited fires he'd barely banked.

Standing this close, Evelyn caught the lingering scent of their interrupted passion on his tailored jacket. The leather wallet still held his body heat from their earlier closeness.

"Use the card if the cash isn't enough." His gaze burned into her. "And don't waste time chatting with other men."

She nodded, clutching the wallet.

As she turned to leave, their eyes met again.

"The PIN is the twins' birthday," he said before she could ask.

Evelyn's breath hitched.

Counting inventory in the hallway, she tallied the compensation amount with shaking hands.

Back in the private lounge, curiosity won out. Someone sent the man who'd given Evelyn water to investigate.

The divider slid back revealing telltale signs - the damp sink, the displaced coffee table clearly knocked during passionate movement, the wrinkled scarlet sofa leather.

"Could that angel-faced woman really be some kind of seductress?" The investigator couldn't believe Dominic Blackwood had finally broken his notorious celibacy.

Dominic lit a cigarette by the sofa, exhaling smoke with a frown. "Watch your tongue. She's my children's mother."

The room erupted.

Not IVF? Not a surrogate? The infamous twins were conceived the old-fashioned way?

The investigator wiped his face, realizing Dominic wasn't asexual - just impossibly loyal.

He'd been saving himself for the mother of his children all along.

The revelation sent waves through the group. All their concern for the "abstinent billionaire" now seemed laughable.

None of them had two children to show for their exploits.

The bitter truth? The supposed celibate had lost his virginity before any of them.

Cards slammed onto tables. Karaoke resumed at full volume.

Now that the mystery was solved, Dominic became fair game for their mockery.

"Clotheshorse beast!" someone jeered.

Dominic merely smiled around his cigarette, that self-satisfied glint in his eyes stoking their irritation further.

Meanwhile...

Evelyn's coworker, seeing her successful sales, hastily copied her natural look - removing makeup and tying her hair in a simple ponytail.

Apparently the wholesome image sold better.

Entering the transaction amount on the POS terminal made Evelyn wince. Even spending Dominic's money hurt at these inflated prices.
###Chapter 156

Dominic stood outside the nightclub, dialing Evelyn's number. "I'm at the entrance."

"You'll see me when I come out." Her voice was breathless. "Give me two minutes."

The call ended. Evelyn quickly changed clothes and rushed toward the exit.

A sleek black Range Rover dominated the prime parking spot in front of the club.

"Get in."

Dominic's large hand discreetly guided her waist while his other opened the car door. His fingers instinctively shielded her head as she entered, preventing any collision with the doorframe.

Evelyn buckled her seatbelt with trembling fingers, avoiding eye contact.

After finishing his cigarette, Dominic crushed it in the ashtray near the club entrance. His dark eyes narrowed against the night breeze before he slid into the driver's seat.

She bit her lip. Part of her wanted to urge him to hurry, to ask why he wasn't more concerned about Isabella's eye injury. But fear kept her silent.

The drive from downtown to Walter and Margaret's suburban villa would take ninety minutes without traffic.

Dominic focused on the road, his silence oppressive.

Evelyn didn't dare speak. The only sound was the hum of the engine.

At a red light near Third Ring Road, her phone shattered the quiet.

She fumbled for it. Harrison Wells' name flashed on the screen.

Her stomach dropped. This could only mean one thing - their inevitable breakup conversation.

She'd already endured his mother's cruel words earlier in the subway.

Evelyn rejected the call.

Thirty seconds later, it rang again.

Another rejection.

This pattern repeated four times before Dominic's deep voice cut through the tension. "Secret calls I shouldn't hear?"

The light turned green.

"Nothing concerning you." She finally answered. "Hello?"

"Finally." Harrison's voice held quiet accusation. "Did my mother contact you?"

"Yes." Evelyn stared at the passing streetlights. Happy couples strolled the sidewalks, their laughter floating through the night air. When had she last laughed like that?

"I'm sorry..." A long pause. "Whatever she said... I apologize."

Evelyn rested her forehead against the cool window. "No need." The words tasted bitter. She remembered Mrs. Wells' venomous accusations about her being a gold-digger.

"Evelyn, I believe you're a good person... But between us..." Harrison struggled. "Money doesn't come easy for me. I've been burned before. I have to protect myself."

Her lips twisted. So he agreed with his mother - just phrased it politely.

"I understand. Goodbye." No explanation would change their minds. Better to end this cleanly.

After hanging up, Evelyn closed her eyes. In the darkness behind her lids, she conjured images of Alexander and Isabella's smiling faces.

Life had taken much from her, but given her these two miracles. That was enough.

"Trouble?" Dominic's voice startled her. "Need my help?"

"No, thank you." She kept her tone polite yet distant. If she wanted to be near her children, she had to tolerate him.

The rest of the drive passed in silence. When they reached the villa, Dominic parked at the entrance.

He exited first, waiting as Evelyn unbuckled. When she moved to open her door, he circled the car to do it for her.

The domesticity of the moment - parents arriving to collect their children - sent an unexpected warmth through Dominic. He enjoyed playing this role more than he'd admit.

The doorbell echoed through the grand foyer.

Evelyn suddenly remembered and dug through her bag. "Almost forgot." She handed Dominic his wallet.

He took it, studying her profile. But her attention was already fixed on the villa door, desperate to see the twins.

Margaret, who took pride in managing household tasks personally, answered.

"Master Dominic." She used his childhood title, then froze upon seeing Evelyn. Though they'd met briefly in the subway, this sudden appearance clearly shocked her.

"Come in." Margaret recovered, though her gaze kept darting between them.

"Thank you." Evelyn hurried inside, heart pounding.

Margaret watched the scene unfold - the mother scooping up Isabella, the father gathering the children's belongings. The answer became clear.

If these two could reconcile and give those babies a complete family... Margaret smiled. Perhaps fate had finally shown them mercy.
###Chapter 157

Evelyn carried Isabella out.

Alexander rushed to the door, scooped up his sister's shoes, and dashed after them.

"Say goodbye to Grandpa Walter and Grandma Margaret." Dominic's deep voice resonated as he strode toward the sleek black Range Rover. He unlocked it with a click, tossing the backpacks inside.

"Goodbye Grandma Margaret, goodbye Grandpa Walter. Take care!"

Alexander sprinted back, wrapping his tiny arms around the elderly couple's necks and planting a kiss on each wrinkled cheek.

Evelyn turned gracefully, offering a polite nod. "Goodbye."

Margaret and Walter exchanged satisfied smiles, their eyes crinkling with warmth.

Dominic's large hand settled possessively on Evelyn's waist, guiding her toward the car. He opened the rear door, ushering her inside with the children.

Safety first—especially with kids. The backseat was non-negotiable.

He'd sooner cut off his own arm than let anything happen to his twins or Evelyn.

"Aunt Evie, why are you with Daddy?" Alexander blurted, buckling himself in with a puzzled frown.

Isabella stayed silent, her tiny lips pressed together. One eye was slightly swollen from the neighbor's kid's accidental hit. It didn't hurt much, but blinking stung.

The little girl buried her face in Evelyn's chest, her chubby arms clinging like ivy.

Evelyn kissed Isabella's forehead, then met Alexander's curious gaze. "I... ran into your dad. When I heard about Isabella's eye, we came together."

"Oh." Alexander nodded, but his mind whirred. Could Aunt Evie come home with them?

The car glided toward the city center.

Alexander fidgeted. He wanted to ask—badly—but Daddy's stern profile silenced him.

At a red light, Dominic caught his son's hesitant stare in the rearview mirror.

Father and son communicated in that wordless way they had. Dominic knew exactly what—or who—Alexander wanted.

The corner of Dominic's mouth twitched. He gave an almost imperceptible wink.

Encouraged, Alexander took the plunge. "Aunt Evie... could you stay with us tonight?" His voice wavered. "And leave... tomorrow?"

He held his breath. It was greedy, but he couldn't help it.

Aunt Evie smelled like sunshine and safety. Like mommies in storybooks.

Evelyn's cheeks flushed. Her gaze flicked to Dominic, whose hands tightened on the wheel.

Silence.

"Daddy... only works. He doesn't know how to fix Isabella's eye," Alexander mumbled, painting their single-dad life as tragically as possible.

Evelyn's heart ached. She'd birthed these children, yes—but the contract had been clear. Money exchanged, babies handed over, exit stage left.

Dominic had full custody. His house, his rules.

"Do you... need help?" she ventured, studying Dominic's rigid shoulders.

She wanted to stay. To cradle Isabella, to soothe the hurt she'd caused by leaving.

"If you're free," Dominic said tersely, eyes on the road, "we'd appreciate it."

Anger still simmered beneath his words—anger at her marriage to Maxwell. But he needed her. Needed her close, where he could see her.

"I'm free."

Evelyn buried her nose in Isabella's hair, inhaling the sweet, baby-shampoo scent. Happiness, sharp and sweet, flooded her veins.

Isabella dozed off, exhausted from the day's tears.

The Range Rover purred into the city center's underground parking.

Evelyn carried Isabella to the elevator, Alexander trailing like a duckling. Dominic followed, laden with backpacks.

"Your arms must be tired." He reached for Isabella. "Let me."

Evelyn recoiled instinctively. "No, I'm fine."

Dominic smirked at her possessiveness. He took Alexander's hand instead.

The lobby staff gaped at the quartet.

Is that the CEO's girlfriend?
They look like a family!
Wait, is she the stepmom?
Poor woman, taking on someone else's kids...

Isabella stirred, grumpy from her nap.

At the penthouse door, Dominic keyed in the code.

Alexander, ever the opportunist, whispered to his sister, "Aunt Evie's sleeping over!"

Before Isabella could react, Dominic cut in.

"Separate rooms," he said firmly, steering Evelyn inside. "No disturbing Aunt Evie."

Alexander's face fell. "But—"

"No buts."

The boy huffed, kicking off his shoes. Stupid grown-ups and their stupid rules.

Dominic pried Isabella from Evelyn's arms—only for the toddler to grab Evelyn's collar.

Buttons popped.

Evelyn's shirt gaped, revealing creamy skin and the swell of breasts Dominic had once explored in a dim club corner.

Heat flashed in his eyes.

"Let go," he ordered Isabella, peeling tiny fingers away.

Evelyn turned crimson, hastily refastening her shirt. She fled to the shoe rack, scrambling for slippers.

Dominic's gaze followed, dark with memory.
###Chapter 158

Evelyn slipped into her house slippers and gently took Isabella from Dominic's arms.

"Have you eaten yet? Are you hungry?" Evelyn fussed over the child like an overprotective new mother, terrified her baby might go hungry.

"I already ate dinner. I'm full," Isabella answered obediently.

The child's voice still carried that adorable babyish lilt, making Evelyn's lips curve into an involuntary smile.

Dominic stepped onto the balcony, lighting a cigarette. Through the glass doors, he watched the mother-daughter interaction unfolding in the living room.

Isabella's left eye was bandaged while her right eye sparkled with joy as she gazed up at Aunt Eve. The child's happiness was palpable.

Dominic observed them for a long moment, his expression growing increasingly unreadable.

In the living room.

"Should I... give you a bath?" Evelyn nuzzled Isabella's cheek, inhaling the sweet baby scent that confirmed this was truly her daughter.

Isabella nodded eagerly. "Yes! Then I'll smell like flowers!"

Evelyn carried the child toward the bathroom.

Alexander neatly packed his schoolbag and belongings. Standing dutifully by the bathroom door, he informed Evelyn, "Aunt Eve, the innermost knob controls the temperature. The baby shampoo is in the blue bottle..."

He repeated the instructions until Evelyn memorized everything.

As the shower's spray echoed against tile, Alexander added responsibly, "Aunt Eve, just call if you need anything. I'll be right here."

Evelyn carefully removed Isabella's clothing and socks, setting them aside.

Alexander's thoughtfulness warmed Evelyn's heart. Despite being raised in the privileged Blackwood household under that vile father's influence, the boy had grown into such a conscientious young man.

A true miracle.

"Got it... thank you, my sweet little gentleman," Evelyn called softly through the door, cupping Isabella's face affectionately.

Alexander leaned against the hallway wall outside, bashfully playing with his fingers after receiving praise.

Chirp, chirp, chirp...

Finishing his cigarette, Dominic returned from the balcony to an empty living room.

Approaching the bedroom, he heard shower sounds from the bathroom. His son stood guard at the door, staring shyly at his own hands.

The clueless father frowned. "What's that look? Stomachache?"

"I... Aunt Eve praised me..." Alexander stammered, his cheeks flushing crimson.

Dominic rolled his eyes at the boy's inexplicable behavior.

A vibrating phone sounded from the living room. Spotting Evelyn's purse on the sofa, Dominic glanced at the closed bathroom door before approaching.

He retrieved the buzzing phone. Seeing "Maxwell" on the caller ID, his expression darkened as he immediately declined the call.

With Isabella's injured eye needing protection from water, bath time required extra care.

Evelyn carefully directed the shower spray over the child's body.

Isabella had always envied other children playing in water with their mothers. Now with Aunt Eve here, she couldn't resist some mischief.

"Giggle!"

The child's laughter bubbled up.

"Hey! Behave—"

Evelyn's gentle scolding held nothing but affection.

After several minutes, the bathroom quieted as the shower turned off.

Freshly scrubbed and shampooed, Isabella smelled of baby soap. Evelyn gently patted her face dry with a soft towel, carefully avoiding the injured eye.

Wrapping the little princess's damp hair in a towel, Evelyn asked softly, "Does your eye hurt?"

Isabella remembered the doctor's warning about temporary discomfort, as long as she didn't rub it. Another treatment tomorrow would speed the healing.

"With you here, Aunt Eve, it doesn't hurt at all," the child lisped through her pink pout.

Emerging from the bathroom, Evelyn cherished feeling needed. She meticulously towel-dried Isabella's hair halfway.

At a dimly lit bar that evening...

Maxwell stalked from the main area to the back exit, emerging into a shadowy alley lined with doors.

This establishment had belonged to his company for years.

"Boss." A waiter nodded respectfully, eyeing the woman trailing his employer before quickly retreating.

Maxwell kept dialing Evelyn's number.

First, the automated voice said, "The person you are calling isn't answering."

Then it changed to, "The number you have dialed is unavailable."

The implications were clear—first ignored, then possibly blocked.

Maxwell's displeasure radiated from his stiff posture.

Sophia followed tearfully behind, desperate for any scrap of his attention.

Since her hospital discharge, she'd accepted reality. If she couldn't marry rich or bear children, she'd extract as much money as possible.

Halfway down the alley, Maxwell turned with contempt. "Why are you following me?"

Sophia pressed her lips together silently.

Frustrated by Evelyn's disappearance—his own wife failing to report her whereabouts—Maxwell seethed for retribution.

"Wait..." Sophia called as he turned away.

When Maxwell spun back, she played her last card. "I'm like this because of you. Have you no compassion?"

She didn't know if appealing to his nonexistent empathy would work, but she had nothing left.

As she spoke, she wrapped her arms around his waist.

Maxwell's money scattered across the pavement. Looking down at the clinging woman, he chuckled darkly before grabbing her throat and slamming her against the alley wall.

Sophia's forehead scraped against rough brick as his cruel hands tore at her gaudy dress.

"Still begging for it after that last rough ride killed your brat?" Maxwell mocked before taking her brutally against the wall.

"Ah! Nngh—"

Agony made Sophia's nails claw at brick as sweat beaded her forehead. The unbearable pain forced whimpers through clenched teeth.
###Chapter 159

Sophia felt like she was dying from the excruciating pain.

What was supposed to be a casual encounter turned violent when Maxwell acted like he'd taken performance enhancers.

"Stop... It hurts... Please..."

Regret flooded her as she thought this might be her last moments alive.

"Problem? Isn't this exactly what you asked for?" Maxwell showed no mercy, convinced this lying woman deserved every bit of punishment.

Her weak struggles and head shakes meant nothing. "I changed my mind... Please stop..."

The alley remained deserted. Bar staff had seen their boss enter with a woman and wisely kept their distance.

Sophia's body burned with searing pain, feeling torn apart. She collapsed onto the cold pavement, curling into a fetal position.

Scattered banknotes glared against the dirty ground.

Tear-stained and smeared makeup covered her face as she peeled broken nails from the wall. Trembling hands collected each bill methodically.

One hour later.

A taxi carried her home.

Keys jingled in her shaking hands when the door suddenly swung open.

"Where the hell were you?" Victoria's shrill voice pierced the night. "Pregnant and roaming streets at this hour? Trying to kill the Kensington heir? How will you explain this to them?"

Sophia stared at her resurrected mother with dead eyes. "Thought you were six feet under."

Victoria gasped before exploding. "You ungrateful brat! Is that any way to greet your mother? What gave you that idea?"

"No calls. No texts. Might as well be dead." Sophia dropped her purse, kicking off heels. "Make me noodles. I'm starving."

Victoria's eyes locked on the stilettos. "Are you insane? Wearing these while pregnant—"

"Lost it. Miscarriage. Probably sterile now." Sophia stripped in the bathroom, recounting every brutal detail between curses.

Victoria's shock morphed into devastation.

She knew her daughter's history too well—first abortion at fourteen.

"You slept around while carrying Nathan's child? Believed some rich playboy would wife you up? Now you're barren! Who'll support you forever? Me?"

Every movement sent fire through Sophia's thighs. She longed to pass out, to escape into oblivion.

Then she saw the blood.

"Mom... I'm bleeding..." Her voice trembled with terror.

"What now?!" Victoria threw open the bathroom door.

"Jesus Christ! What did you do?!"

Sophia sobbed out the alley horror story.

"He... He seemed decent. Wealthy. Handsome..."

Victoria's shaking fingers dialed 911.

After the call, she hurled her phone, screaming, "Men aren't worth dying over! Where's your self-respect?"

"Should I slit my wrists then?" Sophia sneered. "Pot calling kettle black! You screwed married men at the Sinclairs' and got beaten for it!"

Victoria froze—she hadn't known her daughter knew.

"At least my men are richer than your backwater losers!" Sophia unleashed months of pent-up rage.

Across town...

Alexander approached Evelyn after his shower, patting his sister's damp hair. "Bedtime. You've been good."

"Okay." Isabella behaved unusually well that evening.

The boy glanced up shyly. "Aunt Evelyn... You'll still be here tomorrow, right?"

Evelyn felt Dominic's intense gaze without looking. She longed to stay with the children—with his permission.

Otherwise, she'd have to sneak visits before elementary school started.

"Promise." She ruffled his hair.

"Night, Aunt Evelyn!" Alexander planted a kiss before scampering off.

Isabella clung to her like a koala, demanding to share a bed. Despite Dominic's presence, Evelyn agreed.

"The kid bed's too small," Dominic stated. "You'll use my room."

Evelyn nodded—Isabella's bed barely fit the child herself.

He handed her a shirt and sweatpants. "Change after showering."

"Thanks." Gratitude flooded her—for the clothes, for sharing the bed, for him sacrificing his comfort.

'His tall frame will be miserable in that tiny bed...' she thought.

Post-shower with semi-dry hair, Evelyn sorted laundry. Whites first, then darks.

The dryer hummed as she hung everything in the living room, hyperaware of Dominic's silent presence.

"I'll steam these tomorrow," she murmured, avoiding his gaze.

"Sleep now." His deep voice rumbled.

"Goodnight..." Her fingers lingered on his shirt before retreating.

Dominic watched her enter his room.

His oversized clothes draped her slender frame beautifully, pale neck peeking from the collar.

The door clicked shut.

Isabella fought sleep in the large bed, nuzzling Evelyn's chest. "You came back..."

Just as Evelyn cuddled her, the door opened.

Dominic entered in dark silk pajamas, his muscular silhouette outlined as he killed the lights. Without ceremony, he claimed the window-side of the bed.

Evelyn froze.
###Chapter 160

Isabella drifted off to sleep in a blissful haze, her tiny fingers clutching Evelyn's nightgown.

The little girl nuzzled deeper into her mother's embrace with a contented sigh. "You smell like flowers, Mommy," she murmured sleepily.

Across the expansive king-sized bed, Dominic lay motionless.

Only the soft glow of bedside lamps illuminated the opulent master bedroom, casting shadows across the lavish furnishings.

Evelyn gently stroked Isabella's silky hair, marveling at how quickly the child had settled. After years apart, she'd expected tears or tantrums at bedtime.

Instead, her daughter had simply curled against her like a contented kitten.

"Mommy, can I hold them?" Isabella's sleepy voice piped up, small hands already fumbling downward.

Evelyn understood the childish impulse - at five, Isabella still sought the comfort of a mother's touch.

But with Dominic mere feet away, heat crept up Evelyn's neck.

After a moment's hesitation, she guided the searching hands beneath her nightshirt. "Just for a little while, sweetheart. Tomorrow morning, I'll make your favorite pancakes."

Isabella sighed happily, snuggling closer like a baby koala clinging to its mother. Within minutes, her breathing evened out into sleep.

Dominic, who had been staring at the ceiling, turned his head slightly.

Evelyn remained perfectly still, terrified of disturbing the sleeping child. Eventually, exhaustion claimed her too.

Even in sleep, her arms maintained a protective circle around Isabella.

Sometime before dawn, Evelyn half-woke to the sensation of small hands being gently extracted from her nightshirt. The sheets felt damp where tiny palms had rested.

Still half-asleep, she reached out blindly for her daughter.

Her hands met only cool silk.

Evelyn's eyes flew open.

She sat bolt upright, heart pounding as she scanned the empty bed. The indent of a small body remained on the mattress, but Isabella was gone.

Evelyn scrambled from bed, bare feet hitting the plush carpet as she rushed toward the door.

She collided with Dominic just as he exited the nursery.

"Why did you take her?" Evelyn demanded, voice still thick with sleep.

Morning light revealed Dominic's disheveled appearance - his robe hung open, revealing a slice of toned chest. Evelyn became acutely aware of her own state: wrinkled men's shirt hanging off one shoulder, hair in wild disarray.

"You were crushing her," Dominic said matter-of-factly, brushing past her into the bedroom.

Evelyn's mouth fell open. "That's impossible! My boarding school roommate said I slept like a statue. Even my grandfather—"

Dominic silenced her with a searing kiss.

Evelyn rose instinctively on tiptoe before reality crashed back. She shoved against his chest with both hands. "Stop—"

But Dominic cradled her face, fingers tangling in her sleep-mussed hair as he deepened the kiss. The scent of her shampoo - something floral and expensive - filled his senses.

"Please don't," Evelyn gasped when he finally released her mouth.

Her protest died as Dominic's lips trailed down her throat, his hands making quick work of her shirt buttons. The garment slid from her shoulders as he unhooked her bra with practiced ease.

When his mouth closed over her breast, Evelyn arched against him with a strangled cry.

Dominic lifted her effortlessly onto the bed, stripping away the borrowed pajama pants with one swift motion.

"Dominic, the children will hear—" Evelyn's protest dissolved into a moan as his hands roamed her body.

The bed creaked alarmingly as Dominic shrugged out of his robe, revealing he'd worn nothing beneath.

Evelyn's eyes widened. "You—"

Her indignant remark turned into a gasp as Dominic's hands gripped her waist. The headboard knocked against the wall with each movement.

A small knock sounded at the door.

"Daddy? Evelyn?" Alexander's sleepy voice called. "What's that noise?"

Evelyn yanked the duvet up to her chin as the door creaked open. Dominic moved to block their visitor's view.

"I... saw a mouse," Evelyn panted, face flaming.

"A mouse?" Alexander rubbed his eyes. "Like in Tom and Jerry?"

Dominic tightened the belt of his robe. "Go back to bed, Alexander."

"But if there's a mouse, can we keep it? I've always wanted a pet hamster!"

"This mouse," Dominic said sternly, steering his son toward the door, "wants to play with Evelyn."

Alexander's protests faded as Dominic deposited him back in his room.

Alone again, Evelyn trembled beneath the covers - though not from cold. The memory of Dominic's "mouse" made heat pool low in her belly.
###Chapter 161

Dominic was heading back to his bedroom when he spotted Evelyn stepping out with a blanket and pillow clutched to her chest.

Their eyes met for a brief second before Evelyn quickly averted her gaze, fingers tightening around the fabric.

Dominic's brow furrowed as he studied her in silence.

"I'll take the couch," Evelyn murmured after a tense moment.

She moved to brush past him, but Dominic snatched the bedding from her arms before she could.

Evelyn blinked up at him in surprise.

Without a word, Dominic turned on his heel. The dark silk of his robe clung to his broad shoulders as he strode away, his posture rigid with irritation. He carelessly tossed the pillow onto the sofa before yanking the blanket into place with rough movements.

Evelyn's fingers twitched at her sides. The haphazard arrangement made her skin crawl - she had to physically restrain herself from fixing it.

Instead, she turned toward Isabella's room.

The nursery door creaked softly as Evelyn pushed it open, allowing just enough light to filter in without disturbing the sleeping child.

Seeing Isabella's peaceful expression, Evelyn exhaled in relief. She gently tucked the little girl's arm back under the covers before quietly retreating.

Next, she checked on Alexander.

Her son slept sprawled across his bed in stark contrast to his sister's neat posture. Evelyn pressed a feather-light kiss to his forehead, marveling at how his sleeping position mirrored Dominic's in the other room.

The resemblance was uncanny. Genetics truly were remarkable.
###Chapter 162

Evelyn slept deeply through the night.

She was the first to wake at dawn.

Though the penthouse sat in the heart of the city's busiest district, its soundproof windows kept all urban chaos at bay.

Morning light filtered through the curtains in perfect silence.

She checked on the twins first. Isabella slept peacefully with her thumb in her mouth.

Alexander had kicked off his blanket but remained fast asleep. Evelyn tucked him back in gently.

Dominic hadn't fared as well on the living room sofa. His blanket lay crumpled on the floor.

Feeling somewhat responsible for displacing him from his bed, she decided to return the favor.

She approached quietly, retrieving the fallen blanket.

Dominic's brow remained furrowed even in sleep, his chiseled features tense.

Covering a man of his stature proved more challenging than tucking in a child.

As she adjusted the blanket over his lower body, her gaze inadvertently caught on his exposed thighs - powerfully built yet surprisingly smooth.

Heat rushed to her cheeks.

After completing her morning rounds, Evelyn sought refuge in the bathroom to compose herself.

Though most would sleep in, her internal clock never failed her.

Moving silently, she changed into her freshly laundered clothes from last night.

The stillness amplified every memory.

Particularly when Dominic had removed her blouse, buried his face where Isabella had slept, and...

His scorching breath.

Those demanding lips.

That ragged voice.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

The sudden rapping shattered her reverie.
###Chapter 163

"Who's there?" Evelyn's pulse spiked as she jolted from her daydream. Heat flooded her cheeks at being caught mid-fantasy.

She swung the bathroom door open to find Dominic waiting outside.

Evelyn stepped back hastily. "I'll let you use it first."

Dominic strode past her without meeting her eyes. "Steam my dress shirt and pick out trousers. Thanks." His deep voice carried an unfamiliar politeness.

"Got it." She nodded, shutting the door behind him. His sudden courtesy felt unnatural.

The crisp white shirt hung in the living room. Evelyn located the steamer, studied its functions, and began pressing the fabric with practiced ease.

Next came selecting trousers from his walk-in closet - a space larger than her entire apartment. Rows upon rows of perfectly pressed slacks lined the custom shelving.

She chose light gray ones to complement the white shirt. Dominic had that runway model physique - broad shoulders tapering to a narrow waist, legs that made even basic trousers look designer.

The twins still slept soundly.

By the time Dominic emerged from his shower, Evelyn had breakfast prepped. "Food's ready," she announced awkwardly. The domestic phrase felt foreign when directed at him.

Dominic scooped up Isabella, his expression unreadable. "Start without me. Need to fasten my belt."

"Ask Mommy to do it..." Isabella's whisper cut through the quiet apartment.

Alexander piped up, "Teacher said mommies help daddies with ties and belts!" He scampered to the closet, returning with a leather belt thrust toward Evelyn.

Her fingers burned where they touched the supple leather. Under the twins' expectant gazes, she approached Dominic, keeping her eyes lowered like a dutiful wife.

She threaded the belt through each loop with trembling hands, hyperaware of his proximity.

"Problem?" Dominic's low voice rumbled above her. She could feel his gaze tracing the flush creeping up her neck.

Being this close to him while the children watched sent unfamiliar heat pooling in her stomach. The domestic charade was becoming dangerously real.
###Chapter 164

"I...I don't know how to..."

Evelyn's fingers trembled as they fumbled with the belt buckle.

She tried to examine the metal mechanism carefully, but...

Facing Dominic's bare torso made her recall the intimidating bulge beneath his silk pajamas last night. Heat flooded her cheeks until she thought her face might combust.

Her parched lips managed to whisper "I don't know" before she gave up entirely.

She fled to the kitchen.

Pressing her back against the cool tiles, Evelyn willed her flaming cheeks to cool.

She was furious with herself. After all this time, why did Dominic's physique still affect her this way? His chiseled features shouldn't make her pulse race anymore. She must be under some spell.

Dominic fastened his belt himself, oddly pleased by her reaction.

Had Evelyn never helped another man with his belt before? Perhaps he was the only one.

He followed her into the kitchen, standing directly before her.

Evelyn dared only a fleeting glance at his strong brow before dropping her gaze again.

Dominic wasn't sure how shy women operated. Were they like men - bold at night but reserved by day? He certainly tempered his own intensity in daylight.

"I apologize for last night," he said frankly, his voice deep and velvety. "I mistook your staying as an invitation."

The rich timbre of his words made her ears burn.

At twenty-four, Evelyn was still young. Among her peers from good families, girls her age were still pampered like princesses.

During university breaks, she'd browsed forums where they claimed certain male voices could make women weak. Dominic's definitely qualified.

As for last night's misunderstanding, Evelyn needed to clarify. She lifted her chin. "That was my fault for giving you the wrong impression. Me staying over wasn't...wasn't an invitation."

She'd chosen his bed assuming he'd take Isabella's smaller one.

The clatter of spoons echoed from the dining room where the twins had started breakfast.

"I understand. Let's eat first." Dominic arched a brow at her serious expression before guiding her out.

At the table, toast and coffee waited at Dominic's place beside a folded newspaper.

"Aunt Eve, my shoes are broken..." Isabella peered up with one bandaged eye, looking pitiful yet comical.

Alexander declared, "Ask Aunt Eve to buy you new ones! Daddy's too busy with work."

Evelyn nodded. "Of course I'll take you shopping."

Alexander happily stacked three bread slices together, munching as he explained Daddy's hectic schedule.

Last time they'd needed shoes, Great-grandpa had chosen dreadful bark-colored ones fit for soldiers! When Grandma took them, she'd often lose them while on calls. Eventually, it fell to nannies and drivers.

Other kids got to shop with both parents.

Evelyn's heart ached listening to them. She glanced at the silent man across the table.

Was this how he'd parented for five years?

Frankly, it was negligent.

Then she remembered - Dominic had only wanted children to please his family. They were bargaining chips in his power plays. No wonder he lacked paternal warmth.

At the table's end, Dominic sipped coffee while skimming his newspaper, listening to their conversation. Suddenly he stood. "After shopping, we'll watch this movie."

He pointed to a theater advertisement before leaving.

"Yes! I've been wanting to see this!" Alexander vibrated with excitement.

Evelyn meant to refuse, but Alexander's eager face changed her mind.

After breakfast cleanup, Evelyn called Abigail from the bedroom. "I need to request leave again..."

Though she worked nights to compensate, missing daytime meetings wasn't ideal. But with Isabella's injury, she couldn't trust their incompetent father.

"The department head questioned why the boss tolerates your absences," Abigail said. "He even shelved the project temporarily until the site visit."

Meaning Evelyn had no urgent work anyway.

They departed soon after.

With customized child seats occupying the back, Evelyn had no choice but to ride shotgun.

Isabella desperately needed replacement shoes after the neighbor's child damaged hers.

Dominic drove to a nearby mall.

Parking underground, he carried Isabella while Evelyn held Alexander's hand entering the shopping center.

Alexander knew exactly where to go.

A sweet-voiced salesgirl greeted them. "Would the little princess like matching family shoes? We just got new styles in!"
###Chapter 165

The matching sneakers gleamed under the store lights as Isabella tugged at Evelyn's sleeve. "What are family shoes?" she asked the sales associate with wide, curious eyes.

"Let me show you, sweetheart." The young woman returned moments later with four pristine white shoeboxes.

She arranged the identical sneakers on the floor—one pair for Dominic, one for Evelyn, and two smaller versions for Alexander and Isabella. "See? The whole family matches. Isn't that special?"

Isabella's face lit up. She turned to Evelyn and whispered, "One for Daddy, one for you, one for me, and one for Alexander."

Alexander studied the wall advertisement featuring a celebrity family in matching outfits. "If we wear these, everyone will know we belong together, right?"

Evelyn's fingers pressed against her temple. The shoes were this season's flagship product, plastered on every display. A single pair cost more than her weekly groceries.

More importantly, she wasn't legally their mother yet.

The sales associate kept pushing. She'd recognized Dominic's expensive watch and tailored suit. Children's whims were golden tickets to wealthy parents' wallets.

Evelyn opened her mouth to clarify she wasn't their mother, but the words dissolved on her tongue. Biologically, these were her children. That truth was unchangeable.

Isabella nudged Alexander. "You ask Daddy. He never says no when you use your sad voice."

Dominic lounged on a leather sofa, flipping through a financial magazine. He looked up when Isabella barreled into him, confiscating his reading material with sticky fingers.

"Done shopping?" He lifted her effortlessly, ignoring the sales staff's lingering stares. The way this stern man cradled his daughter made the associate double-take. His sharp features looked eerily familiar—hadn't she just seen that face on Forbes?

"Daddy, can we get the family shoes?" Isabella buried her face in his shoulder preemptively.

The associate launched into her pitch. Dominic's gaze flicked to Evelyn, who shook her head almost imperceptibly.

Twenty minutes later, four shopping bags landed in the trunk. When Dominic turned, the sight punched him in the chest—Evelyn, Alexander, and Isabella, all wearing identical white sneakers.

A smirk tugged at his lips. To any passerby, they were unmistakably his family. He hadn't worn sneakers since college, always opting for polished leather in the boardroom. Yet here he was, matching them stride for stride.

At 10 AM, Sebastian texted the aquarium tickets. With hours until the 2:40 PM showtime, Alexander tugged Evelyn toward the parking lot. "Can we go to the playground first?"

The pleading looks from both children forced Evelyn to approach Dominic. "They want to play before lunch."

His brow furrowed. "Why do you look like someone stole your favorite pen?"

She gestured to their shoes. "If paparazzi see us like this, the tabloids will have a field day."

Last week's headlines still haunted her—billionaire bachelor spotted with mystery children. Every socialite in the city was now vying to become their stepmother.

Dominic's expression darkened. "Which part bothers you more? Being labeled my mistress, or having the world know you're their birth mother?"

Evelyn hesitated.

He lit a cigarette, exhaling sharply. "Or is it your husband seeing these pictures?"

Jealousy laced his words, that familiar blend of desire and irritation she always provoked.

"That's not—"

"Good." He cut her off, tapping ash away. "Keep those shoes on. Take them off, and you lose visitation rights."

Evelyn gaped.

After the playground, she slipped away to the hospital.

Meanwhile, twenty minutes across town, Maxwell Lockwood's phone buzzed. His mother's cheerful voice chirped, "Remember you promised family time? I bought three aquarium tickets for 2:40. Your father and I are waiting."

The recent argument with his father still hung between them. This was clearly his mother's peace offering.
###Chapter 166

Dominic didn't refuse his mother.

He genuinely needed this chance to mend things with his father.

Compared to his dad, Dominic believed he should be the one to compromise.

The truth was, his father never stayed angry at him for long. Every outburst was just surface-level—within minutes, he'd soften.

His promise to take his parents to a movie or play dated back over five years.

To prison.

Whenever his parents visited, guards would escort him out in handcuffs and prison garb.

Sitting across from them, Dominic saw how much they'd aged. His throat tightened. Words failed him.

He'd never been one for long conversations with them.

That day, his mother's sobs echoed through the thick glass. "Son, don't lose hope in there... When you get out, just be better. Don't break the law again. Your father and I still love you. After your release, listen to us—settle down, start a family. We'll be together again, live peacefully..."

Her words blurred between tears, but one thing stuck: "If you ever want to make it up to us, just take us to a movie or play. That's all we ask."

Back then, Dominic had sat motionless, numb. Yet it stunned him—their expectations were so simple.

Being a good son was that easy. Just a movie. A play.

And in twenty years before prison, he'd never done it.

Now, driving freely down the street, his mother's call brought it all back.

Three tickets to a play.

Five years later, it was time to keep his promise.

At the hospital, Evelyn didn’t let Dominic and the twins enter Grandpa’s room.

She’d already told Grandpa they weren’t a match. Showing up together now would raise questions.

After lunch, she excused herself, grabbing the laptop she’d left at the hospital yesterday.

Just in case Abigail needed her.

Grandpa waved her off, signaling she should go.

Outside, the black Range Rover waited.

As she approached, Dominic appeared—cigarette in hand—and took her laptop. He opened the car door for her.

"What’s for lunch?" he asked before she could thank him.

Evelyn glanced back. "Let Alexander and Isabella decide."

Dominic nodded, playing the dutiful husband.

The kids would choose.

While he drove, Evelyn scrolled through high-end restaurants on her phone, letting the twins pick from the backseat.

Alexander set down his game console, studying the options with his sister. Isabella blinked sleepily, her dark lashes fluttering.

"Decided yet?" Evelyn turned to ask.

Alexander frowned at the screen. "Not yet."

"Take your time." She had the whole day for them.

Then Olivia’s texts popped up:

1) Mom came to the office. Just sent her away. Thank God you weren’t here—she’d have dragged you into it. She never takes responsibility for anything.

2) She talked to a lawyer. Nathan might get over a year in prison. Sigh.

3) Weirdly, I’m not even upset. Just craving a burrito. Does that make me heartless, Ev? He needs this wake-up call.

The twins zeroed in on one word: burrito.

Alexander perked up. "Aunt Ev, what’s a burrito?"

Evelyn blinked. "A burrito?"

She checked her phone—none of the upscale places she’d picked would serve that.

Not with Dominic there.

Men like him didn’t do casual dining.

"Have you two... ever had one?" She already knew the answer.

"No," they chimed.

If they’d grown up with her instead, things would’ve been different.

The wealth gap was staggering.

Now they wanted burritos. But she had to ask Dominic.

She typed: Kids want burritos. Okay?

Sent.

Waited.

Dominic kept driving.

Two minutes passed.

"I think your phone buzzed," she hinted.

He hadn’t heard it but checked anyway.

A chuckle. His reply came fast:

Whatever you want.
###Chapter 167

Evelyn awkwardly stepped forward.

Not every taqueria served decent burritos. To play it safe, she directed Dominic to her old apartment complex.

After returning from abroad, Evelyn had lived there briefly. She knew every eatery in the neighborhood like the back of her hand.

The black Range Rover made a dramatic entrance, drawing curious stares from passersby.

The striking family unit - a distinguished father with perfect posture and his angelic twins - turned heads effortlessly.

Lunch rush had the tiny shop packed to capacity.

"Order number 23!" The owner bellowed.

A high schooler in uniform scrambled to the counter, exchanged his numbered token, and grabbed his foil-wrapped meal.

The shopkeeper's eyes sparkled when the gorgeous quartet entered.

Not because of the extra business, but their sheer magnetism. They looked like Hollywood royalty.

"Please, make yourselves comfortable! We'll find you a spot!" She shooed students from their table with surprising efficiency. "Could tables one and two consolidate? We've got VIPs here!"

The teenagers obliged instantly, clutching their lunches as they squeezed in elsewhere.

The owner wiped down the vacated table with extra care. "What'll you have?"

Evelyn glanced at Dominic, recalling his earlier deference to her choices. "Four burritos. Two original, two mild."

"We can handle spice..." Alexander and Isabella chimed in unison.

Evelyn hesitated, seeking confirmation from their father.

Dominic settled into his seat. "Alexander tolerates heat well, but Isabella's pediatrician advised against it."

Evelyn amended the order.

As the owner jotted it down, she leaned in conspiratorially. "You folks shooting a reality show or something?"

Evelyn shook her head. "I used to live around here. Your burritos are legendary."

The woman kept polishing the already-clean table, unconvinced. "Could've sworn you were undercover celebrities. You know that show where rich folks pretend to be normal? My shop could use that kind of exposure!"

Evelyn knew Dominic's aura was to blame. "We're really just regular people..."

Technically, Dominic wasn't a celebrity - he existed in a more exclusive stratosphere.

Fortunately, the lunch crowd consisted mostly of construction workers and locals who wouldn't recognize a billionaire if he bit them.

"Order up!" The owner delivered their meals.

The twins attacked their burritos with glee, their enjoyment palpable.

Evelyn's chest swelled with unexpected pride. Had her humble palate genes manifested in her children?

1:15 PM.

Dominic navigated the Range Rover through narrow streets.

His phone buzzed.

"Grandfather?" Dominic answered on speaker.

"Dominic, your great-aunt arrived with her medical team. You know her husband's condition? The man's barely coherent. She thinks seeing the twins might give him some peace before..." Reginald Blackwood's voice crackled.

Everyone in the car heard the request.

Evelyn stayed silent, respecting family matters.

"Does this mean we're missing the movie?" Isabella's lower lip trembled.

"We'll reschedule," Dominic decided firmly.

Forty minutes later, Sebastian collected the twins outside Dominic's office.

"Aren't you joining them?" Evelyn remained buckled in.

Exiting here would invite unwanted attention from Dominic's employees.

The engine purred to life. "I'm concerned he might recognize me as their father."

This white lie was for a dying man's comfort.

"Could you drop me a block away? I'll walk back."

Dominic ignored her, merging into traffic. "We need to discuss the children."

The car's atmosphere shifted dramatically without the twins' chatter. Tension thickened between them.

Evelyn would endure anything for this conversation, even forgetting her earlier escape plan.

The drive continued in heavy silence.

She waited for him to break it.

But Dominic remained unreadable as ever.

A movie theater seemed an odd venue for this discussion. Yet Evelyn pressed on. "Can I see them regularly?"

"Yes."

At the intersection, Dominic nodded while executing a perfect turn.

Evelyn exhaled. "Maybe... occasionally have them stay overnight?"

A reasonable request from their birth mother, yet she held her breath.

Dominic considered briefly before nodding again.

Evelyn's opinion of him softened considerably.

Theater parking lot.

Dominic's gaze locked onto a familiar Porsche Cayenne two spots over.

The license plate confirmed it belonged to Maxwell.

'Since when does Maxwell attend matinees alone?'

Knowing his cousin, he wouldn't be solo.

Evelyn had reservations about this movie date sans children. But Dominic's logic was sound - she could recount the film to the twins later.

Their seats weren't prime real estate. Sebastian had chosen discretion over prestige, avoiding potential business interruptions.

As they settled in, Evelyn focused on the stage.

Then a chillingly familiar voice cut through the darkness ahead.
###Chapter 168

Maxwell turned his head sharply towards the woman beside him. "Mother, the performance is starting. Let's maintain silence now."

His voice carried that signature icy detachment.

Whether addressing subordinates or family, Maxwell Lockwood never altered his frigid tone. That distinctive voice had etched itself into Evelyn's memory.

She remembered every syllable, every threat that man had ever uttered.

Seeing his profile in the dim theater lighting, Evelyn felt her good mood evaporate instantly.

"This is barely the introduction," Lorraine Lockwood protested in hushed tones. "Don't think I haven't noticed your pattern - sending escorts to whisk us away before we can finish speaking."

Maxwell offered no response.

The silence confirmed her suspicions.

Seizing the moment, Lorraine pressed on. "Your father and I were overjoyed about your marriage. Yet within days, Reginald Blackwood storms our doorstep accusing you of kidnapping his granddaughter-in-law! If this scandal spreads..."

Maxwell remained motionless, gaze fixed on the illuminated stage.

Frederick Lockwood chimed in. "We wanted you married, yes - but not like this. You've strained family relations irreparably."

"That Sinclair girl brings nothing to this union - no pedigree, no education," Lorraine interjected, playing her trump card. "Allison has practically adopted her as a daughter-in-law already."

Still, Maxwell didn't react.

As theater lights dimmed signaling the show's commencement, Lorraine grew desperate. "Allison's visited us repeatedly about this. She's devastated!"

Finally, Maxwell spoke. "What exactly did she say?"

Lorraine's whisper grew louder, nearly drowning out the emcee. "She's considered Evelyn her future daughter-in-law for years! This sudden marriage has shocked her. Since it's unconsummated, why not annul it?"

Evelyn sat frozen behind them. The darkened theater provided scant comfort.

As Maxwell's new wife, part of her hoped his parents might succeed where others failed. Yet she knew Allison's motives weren't pure.

Whatever awaited post-divorce, Evelyn resolved to uncover the truth herself.

In the VIP section, most eyes remained glued to the stage. Evelyn found herself unable to focus.

Maxwell appeared engrossed in the performance while his parents alternated between watching and glaring at their unyielding son.

'I need air.' Evelyn texted Dominic.

Seeing him read the message, she excused herself quietly.

The performance became unbearable torture. She'd wanted to memorize every detail for the twins, but Maxwell's proximity made concentration impossible.

When Evelyn didn't return, Dominic noticed Maxwell suddenly addressing his parents.

"She's pregnant."

Dominic's grip tightened on his armrest.

The Lockwoods' stunned expressions mirrored his own shock.

Maxwell had delivered this bombshell with terrifying calmness.

Evelyn returned during the performance's climax, careful to avoid detection. The atmosphere had shifted dramatically - Dominic's glacial stare unsettled her.

As curtains fell, lights flooded the theater.

The Lockwoods stood immediately, visibly shaken.

Evelyn waited, letting them exit first.

Lorraine turned abruptly. "Stop dawdling! This conversation isn't over!"

Her maternal patience had evaporated.

Maxwell rose with characteristic indifference, then followed his mother's furious gaze.

They'd occupied the third row. Only two figures remained in the fourth.

"Have you no shame?" Lorraine hissed.

Maxwell's frown deepened as he tracked her line of sight.
###Chapter 169

Maxwell stood waiting outside the theater.

Dominic emerged from the third row, stepping into the aisle. He positioned himself where he could clearly see the fourth row. His gaze lingered.

By then, nearly everyone had left the auditorium.

On stage, the crew was dismantling the set.

In the fourth row, a couple was locked in a passionate embrace. The man's hands wandered beneath the woman's shirt without restraint. One could only imagine what they did in private.

Eleanor Lockwood hadn't gotten a good look at them. She called out impatiently, "Let's go. Your father's waiting."

Maxwell's brow furrowed as he continued staring at the distant figures.

Then he noticed their matching sneakers. The tension in his shoulders eased as he finally followed his mother out.

Frederick Lockwood stood outside, visibly annoyed. "What kept you?"
"Some young couple couldn't keep their hands to themselves. The youth these days," Eleanor muttered, leading the way to the parking lot.

Their arranged driver was already waiting.

Frederick recognized him - the same man who'd worked with Maxwell five years ago at the bar.

"What's this about?" Frederick demanded.

Maxwell explained, "You two go ahead. I've got unfinished business since I postponed it for the movie. We'll talk more at dinner."

Eleanor quickly ushered her husband into the car, avoiding another argument.

Frederick remained silent.

Before entering, Eleanor turned. "If you say you'll be back for dinner, mean it. We need to discuss your situation with Evelyn."

Maxwell nodded. "I will."

As the car drove off, Maxwell turned to unlock his own vehicle. The familiar beep sounded just as he noticed a black Range Rover parked two spots away.

He froze.

Dominic drove an identical model.

Of course, many people owned the same car in this city.

But the license plate confirmed his suspicion.

His throat went dry as the truth hit him.

Last night's unanswered calls. The disconnected tone. He'd been blocked.

He'd known it since spotting the Range Rover.

All night outside Reginald Sinclair's hospital room. No sign of Evelyn.

The exhaustion. The cold water splashed on his face at dawn.

This wasn't like him. He didn't even like Evelyn.

Yet jealousy had consumed him completely.

Legally, she was still his wife. That meant something, even if she didn't care.

He'd waited outside the hospital all morning, certain she'd visit her grandfather. She never came.

Now this.

Maxwell stormed back into the theater.

That couple in the VIP section - their builds matched Dominic and Evelyn's. He hadn't seen their faces.

What were the odds they'd sit directly behind him and his parents?

The VIP hall stood empty now.

Maxwell recalled the scene vividly. A gut feeling lasted exactly ten seconds.

Why would Dominic wear matching sneakers? The man never dressed so casually.

Evelyn, at twenty-four, would. But Dominic?

Meanwhile, Evelyn walked alone toward the subway station.

She'd declined Dominic's offer to accompany her.

Their agreement stood - she could see the twins whenever she wanted, even have them stay weekends.

No need for further intimacy between them.

Before parting, Dominic had warned, "Leave now if you want to avoid him. Maxwell's suspicious nature might bring him back here."

The man spoke in riddles.

On the subway, Evelyn closed her eyes in frustration.

She'd planned her exit strategy when marrying Maxwell. Saving her grandfather came first, but she wouldn't sacrifice her entire future.

When the time came, she'd file for divorce without hesitation. A marriage certificate shouldn't be a life sentence.

Nearly home, Olivia's text arrived: "Are you there? No one's answering. Can't face my parents right now..."

Evelyn replied, "Almost there."

She found Olivia waiting outside her apartment.

Inside, Olivia's eyes immediately dropped to Evelyn's shoes.

"Oh my God! Six thousand four hundred—"

Evelyn set down her bag, swapping heels for slippers. "What is?"

"Those shoes! They're from the luxury family collection. The mother's pair retails for six thousand four hundred dollars."

Evelyn frowned. Six thousand for shoes? Her budget capped at three hundred.

The doorbell rang.

"Expecting someone? Your boss perhaps?" Olivia teased, already opening the door before Evelyn could stop her.

Maxwell stood in the doorway.

"Can I help you?" Olivia asked, eyeing the intimidating suited man.

His gaze locked onto Evelyn. "We need to talk."
###Chapter 170

Evelyn recognized the man at the door instantly - Maxwell Lockwood.

His presence here confirmed her suspicions. He'd been searching the theater, returning to the VIP lounge repeatedly, only to find her gone.

Now the furious man had come to confront her.

He'd witnessed his lawfully wedded wife with another man, yet failed to catch them in the act. The humiliation burned through him, despite their marriage being nothing more than a contractual arrangement.

In Evelyn's mind, visiting the father of her children didn't constitute infidelity. But to Maxwell, seeing Dominic kiss her was undeniable betrayal.

"Eve, is this your friend?" Olivia stood awkwardly in the doorway, sensing the tension between them.

Evelyn remained silent.

Olivia knew all of Evelyn's domestic friends and colleagues. This stranger didn't fit either category. The only explanation - someone from Evelyn's time abroad.

But the man's murderous expression suggested something far more complicated than friendship.

"Would...you like to come in?" Olivia offered.

Maxwell ignored her, his gaze locking onto the white women's sneakers by the door. The memory of that intimate scene in the VIP lounge flashed before his eyes.

"Come in. I have things to say to you too." Evelyn's voice was ice as she turned toward the kitchen for glasses.

She placed two glasses of water on the coffee table.

Olivia stepped aside as the tall, imposing man entered. Compared to Dominic's refined elegance, Maxwell carried a dangerous, almost feral energy.

His designer suit seemed like a wolf wearing sheep's clothing.

"Here are slippers." Olivia retrieved a pair from the cabinet.

Maxwell frowned at the size. "These belong to Eve's grandfather," Olivia explained. "They'll have to do."

At this revelation, Maxwell slipped them on without hesitation.

The living room tension grew unbearable.

Sensing they needed privacy, Olivia excused herself. "I'll be in my room. Call if you need anything."

Evelyn nodded gratefully. Without Olivia present, she'd never have let Maxwell inside. The man who treated marriage like property rights didn't deserve private conversation.

Had Olivia recognized him through the peephole, that door would have stayed shut all night.

Now alone, Maxwell didn't sit. He went straight for the shoe cabinet, retrieving the white sneakers.

"What are you doing?" Evelyn followed as he carried them to the kitchen.

Maxwell turned on the gas stove. As the flames grew, he tossed the shoes onto the fire.

Evelyn lunged for them, but his strength overpowered her. A button tore from his shirt as she struggled, but the shoes were already burning.

"Are you insane? Go check into a psychiatric hospital!" Evelyn shouted.

Olivia, who'd been eavesdropping, burst into the kitchen. She turned off the gas, horrified, then doused the ruined shoes with water.

The acrid smell of burned rubber filled the air as she opened windows.

Olivia stared at Maxwell in shock. What kind of deranged person burns shoes?

"I must have been out of my mind to think we could have a civilized conversation." Evelyn trembled with rage.

Maxwell advanced on her, face dark.

Olivia jumped between them. "This is illegal! You can't destroy six-thousand-dollar shoes! You owe Eve an apology and compensation!"

Maxwell ignored her, his cold amber eyes locked on Evelyn. "Fulfill your wifely duties. Or face the consequences."

"More threats? First you kidnapped my grandfather to force marriage. Now what? Demand sex? A child?" Evelyn refused to be controlled.

But Maxwell had prison-hardened ruthlessness. He operated outside the law, unafraid of consequences. Evelyn wished for that same fearlessness, but she had too many to protect - her father, grandfather, Alexander and Isabella.

Would this cycle never end?

Olivia, caught between them, suddenly remembered Abigail's drunken revelation about Evelyn's marriage. This monster had kidnapped Evelyn's grandfather?

"You hurt an old man? You disgusting—" Olivia began.

Maxwell calmly pulled out his phone, recording her outburst. "Repeat that."

"I'm not afraid of you!" Olivia obliged.

He pocketed the recording.

"This is between us," Evelyn said firmly. "I'll have my lawyer handle the divorce."

She knew Maxwell was shameless, but the depths of his depravity remained unknown.
###Chapter 171

"Until our divorce is finalized, you remain my wife. Any man who dares to pursue you will be labeled an adulterer and risk having his reputation utterly destroyed."

Maxwell delivered his chilling threat before storming out.

Evelyn slumped against the cold kitchen wall, watching Olivia bustle around the counter. "What the hell was that? That man's insane. What's his game? Forcing you into marriage, then acting like some possessive lunatic? I refuse to believe he actually has feelings for you. This makes no sense."

There was no doubt in Olivia's mind—those matching shoes had been worn by Evelyn and Dominic's children.

But how had that deranged man found out?

He knew. Otherwise, he wouldn't have shown up to issue that warning. Demanding some archaic standard of virtue, even burning the shoes by the stove like some twisted ritual.

Evelyn's lips parted slightly, her lashes trembling. "Prison changes people. Warps their minds. So nothing he does surprises me anymore. But you're right—he has zero interest in me. None of his past women resembled me in the slightest. There's only one explanation for this forced marriage."

"What?" Olivia pressed.

Evelyn scooped the charred remains of the shoes into a bag, ready to toss them out.

"He's Dominic's cousin."

Olivia's eyes widened. "Cousins? Then you—" As Evelyn's closest friend, she should've been sympathetic. But this level of drama was almost impressive.

"Some long-standing family feud, no doubt. Polite on the surface, but Maxwell's been competing with Dominic behind the scenes." Evelyn couldn't think of any other reason.

A grown man, no matter how twisted, wouldn't do something this drastic without motive.

Olivia shuddered. The tangled webs of wealthy families were beyond ordinary comprehension.

"So you're just collateral damage in their war," she sighed.

Evelyn nodded.

By 8:30 PM, Olivia started gathering her things. "I should head back."

"Aren't you staying?" Evelyn had assumed she'd spend the night.

Olivia shook her head. "Mom's been nagging nonstop, but with her heart condition... I should check in. They're probably asleep by now, but I'll rest easier under the same roof."

Evelyn understood. She didn't press further.

"Drive safe," she said, watching Olivia disappear into the night.

Alone in the empty apartment, Evelyn washed up and prepared for bed.

Then the doorbell rang.

Still in pajamas, she moved toward the door instinctively. Before she could check the peephole, a familiar voice cried out.

Isabella.

Evelyn flung the door open without hesitation.

Dominic stood there, one arm cradling a tearful Isabella, the other gripping a sulking Alexander.

"What happened?" Evelyn scooped her daughter into her arms while Dominic carried Alexander inside.

"Bad Miss Evelyn!" Isabella buried her face in Evelyn's freshly showered scent, sobbing dramatically.

"Shh, sweetheart. Crying will make your eyes worse."

Evelyn shot Dominic a questioning look as she comforted her daughter, her movements tender yet unpracticed, like a new mother all over again.

"Alexander got dirt on Isabella's new shoes," Dominic explained before heading to the bathroom.

Evelyn said nothing as the man navigated her home with unsettling familiarity.

Alexander pouted. "It was just a little dirt! I even wiped it clean!"

"Mean big brother!" Isabella wailed.

A flush sounded, and Dominic emerged moments later.

It took Evelyn considerable effort to calm Isabella down. She removed the gauze from her daughter's eyes, checking the healing progress. Following the doctor's instructions, she dabbed away tears, sterilized the area, and reapplied fresh gauze.

"Miss Evelyn, can I have water?" Alexander asked, throat dry from apologizing.

"Of course." She finished with Isabella and moved to the kitchen.

The water she'd boiled earlier had cooled to the perfect temperature. She poured two glasses.

Isabella slid off the sofa, wandering around the room.

Evelyn handed one glass to Alexander, who gulped it down. The other, she offered to Dominic, seated on the couch.

"I wanna sleep with you, Miss Evelyn!" Isabella suddenly hugged Evelyn's leg from behind.

Caught off-balance, Evelyn's grip loosened. Before Dominic could take the glass, water splashed directly onto his lap.

"I'm sorry—" She scrambled for tissues.

Dominic glanced down at the damp stain between his legs, expression unreadable as he stood and strode back to the bathroom.

Evelyn pushed aside her embarrassment, smoothing things over between the siblings. Soon, Alexander was back to his protective big-brother role, and Isabella forgot her shoe-related grievances.

The bathroom door remained shut. Evelyn knocked lightly.

It swung open to reveal Dominic under the dim light, frowning as he towel-dried his soaked trousers.

"I couldn't handle them tonight. Didn't have the energy to keep pacing, so I brought them to you." His tone was matter-of-fact as he explained his late-night visit.

"Thank you for bringing them." Gratitude warmed Evelyn's voice. Caring for her children, even in small moments, filled her with quiet joy.

Dominic studied his reflection silently.

Evelyn continued, "What about your pants? Should you call Sebastian to bring a change? You can't leave like this..."

"Sebastian isn't at my beck and call. He has a life—probably on a date." Dominic's voice was calm.

Evelyn flushed, realizing the intrusion.

"It's dark out. No one will notice if you leave like this," she suggested.

A dangerous glint entered Dominic's eyes as he tossed the towel aside.

Stepping closer, his breath warm against her cheek, his voice dropped to a low, steady murmur. "If paparazzi snap me outside your door at this hour, what headlines would run tomorrow? 'Dominic Blackwood caught leaving a woman's apartment with a wet crotch'? Or perhaps, 'Desperate man begs for pleasure, only to be rejected'?"
###Chapter 172

Evelyn felt utterly powerless.

If Dominic, that man who always commanded attention, stepped outside like this, the paparazzi would undoubtedly swarm him.

Those vultures lived to invade his privacy. They'd twist any photo into scandalous headlines.

But changing clothes wasn't an option either. Sebastian, his usually flawless assistant who never made mistakes, had chosen tonight of all nights to go on a date.

Evelyn understood breaking up a relationship was wrong. Sebastian wasn't young anymore - finding love again wouldn't be easy.

Yet what could she do now...

She checked the time, her lashes fluttering. "It's too late now. The stores are closing soon. Even if I rushed out to buy you pants, I wouldn't make it before they shut."

"So after all that, you're saying I have to stay the night and leave tomorrow?" Dominic's expression darkened as he spoke. Without waiting for a response, he strode out of the bathroom.

Evelyn stood frozen by the doorway, fingers gripping the frame.

She'd never suggested he stay over.

And that disgusted look on his face...

Was her apartment really that terrible?

"Miss Evelyn, where do I sleep?" Isabella rubbed her red-rimmed eye, clinging to Evelyn's leg.

Evelyn scooped up the drowsy child. "We'll share my bed tonight, okay?"

"Okay..." Isabella buried her face happily into Evelyn's neck.

Dominic stood smoking in the kitchen, the stove's blue flame flickering. Alexander lingered in the living room, uncertain where to sleep.

Clearly, Evelyn's bed only fit two.

If she slept with Isabella, that left... the other room for him?

He wanted to sleep near Miss Evelyn too.

At least he was brave. Used to sleeping alone, he wouldn't feel scared.

"Dad, you're still here?" Alexander tiptoed into the kitchen with his empty cup, surprised to find his father lingering.

Dominic turned, glowering at his son.

Did everyone want him gone?

Alexander froze under that stare. Filling his cup, he peeked up. "Do you want to stay too? Will you sleep on the couch or share with me?"

After bathing Isabella in the cramped bathroom with its temperamental shower, Evelyn helped her into an oversized T-shirt.

"Put this on so you don't catch cold." Summer's warmth was fading into autumn's chill.

Worried about the gauze on Isabella's forehead getting wet, Evelyn had skipped washing her hair.

"Let's tuck you in." Evelyn carried her to bed, kissing her forehead.

"Goodnight, Miss Evelyn!" Isabella smiled sleepily with one eye.

"Goodnight." Evelyn watched as the child obediently closed her eyes, clearly trying not to be a burden.

Alexander emerged from his shower shyly, covering himself with his clothes and a towel. Without a word to his father, he slipped into Grandpa Robert's old room.

The simple blanket smelled faintly of detergent. Not luxurious like home, but Alexander preferred it.

Once Isabella slept, Evelyn stepped out to find Dominic watching CNBC on her tiny TV.

Men and their dull news programs.

His sharp profile held her gaze - those striking features, that commanding presence. Even his hands fascinated her, recalling teenage fantasies of gentle touches.

Her shabby sofa somehow looked refined beneath him, though his frown suggested the small screen strained his eyes.

Evelyn ignored him, quietly checking on Alexander. He slept like an octopus, blanket kicked aside. Both children kept strict schedules, thanks to Blackwood upbringing.

Returning to the living room, she poured Dominic water. "It's late. You can use my grandfather's room after the news. I'm going to bed."

Their eyes met briefly. Had he just glanced at her stomach?

"Do you plan to have more children?" Dominic took the glass but didn't drink.

The question startled her. "Before, maybe. But first I'd need a man worth having children with."

"Found him yet?" Dominic stood, towering over her as he turned off the TV.

Evelyn shook her head. "I don't want more children." Her heart belonged to Isabella and Alexander now.
###Chapter 173

"Would you consider terminating it if you're expecting?" Dominic's piercing gaze locked onto her as he casually removed his wristwatch.

Evelyn sensed he might need rest soon.

Yet the absurdity of this conversation made her scoff. "Why would I deliberately get pregnant? Even if I were with someone, I'd insist on protection. So...the question of abortion wouldn't even arise."

With that, she retreated to her bedroom.

Dominic remained in the living room, his imposing presence overwhelming the modest space. Undoing his shirt buttons, he exhaled sharply watching her disappear behind the door.

Maxwell had manipulated her using her grandfather's safety to force their marriage. That much was clear.

His relatives had informed him days ago about Maxwell's sudden marriage.

The moment Maxwell brought Evelyn into that private hotel room, her grandfather's disappearance case was effectively solved.

Targeting her grandfather was Maxwell's only leverage.

Maxwell was paranoid by nature - meticulous in covering his tracks. But even the most careful criminals made mistakes.

After his prison release, Maxwell became even more cautious than in his twenties.

He'd kidnapped Evelyn's grandfather without leaving a single trace. A flawless crime.

The courts required concrete evidence to convict.

Evelyn stood no chance against Maxwell.

But Dominic would deliver justice for every wrong she'd suffered. He'd support her completely - if only she'd ask.

After a quick shower, Dominic turned off the lights, plunging the rented apartment into darkness. Even without curtains, no one could peer inside.

Wrapping a small towel around his waist, he went to the kitchen for a smoke.

Isabella's dinner had been oversalted because Dominic's great-aunt brought pickles to the hospital. The child, tasting them for the first time, had overindulged.

Now in bed, Isabella murmured sleepily, "Water...need water..."

Evelyn, still awake beside her, immediately rose to fetch water when she heard the request.

Opening the bedroom door, she found the living room dark - Dominic must be asleep.

As she moved toward the kitchen, troubling thoughts surfaced. When Isabella and Alexander stayed at Blackwood Manor, who attended to their nighttime needs?

Using her phone's light, Evelyn entered the kitchen and flipped the switch.

What she saw made her freeze.

The man stood completely exposed - sculpted muscles, broad shoulders, that tantalizing V-line leading downward...

Evelyn spun away, face burning. Her trembling hands nearly dropped the phone.

That uncensored image burned into her mind.

Terrifying!

Even having seen and felt his body before, the shock sent her fleeing back to her room, completely forgetting Isabella's water.

Luckily, the child had already fallen back asleep.

Dominic hadn't bothered with pajamas. The towel he'd wrapped around his waist after showering proved too small, so he'd discarded it.

After extinguishing his cigarette in the living room ashtray, he noticed his pants were still damp from the shower but put them on anyway - not wanting to scare her from leaving her room again.

Evelyn must have come for water. Why else visit the kitchen at this hour?

He decided to check if she needed anything.

Four trips to this tiny kitchen tonight, and now he spotted something peculiar - a shirt button in the corner.

Bending down, he picked it up.

Memories flooded back - his aunt's tearful breakdown five years ago. "He was doing so well," she'd wept. "Starting businesses, dating...he even brought home shirts saying his girlfriend designed them. I hoped marriage would settle him, but then...how could he commit such crimes..."

Dominic recalled those shirts with their distinctive buttons - creations of a famous female designer who'd orbited Maxwell.

This button on Evelyn's floor matched that designer's work exactly.

Jealousy breeds madness - narrowing perspectives, heightening paranoia.

Maxwell's theater taunts resurfaced in Dominic's mind as he examined the button, then noticed the missing parent-child shoes by the entryway.

In that moment, something primal awoke within him.

Back in bed, Evelyn tossed restlessly until her phone buzzed with an Instagram DM from Dominic: "Come out or I'm coming in."

What could he want at this hour?

She slipped out quietly, finding him by the shoe rack with a stormy expression.

"Where are the parent-child shoes I bought you?" he demanded, advancing with furrowed brows.

Evelyn recalled their destruction, guilt twisting her stomach. But revealing the truth might enrage him further.

Retreating, she stammered, "At the dry cleaners. My company requires heels tomorrow..."

"I'll wait for their return. Imagine Isabella and Alexander's reaction when they're gone. And explain this." Dominic held up the button while gripping her wrist tightly. "Found it on your kitchen floor."

Evelyn couldn't escape his iron grasp.

She studied the button blankly. Who did it belong to? Her father and grandfather wore only plain shirts with basic buttons.

What woman would memorize men's shirt buttons by examining their chests?

"I see now," Dominic said coldly. "Having the children visit while another man's here was a mistake." He tossed the button away and released her, heading for the door.

As he reached for the knob, Evelyn caught the hem of his shirt from behind.

Her delicate fingers clung like a kitten's paws refusing to let go.
###Chapter 174

Evelyn sensed Dominic turning toward her.

She kept her gaze lowered.

"Maxwell... Maxwell came by this afternoon. We had a disagreement over something trivial."

Her voice remained steady.

"The button probably fell off during our argument."

She refused to feel like a criminal under interrogation. She'd done nothing wrong.

Dominic's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "What did he do to you? Why were you fighting?"

"Just words. Nothing physical. Olivia was here too - she stepped between us."

Evelyn finally met his piercing gaze, trying to explain herself properly.

She wasn't sure why she felt compelled to justify everything to him. Maybe because he was the father of her children.

After her explanation, silence stretched between them.

Then his warm breath, laced with that intoxicating masculine scent, fanned across her face.

Before she could react, his lips captured hers.

The kiss started soft. Too soft. That gentleness made every nerve in her body awaken.

As their tongues tangled, the air between them grew thick with desire.

Dominic's large hand cradled her neck, feeling her rising temperature. His other arm wrapped around her waist.

Through her pajamas, his fingers teased the curve of her bottom.

Evelyn felt her control slipping. She struggled to maintain composure, fighting the overwhelming sensations.

When she finally gathered enough willpower to push him away, she realized he'd maneuvered them from the doorway to the living room sofa.

The cold breeze from the open window brought her back to reality.

"You're blushing harder than when we conceived Alexander and Isabella," Dominic rasped, his hand sliding beneath her pajama top.

Evelyn jerked back, gasping. Her face burned.

She tried to stop his wandering hands, but it was too late. He'd already captured her sensitive peaks.

"Stop. The children are here."

Her fingers gripped his muscular arms uselessly. The strength beneath her palms made her pulse race.

Dominic flicked her nipple casually with his thumb.

"No... don't..."

Her breath came in short gasps, lips swollen from his kisses. She clawed at his hands weakly as heat flooded her body.

Her involuntary moans seemed to electrify Dominic. She felt his growing hardness press against her.

His hand traveled lower, pulling her flush against him until not an inch separated them.

The friction between their bodies sent shockwaves through her. Evelyn felt herself melting.

His scorching lips returned to hers, the kiss deepening until it stole her breath.

His hands roamed her bare back as her pajama bottoms disappeared.

"You make me tremble... burn..." he growled in her ear.

Their ragged breaths mingled, the air between them charged.

Evelyn's mind fogged, but she clearly heard Dominic's filthy whispers between groans.

"No... ah... stop..." Her body betrayed her, responding against her will.

"Such a good girl... you love this," he murmured before sucking her earlobe.

Just as she was about to surrender completely, Isabella's cries pierced the haze.

"Aunt Evie! Aunt Evie!"

Reality crashed back. Evelyn couldn't find her pants. Her pajama top hung open, revealing love bites.

"Coming!" She straightened her clothes and rushed to the sobbing child.

Isabella's injured eye took priority.

Dominic pulled her back, his desire still evident. The hard length pressing against her made her gasp.

"I need to check Isabella. This isn't exactly... child-friendly activity," she stammered.

His dark chuckle told her those words would haunt her later.

Back in the bedroom, Isabella snuggled close. "Aunt Evie, you smell like Daddy..."

Evelyn's cheeks burned as she kissed the girl's forehead. "What does Daddy smell like?"

"Nice. But sometimes when he's mad, he smokes. I hate that smell."

That night, Evelyn woke repeatedly to ensure Isabella didn't scratch her injured eye.

Despite little sleep, she woke energized. She prepared an elaborate breakfast - fruits, toast, eggs.

Isabella, more temperamental since her injury, asked between bites, "Daddy, you told Great-grandpa you're going to a small town. Can we come?"

"No." Dominic's CEO demeanor returned. "Finish your remedial classes. Sebastian will take you to school."

The twins exchanged disappointed glances before lowering their heads.
###Chapter 175

Evelyn kept her head down as she ate breakfast, listening to the lively chatter between the grown-up and the twins. A part of her wanted to chime in - to describe how charming the countryside could be.

There were simple joys city children rarely experienced.

"Aunt Evie..." "Aunt Evie please..."

The pleading voices of Alexander and Isabella tugged at her heartstrings.

The clever twins knew their stubborn father would only listen to Aunt Evie. They needed her help convincing him.

Dominic's stern expression softened when his gaze landed on Evelyn. His tone shifted completely from the firm parental voice he'd used moments earlier. "Other children started school weeks ago. These two are already behind."

Evelyn's eyes widened. "Then you really should attend classes..."

The twins' faces fell instantly.

At eight sharp, Dominic called Blackwood Manor.

All school supplies and uniforms were prepared in advance.

Sebastian arrived promptly to collect everything.

The butler greeted him at the gates of the estate where the family was breakfasting.

From the hallway, Sebastian overheard Beatrice Lockwood's anxious voice.

"Father, I adore Evelyn, but think of the scandal! The Blackwoods can't afford this kind of publicity. My family might weather the storm, but your reputation—"

The elder Blackwood set down his spoon with deliberate calm. "Truth favors the bold. That Lockwood boy deserves every consequence coming his way."

Beatrice's porcelain skin flushed. "I'm a Blackwood now! Must you humiliate my entire family? Maxwell could lose everything!"

"Self-inflicted wounds," the patriarch retorted, accepting his cane from a maid. His rheumatism had been acting up with the changing seasons.

Margaret Lockwood descended the staircase in silk pajamas, smirking at her daughter-in-law's distress. "Typical Lockwood behavior. A mistress clawing her way to legitimacy suddenly thinks she owns the place—"

"Enough!" Beatrice slammed her palms on the table.

Margaret merely accepted a bowl of porridge from a maid. "Screaming won't change your roots, dear. Your family's always been trash beneath my shoes."

Sebastian and the butler entered discreetly, clearing their throats.

After a respectful nod to both women, Sebastian followed a maid upstairs for the children's belongings.

Meanwhile, Evelyn accompanied Dominic and the twins outside.

She planned to stop by her office first before handing the children to Sebastian.

Dominic's luxury sedan waited in the residential parking lot. After buckling in the pouting twins, he opened the passenger door for Evelyn.

Remembering last night's conversation, Evelyn hesitated. "Aren't you worried about paparazzi?"

She dreaded becoming tabloid fodder alongside him.

The inevitable backlash from his admirers would be brutal.

"I'll be more discreet next time." His hand at her waist gave a playful pinch - their private language.

Blushing, Evelyn quickly slid into her seat.

As they neared her workplace, she insisted on disembarking early - their agreed arrangement.

Dominic pulled over as promised.

"Be good at school, okay?" Evelyn leaned into the backseat to console the miserable twins.

Two dejected nods answered her. "Okay..."

"Such brave kids!" Stepping back onto the sidewalk, she waved with an encouraging smile.

As the car pulled away, Dominic's gaze lingered on her shrinking figure in the rearview mirror.

"Daddy, eyes on the road," Isabella chided with one eye open.

By nine, T Corporation buzzed with activity.

Evelyn stored a new marker in her desk drawer. Settling in, she wondered how the twins were adjusting to school.

Her morning passed in a blur of productivity.

At noon, her department head announced an unexpected assignment - Evelyn and select colleagues would accompany executives to an emerging township.

While others buzzed with excitement, Evelyn remained composed. She'd treat this like any other project.

Truthfully, she hesitated to leave the city, thinking of how the twins relied on her. When Dominic entrusted them to her care, she poured maternal affection into compensating for their absent mother.

She researched the township until lunch. With Abigail absent, Evelyn joined other colleagues in the cafeteria.

Loading her tray with pasta and vegetables, she was about to join the lively conversation when a distinguished stranger approached.

"Miss Sinclair?" The bespectacled man in a tailored suit extended a business card. "Victor Langley. Might we speak privately?"

Evelyn's breath caught.

Victor Langley - one of the most formidable attorneys in the country!

He sat with effortless elegance and cut straight to the point. "Per Mr. Blackwood's instructions, you must file for divorce immediately."
###Chapter 176

"Good heavens! Isn't that Victor Langley?"

A female intern nudged Evelyn's elbow while sipping her soup at the adjacent table.

She blinked rapidly, lifting her gaze in disbelief to confirm with her colleagues.

One colleague spun around and gasped. "It really is Victor Langley..."

The entire cafeteria buzzed with whispers about the celebrity lawyer's unexpected appearance.

At a nearby table, a starstruck woman discreetly snapped photos with her phone. "He was voted Sexiest Man in Glasses last year," she gushed. "Even more handsome in person."

The cafeteria hummed with subdued excitement.

Evelyn found Victor's legal explanations remarkably clear and insightful.

That fateful evening when Maxwell forced her into marriage at the subway station, she'd thought nothing could shock her anymore.

After all, she'd survived selling her body for her father's medical bills. What was one more indignity?

Sometimes Evelyn wondered if she'd committed atrocities in a past life to deserve such suffering.

But she'd endure. She always did.

The moment she'd signed that marriage certificate, Evelyn had resolved to file for divorce at dawn.

Yet her grandfather's illness kept delaying her plans.

Unbeknownst to her, Dominic had already secured the finest divorce attorney in the city.

Victor, surprisingly down-to-earth, joined Evelyn for lunch in the staff cafeteria while discussing her case between bites.

"How soon can I be free of him?" Evelyn pushed aside her untouched lemonade.

"The roasted vegetables here are excellent," Victor remarked casually. "No divorce is impossible in my experience, though the court requires due process."

He took a sip of water. "With no children or shared assets, this should be straightforward. An out-of-court settlement would save time."

Evelyn nodded in understanding.

After lunch, Victor called Dominic before leaving.

Out of courtesy, Evelyn escorted him to the elevator, standing diagonally across as it descended.

Victor chuckled into the phone. "What's this sudden philanthropy, Mr. Blackwood? Worried your employee can't afford my fees?"

The elevator stopped at the tenth floor.

Evelyn couldn't hear Dominic's response, but Victor's teasing reply made her cheeks burn. "Honestly, you're more invested in this divorce than the actual wife."

Perhaps she should have let Dominic take her grandfather that day.

The secure accommodation would have prevented Maxwell's kidnapping scheme.

Now Dominic was being accused of wife-stealing, albeit jokingly between friends.

Evelyn bid Victor farewell in the parking garage, her mind racing as the elevator doors closed behind him.

Back in the design department, Yvette's presence immediately soured the atmosphere.

Evelyn ignored her, focusing on work. The faster she finished, the sooner she could visit her father.

Yvette, who'd arrived with her mother after lunch, enjoyed privileges no junior intern deserved.

"I heard you lunched with Victor Langley," Yvette sneered, spinning in her chair. "You certainly know how to climb the social ladder."

Evelyn met her gaze evenly.

Before Yvette could continue, colleagues returned from lunch, including Abigail and Olivia chatting animatedly.

At three o'clock, Yvette's phone rang through the quiet office.

"Darling, what's wrong?" she cooed, affecting a sickeningly sweet tone.

The entire department froze.

"You beast!" Yvette giggled. "Such a gentleman in public, such a rogue in private. Don't worry, your employees won't laugh."

Olivia shot Evelyn an incredulous look.

Though Evelyn kept her head down, the subtle tension in her shoulders betrayed her discomfort.

"I swear you only want me for my youth!" Yvette pouted before dramatically ending the call.

Olivia rolled her eyes. Was their powerful CEO really just another man enslaved by a pretty face?

Yvette was only nineteen - all baby talk and calculated flirtation.

The entire office, Evelyn included, likely shared Olivia's disgusted realization.
###Chapter 177

The office was buzzing with activity as everyone prepared to leave at five sharp. Just then, an enormous bouquet of crimson roses arrived at the entrance.

"Excuse me, is Miss Seraphina Prescott here?"

"That's me. What is this about?" Seraphina adjusted her designer handbag and sauntered toward the delivery man.

"These are for you. The sender said he doesn't want you to stay angry and promises to marry you once you're legally of age." The delivery guy handed over the lavish arrangement.

Seraphina accepted the flowers, her expression darkening as she pulled out the enclosed card. Then, her face brightened. With a coy smile, she tossed the card into the nearest trash bin before exiting.

"Can you believe our ice-cold CEO sent flowers just to appease some girl?" One female colleague immediately fished the card from the trash.

A small crowd gathered, curiosity piqued.

Whatever was written on that card left the women gasping. "He actually has self-control? Those motivational quotes online weren't lying after all!"

A male colleague packing up his laptop snorted. "You ladies stay up all night sketching. No wonder your skin's ruined. How could you compare to a spoiled little princess like Seraphina? Of course Mr. Blackwood prefers a fresh-faced 19-year-old. It'd be weird if he didn't!"

Just then, Seraphina stormed back in.

The office fell silent.

"My card." She made a beeline for the trash, only to find it already in a coworker's hand.

She'd anticipated this.

If they'd read it aloud, then Evelyn must have heard everything. Perfect.

"Here. I figured you'd come back for it," the guilty colleague mumbled.

"Thanks." Seraphina sighed dramatically. "I shouldn't have thrown it away. Now he'll punish me tonight..."

The way she emphasized "punish" and "tonight" sent imaginations running wild.

As Seraphina turned to leave, Olivia piped up innocently, "Flowers from your lover? Why send them here? Are you two fighting so badly you're living apart?"

All eyes turned to the unfolding drama.

Seraphina's face twisted in anger, but Abigail cut in first. "Olivia, weren't you listening? Seraphina said she'll be punished for throwing the card away. This is just another form of romance."

"Punished? Why? Because her family isn't good enough? Does she have to kneel and kiss his feet like some servant?" Olivia widened her eyes. "What kind of twisted relationship is that? Sounds like something from medieval times!"

Seraphina's face burned scarlet.

"You're doing this on purpose!" she shrieked, hurling the roses at Olivia.

Abigail pulled Olivia aside just in time.

With rabbit-like innocence, Olivia added, "I'm so worried for you, Seraphina. First the card, now the flowers? Will he knock your teeth out tonight?"

The office erupted in stifled laughter.

Abigail decided enough was enough. She grabbed Evelyn and Olivia and made their exit.

Left alone, Seraphina redirected her fury toward Evelyn. "You pathetic gold-digger! Couldn't seduce my man, so you sent your friends to humiliate me? Look at yourself! I outclass you in every way!"

The remaining coworkers exchanged glances. Clearly, Seraphina lacked both class and intelligence.

Evelyn visited her father at the hospital before heading to see her grandfather.

En route, her phone buzzed.

Dominic had acted first—her grandfather was now safely relocated with proper care. The message invited her to join them if she wished.

Evelyn hesitated but ultimately felt relief. With Maxwell Lockwood lurking, this was safest. Her grandfather deserved peace in his twilight years.

She'd repay Dominic someday.

As she typed "thank you," another message arrived—a voice note. His deep, velvety voice filled the air around her.

"Send me your location. I'll pick you up. It's the kids' first day. They'll want both parents there."

How could she refuse?

She sent her coordinates and waited roadside.

Today marked her twins' school debut. Evelyn had longed to fetch them but feared drawing attention beside Dominic. Now he'd made it possible.

At the school gates, the children vetoed restaurant dining, insisting on "Mommy's cooking."

"But Mommy's tired after work," Dominic reasoned, though he secretly craved her homecooked meals too.

Evelyn knelt, wiping sugar from Isabella's lips. "It's fine. I want to cook for them."

What mother wouldn't? Her babies needed proper nutrition.

Dominic raised an eyebrow but acquiesced.

At the supermarket, Evelyn shopped alone—no need for a human billboard attracting middle-aged admirers. The last thing she needed was "trophy wife" rumors.

Back at her apartment, she handed out new slippers.

Watching Evelyn carry groceries into the kitchen, Dominic realized something: without her, this wouldn't feel like home.
###Chapter 178

Evelyn moved briskly around the compact kitchen.

The cheerful sounds of Alexander and Isabella playing in the living room reached her ears. Suddenly, Isabella's small yelp cut through the air, followed by silence.

Abandoning the vegetables, Evelyn hurried out. She knelt beside the little girl, gently pulling her hand away from her eye. "What happened, sweetheart?"

"I poked my eye by accident," Isabella sniffled, rubbing at the offended spot.

She'd made Aunt Evelyn worry!

"Does it hurt? Tell me if it does." Evelyn's voice softened as she leaned closer, her warm breath fluttering over the child's eyelid.

Isabella beamed instantly. "It doesn't hurt when you blow on it!"

Seeing the girl's genuine relief, Evelyn smiled and ruffled her hair. "Why don't you go do your homework with Alexander? Dinner will be ready soon."

The little girl nodded eagerly.

Alexander retrieved his schoolbag, fishing out pencils and workbooks with practiced ease. Soon both children were bent over their assignments at the small table.

Starved for maternal affection, the twins lived in constant fear of displeasing their beloved Aunt Evelyn. Their survival strategy was simple - be as obedient and endearing as possible.

Content with their diligence, Evelyn returned to her cooking.

Normally, kitchen chores brought her no joy. But preparing meals for Alexander and Isabella? That filled her with unexpected happiness.

"Need any help?" Dominic's deep voice rumbled behind her.

Barefoot after removing her heels, Evelyn's 5'4" frame seemed tiny compared to Dominic's imposing 6'2" stature. She started to refuse when his long fingers plucked the potato from her grasp.

Anyone who knew Dominic Blackwood would assume the eligible billionaire enjoyed a glamorous nightlife.

Socialites, heiresses, influencers - they'd all throw themselves at T Corporation's powerful CEO.

To accurately depict his evenings, one would imagine him surrounded by stunning women.

Otherwise, what would be the point?

Yet here he stood - the nation's top architect, head of T Corporation's design directors - peeling potatoes in a modest 60-square-foot rental kitchen.

Even Evelyn, far from being one of his starry-eyed admirers, couldn't hide her surprise.

"I should probably handle this," she said, watching him instead of continuing with the other vegetables. Seeing the mighty Dominic Blackwood performing such a mundane task felt... wrong.

"I'm bringing my whole family to eat at your place. Wouldn't want you complaining about my lack of help." His focus remained on the stubborn potato.

Perhaps the vegetable rebelled against its unskilled handler - it slipped suddenly, the peeler slicing Dominic's finger instead.

Evelyn's eyes widened. First aid kit or running water? She hesitated between the two options.

"Careful! I told you I'd do it." Frowning, she directed him to rinse the wound while she fetched the medical supplies.

The water washed away the initial blood, only for fresh crimson to well up immediately.

Evelyn applied antibiotic ointment with care before smoothing a bandage over the cut.

Dominic didn't flinch once. His gaze remained fixed on the petite woman fussing over him, her warm scolding washing over him like an unexpected comfort.

Only when she finished did Evelyn realize she'd been rambling. The air between them grew thick with unspoken tension.

"I should start cooking. The stove's old - the ventilation isn't great." She turned on the exhaust fan without looking back, her indirect dismissal clear.

Instead of leaving, Dominic lit a cigarette, his eyes tracing her movements as she cooked. He couldn't seem to look away.

The cramped kitchen forced them into close quarters. When Evelyn turned to grab spices from the mini-fridge, she found herself face-to-face with swirling smoke and Dominic's intense stare.

She quickly returned to stirring the vegetables. "It's too small in here. You should wait outside."

"The smoke might bother the children." Using their wellbeing as an excuse, he remained planted by the stove - the perfect smoking spot, apparently.

Evelyn bit back the retort on her tongue: Then stay in the kitchen forever.

Dinner was a lavish spread.

Carrying dishes to the table, Evelyn felt her cheeks burning. The kitchen's heat must have gotten to her.

The children sat between the adults at the small table - a stark contrast to the Crawfords' usual silent meals.

Tonight, no one spoke.

As they finished, Alexander set down his fork shyly. "Aunt Evelyn... can we stay here tonight?"

Evelyn's heart leapt. She wanted nothing more than to have them with her every night.

But their father's permission was required.

Dominic stood, regarding his children. "Behave. Don't trouble Aunt Evelyn."

"Yay! Thank you, Daddy!" Alexander jumped up excitedly. "Can you take us to buy new pajamas first?"

Evelyn mentally kicked herself. She'd remembered groceries and slippers, but pajamas had slipped her mind.

Perhaps Sebastian could bring some from Blackwood Manor in the morning.

As Dominic retrieved his suit jacket, he turned back with an apologetic look. "I have business tonight. You'll take them?"

After a pause, Evelyn nodded silently.

After dinner, she cleared the table quietly with the children's help. Though reluctant to let them assist, she didn't want to reject their kindness. Alexander carried spoons; Isabella took the forks.

Dominic lingered with his jacket, frowning at Evelyn's subdued mood. She'd been distracted since picking up the children after work, and his announcement about leaving seemed to upset her further.

Did she want him to stay?

He couldn't think of another excuse.

"Remember - no running around when you're out with Aunt Evelyn. Shower before bed. I'm leaving now." The twins blinked up at him before watching him go.

Dominic glanced back at the kitchen, where Evelyn stood washing dishes with her back to him.

Was this woman... angry with him?
###Chapter 179

Evelyn felt a wave of relief wash over her as Dominic walked out the door. But it wasn't complete.

The dishes clinked in the sink as she washed them. A heavy sigh escaped her lips. She couldn't pinpoint what was wrong with her.

When he mentioned having business tonight, Yvette's words from the office echoed in her mind.

Yvette had been right about one thing.

Men always craved younger women's bodies.

At twenty-four, Evelyn knew she wasn't old. But nineteen-year-old Yvette had youth on her side.

There was an undeniable difference between a woman who'd given birth and one who hadn't.

The internet was full of horror stories about terrible men and foolish women. One wrong thought could make her just like them.

A man like Dominic - wealthy, powerful, devastatingly handsome with an athlete's body - naturally attracted women like moths to a flame.

How could she expect his love confession to last forever?

Sebastian arrived at 7:40 PM sharp.

Evelyn had planned to take the subway with the twins, who always enjoyed the ride.

"Mr. Blackwood called. Insisted I get here before you left," Sebastian said, treating her with CEO-level respect.

But Evelyn remembered Dominic's words last night - how Sebastian had been on a date when called for clean pants. A man should prioritize his girlfriend.

Plus, it was his personal time.

"We'll take the subway. It's faster," Evelyn insisted, not wanting to cause relationship trouble. "Go enjoy your evening, Mr. Whitmore."

Sebastian smiled. "My life belongs to my boss. Please, Miss Sinclair, get in."

She refused again.

Everyone deserved personal time!

"Perhaps you've never taken the twins out alone," Sebastian cautioned. "One moment of distraction and children can..." He trailed off, unwilling to jinx the Blackwood heirs.

In the end, Evelyn and the children climbed into the Bentley.

All this for pajama shopping? Ridiculous.

Centercourt Mall stretched before them.

Evelyn hesitated over price tags. But for her precious twins, no cost was too high.

She'd missed five years of their lives. Now she had to relearn every detail.

Across town, Dominic buried himself in work. Since inheriting Blackwood Industries, he'd become a workaholic again.

Every minute counted.

His world narrowed to spreadsheets and contracts. Endless decisions piled up before dawn until he collapsed at night.

Before leaving town, he needed to complete ten days' worth of work.

Every second with Evelyn was precious. He wouldn't let business intrude.

At 9 PM, Sebastian returned to the office.

The city's glittering skyline reflected in floor-to-ceiling windows. His tireless boss shifted between documents and screens, an iron man who never rested.

The weight of empire pressed on his shoulders.

Evelyn tucked the children in.

In the kitchen, she checked the clock - nearly ten. Still no Dominic.

Leaning against the counter, water glass forgotten, she wondered: Had he left the children in her care permanently? Should she make plans accordingly?

An inexplicable sadness settled over her. His absence should bring relief. No more obstacles.

Then why this ache?

Was it for the children? They'd had a father's love but no mother. Now they had her but might lose him.

The thoughts gave her a headache. She went to bed.

The nightmare came swiftly. Alexander pointed at her. "Go away! We hate you! You drove Daddy to that horrible woman! Now he has a baby with Aunt Yvette and doesn't want us anymore!"

Evelyn jolted awake at 1 AM.

Moonlight revealed Isabella sleeping peacefully beside her. Sweat soaked Evelyn's face.

Three pairs of shoes by the door confirmed Dominic's absence. She'd given him a spare key yesterday.

Where was he?

With Yvette?

Memories surfaced - Dominic's pained expression when she denied him release. Had he sought satisfaction elsewhere?

The thought stole her breath.

She shook herself. "Evelyn, what's wrong with you?"

"You're not his wife. This isn't your business."

"You bore his children as a transaction. He lets you see them now. Why ask for more?"

"Dominic Blackwood is untouchable. Are you insane?"

She lay down, eventually drifting off.

The nightmare continued.

Isabella clung to Dominic's leg, glaring. "Daddy raised us five years. Where were you? He doesn't like you, so we don't either!"

"Don't go!" In the dream, Evelyn became a desperate woman watching another take her children. She grabbed Dominic's sleeve, weeping. "Take me instead. I'll give you everything. Just don't take them!"

A deep voice rasped in her ear: "I'm not leaving. I'm here."

Evelyn didn't know if she dreamed or woke.

Blinking through tears, morning light revealed Dominic's chiseled features inches away. As she lifted her head, her lips brushed his jaw.
###Chapter 180

Evelyn inhaled Dominic's crisp masculine scent. After several shaky breaths, she finally grounded herself back in reality.

"Bad dream?" Dominic's cool lips brushed against her forehead.

His large hand gently tucked her disheveled hair behind her ear. His gaze lingered on her pale complexion and tear-dampened lashes.

"I'm right here," he murmured. "Not going anywhere."

Relief flooded Evelyn's veins. That terrifying nightmare wasn't real.

The reality greeting her upon waking was infinitely better than the horror show her subconscious had conjured.

One hand clutched Dominic's solid waist while the other fisted his wrinkled dress shirt. His comforting words hovered on her tongue, but no sound emerged.

Silence blanketed the small bedroom.

After what felt like eternity, feeling returned to Evelyn's limbs. She slowly withdrew her hands from his body.

The shirt Dominic wore now bore the evidence of her distress in its creased fabric.

"Sorry," she whispered hoarsely. "I'll... I'll press it for you." Words failed her beyond this simple offer.

As she moved to rise, Dominic pulled her back against his chest. "Sleep," he commanded. "It's still early."

His warm breath fanned across her cheek, transforming the atmosphere between them into something unexpectedly intimate.

Perhaps it was the unseasonably warm weather. Or Dominic's radiating body heat. But the air around Evelyn grew cozy, lulling her back toward sleep.

Since turning eighteen, she'd rarely allowed herself the luxury of sleeping in.

Dominic's presence offered a security she couldn't deny. In these quiet moments, she sometimes wished she didn't have to let go.

She chalked it up to sleep-addled thinking. Just this once, she'd permit herself to cling to him.

Her fluttering lashes stilled. The frantic pace of her breathing gradually evened out.

This time, no nightmares disturbed her slumber.

The bedroom's queen-sized bed wasn't designed for two adults - especially not one with Dominic's towering frame. His long legs dangled awkwardly off the edge.

When sharing this bed with five-year-old Isabella, Evelyn barely moved, terrified of accidentally crushing the child.

Though exhausted, Dominic remained awake.

He'd worked in his office until 5 AM. The empty morning streets meant he'd reached the rented apartment by 5:30.

Using the spare key, he'd first checked on his son.

The boy slept soundly, one leg kicked free from the blankets, emitting soft snores.

After re-covering Alexander, Dominic had moved to Evelyn's room.

Isabella slept more neatly than her brother, barely shifting positions throughout the night.

He'd been about to leave when restless movements from the bed caught his attention. Evelyn thrashed beneath the sheets, face glistening with sweat, features twisted in distress.

Dominic approached, unsure what horrors plagued her dreams, and attempted to wake her.

Evelyn mumbled incoherently, trapped in her nightmare.

Eventually, Dominic lay beside her, drawing her into his arms. He kissed her forehead, hoping to provide comfort.

Then he clearly heard her plea: "Don't go. Please don't go."

Those five words made his jaw tighten.

Dreams reflected daytime thoughts.

Dominic burned to know who she begged so desperately not to leave her.

Motherless since childhood, Evelyn had never voiced her longing for maternal love. But Dominic knew that ache - saw it reflected in his own children.

Like Alexander and Isabella, who swallowed their childhood pains without complaint, never asking for their mother.

Yet their instant attachment to "Aunt Evelyn" proved how deeply they yearned for her.

Dominic preferred believing Evelyn dreamed of her absent mother rather than... someone else.

A worthless ex like Nathan didn't deserve her tears.

The police investigation had revealed Nathan traded Evelyn's intimate photos like business cards. Dominic wished the bastard would rot in prison forever.

Jealous thoughts swirled until Evelyn's sleep-slurred voice cut through: "Don't you want me? I'll give myself to you now. Just... don't take Alexander and Isabella away..."

Then he knew - he was the man in her nightmare.

Dominic held her tighter, employing soothing techniques usually reserved for his daughter. He let her clutch his shirt and waist, anchoring him in place.

Her warm fingers tracing his waist spoke of insecurity. Of desperate need.

Unfortunately, combined with his morning arousal, her touches only inflamed him further.

Dominic had never experienced such persistent... discomfort.

Once Evelyn slept peacefully again, he carefully tucked the blankets around her and slipped away to the bathroom.

Alexander woke needing to pee.

"Daddy, why're you up so early?" The boy asked mid-stream, pajama bottoms clutched in one hand.

Dominic dried his hands on Evelyn's freshly laundered towel.

Before he could answer, Alexander continued cheerfully: "Bring my school clothes later. And winter stuff too. It's almost fall."

Dominic muted the morning news. "Planning to live here permanently?"

"Obviously." Alexander blinked at his father's stern expression. "You're always busy. Now that Aunt Evelyn takes care of us, you can work. Just remember to pay tuition. She works hard - I don't want to burden her."

"Your great-grandfather will miss you," Dominic said quietly.

"Then he can visit. Or move in too!" The child's solution was beautifully simple.

Dominic's lips pressed into a thin line. Whether from the news or his son's words, he remained silent for a long moment.

Alexander retreated to his room.

The master bedroom, slightly larger than the others, remained Grandpa Robert's domain. Evelyn finally woke over an hour later.

Standing before the bathroom mirror, toothbrush dangling from her lips, Evelyn's thoughts churned chaotically. No solutions emerged from the mental fog.

The morning news had ended. With living room curtains drawn, the space remained dim. On the sofa, Dominic's tall frame had finally succumbed to sleep, forehead still creased with tension.
###Chapter 181

Evelyn snatched the only blanket in her apartment, unfolding it with quick movements before draping it over the man's broad shoulders.

As she adjusted the edges, her slender wrist was suddenly seized by an iron grip just as she started to pull away.

Her gaze lifted to meet Dominic's intense dark eyes. Those fathomless pools seemed to swallow her whole without warning.

Without preamble, he yanked her forward.

Evelyn barely had time to gasp before tumbling onto the floor before him. Her breath hitched as she found herself nose-to-nose with the imposing figure.

She swallowed hard, her body growing inexplicably warm under his smoldering stare. Every nerve ending tingled with awareness.

Dominic possessed the perfect aristocratic features - sharp double eyelids framing those penetrating eyes, strong brows accentuating his chiseled jawline. The combination exuded both refinement and raw masculinity.

Her gaze dropped to his sculpted lips, mere inches from her own. Their mingled breaths created an electric charge in the morning air. No woman could resist this magnetic pull.

Evelyn was drowning in the moment, her common sense evaporating like morning dew beneath the summer sun. She was falling... falling...

"Aunt Evie..." Isabella's sleepy voice shattered the spell. The little girl emerged rubbing her eyes, the gauze bandage slipping from her face as she stumbled into Evelyn's arms.

Evelyn steadied herself, cradling the child. "What's wrong, sweetheart? Bad dreams?"

"Can you and Daddy take me to school today? Please?" The plea in those innocent eyes tore at Evelyn's heart.

It was a simple request most children took for granted. But for Isabella and Alexander, this ordinary ritual represented everything they'd been denied.

Dominic rose from the sofa, his voice low. "They've wanted a mother for years. In every way that matters, they've been deprived compared to other children."

The unspoken implication hung between them. Not 'Aunt Evie' - but mother. Evelyn's throat tightened as she nodded her consent.

Breakfast became a study in contrasts. Evelyn had shaped the rice into adorable animal figures, decorating them with vibrant vegetables. Isabella giggled as she nibbled on a panda-shaped rice ball.

Dominic sat apart, methodically eating plain toast with strawberry jam, his breakfast conspicuously lacking the love poured into the children's meals.

"This is your last night here," Dominic announced abruptly. "Tomorrow you return to the manor."

The twins froze mid-bite, their disappointed expressions speaking volumes. Evelyn smoothed their hair before excusing herself to change.

When she returned, she found Dominic pretending to watch news reports, his disinterest palpable. The man's world seemed so... sterile. No wonder the children craved warmth.

Before leaving, Evelyn meticulously ironed Dominic's crisp white shirt. Her fingers lingered as she searched for nonexistent wrinkles - or perhaps evidence of another woman's presence.

Halfway through, she realized this wasn't the shirt he'd worn yesterday. He'd changed at some point during his mysterious absence.

The car ride passed in tense silence. Evelyn barely registered Isabella's chatter, her mind whirling with unanswered questions.

As usual, she exited the car blocks from the office. Dominic allowed the charade, though his tightened jaw betrayed his irritation.

The design department buzzed with morning activity. Yvette arrived fashionably late at ten, flashing an apologetic smile. "Sorry darlings, I overslept. My husband kept me up all night..."

A colleague smirked. "That good, huh?" The women tittered, playing along for potential perks from the office spendthrift.

Olivia's text interrupted Evelyn's thoughts: "Was the boss with you last night?"

Evelyn's fingers hovered before typing a single word: "Yes."

Meanwhile, Abigail stormed past Sebastian in the hallway, venting about Yvette's inappropriate workplace behavior. "Check the security footage if you don't believe me!"

Sebastian blinked as Abigail flounced away. Since when did she roll her eyes at him? The interaction left him unsettled throughout his morning tasks.

By lunchtime, Sebastian decided Dominic needed to know about Yvette's fabricated escapades. This couldn't continue.
###Chapter 182

Sebastian revealed everything to his boss in careful ambiguity. As Dominic's right-hand man, he trusted his employer's sharp intellect. Surely the man could deduce Yvette's schemes.

Yet Dominic remained an enigma. His decades of experience and social standing prevented him from acting like some brutish thug. The billionaire never let his emotions show, making him utterly unpredictable.

Sebastian had no clue how his boss would handle this situation. He could only wait and watch while attending to his own responsibilities.

Down in the design department...

Since Yvette's arrival, office chatter had taken a dramatic turn. Conversations jumped from high-society debutantes to A-list celebrities, occasionally touching on powerful tycoons.

The monotony of corporate life needed spicing up. Gossip became their favorite pastime, with Yvette always at the center. Even department head Vivienne Laurent turned a blind eye.

Abigail Thornton fumed silently. As a junior team leader, she couldn't intervene without her superior's approval. She had to endure the nonsense.

"Yvette, have you met Lillian Prescott in person?" a colleague asked eagerly.

Yvette pretended to consider. "Naturally."

"Is she as stunning as she appears on screen?"

"In reality..." Yvette feigned hesitation. "She's quite average. Relies heavily on makeup and editing."

The truth? Yvette had never laid eyes on the rising starlet. Lillian, the breakout actress of the year, had become Hollywood's newest darling after her lead role in a blockbuster.

The colleague worshipped Yvette's apparent connections. "With your industry insights, do you think Lillian will sustain her fame?"

Olivia Kensington slammed her keyboard. "Shouldn't you be more concerned about your mother's health? The hospital called this morning."

The colleague flushed. She'd brushed off the doctor's call to indulge in celebrity gossip.

Yvette shot Olivia a sideways glance before continuing, "If you're betting on Lillian, you've chosen wisely. Nothing can stop her ascent."

"Why's that?"

"Her connections." Yvette arched a brow. "Far beyond your imagination. But I can't elaborate."

Yvette knew the Prescott family secrets. Genevieve Prescott, wife of Governor Jonathan Prescott, had been childhood friends with Beatrice Lockwood and Lorraine Lockwood.

Despite their wealth, the Prescotts remained childless until Genevieve adopted ten-year-old Lillian from an orphanage. Now twenty, the girl enjoyed privileges most starlets could only dream of.

The entertainment industry's power players knew exactly who backed Lillian. They treated her like royalty, ensuring her effortless rise to stardom.

Yvette burned with envy. Ten years as an orphan, then a decade of fame. Life's unfairness stung.

Across the office, Evelyn Sinclair worked furiously while "Lillian Prescott" echoed around her. After a chaotic morning and rushed lunch, she dashed out at three.

She visited multiple print shops before choosing the most affordable option for business cards, arranging delivery to the office.

At Reginald Sinclair's countryside villa, tranquility reigned. The caretaker greeted Evelyn warmly when she arrived.

Her grandfather's injuries had nearly healed in this peaceful environment. Evelyn felt justified in accepting Dominic's help - her pride mattered less than her grandfather's wellbeing.

As they strolled the gardens, Reginald said, "Dominic cares deeply for you. That's why he's helping me. Remember that."

"He's generous," Evelyn deflected.

Reginald thumped his cane. "Generous? He's doing this to ease your burden! Do you think he'd take in every poor old man? There's a reason he chose me."

Evelyn smiled at her grandfather's lecture.

"Don't sabotage this relationship with insecurities," Reginald continued. "If he values you, you must have qualities he admires. Compatibility matters more than matching social status - many 'perfect' matches end miserably."
###Chapter 183

Evelyn was mid-conversation with her grandfather when her phone buzzed.

"Grandpa, I need to take this." She gently pulled away from his grip that was starting to leave marks on her arm.

Abigail's name flashed on the screen.

Evelyn answered immediately. "What's up, Abby?"

The response came rapid-fire. "Evie, the town development project got pushed up - they want us to start outdoor training tomorrow. Meet at the office entrance at eight sharp. Pack hiking gear and essentials. Any questions, text me. I'll notify the others."

"Got it," Evelyn replied before ending the call.

During her study abroad years, Evelyn had participated in numerous outdoor leadership programs. She always treated them as both physical challenges and mental refreshers.

After dinner, Evelyn automatically started clearing the table.

"Miss Sinclair! Please don't!" The new housekeeper rushed over in panic. "If Mr. Blackwood finds out we let you do chores, we'll be fired!"

The woman eyed Evelyn curiously. Shouldn't the future daughter-in-law of the Blackwood family act more... princess-like? Maybe old habits died hard for someone who'd lived the Cinderella story.

Evelyn finally relented, though dishwashing had become second nature after years of independence.

"Grandpa, no need to walk me out." Evelyn stopped the old man at the door. She turned toward the subway station, her sneakers crunching on fallen leaves.

The neighborhood was quiet, populated only by luxury vehicles gliding soundlessly down the tree-lined streets.

At the station entrance, Evelyn glanced back at her grandfather's mansion. It wasn't far from where Margaret and Walter resided.

Her steps slowed as another worry surfaced.

Blackwood Manor.

Alexander and Isabella arrived home with their driver.

Beatrice happened to be home that afternoon, carrying milk upstairs to her grandchildren. "Where have you two been these past days? With your father?"

She couldn't imagine Dominic handling childcare alone. The man barely had time to eat, let alone supervise homework and meals. And he was notoriously strict about their diet.

Before Alexander could answer, Beatrice spotted Dominic approaching silently on the plush carpet.

"Were you actually caring for them yourself?" Beatrice asked skeptically. "How did you manage?"

She desperately wanted the twins to stay at the manor. This estate wasn't just property - it symbolized the Blackwood legacy. Whoever controlled it held undeniable status within the family.

Margaret Lockwood had retreated from high society after her husband's affair, but recently resurfaced - partly for rehabilitation, partly for revenge.

Beatrice knew people called her the scheming mistress, but in her mind, securing both marriage and love took skill. If Margaret couldn't keep her man, that was her own failing.

Both women remained in the manor out of stubborn pride. Margaret stayed to claim what was rightfully hers; Beatrice refused to surrender her home.

The old master Reginald felt guilty toward Margaret and her son Louis, but hadn't transferred the manor to them. Not out of concern for Dominic - the man had more wealth than he could spend in ten lifetimes - but for the twins' sake.

Margaret despised everything related to Beatrice, including the adorable grandchildren. While she'd never harm children, evicting them from the manor wasn't beyond possibility. What wronged wife would tolerate her husband's illegitimate descendants under her roof?

Only saints could forgive such things, and Margaret was no saint.

Now that Dominic had moved the children out, Beatrice panicked. If this became permanent, Reginald might actually deed the manor to Margaret.

Losing her home of decades was bad enough, but the social humiliation would be unbearable. The society ladies already whispered behind her back - the mistress who'd never be buried in the Blackwood family plot.

The more she thought about it, the more agitated Beatrice became.

Dominic never discussed personal matters with her. When pressed, he'd only say coldly, "They're being cared for."

Beatrice longed to ask by whom.

But Dominic merely pointed at Alexander's notebook. "You're missing an 'e' in 'deep.' Did you eat it?"

"Oops." The five-year-old quickly corrected his spelling.

Recognizing the dismissal, Beatrice retreated quietly.

The next day, T Corporation's outdoor training commenced. Employees were divided by department for hiking, swimming, team-building exercises, and corporate culture seminars. By 6 PM, everyone was exhausted though the sun still hung low.

As CEO, Dominic rarely made appearances. Employees whispered this might be his first time addressing every department personally.

The design team's turn hadn't come yet.

"Von," a female colleague teased Yvette, "did you convince the boss to come during your pillow talk last night?"
###Chapter 184

The design team's gazes instantly snapped toward Seraphina Prescott.

If this was truly the result of her pillow talk... Seraphina had serious influence!

A nearby couple began whispering. "Mr. Blackwood's always so distant and intimidating," the man murmured. "For him to show up at a company outing just because Seraphina whispered in his ear? That's insane."

His girlfriend rolled her eyes. "You really don't get it, do you?"

"Get what?" He looked genuinely confused.

She scoffed. "It means no man - not even a powerful CEO - can resist a seductive little minx. Satisfy them in bed, and they'll move mountains for you."

"Jesus," the man grimaced. "We're discussing business here. Why attack me?"

"Because if even our stone-cold boss falls for this, what hope is there for losers like you who spend all day gossiping?" She punctuated her words with a sharp elbow to his ribs.

Evelyn Sinclair sat on a boulder, massaging her cramped leg. She gritted her teeth against the pain.

The physical discomfort already had her on edge. Now this bickering couple was making things worse.

Their argument escalated.

The clueless boyfriend grabbed his girlfriend's arm. "Go find out if it's true. If Seraphina really has that kind of influence, you should start carrying her bags and fetching her drinks. Easy way to get ahead with a boss who thinks with his-"

"Idiot!" The girl spun away in disgust.

Evelyn heard every word.

Clearly, no one cared about being overheard. The entire office was thinking the same thing - they just weren't saying it aloud.

The girlfriend's crude insult didn't embarrass Evelyn. If anything, it sounded like sweet music.

Meanwhile, Seraphina blushed furiously. Watching Dominic Blackwood converse with department heads, she confided to a colleague, "I never expected this. I just mentioned it in passing last night, and he actually... came..."

Her coy demeanor and suggestive words confirmed everyone's suspicions. His presence was entirely due to her nocturnal persuasion.

Evelyn lowered her head.

"Mr. Blackwood is the perfect boyfriend!" someone squealed.

Female colleagues swarmed Seraphina, their envy palpable.

Olivia Kensington overheard the exchange. She shot an angry glance at Evelyn.

What the hell was happening?

Since when had their CEO become Seraphina's bedmate?

And pillow talk? Disgusting.

With so many people around, Olivia couldn't confront Evelyn directly.

A sudden applause erupted from the adjacent department. Then Dominic Blackwood approached, radiating authority.

Two imposing bodyguards flanked him. Sebastian Whitmore followed slightly behind, frowning as he briefed his boss.

"The CEO's here. Straighten up," the female department head reminded everyone sharply.

They couldn't look like a pack of hungry wolves.

This was the design department, not some desperate dating pool.

Everyone adjusted their swimwear hastily. Some wrapped themselves in towels; others threw on cover-ups.

Evelyn loved swimming - it helped her manage stress. But this was her first autumn outdoor swim in the city.

Her wet hair dripped as she stood. The cold water had triggered intermittent leg cramps, leaving her too distracted to care about appearances.

She wrapped the company-provided towel around herself.

It barely covered her thighs. Seeking warmth, Evelyn crouched low, hugging her knees.

The position eased her cramping calves.

Dominic's deep voice carried from meters away. After a long moment, Evelyn finally looked up.

Several pairs of bare legs surrounded her.

Everyone had covered their torsos, but little else.

If Seraphina wasn't lying, Evelyn thought bitterly, this revelation should stab through her heart. Instead, her legs cramped harder.

Her mood couldn't get worse.

The field fell silent as Dominic spoke. Even those familiar with his voice seemed stunned.

Then everyone noticed his intense gaze sweeping the crowd.

A colleague nudged Seraphina. "He's looking at you! Oh my God, he's totally smitten!"

"Every great man has a weakness," another gushed. "Teach us your secrets! You've snagged the city's most eligible bachelor!"

Seraphina basked in their admiration.

"He's coming!" someone hissed.

The crowd parted like the Red Sea.

The department head and Abigail Thornton waited calmly to see what would happen.

Standing at the back, Seraphina wondered what had prompted Dominic's sudden interest. Had he finally recognized the... pleasures a nineteen-year-old could offer?

She discreetly adjusted her swimsuit to reveal more cleavage, then bit her lip demurely.

Her heart raced as she sensed Dominic approaching.

But then...

He walked right past her.

The colleagues who'd believed Seraphina's story gaped in shock.

"Von...?" her friends whispered in confusion.

Olivia exchanged glances with Abigail. Had Seraphina's lies finally backfired?

What an epic self-own.
###Chapter 185

Evelyn didn't hear any movement from the front. Despite her terrible cramps and foul mood, she lifted her head.

That's when she saw him walking toward her.

Dominic Blackwood stood tall with those impossibly long legs. His expression was unreadable as always. In that tailored suit, he looked like a god descended from Olympus.

The man carried himself with the same commanding presence whether at a Wall Street summit, corporate boardroom, or this rural retreat. Nothing ever cracked that icy composure.

His eyes remained as cold and unfeeling as ever. Even dressed for the countryside, he wore his signature designer suit with that same infuriating perfection.

Evelyn never expected Dominic to approach her.

Why was he here?

Backlit by the setting sun, she squinted at his approaching figure. She glanced behind her - no one there.

He was coming for her.

It wasn't that Evelyn refused to speak to him. She simply didn't want this conversation happening in front of their colleagues.

"Are you unwell?" Dominic knelt without hesitation, that usual arrogance gone. His gaze swept over her pale face and ankle with genuine concern.

Their eyes met. Evelyn noticed his brows furrowed in the same moment hers did.

He was worried.

Perhaps that's all this was - professional concern. She shook her head, avoiding his piercing stare. "I'm fine. You should go back to your meeting."

She hated being the center of attention.

Dominic stood, making everyone else fade into the background. "Abigail. Come here."

Abigail Thornton hurried over.

"What's wrong with Evelyn?" Though his tone remained businesslike, concern flickered in his eyes.

"She..." Normally unflappable, Abigail stammered under his intense gaze. "Ev... Evelyn has severe cramps. The pool water was too cold for her condition."

At the word "cramps," Dominic turned and knelt again. His hand hovered near her shoulder. "Can you stand?"

Evelyn eyed his outstretched hand. She attempted to rise, but a sharp pain shot through her calf.

Her face contorted.

Without warning, Dominic scooped her into his arms bridal-style.

"Put me down. Now." Her protest came out barely above a whisper, but he heard.

"Keep struggling and I'll kiss you right here in front of everyone."

He carried her toward the black Range Rover parked nearby. When she squirmed, he looked down with that infuriating mix of amusement and pity.

Jaws dropped across the lawn.

Meanwhile, Yvette Prescott watched her supposed lover carry Evelyn away. Furious, she hurled her shawl to the ground.

Silence fell.

No one dared question why the CEO was carrying Evelyn Sinclair.

Not even his rumored girlfriend Yvette had ever touched his sleeve.

Dominic hadn't so much as glanced at Yvette. She might as well have been air - just another nameless employee.

Unworthy of his attention.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, packing began. "What's Evelyn's relationship with Mr. Blackwood?" someone whispered.

"Maybe she twisted her ankle? He was just being decent," another offered while folding chairs.

"Decent? Have you met our CEO? The man's an iceberg. The coldest man alive!"

Veteran employees shook their heads. "If Evelyn had fallen, the 'decent' thing would've been calling an ambulance. That man wouldn't lift a finger for anyone - not even himself."

Yvette overheard this as she marched to her car.

The gossiping women didn't recognize her. "He carried her to his car personally. They're definitely involved. Don't you know? The CEO personally approves every design hire. He must've noticed her during interviews."

"I heard no woman's ever sat in his passenger seat before. Sebastian Whitmore once said at a gala, 'Unless she's his wife or daughter, why would she?'" The woman eyed Sebastian. "I'm going to ask why Evelyn gets that privilege now."

Sebastian collected Evelyn's belongings, placing them silently in the Range Rover before retreating to his own car. He sent a quick text.

Nearby, Abigail checked her phone.

Olivia Kensington looked confused when Abigail called, "We're riding back with Mr. Whitmore."

Yvette's former sycophants stared slack-jawed at the black Range Rover. What was happening inside?

Employees from other departments, unaware of protocol, pulled out binoculars like paparazzi stalking celebrities.

Through tinted windows, they glimpsed Dominic using a company towel to dry Evelyn's hair - the gesture almost paternal in its tenderness.

Then he removed his jacket, wrapping it around her shoulders despite her vigorous head-shaking.

Most shocking of all - the CEO massaging Evelyn's calf with those long, elegant fingers.

Every moment shattered their image of the cold, unapproachable Dominic Blackwood.
###Chapter 186

"What did you see? Tell us!"

The finance department women huddled around their colleague who held the binoculars.

The new hire, still naive, blurted out everything she witnessed.

Blank stares met her words.

"I'm not lying!" she insisted, cheeks flushing.

One colleague scoffed. "Sweetheart, with that imagination, you should write romance novels. If you'd said that woman was straddling the boss, tearing his shirt open while undoing his belt, maybe I'd believe you."

The boss drying her hair? Massaging her calves? Ridiculous.

Another woman adjusted her bag. "That girl's pretty, but Public Relations has stunners. In all my years here, I've never heard of the boss touching any of them. No way some designer caught his eye. Let's wait and see."

The group dispersed, leaving the newbie alone.

She squinted at the empty parking spot where the boss's car had been. Maybe her eyes were playing tricks?

Evelyn rode back to the city center with her design team.

The bus that had buzzed with gossip about her and Dominic earlier was now dead silent. Some scrolled through phones. Others feigned sleep.

The shift infuriated Evelyn, who'd basked in their attention just hours ago.

She was the first off at the office building.

Her colleagues exchanged glances.

The bigger the lie, the harder the fall.

Dominic had humiliated Evelyn publicly.

As the last employee stepped off, the department head remained seated, clutching her temples.

"Ma'am, are you okay?"

"Just carsick. Go ahead."

Through the windshield, the head watched Evelyn storm toward a waiting yellow sports car.

The designer flung her belongings inside before speeding off.

Her designer clothes and luxury car screamed old money. By all appearances, she matched Dominic's social standing.

The department head sighed.

She'd backed the wrong horse.

Dominic leaving with Evelyn would be office gossip by Monday. The design department would be under scrutiny.

And she'd made life hell for the real object of Dominic's affection.

Forcing Evelyn to fetch coffee? Having her scrub floors yesterday?

All to please a liar.

Her stomach churned as she recalled how Evelyn and her friends had ridden in Sebastian's car while she took the bus with the plebs.

Evelyn collapsed onto her bed after showering.

She dialed Beatrice, sobbing. "Auntie, I can't do this anymore. Dominic humiliated me today. I'm resigning Monday."

"What happened?" Beatrice demanded.

Evelyn's mother entered, gesturing for her to continue.

Between sniffles, Evelyn recounted the events.

Beatrice sighed. "Darling, you must be mistaken. Evelyn's married. She has a certificate with another man!"

Evelyn froze.

Right. That forced marriage to Maxwell. She'd dismissed it as irrelevant.

Now it was her ammunition.

Her mother, overhearing, snarled, "Some married slut is stealing your man? Stop crying and put that homewrecker in her place!"

Evelyn's tears dried. "Thank you, Auntie. I know exactly what to do."

Dominic carried Evelyn upstairs.

His massage had eased her cramp, but he remained concerned.

"I'm fine," she insisted, handing him water. "Go work."

Today had been perfect.

His public rejection of Evelyn proved their relationship was fiction.

"Happy I cleared things up?" he asked, sipping.

Evelyn flushed as he stood.

He advanced until her back hit the wall, his breath warm on her lips.
###Chapter 187

His scorching breath grazed her skin, making her knees buckle instantly.

A deep blush spread across Evelyn's face.

She thought Dominic would kiss her again.

That's how it always used to be.

This man had a one-track mind when it came to intimacy.

But this time, his lips only brushed against her cheek. He lingered there, eyes closed, savoring the contact.

The kiss lasted so long she had to hold her breath.

When he finally pulled away, his voice was rough. "Don't make me worry about you. Stop bottling things up."

Evelyn lowered her gaze, confused by his words.

"Get some rest. We leave for the town tomorrow." Dominic's fingers, which had been tilting her chin, reluctantly withdrew.

Exhausted from the day's activities, every muscle in her body ached. Sleep called to her, but where was he going?

She watched as Dominic opened the door to leave, her heart twisting uncomfortably.

He'd vanished the entire previous night too.

After dinner, he'd left the twins with her and didn't return until dawn. Where had he been during those missing hours?

No one knew.

A powerful man like Dominic could easily keep secrets.

If he'd gone to Yvette's place, then his behavior today was just an act. It would also mean he disrespected Yvette completely.

In relationships like theirs, the younger woman always suffered in silence.

It wasn't surprising that a naive 19-year-old would get swept up in an older man's world.

But these were just baseless assumptions. Truthfully, Evelyn didn't want to doubt Dominic. Despite the scandals surrounding powerful men, she chose to believe in him unconditionally.

Because he was extraordinary. And because he was Alexander and Isabella's father.

Shaking her head, she pushed the thoughts away.

Yet human hearts aren't ruled by logic.

Under the shower's spray, her mind kept circling back. Had Dominic gone home to sleep? To the manor or his penthouse?

But with the children here, why would he sleep elsewhere?

Dominic wasn't some prude from ancient times.

These thoughts plagued her through her shower and into bed. Clutching the blanket, she finally drifted off.

Sometime in the night, the mattress dipped sharply.

The rented apartment's bed was flimsy compared to the luxurious ones at Blackwood Manor. Just an iron frame with uneven slats.

Fine for her and the children, but unable to support a grown man's weight without protest.

Exhausted from the day's activities, Evelyn slept deeply at first.

Then the heat woke her.

Why was it so sweltering? Wasn't it autumn? This felt like midsummer.

A soft moan escaped as she blinked awake to find a man in a white shirt and black pants hovering over her, his lips claiming hers.

"Mmm... You—" Reality crashed in.

If this was a dream, it felt terrifyingly real.

Her thin pajamas provided little coverage. Having expected to sleep alone, she'd forgone a bra after showering.

A traitorous moan slipped out, soft and honeyed.

Dominic kissed her like a husband returning from war, his hunger speaking volumes.

Only their clothes separated their burning bodies.

Under his skilled hands, Evelyn's body betrayed her, responding eagerly.

Her pajama top rode up as Dominic's large hands spanned her slender waist. Fatigue shadowed his eyes, but desire burned brighter.

Evelyn arched into his touch, her mind and body at war.

"Ah... Ha..." The sounds escaped unbidden.

Maybe subconsciously she knew they were alone. Maybe that's why she didn't hold back.

"Still this sensitive?" Dominic's voice roughened, his eyes darkening. The bloodshot veins from sleep deprivation only made him look more dangerously attractive.

Evelyn melted beneath him, her black hair fanned across the pillow. The contrast between her pale skin and his tan was stark.

"You bit your lip that first time too," he murmured against her neck. "Trying so hard not to scream..."

His husky tone sent shivers through her.

Evelyn gasped for air as strong hands flipped her onto her stomach. His weight pinned her as he tugged her pajama bottoms down.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

"Evelyn? Are you home?"

Allison's voice cut through the moment.

The doorbell remained silent as Allison kept knocking.

A neighbor returning from the market explained, "The bell's been broken for weeks. Landlord won't fix it."

Frustrated, Allison checked Yvette's message again:

Aunt Beatrice, I hate to bother you, but it's urgent. Dominic's taking Evelyn to that remote town. Who knows what might happen? The family's reputation—

Allison rolled her eyes. Yvette always ran to others instead of solving her own problems.

"Dominic knows his limits," she muttered.

But Yvette's next words gave pause:

"Alone in some secluded place... A man and woman... Passion could easily—"
###Chapter 188

"A quiet little town... A man and a woman alone... consumed by fiery passion..."

Every word from Yvette's lips sent Evelyn's imagination spiraling out of control!

The realization hit Evelyn like a thunderbolt - she had to intervene before things went too far.

History had shown time and again how even the mightiest warriors would falter before feminine charms. The evidence was undeniable.

Whether Dominic truly found Evelyn beautiful was irrelevant. In his eyes, she was perfection incarnate - and that alone had clouded his judgment!

Beatrice knew the ways of young love all too well. A single spark could ignite an uncontrollable wildfire between a man and woman.

The more she dwelled on it, the hotter her anger burned.

Her clenched fist hammered against the door with increasing force.

The knocking escalated from polite raps to thunderous bangs, mirroring the fury swelling in Beatrice's chest.

"Evelyn Sinclair! If you're in there, stop hiding from me!"

The cheap apartment walls offered little privacy. On this quiet morning, any shouting should have been clearly audible inside.

"Has my mother contacted you before?" Dominic could tell from the relentless pounding and Beatrice's tone that this wasn't a friendly visit.

He pressed a kiss to Evelyn's delicate neck, leaving a faint mark as he searched his memories.

To his recollection, his mother barely knew Evelyn. They'd met perhaps twice, three times at most.

Yet the familiarity in Beatrice's voice suggested some unspoken connection between them - one that bypassed all formalities.

'Perhaps Mother confronted Evelyn about marrying Maxwell Lockwood when things between us were just getting serious,' he mused.

This confrontation likely stemmed from a mother's misunderstanding of her future daughter-in-law.

"I'll... um... answer it..." Evelyn attempted to rise.

In an instant, Dominic's strong arms pulled her back against his bare chest. Their sweat-slicked bodies pressed together intimately.

"You think I can stop now? After all this time waiting?"

Dominic's husky voice sent shivers down Evelyn's spine, her senses already heightened from their foreplay.

His weight pinned her helplessly beneath him...

Beatrice's shouts continued outside. "Do you want the whole building to hear? Then come out now! Hiding won't solve anything!"

It was a blatant threat.

Evelyn's entire body flushed crimson, not an inch of skin untouched by heat.

Panic set in as Beatrice's words registered. "You... you heard her... please... let me... ahh..."

Dominic watched Evelyn's slender waist twist beneath him as she struggled. The fire inside him burned unbearably hot!

As she turned to plead with him, the rustle of fabric signaled his belt coming undone.

His pants followed in one swift motion.

Her eyes widened at the intimidating sight before her.

Dominic was beyond reason now. Not even an earthquake could tear him away from the woman in his arms.

"Whatever she wants can wait. I can't hold back any longer."

In the cramped apartment, he claimed her trembling body once more.

Evelyn knew escape was impossible.

Yet she couldn't ignore Beatrice's commotion either. The neighbors would surely gossip, and she couldn't bear moving yet again to avoid scandal.

The constant relocations had exhausted her.

Releasing her death grip on the pillow, she fumbled for her phone.

The screen lit up with a flood of notifications.

Ignoring them all, she found Beatrice's number and dialed.

The ringing stopped almost immediately outside.

"Finally decided to turn on your phone? Too cowardly to face me? I know you're home, Evelyn! Should we have this conversation through the door? You may have no shame, but I do!" Beatrice ranted without pause.

In all her years as a Crawford matriarch, when had she ever been treated so disrespectfully?

Since when did she have to beg at someone's doorstep like a common petitioner?

Evelyn held the phone to her ear, but words failed her.

What could she possibly say? "Your son is currently ravishing me in bed"?

The opportunity to speak passed as Evelyn lost control of her voice. The sounds escaping her lips were pure, unfiltered reaction...

"Ah... so tight..."

Dominic's guttural groan vibrated through her.

His calloused hands slid beneath her, one palm pressed to her heated skin, the other braced against the sheets.

Evelyn couldn't form words, though her grip on the phone remained firm. Eyes squeezed shut, forehead pressed to the pillow, every nerve ending alight...

"Are you listening, Evelyn?" Beatrice's voice crackled through the phone.

Evelyn heard, but any response would emerge as wanton moans...

Dominic's heartbeat pounded like war drums against her back.

Drenched in sweat, Evelyn endured the overwhelming sensations of being thoroughly claimed.

She nearly forgot the ongoing call. "Ha... ah... ha..." Her breathy moans escaped unchecked.

Normally, Evelyn's petite frame struggled to accommodate him.

Now with Beatrice pounding at the door, her tension only heightened the intensity.

"It... hurts too much..."

Evelyn ended the call with a sharp cry, abandoning all pretense of modesty.

Her fists twisted the bedsheets into crumpled heaps...

Dominic took pity despite his own desperation. Though consumed by lust, he recognized this wasn't ideal timing. His mother's presence certainly didn't help.

At least without an audience, Evelyn might relax.

Under these circumstances, relaxation was impossible.

"Can we... next time..." Tears welled as she tried to turn, catching only a glimpse of his muscular thighs braced on the mattress.

"Please... make your mother... leave..."

"Fine," Dominic agreed instantly but couldn't resist teasing. "After I finish."

'The agony might kill me otherwise.'

Evelyn found herself lifted in his arms. Her frantic gaze darted about the room before settling on his arousal. "I'll... help you..." The blush deepened.

"How?" He doubted her knowledge.

"I..."

Though inexperienced, Evelyn had general ideas.

Her pulse raced erratically. Closing her eyes against his intense stare, she tentatively reached down with delicate hands.

"Open your eyes and look at it!" Dominic guided her touch with his own.
###Chapter 189

Beatrice Lockwood's sharp eyes darted from her phone screen to the closed apartment door.

Her instincts screamed that something was off since dawn.

Evelyn called but stayed silent...

What game is she playing?

And those sounds—were those... moans?

From Evelyn?

A shudder ran down Beatrice's spine at the thought.

"Open this door right now, Evelyn! I know you're in there!" She couldn't wait to expose the man hiding inside.

Before arriving, she'd confirmed with her brother that Maxwell, her nephew, was still asleep at home.

She also knew Dominic couldn't possibly be here.

Sebastian had assured her his boss had been pulling all-nighters at the office.

According to Sebastian, Dominic was working overtime to clear his schedule before their trip—so he could focus entirely on Evelyn.

The unfairness burned in Beatrice's chest. Neither she, Alexander, nor Isabella had ever received such devotion from him.

And yet, here Evelyn was—betraying them all.

While her husband slept alone, and Dominic slaved away at work, she was entertaining another man at dawn.

Today, Beatrice vowed, Evelyn's deceit would be laid bare.

With renewed fury, she raised her voice. "Don't think I don't know what you're doing in there! I'm not leaving until you open this door! Unless you plan to jump out the window, you'd better face me!"

Her shrill threats echoed through the hallway.

Inside, the rickety wooden bed groaned under the weight of rapid, relentless movement.

Gasping breaths filled the cramped space.

Evelyn fought to stay coherent. Terrified he might lose control completely, she abandoned all restraint and gripped him tightly as he neared his climax.

"Ah—" Dominic's large hands clamped over hers.

The rhythm stuttered, then intensified.

Finally, release.

Leaning against the windowsill, Evelyn stared at the beast of a man before her, struggling to steady her breathing.

She withdrew her hands slowly, cheeks burning.

The blanket barely covered her trembling form.

Dominic exhaled sharply, savoring the moment before swallowing hard and opening his eyes.

The heat in his gaze could have melted steel.

The air between them crackled with tension, all barriers obliterated.

When Evelyn tried to look away, his fingers caught her chin, forcing her to meet his lips in a searing kiss.

He devoured her until her mouth ached, then trailed fire down her neck, his breath scorching her skin—

Outside, Beatrice's patience snapped.

She dialed Evelyn's number again.

It rang. No answer.

Fists clenched, she raised her hand to pound the door—

It swung open.

Evelyn stood there, clad in modest cotton pajamas.

Beatrice's eyes narrowed, then dropped to the pair of men's leather shoes by the door.

Her fashion-trained eye recognized the brand instantly—handcrafted, exorbitantly priced.

"Impressive. You've landed yourself a wealthy lover?" Her voice dripped with disdain.

Evelyn closed the door behind her.

She fetched slippers, offering them silently.

Beatrice kicked them aside, striding into the living room in her heels before tossing her purse onto the couch.

"Where is he? Too cowardly to show his face?"

She was ready. If this man was anyone of importance in the city's elite circles, she'd use her status as Dominic's mother to humiliate him publicly.

"There's no one here," Evelyn said calmly, placing a glass of water on the coffee table.

Beatrice ignored it. "No one?"

Evelyn nodded.

Beatrice's gaze flicked to the closed bedroom door, then back to the shoes. "Then explain those."

"Your son left them here last time. Sebastian brought him a new pair after Isabella spilled water on them."

"You shameless liar!" Beatrice hurled the glass aside and lunged. Before Evelyn could react, she tore the pajama top open.

"What the hell—?" Evelyn recoiled.

"No man? Then what are these?" Beatrice pointed at the vivid marks littering Evelyn's skin.

Her neck. Collarbones. Shoulders.

Evidence of passion, raw and undeniable.

SMACK!

The slap echoed through the apartment.

"Married to my nephew, yet whoring around at dawn? You disgust me!" Beatrice raised her hand again—

Evelyn caught her wrist mid-air.

Her voice turned icy. "Haven't I always been the villain in your eyes? First, I supposedly seduced your son—my brother, according to you. When that failed, I married your nephew—another relative. You've called me every vile name imaginable. So why wait until now to hit me? Why not do it in front of the Blackwoods and Lockwoods?"

Beatrice paled. Her hand trembled.

She'd come to expose an affair, not reveal Evelyn's connection to their family.

If this got out, the scandal would ruin her.

Too late.

The bedroom door creaked open.

A man stepped out—immaculate in a tailored suit, his presence freezing the room solid.
###Chapter 190

Dominic was caught off guard.

Any rational person could piece together the situation from that heated exchange.

"Don't think I don't know what you're doing in there, Evelyn! Listen carefully—I'll be waiting right outside this door! I won't leave until you open it! If you want to escape, you'd better sprout wings and fly out the window!"

His mother’s furious voice cut through the air just as he was tangled up with Evelyn. At that volume, it was impossible to ignore.

He hadn’t stopped what he was doing because he assumed his mother was trying to prevent him from being with his cousin’s wife.

After all, that would be a scandal beyond social acceptance.

But then, the moment Beatrice stepped inside, she had smirked and said, "Not bad. Did you manage to reel in a big fish?"

Dominic knew something was wrong.

He couldn’t pinpoint it yet, but his mother’s intentions were clearly different from what he’d expected.

The argument that followed between Beatrice and Evelyn would’ve been gibberish to an outsider.

"You’re telling me there’s no man here? You’re cheating on my nephew and my son at the crack of dawn! I never thought you’d stoop this low, Evelyn!"

Dominic had cleaned himself up while his mother hurled accusations.

Then—slap!

The sound was sharp, like a blade slicing through the tension. The two women outside—the woman who raised him and the mother of his children—were now physically fighting.

Once Dominic had straightened his appearance, he frowned and moved toward the door. Just as his hand touched the knob, Evelyn’s next words struck him like lightning.

"Haven’t I always been a disgrace in your eyes? You think I seduced your son—my supposed brother. And when that failed, I married your nephew, who you claim shares my blood. Isn’t that what you’ve always said? That I was born to ruin you? So why wait so long to hit me? Why not do it in front of the Blackwoods and the Lockwoods?"

Everything clicked.

Now he understood why she left him. Why she said she couldn’t forget Nathan Kensington. Why she settled for some low-level employee from another company.

He’d thought she was insane when she whispered that it would be nice if he were her older brother.

He’d assumed it was some twisted fantasy.

But there was a reason behind it all—and his mother was the architect.

"Dominic." Beatrice panicked, her hostility vanishing as she forced a gentle smile. "I was just so angry at Evelyn that I wasn’t thinking straight. I thought she was sneaking around with some random man."

Dominic ignored her. He strode to the coffee table, picked up his cigarette case and lighter, and lit one.

Taking a slow drag, he turned to Evelyn. "Pack your things. We leave at nine sharp."

Evelyn’s cheek was swollen from Beatrice’s slap.

Dominic stared at the mark for a long moment before looking away and dragging his mother out of the apartment.

Silence settled over the cramped rental.

Evelyn washed her face at the sink, water dripping from her lashes. She didn’t know if it was from the tap or her own tears.

The moment she’d burned bridges with Beatrice, she knew there was no going back.

Even if a DNA test proved she was Beatrice’s daughter and Dominic wasn’t her brother—it wouldn’t matter.

Their relationship was beyond repair.

Blackwood Manor

At seven, Sebastian arrived to take Alexander and Isabella to school.

Margaret and Julian lived on the west wing, oblivious to the storm brewing on the east side.

Reginald Blackwood was downstairs, watching the gardeners tend to the roses. He barely glanced up when his grandson and daughter-in-law entered and headed upstairs.

But then—raised voices.

Reginald’s ears pricked.

Dominic was assertive, yes, but he never lost control in front of family. He preferred to ignore what he didn’t want to see—unless it crossed moral or legal lines.

So why was he shouting at his mother now?

Upstairs

Dominic hadn’t spoken a word to Beatrice on the drive back.

She knew her son. The quieter he was, the more dangerous.

She couldn’t let this fester. She couldn’t let him believe Evelyn.

"I did this for you," she insisted. "I know you think for yourself, but men have destroyed themselves over women before. Blackwood Corp is leading the industry. Don’t throw it all away for her, Dominic!"

She was weaving the perfect lie.

Dominic stopped at the doorway, turning to face her with a razor-sharp glare.

"Didn’t Father do the same? He abandoned his first wife for you. If I break a few social norms, so what? I’m your son."

Back then, when Edmund Blackwood and Margaret Lockwood’s marriage was official, Beatrice had already been recognized as his second wife.

Two wives—as if they’d forgotten society only allowed one.

"Dominic, Evelyn is Maxwell’s wife! Your grandfather will disown you if he finds out what you two did this morning! You might not care about the Blackwood name, but he does!"

Beatrice played her last card—Reginald’s authority.

"Go tell him then," Dominic snapped, his voice icy. "Tell him right now."

The staff nearby flinched.

Dominic’s gaze was frigid. "If it weren’t for you, Evelyn would never have married Maxwell. And as for how I became her brother—I’ll get answers when I return."
###Chapter 191

Beatrice Lockwood despised Evelyn Sinclair from the moment she discovered Evelyn was Robert Sinclair's daughter.

Any woman could marry Dominic Blackwood and become her daughter-in-law—except Evelyn.

She had hidden her true feelings for the sake of family harmony. But now, she would openly oppose this union.

Seeing Dominic's fury made her feel guilty, but also relieved she no longer needed to pretend.

She would stop Evelyn at all costs, even if it meant burning bridges with her own son.

Their mother-son bond was unbreakable. No woman could change that.

"You want an explanation? About how I turned to that scoundrel Robert Sinclair after your father abandoned me?" Beatrice confessed, knowing her brilliant son would uncover the truth anyway.

Dominic's shocked expression confirmed her suspicions.

Tears streamed down Beatrice's face. "I've kept this shameful secret for over twenty years. Your father was ruthless—he would have disowned us both if he knew."

She moved to her vanity and opened the hidden safe.

Inside lay stacks of pawnshop receipts where all her jewelry had been sold.

"Look at these!" She thrust them at Dominic.

He examined the documents. Every piece of jewelry he'd ever gifted her had been liquidated.

This made no sense. The Blackwood family tracked every expenditure meticulously.

Where had the money gone?

Beatrice sighed under her son's piercing gaze. "Robert Sinclair is sick. He needs expensive treatments. That's when I forced Evelyn to leave you."

She continued dramatically, "She knows my past with her father and uses it against me. They've blackmailed me repeatedly."

"Now that I have nothing left to give, she's revealing our secrets. She wants to turn you against me!"

Beatrice's mind raced as she spun her web of lies.

But Dominic remained unmoved. If anything, his anger grew.

"Evelyn doesn't scheme for money like other women," he stated coldly. "I've never misjudged character. And I've always known there was more to you."

Beatrice's heart sank. Her son didn't believe her. He trusted that woman instead!

Dominic paused, then delivered his final blow. "When a son can't trust his mother, perhaps the mother should examine her actions."

The staff discreetly retreated downstairs, wisely avoiding the family drama.

Dominic stormed out like a tempestuous aristocrat from a Victorian novel.

"Dominic!" Reginald Blackwood called after his grandson, but the young man roared away in his sports car.

With her son's trust lost, Beatrice turned to the only remaining authority—the family patriarch.

"Father, you must intervene!" she cried dramatically. "If the Lockwoods learn Dominic slept with Maxwell's wife, the scandal will destroy us!"

She embellished the story further. "Yes, Maxwell took Evelyn first, but their marriage is legal. Will you let your grandson ruin our family name?"

Reginald clutched his chest, gasping for breath.

"Call Dominic!" Beatrice screamed to a nearby maid. "Tell him his grandfather is having a heart attack!"
###Chapter 192

The housekeeper obeyed without hesitation.

Her hands shook violently as she dialed Dominic's number. The first call went unanswered. The second attempt met the same fate.

Yet the line kept connecting each time.

After what felt like an eternity of redialing, someone finally picked up.

"Sir, Reginald Blackwood has suffered a cardiac arrest. He's at City Hospital now. Please come immediately!" The housekeeper's voice cracked with urgency.

City Hospital's VIP ward.

Reginald Blackwood lay motionless on the sterile hospital bed. The medical team had successfully stabilized him, his vital signs gradually returning to normal.

Beatrice Lockwood sat hunched in a chair beside the bed, dabbing at her swollen eyes with a tissue. The guilt radiating from her seemed almost tangible.

Margaret Lockwood and Julian Blackwood arrived shortly after receiving the news. As Edmund's second son, Julian shared an unbreakable bond with his grandfather - the man who'd practically raised him after his father's untimely death.

Reginald had been strict, yes, but fiercely protective of his family.

Julian actually felt closer to his grandfather than he ever had to his late father.

There was another reason for Julian's deep gratitude.

When Edmund had tried to abandon Margaret to marry Beatrice, Reginald had intervened. He'd vehemently opposed his son's decision, ensuring Margaret and Julian retained their place in Blackwood Manor.

Julian vaguely recalled the Armstrong family teetering on the edge of ruin during that turbulent period.

Without Reginald's intervention, he and Margaret would have been cast out onto the streets while Beatrice reaped all the benefits.

Julian had always carried this gratitude silently beneath his rebellious exterior. He longed to repay his grandfather, but business acumen wasn't his forte.

Unlike his older brother - heaven's perfect gift to Blackwood Industries.

If only Dominic's mother weren't so despicable.

Julian's forehead creased as he watched the frail old man struggle for breath. Reginald deserved to live a century, free from suffering.

Meanwhile, Margaret shot Beatrice a suspicious glance. Those crocodile tears didn't fool her. "Father seemed perfectly fine when I left this morning. What triggered this attack?" she demanded.

Margaret knew Beatrice's true nature. That woman wouldn't shed genuine tears unless hell froze over.

Something far more sinister was at play here.

The spacious VIP ward resembled a luxury suite more than a hospital room, complete with plush seating arrangements.

Dominic hadn't spoken since arriving.

Not during the agonizing wait outside emergency. Not when the doctors finally emerged with news. Not even when they transferred Reginald to this ward.

Silence hung thick until Margaret's unanswered question.

The attending nurse gently massaged Reginald's IV site to ease discomfort.

Dominic's polished shoes clicked against the tile as he turned to leave.

He'd missed his scheduled departure time with Evelyn. Her phone went straight to voicemail. That haunted expression she'd worn earlier gnawed at him.

Reginald stirred weakly. Even blindfolded, he'd recognize those footsteps anywhere. "Dominic... wait..." he rasped.

Margaret's eyes snapped to her father-in-law.

Julian turned toward his brother, frozen mid-exit.

The pieces clicked into place.

Dominic had somehow caused this.

Margaret couldn't reconcile this with the dutiful son she knew.

Beatrice accepted a fresh tissue from a nurse, dabbing her red-rimmed eyes. "Give us some privacy," she requested.

Julian complied immediately, recognizing his grandfather needed to speak with Beatrice and Dominic alone.

Margaret resisted until Julian physically guided her out.

The medical staff followed.

Only three remained: Reginald on the bed, Beatrice at his side, and Dominic by the door.

Beatrice kept her head bowed as she wiped tears. "Dominic, I know you hate me for telling your grandfather. But I had no choice!"

She rushed to explain before Reginald could gather strength to interrupt.

"Do you know how hard it was raising you alone? The family rejected me. My so-called friends abandoned us. You were my only comfort."

Her voice cracked dramatically. "To protect you, I had to swallow my pride and accept Robert Sinclair's help."

This performance was for both men.

Zachary's temper no longer frightened her, but the Blackwood patriarch still held power.

If her son wouldn't support her this morning, she needed Reginald's intervention.

She'd known the risk to his health. But Evelyn could never marry into their family!

Dominic's voice cut through the ward like winter wind. "My records show I grew up in an orphanage until the Blackwoods took me in."

He bore no resentment about his past.

He pitied Margaret, though duty compelled him to respect Beatrice as his birth mother - even when she was wrong.

Yet her actions erected an invisible wall between them.

That's why he maintained polite distance rather than genuine closeness.

The orphanage had taught him life's harsh realities. The Blackwood scandals schooled him in morality.

His mother was a mistress who traded integrity for wealth. An undeniable truth.
###Chapter 193

Reginald Blackwood lay on the hospital bed with his eyes closed, listening intently to the heated exchange between his daughter-in-law and grandson.

Within thirty seconds, Beatrice Lockwood had skillfully shifted all blame onto Margaret Lockwood.

"You've never trusted me, have you?" Beatrice's voice trembled with manufactured hurt. She dabbed at dry eyes with a tissue. "I would have told you everything if you'd just asked! But you never did!"

Her performance continued as she pretended to recall painful memories. "When I was forced to leave A City after separating from your father, what choice did I have? A young mother with an infant - I had to hide in remote villages. Margaret Lockwood hunted me like an animal! Her people found me no matter where I went!"

Beatrice's voice dropped to a dramatic whisper. "Back then, Margaret was barren. You know how crucial heirs are in wealthy families, Father Blackwood. And I'd given birth to a son! I had to leave Dominic at the orphanage for his own protection. At least there he'd be safe and cared for..."

Reginald Blackwood's frown deepened at Beatrice's calculated words.

The old patriarch considered his two daughters-in-law - Margaret Lockwood from an equally prestigious family, and Beatrice with her common origins.

Margaret's aristocratic upbringing had been both her strength and downfall. She could never compete with Beatrice's flirtatious charms. When her marriage collapsed, Margaret's sanity had crumbled along with it.

Reginald knew exactly which woman had a poisonous heart beneath her refined exterior, and which one had genuine kindness behind her rough edges. He didn't believe Beatrice's fabricated tale of maternal sacrifice for a second.

Opening his eyes, Reginald focused on his grandson standing near the door. "Dominic, come here."

Beatrice's fake sobs paused abruptly. She watched eagerly, hoping to manipulate the situation in her favor.

Though worried about Evelyn, Dominic approached his grandfather's bedside.

"If you tarnish our family name, I'll never rest peacefully," Reginald warned.

Dominic adjusted the blanket with steady hands. "It's not that serious, Grandfather. You should focus on recovering."

Reginald had always trusted his eldest grandson's judgment. When Dominic gave his word, matters were handled impeccably.

"I've always accepted Evelyn as family," Reginald continued. "Why else would I have intervened when the Lockwoods tried marrying her to Maxwell?"

Dominic nodded. That incident had proven his grandfather's approval of Evelyn beyond doubt.

"But remember," Reginald cautioned, "Evelyn is legally married to that Lockwood boy. Their union is protected by law. I say this because I fear you might act rashly."

"I understand completely," Dominic assured, his impeccable business suit radiating calm authority.

Seeing the conversation slipping from her control, Beatrice interjected sharply. "Do you really believe him, Father? This morning I found Dominic in Evelyn's bed! He was sleeping with another man's wife!"

Dominic shot his mother a warning glare she pointedly ignored.

"If you condone this," Beatrice pressed, "how is he any better than what Zachary and I did? At least we've admitted our mistakes! All I want is for Zachary's soul to rest peacefully..."

Reginald closed his eyes with a weary sigh. "Listen to me, Dominic. As long as Evelyn remains married, you must maintain boundaries. We cannot become society's laughingstock."

"You can't possibly approve of this affair!" Beatrice protested, glaring at the stubborn old man.

Meanwhile, on the high-speed train to the countryside...

Traveling during off-peak hours meant few fellow passengers. Evelyn stared at the half-finished design on her laptop screen.

Her team had driven ahead separately. They hadn't invited her - probably knowing the boss would accompany her. But when Dominic didn't appear at the scheduled time, she'd departed alone.

As the train approached her hometown, Evelyn looked up from her work, studying the familiar landscape.

By 1 PM, she arrived at the small station, wheeling a compact silver suitcase behind her.

"Evelyn! Over here!" An HR colleague waved urgently. "I've been trying to call you!"

Evelyn checked her phone. "How strange - it shut down by itself."

The colleague led her to a two-story building and handed her a key. "This is the best accommodation the company could arrange. Keep this safe. I need to return to headquarters now, but call me immediately if you need anything."
###Chapter 194

The examination ended, and the colleague descended the stairs.

Evelyn unlocked the second-floor apartment with her key. The space measured roughly three hundred square feet.

Pale wooden tiles covered the floor. A single bed and a modest wardrobe stood as the only furnishings.

Before she could unpack, another department's colleague appeared at her doorway.

A young man in his twenties lingered outside without entering. "You're Evelyn Sinclair from design, right? Pleasure to meet you. I'm Julian Montgomery."

"Likewise. Evelyn Sinclair." She greeted him politely.

Julian gestured downstairs. "The team hasn't eaten yet. Town restaurants proved... unsatisfactory. Some city girls couldn't stomach the conditions. Since our department lead mentioned you grew up here, we hoped you'd show us around. Maybe we could buy ingredients and cook lunch together."

Understanding dawned. Evelyn closed her trunk and nodded. "Of course. I'll come down now."

"No hurry. Settle in first." Julian nodded and left.

Her watch showed nearly two o'clock.

'We'll be preparing dinner at this rate!'

She grabbed her power bank, plugged in her phone, and abandoned unpacking. Keys and purse in hand, she followed Julian downstairs.

Multiple notifications buzzed.

Missed calls from Dominic. Then a text: [Call me when you're back online.]

Surrounded by colleagues, she typed instead: [Talk later. Grocery shopping with coworkers.]

Another message arrived mid-conversation: [Don't let me catch you cooking for other men!]

Dominic's signature possessiveness.

A City.

After leaving the hospital, Beatrice Lockwood visited her brother's residence.

Frederick Lockwood startled at his sister's abrupt appearance. "What's wrong? You seem agitated."

Eleanor Lockwood descended the staircase as Beatrice glanced between them. "What else? Your daughter-in-law's entanglement with my son."

Frederick and Eleanor's expressions soured. No parents wanted to hear about their daughter-in-law's alleged infidelity, even if plausible.

Beatrice pressed on despite their discomfort. "Last year, the company acquired full development rights to a town near A City. Your daughter-in-law from the design department went there." Her lips curled. "Only my intervention stopped my son from following!"

Frederick's head snapped up. "What?"

Eleanor, never fond of Beatrice, countered: "She's our daughter-in-law. He should know better!" Anger colored her tone.

"Sister-in-law, my son isn't the instigator!" Beatrice interjected. "Your daughter-in-law lures him. Would any red-blooded man refuse such advances?"

The argument escalated until Maxwell Lockwood descended, rubbing sleep from his eyes.

"Who's seducing whom now?"

Beatrice smiled sweetly from the sofa. "Who else but your wife? No ordinary woman could bewitch so thoroughly."

A caretaker offered Maxwell water. He drank deeply before retorting: "You're a woman too, Aunt Beatrice. Must every charming woman be branded a seductress?"

Beatrice bristled. "She fits the description! Poor family, ailing father and grandfather - survives by ensnaring men. If that's not a seductress-"

"By that logic, you seduced my wealthy late uncle-in-law. Doesn't that make you the grand seductress?" Maxwell's first-ever rebuttal stunned Beatrice.

Her face darkened instantly.

Yet Maxwell's casual smile left her guessing - was he joking?

Frederick, uncomfortable with domestic disputes involving his son, glanced at his wife.

Eleanor understood. "Maxwell, monitor your wife. You're legally married, announcements made. We tolerated this union solely because of her pregnancy!"

"Pregnant?" Beatrice's shock was palpable. "Since when?"

Eleanor confirmed with a nod. "Precisely why we accepted her. The Lockwood heir matters."

Beatrice struggled to process this revelation.

Eleanor continued: "She's your wife. If you won't safeguard her, why should we? She avoids us, yet risks our grandchild in some backwater town! Does she plan to miscarry 'accidentally'?"

Frederick, aging and desperate for a grandson, erupted. "Retrieve her immediately! After delivery, she can go wherever - but not now!" He jabbed a finger at Maxwell. "Go!"
###Chapter 195

After successfully stirring up trouble at the Lockwood residence, Beatrice returned home.

Back at the hospital, Beatrice found no sign of Margaret or Julian. Reginald Blackwood lay motionless on the hospital bed while Dominic sat vigil beside him.

Her son's worried expression spoke volumes about his concern for his grandfather's condition.

Watching this scene unfold, Beatrice secretly prayed for Reginald's slow recovery. If his condition worsened, Dominic would be forced to remain by his side!

This would prevent the Blackwood heir from returning to that insignificant town. Society's rigid expectations would brand him as an ungrateful grandson otherwise.

Beatrice felt her morality slipping away in her desperate attempts to separate Evelyn from Dominic.

She saw no alternative. If Dominic married Evelyn, her life would become unbearable. That girl was her personal curse!

The nurse arrived with Reginald's lunch tray.

Beatrice unpacked the meal containers from the bag. "Father, Eleanor prepared all your favorite dishes. They're specially designed for your health."

As she spoke, Beatrice settled beside the bed and began feeding Reginald.

Despite his illness, the old man maintained a healthy appetite.

After several minutes of silent feeding, Beatrice seized her opportunity. "There's something you should know, Father."

Reginald's silence signaled permission to continue.

Avoiding her son's gaze, Beatrice pressed on. "Earlier, Frederick summoned me to discuss important matters. While there, I learned... Evelyn is already carrying Maxwell's child."

The expected reaction came instantly - Reginald's face froze in shock.

If Evelyn truly loved his grandson and not that Lockwood boy, she should have preserved her purity for Dominic!

Had Maxwell forced himself upon her, Reginald would have him prosecuted immediately!

But secretly bearing another man's child? That constituted the ultimate betrayal of Dominic's trust.

This revelation blindsided the family patriarch.

"Absolute nonsense." Dominic's glare could have melted steel as he addressed his grandfather. "That's a fabricated story Maxwell concocted to appease his father."

Beatrice hadn't anticipated this twist...

Her nerves tightened like coiled springs...

The mother-son tension reached breaking point. Distracted, she nearly fumbled the spoon from her trembling fingers.

Meanwhile, in the small town...

Evelyn had prepared all the ingredients but refused to cook. She'd purchased new cutlery, cookware, and other kitchen essentials.

She handled every household chore except the actual cooking.

The young colleagues bonded over shared meals and casual conversation.

After dinner, they cracked open some beers.

Evelyn, with her low alcohol tolerance, only sipped at her glass.

While cleaning up, Julian Montgomery exclaimed excitedly, "The air here is incredible! I can't wait to see this place after development."

The town itself held little charm beyond its surrounding natural beauty.

Their temporary residence would allow firsthand experience of local culture and scenery - crucial for drafting the perfect project proposal.

Evelyn stood at the kitchen sink, washing dishes.

Suddenly, a car pulled up outside.

Everyone turned toward the sound, but Evelyn's position blocked her view.

A Porsche Cayenne rolled to a stop before the two-story compound. Two figures emerged - one from the driver's seat, one from the passenger side.

The passenger announced, "This is the place! I'll be heading home now!"

Maxwell produced several crisp bills from his wallet and handed them over.

The local pocketed the money and hurried off happily.

Town development plans had been public knowledge for years.

The arrival of corporate representatives made front-page news for the small community.

Everyone knew about their presence.

Having lost contact with Evelyn - unanswered calls and messages - Maxwell had inquired locally until someone directed him here.

The T Corporation employees in the courtyard didn't recognize Maxwell, but his expensive car and attire made them cautious. Could he be corporate management conducting surprise inspections?

"Can someone point me to Evelyn Sinclair?" Maxwell's tone and demeanor screamed street thug.

Someone gestured toward the kitchen.

Maxwell turned and strode in that direction.

Evelyn stood at the sink, water cascading over several glasses. The rushing water drowned out all other sounds.

As she focused on the sparkling clean dishes, strong arms suddenly encircled her from behind.

In the courtyard, Julian gaped at the kitchen scene.

The sink faced the entrance directly, allowing clear visibility from outside while blocking the washer's view.

"Isn't she... with the boss..." Julian averted his eyes awkwardly, addressing a design department colleague.

Evelyn worked in design, so Julian assumed they'd know more.

The equally confused colleague whipped out her phone, gossiping to A City contacts immediately.

Inside the kitchen, Evelyn dropped her pot with a clatter, scrambling backward in alarm at Maxwell's sudden appearance.

"Is this any way for a wife to react to her husband's embrace?" Maxwell remained unbothered - he didn't actually care for Evelyn. But her subtle feminine fragrance intrigued him.

It smelled surprisingly pleasant.

Meanwhile outside, the colleague received a voice message: "Evelyn has no relationship with the boss. Yvette clarified this morning - she's the wife of the boss's uncle's son. Complicated family tree. The boss shows concern because they're relatives. Also, rumor has it Evelyn's pregnant - hence the special attention." The message came from an off-duty colleague.

Abigail Thornton, planning to work late, shot the messenger a sharp look.

Another message followed: "Who else would grab Evelyn's waist in public except her husband? Give them privacy!"

Abigail immediately texted Sebastian Whitmore:

[What's happening? Word is Maxwell Lockwood showed up in town making moves on Evelyn. Does the boss know?]
###Chapter 196

Sebastian Whitmore was waiting outside the school gates when Evelyn's message came through. The Blackwood twins would be out any minute now.

"Uncle Sebastian!" Isabella came running out first, throwing herself into his arms.

He scooped her up effortlessly with one arm while taking Alexander's hand with the other. Together, they walked toward the sleek black car parked nearby.

"When will Daddy pick us up again?" Alexander asked, though he already knew the answer.

Dominic Blackwood was always busy. Even when he was home, he was distant—more like a shadow than a father.

Now that he had finally started warming up to them, he'd vanished without a word for two whole days.

Isabella, now buckled into her seat, turned wide eyes toward Sebastian, waiting for his response.

Sebastian shut the car door firmly before answering. "Your father has urgent business. I'll ask him when he can make time."

He slid into the driver's seat, started the engine, and sent Evelyn's intel straight to Dominic.

Ten minutes later, new instructions arrived.

The twins exchanged confused glances as the car veered onto an unfamiliar road.

"Uncle Sebastian, this isn't the way home," Alexander said, straining against his seatbelt to peer out the window.

Sebastian's grip on the wheel tightened. "We're going to see your father."

Meanwhile, in the small town...

Evelyn Sinclair wiped down the last dish with more force than necessary.

The courtyard had gone quiet after the Porsche's arrival. Her colleagues, sensing tension, had discreetly retreated to their rooms.

Maxwell Lockwood leaned against the kitchen doorway, watching her. "First time I've seen you do housework since we got married. When are you cooking for your in-laws?"

Evelyn ignored him, slamming the teacup into the cupboard.

She dried her hands and strode toward the stairs, only for Maxwell to grab her wrist from behind.

"Let go!" she snapped, twisting free.

His grip was iron, his smile deceptively pleasant. "Must we always fight? We're husband and wife."

"Since when?" Evelyn scoffed. "Show me the marriage certificate, and I'll show you scrap paper."

She yanked her hand away.

Upstairs, her colleagues watched through closed windows as the argument unfolded silently below.

Back in her room, Evelyn locked the door and pulled her laptop onto the small floor table.

Her phone rang—Victor Langley, the high-profile lawyer.

"Evelyn," he said without preamble. "Send me your location. I'm coming now."

"Can't this wait until tomorrow?"

"Dominic's orders. He wants progress on the divorce."

Evelyn's gaze flicked to the window, where Maxwell was playing with a stray puppy.

So that was why Victor couldn't meet Maxwell in the city.

Maxwell must have suspected Victor was working for Dominic.

Now that Maxwell was here, Victor could corner him.

She sent her location.

An hour later, darkness fell.

Maxwell knocked on her door.

Evelyn hesitated. If she refused, he might leave—and Victor would miss him.

She unlocked the door and returned to her work.

"Too busy for me?" Maxwell entered, glancing around before sitting cross-legged on the floor.

Eventually, he stretched out, his gaze drifting from her laptop to her face.

By the time Victor arrived, Maxwell was asleep.

"Apologies for disturbing you, Mr. Lockwood," Victor said smoothly.

Maxwell's eyes snapped open, landing on the lawyer's face.

"Took some effort to track you down," Victor continued, setting a stack of papers between them. "But worth it."

Maxwell scanned the divorce agreement, then the empty room.

Evelyn was gone.

His jaw tightened. She set me up.
###Chapter 197

Evelyn was nowhere to be seen.

Dominic might not care about others' opinions, but he refused to become the laughingstock of T Corporation's employees.

He left town to avoid appearing desperate in his pursuit of Evelyn.

Victor Langley carefully placed the divorce papers and signing pen back into his briefcase.

Without delay, he returned to his car and followed the "defendant" of this divorce case out of town.

As he drove, Victor took a sip of his energy drink. In his nearly thirty years of life, this marked the first time he'd personally tracked down a defendant.

No other client had ever received such personalized service.

Frankly speaking, divorce cases rarely warranted his attention - unless they involved billionaires!

After the cars departed, whispers erupted among the colleagues upstairs.

With doors left ajar, Julian Montgomery overheard female coworkers gossiping while distributing bottled water. "Can you believe Victor Langley actually came here?" one whispered. "Why would he?" another questioned.

"Why else? I heard both Victor and Evelyn's Cayenne-driving husband left her room consecutively. Victor mentioned divorce papers, and her husband actually said, 'I never agreed to divorce. The thought never crossed my mind.' Clearly Evelyn wants out..."

"The man in the Cayenne - rumored to be the boss's cousin - refuses to let go..."

"Following that logic, Evelyn must have hired Victor to negotiate with her husband."

Julian froze mid-motion, the Red Bull can suspended in air.

"Just who is Evelyn from design? Money alone can't hire Victor Langley. We're talking about the legendary lawyer, not some random street firm attorney."

Even with money, Evelyn lacked the social status.

'No idea,' the colleague shrugged.

Meanwhile, Evelyn stood before her grandfather's weathered house.

Before traveling to this small town, Evelyn had visited her grandfather. She'd reminded him about taking medication regularly and getting proper rest.

Her grandfather insisted she focus on work instead of worrying about him. Ambition was good, but overworking wasn't wise.

Before leaving, Evelyn had obtained the house key.

While Maxwell slept inside, Evelyn received Victor's text.

Victor had only located the general area from her directions, unaware of the specific room.

Evelyn carefully slipped out without disturbing Maxwell, meeting Victor in the courtyard.

After providing the room number, Victor assured her he'd handle everything. He suggested she stay away temporarily, in case Maxwell reacted badly.

For her city-bred colleagues, this rundown town offered nothing. Evelyn understood - she'd grown up differently, in far worse conditions.

This "dingy little town" held special meaning for her.

Retrieving the key, she pushed open the rusted steel gate, stepping into the overgrown courtyard.

This abandoned space held countless childhood memories.

At six years old, her grandfather kept geese.

They'd feed the goslings grass. Her grandfather would chop fresh greens on a stone block while she scooped the pieces into their bowl.

She once asked, "Grandpa, Mommy hasn't visited in years. What if I see her in town and she doesn't recognize me?" "Don't you like living with Grandpa? Where your mother is, there's no geese, no fresh grass, no clean air!"

Young Evelyn understood her grandfather knew her mother's whereabouts.

Even now, she suspected both grandfather and father believed Beatrice Lockwood had borne her for the Sinclair family.

Her grandfather seemed to have no memory of Beatrice.

After decades, he'd likely forgotten his seldom-seen daughter-in-law's name.

Yet her father - now hospitalized with lung cancer - appeared unaware she probably wasn't Beatrice's child.

If true, who had given birth to her?

Her father never mentioned other women besides Beatrice. He should know her true origins - so why believe it was Beatrice?

In City A...

Reginald Blackwood awoke around nine, parched.

Scanning the room, he found Dominic absent. Only a nurse, his treasured great-grandchildren Alexander and Isabella, and Sebastian Whitmore remained.

"Where's Dominic..." Reginald rasped.

Sebastian remained expressionless. "The boss went to purchase study materials for Alexander and Isabella," he explained.

"Why go himself..." Reginald clearly doubted this.

Isabella rubbed her eyes sleepily. "Teacher assigned homework. She wants parents to buy materials personally so they know what we're learning. Daddy had to visit a specific store. Otherwise, teacher will scold us in class."

Sebastian nodded ruefully. "Let's hope he gets the right items!"

Reginald scoffed. "He's grown. Can't handle something so simple?"

Sebastian continued, "Normally I buy their supplies. The boss avoids crowded places." "Avoids crowds! Does he think other parents will swoon over his looks? Such arrogance!" Reginald seized the chance to criticize his admittedly handsome grandson. "If he'd avoided flirting, Alexander and Isabella might still have their mother. Look what he's done..."

He'd caught Evelyn's eye, but things turned awkward.

What good were looks and wealth? Nearly thirty and still single - worse off than less attractive, less wealthy men.

After thoroughly "criticizing" his grandson, Reginald drifted back to sleep.

Meanwhile, in the small town...

Night brought quietude, contrasting sharply with the city's bustle.

Evelyn's colleagues prepared for bed when engine sounds interrupted.

Peering out, they recognized the boss's distinctive car model immediately.

Employees - male and female alike - hastily dressed and gathered in the courtyard.

Dominic remained in his parked car. Surveying the crowd, he asked, "Is Evelyn asleep?" "Um...I don't think so," a female colleague answered after glancing at a dark second-floor window. "She went out earlier - said she'd visit her childhood home. Told us not to worry."

"Get some rest," Dominic said curtly before reversing and driving away.
###Chapter 198

The moment Dominic's car vanished from the courtyard, the workers lost all desire to sleep.

Their boss had appeared out of nowhere and disappeared just as quickly, like a fleeting shadow.

Yet an inexplicable tension hung in the air.

It felt like an unannounced inspection—one where they had failed to meet expectations.

Julian couldn't hold back his curiosity any longer. "What's the deal between our boss and that cousin of his with the Cayenne?"

His colleagues exchanged glances before shaking their heads.

"How would we know?" one of the women answered. "Dominic keeps his personal life locked down tight. Even the paparazzi can't dig up anything."

The only glimpse they'd ever gotten was a single photo in a high-end magazine—Dominic taking his twins out for breakfast at dawn.

Half the women in the office had bought that issue. They sighed over how their boss wasn't just devastatingly handsome and successful, but also a devoted single father.

The same female colleague kept that photo on her desk, glancing at it whenever she needed motivation to work harder—and maybe, just maybe, find a man like him someday.

Julian frowned, wide awake now. He grabbed his jacket. "Anyone want to help me look for Evelyn? We came here as a team. What if she wandered off alone and got into trouble?"

If something happened to her, explaining it to upper management would be a nightmare.

This town might seem quaint, but danger lurked everywhere.

The female colleague volunteered immediately. "I'll go. She mentioned where her old house was when we passed it earlier. I can take you there."

The others nodded. "Be careful."

As the Range Rover's taillights faded into the distance, the two set off with flashlights in hand.

Meanwhile, at the old house, Evelyn froze as Dominic materialized before her.

He had left the city without telling anyone—not Reginald, not even her.

"What are you doing here...?" she blurted.

Dominic stepped into the overgrown courtyard, his presence cutting through the darkness like a blade.

"It's late. Why aren't you asleep?"

His polished shoes crushed the wild grass underfoot, each step radiating quiet dominance.

He was like a forbidden drug—irresistible yet lethal.

When he stopped in front of her, Evelyn's gaze dropped, her pulse erratic. "How's your grandfather?"

"Stable." His eyes never left her.

They'd planned to come here together, but he'd stood her up. Only later did she learn Reginald had been hospitalized after a heart attack.

Dominic hadn't explained the cause, but Evelyn could guess—Beatrice had likely told him about finding them together that morning.

Reginald tolerated her presence, but that didn't mean he condoned his grandson sneaking out of another man's wife's bedroom at dawn.

"Does your grandfather know you're here?" she asked, desperate to fill the heavy silence.

The only sounds were crickets and her own unsteady breathing.

Dominic studied her for a long moment before lighting a cigarette without answering.

Evelyn's attention snagged on his fingers—long, deft, impossibly masculine.

He noticed her staring but said nothing, deliberately bringing the cigarette to his lips.

Her gaze followed the movement, colliding with his when she looked up. Heat flooded her cheeks.

The air between them thickened.

"You drove three hours," she stammered. "Have you eaten? I could—"

She turned to leave, but his hand caught her wrist.

In one fluid motion, he spun her around and pulled her against him.

Evelyn's heart hammered. Every inch of him overwhelmed her—the sharp angles of his face, the scent of tobacco and something uniquely him.

His arm locked around her waist. "It was a long drive. I'm starving."

"I'll... take you to get food..."

His grip tightened. Suddenly, he turned her, crushing his mouth to hers.

"Only one thing can satisfy my hunger tonight," he growled against her lips.
###Chapter 199

Evelyn couldn't resist Dominic's wild, possessive kiss.

Their mingled breaths created an intoxicating blend of familiarity and forbidden desire.

That morning's near-miss encounter had left Dominic ravenous. Now, with her lips against his again, he transformed into something primal.

His teeth grazed her swollen mouth with unrestrained hunger.

Though she whimpered in protest, he only deepened the kiss. He wanted to consume her entirely, claim the body that had haunted his dreams.

Dominic behaved like a child discovering chocolate for the first time.

He'd craved Evelyn's curves for years. This morning had offered his first taste of her addictive sweetness.

Given such temptation, any man would act the same - tearing away wrappings to savor the treasure beneath, melting it with his heat, owning every sensation...

Dominic devoured Evelyn with the same single-minded intensity.

"Mmm..."

Her knees buckled as Dominic's strong arms enveloped her. His mouth burned hotter than the summer sun.

She drowned in his savage possession...

Rational thought evaporated. Propriety meant nothing. Only Dominic's hands and tongue guided her now.

The crisp mountain air should have refreshed her. Instead, she gasped for breath, intoxicated by his dangerous masculine scent.

It was pure pheromones - raw and unfiltered.

When Dominic finally allowed her to breathe, she barely managed two shuddering gasps before he recaptured her mouth.

The cycle repeated endlessly.

A breeze carried the scent of dewy grass through the abandoned house. Rather than clearing her head, the earthy fragrance only heightened her intoxication.

His kisses grew more demanding. The hand beneath her blouse burned hotter with each passing second.

"Let's move to the bedroom," Dominic murmured against her lips.

His words jolted Evelyn back to reality. She pushed against his unyielding chest. "Aren't you... supposed to leave tonight?"

Before he could answer, she added hastily, "Your grandfather wouldn't approve—"

Dominic's grip tightened around her waist, though his expression cleared slightly.

Evelyn knew she loved this man completely. What began as a student's admiration for her professor had evolved into something deeper - awe for his accomplishments, pride in their connection.

Then came the shocking realization that she carried his children. That she, of all women, had given the great Dominic Blackwood twins.

The knowledge filled her with dizzying joy, especially knowing he still desired her.

This was no schoolgirl crush, but mature, passionate love - a mutual craving of body and soul.

Dominic's gaze turned predatory. "What does my grandfather's opinion matter?"

His deep voice vibrated through her as he swept her off her feet!

Carrying her past the overgrown yard, Dominic headed for the front door.

"What are you doing? You can't—" Evelyn squirmed in panic as he effortlessly held her.

"What do you think I'm doing?"

He fished the keys from her pocket with practiced ease.

The larger key opened the rusted gate. The smaller one turned in the weathered door lock.

Handling the old-fashioned key transported Dominic back to his student days, when he'd lived in the town's finest two-story home.

"Evelyn? Are you there?" Julian's voice carried through the night as his flashlight beam cut through the darkness.

He spoke carefully - loud enough to be heard, but not so loud as to disturb neighbors.

The unlocked gate swung slightly in the breeze.

His light revealed a courtyard cluttered with decaying relics of rural life - objects no city dweller would recognize, let alone know how to use.

The place gave him chills. Not everyone appreciated such primitive surroundings.

"Doesn't look like she's here. This place gives me the creeps," Abigail whispered, arms crossed against the chill.

"Are you sure this is the right house?" Julian swept his flashlight beam across the crumbling walls.

"We only saw it from the road. I remembered the roof height and window quality to assess the property value," she explained through chattering teeth.

The mountain night air bit sharply.

Julian guided his shivering colleague away. "Probably left unlocked because there's nothing worth stealing."

Abigail nodded. "If this was her childhood home, she's likely staying with relatives."

Their voices faded into the night.

Outside, Julian's flashlight illuminated the CEO's parked car. "Why would Mr. Blackwood come here? Mediating for his cousin? Marrying the boss's relative is one thing, but having him salvage your relationship?"

The colleagues departed, unaware.

Inside the darkened house...

No lights burned.

Thick dust coated the damp northern bedroom's mattress - hardly inviting.

Evelyn yanked the southern window's thin curtain shut when she spotted the flashlight beams, though the room was already pitch black.

At that exact moment, Dominic entered her from behind.

Their ragged breathing filled the ancient house...
###Chapter 200

Evelyn bit back her moans. Her body arched taut as her fingers clutched the flimsy curtain before her...

The fabric gave way under her grip. When Dominic thrust deeper, she gasped sharply.

Her vision blurred. The curtain slipped from her fingers...

"Eve." Dominic's lips brushed her nape. Moonlight painted her skin like polished ivory.

He moved with deliberate slowness, marking every inch of her exposed flesh.

Defenseless against his invading mouth, Evelyn arched her neck, pressing flush against the chilled window.

Dominic advanced relentlessly, each inch claiming her with possessive precision. Her breathing grew erratic.

Short, shallow gasps kept her from drowning in sensation.

The night air chilled. When Evelyn opened her eyes, her breath fogged the glass.

The initial discomfort lasted mere minutes before dissolving into mind-numbing pleasure...

A sensation she knew too well.

Whether five years ago when she'd grown accustomed to his touch, or their recent hotel encounter - the same tremors coursed through her...

Dominic's palm pressed against her abdomen, rubbing circles on the fogged glass while his other hand gathered her blouse.

He sensed her surrender. "You like this..." The words came between ragged breaths.

His sudden thrust punctuated the question...

Words failed Evelyn. When his mouth claimed hers, only breathy whimpers escaped...

The moon climbed higher.

Crickets' chirping drowned beneath their synchronized panting.

Dominic knew she craved him - would do anything to keep him. At this moment, he felt like candy melting in her mouth.

And she the greedy child, swallowing him whole.

Dominic's darkened gaze found Evelyn's face when they finally turned to each other. Her raven hair spilled over his arms.

The unheated house should've chilled them, yet she shook her head, murmuring about unbearable heat...

Dominic couldn't decipher whether she begged for more or less- "Mmm," he groaned, experiencing something unprecedented.

Like hard candy softening in a warm mouth, dissolving under persistent tongue strokes, flavor spreading...

The candy might resist at first, but saliva and motion would eventually make it yield...

Upon entering and spotting their intruding colleagues, Dominic had tossed his phone onto the narrow sill.

Their frenzied movements jostled the wall, sending the device clattering to the floor.

When Dominic lifted Evelyn to eye level, their gazes locked - souls laid bare.

The phone's vibration barely registered until its dim glow caught her attention.

Someone was calling...

"Focus!" Only Evelyn's exquisite form mattered now. Nothing else existed.

His gravelly voice shattered her resistance. Too intoxicating...

Only then did she realize her scandalous position - legs wrapped around his waist, toes curling against his shirt.

She never imagined surrendering so completely... so shamelessly...

"Ah!" Dominic punished her distraction by pressing her harder against the window.

One lost shoe left her barefoot. Her toes rubbed circles against his lower back.

She hadn't sought this recklessness.

Yet Dominic forced her to confront it.

Restraint abandoned, he drove into her relentlessly, their impact rattling the flimsy glass.

When his mouth sealed over hers, each breath became a struggle.

Breaking free, Evelyn's cries filled the musty old house.

"Ah! Ngh... yes... more..."

Morning brought a knock at Evelyn's door.

Julian noticed the female colleague in the hallway. "Did Evelyn return last night?" he asked.

"I heard movement. She's definitely inside," came the hushed reply.

The colleague recalled faint noises around 1 AM - possibly male voices.

Half-asleep, she couldn't identify the man.

Peering outside, she'd seen departing headlights too bright to reveal the car model.

From the engine's purr, it could've been the boss's Range Rover or Evelyn's husband's Porsche.

"Evelyn? You awake?" Gentle knocks followed.

Enough to rouse someone awake, not enough to wake the sleeping.

Receiving no response, the colleague descended.

By 8 AM, breakfast awaited in the courtyard.

"Should we wake Evelyn?" Julian asked.

"Let her rest," the female colleague insisted. "She might need it."

Julian reluctantly sat.

The women who'd been with lovers understood - post-intimacy exhaustion often demanded all-day bedrest.

If Evelyn returned late, perhaps her husband had persuaded her home for a reunion.

As T Corporation employees ate, approaching headlights made them straighten.

Why was the boss arriving so early?
###Chapter 201

The sleek Bentley limousine remained parked outside the courtyard instead of driving in.

Dominic wasn't behind the wheel today.

Sebastian stepped out after parking and opened the rear door with practiced ease.

The CEO emerged with his two children in tow.

As always, Dominic looked impeccable in his tailored suit and polished leather shoes. Yet there was an unusual spark in his eyes, the corners of his mouth lifting slightly as if privy to some delightful secret.

Isabella nestled in her father's arms, breathing in his familiar cologne, while Alexander dashed ahead excitedly with his backpack bouncing.

"Good morning, handsome young man!" One of the female staff members called out.

'This trip was absolutely worth it!'

'The accommodations might not be five-star, but getting to see the boss's striking features and adorable kids?'

'Pure bliss!'

Alexander scanned the crowd but didn't spot Miss Evelyn. Still, he remembered his manners. "Good morning, lovely lady!"

The compliment made the woman beam.

Julian took charge, maintaining order amidst the morning chaos.

He approached Sebastian for a handshake.

As everyone settled for breakfast, a female colleague noticed Dominic walking alone toward the two-story dormitory building.

His right hand carried what appeared to be a takeaway bag.

'The CEO personally delivering breakfast to his cousin's wife...'

Truth was, Sebastian hadn't had time to eat before driving. The children had woken at dawn, insisting on coming along.

"Isabella, what would you like for breakfast?" Sebastian gestured with both hands - toast and milk on one side, steamed buns and oatmeal on the other.

"Oatmeal, please." Isabella pulled a picture book from her backpack, showing the adults. "Daddy got this for me. I'll earn full points if I read it..."

Upstairs in her room...

Evelyn didn't stir from the commotion below or the knock at her door. It was her vibrating phone that finally roused her.

She'd been having phone issues lately - the device shutting off randomly despite having 60% battery.

She'd considered ordering a new one online or visiting a reputable store in town.

Answering calls had become a game of chance...

The caller ID showed an unknown number, but she answered anyway.

"Evelyn? It's Lorraine, your mother-in-law." The voice came through clearly.

Evelyn curled deeper into her blanket. "I recognize your voice. What can I do for you?" Her tone remained polite yet distant.

Lorraine bristled at the formal address. It felt like Evelyn was deliberately keeping the Tanner family at arm's length.

"Let me be direct. My son informed me you're carrying his child. As both your mother-in-law and a woman who's been through pregnancy, I advise you to rest more. Why work in that backwater town when you could have comfortable employment in A City?"

She'd expected Maxwell to bring Evelyn back yesterday.

Instead, her son returned alone.

Maxwell had avoided her questions, drowning his sorrows at a bar with friends until dawn.

He'd only woken in the afternoon.

Concerned for her supposed grandchild, Lorraine made the call.

Evelyn felt groggy and parched. She sat up, phone pressed to her ear.

Entering the tiny bathroom, she rinsed with mouthwash, immediately feeling more alert. "What child? There must be some misunderstanding."

Before she could explain, Lorraine's phone pinged with a delivery notification.

"Wait, I'm coming!" Lorraine exclaimed.

Evelyn didn't respond or hang up. She wasn't sure how seriously to take Lorraine's pregnancy assumption, but she needed to clarify the misunderstanding.

Meanwhile in A City, Lorraine signed for the package while keeping an eye on her call screen, ensuring Evelyn hadn't disconnected.

The recipient name read "Evelyn Sinclair."

On impulse - perhaps suspecting her daughter-in-law of deception - she opened it.

The lightweight package contained only a single sheet.

A medical examination report.

As a former office worker, Lorraine recognized it as the standard employee health check. That's how she'd first learned of her own pregnancy with Maxwell.

Many newlywed women discovered their condition through such routine exams.

Scanning the report, Lorraine found no indicators of pregnancy.

Evelyn's words echoed: "What child? There must be some misunderstanding."

The realization hit - her son had lied to gain parental support!

Back in the small town...

Sebastian received a delivery confirmation during breakfast.

Upstairs...

Evelyn prepared to explain when she realized Lorraine had ended the call.

She stood frozen in the bathroom momentarily before checking the time. Despite feeling unwell, work awaited.

Tucking her phone away, she washed her face with cleansing foam.

As she patted dry, movement caught her eye - a man now occupied her modest room.

Dominic placed the takeaway bag on the table, steam still rising from its contents.

Water droplets clung to Evelyn's flawless complexion - those delicate brows, soulful eyes, lips slightly swollen from last night's passion...

Her hand froze mid-motion. She'd expected this confrontation, just not so soon.

Before she could react, Dominic closed the distance, crushing her against him in a searing kiss as he kicked the bathroom door shut.

"Mmm...ah..."

The embers of last night's passion reignited instantly.

Shameful memories assaulted their senses, demolishing all restraint.

Dominic devoured Evelyn's lips hungrily. After last night's struggle, his suppressed desire had erupted uncontrollably. Nipping her earlobe, he growled, "I love the sounds you make..."
###Chapter 202

The morning sun painted golden streaks across the courtyard below.

Breakfast consisted of steamed buns purchased by early shift colleagues, while Margaret Whitmore prepared oatmeal in the small kitchen. Everyone agreed the store-bought oats tasted too coarse.

It was Alexander and Isabella's first time tasting small-town homemade buns. The twins devoured two each, still hungry for more.

Isabella stuffed her cheeks full, blinking pleadingly at Uncle Sebastian. "More please?" she mumbled through her mouthful.

"Easy there." Dominic ruffled his daughter's hair. "I'll get more for everyone," he announced to the team.

The sudden arrival of their CEO, his assistant, and two children had stretched their breakfast supplies thin.

The town square buzzed with activity.

Sebastian stood before a food cart, ordering fifteen chicken buns. As he reached for his wallet, a well-dressed woman in her thirties entered the courtyard.

"That'll be $27," said the vendor, handing over the steaming package.

"Thank you," Sebastian replied courteously.

Returning, he found the stranger standing before their communal table. "Excuse me," the woman asked politely, "is Evelyn Sinclair here?"

All eyes turned toward the elegant newcomer, then instinctively sought Sebastian's reaction.

With their CEO upstairs, Sebastian was the acting authority.

The woman clutched a limited-edition Hermès bag, her porcelain skin flawless. Noticing everyone's gaze shift, she turned to face Sebastian.

At nearly forty, Sebastian remained composed. "May I ask who's inquiring?"

"Gwendolyn Sinclair. Evelyn's aunt. Locals mentioned seeing her here," she explained.

Sebastian handed the buns to Julian Montgomery. "Evelyn's still upstairs with Mr. Blackwood. Would you care to wait?"

"Could I go up?" Gwendolyn's eagerness showed through her polished demeanor.

"Apologies, Ms. Sinclair. They may be discussing private matters."

Gwendolyn nodded understandingly.

Sebastian offered her a chair and breakfast, which she declined with practiced grace.

Upstairs, Dominic had Evelyn pinned beneath him, their passion unquenchable. The small room grew stifling...

Evelyn's skin glistened with sweat in the morning light.

Her leg bent at an impossible angle under Dominic's insistence.

"Please... stop... I can't... ah!" Her protests dissolved into moans as he drove deeper.

Her body arched, split open by his relentless invasion. She teetered on the edge of consciousness.

Yet shamefully, after last night's marathon, her traitorous body craved more of his savage possession...

The primal sounds echoing through the room made Evelyn acutely aware of the damp sheets beneath them.

The sizable wet patch.

The uncomfortable stickiness coating her skin.

Breakfast vendors outside began packing up. Colleagues' laughter drifted through the window.

After relentless frontal assault, Dominic flipped her onto her stomach. The wooden floor protested their rhythm.

Evelyn muffled her cries into the pillow, the bedframe creaking violently. When their climax came simultaneously, she collapsed into exhausted stillness...

Sunlight burned her bleary eyes.

As Dominic withdrew, she glimpsed his satisfied smirk through half-lidded eyes.

Her throat felt scorched, limbs leaden.

The room looked like a warzone - clothes strewn from bathroom to bed, her trunk overturned, floorboards loosened...

The realization made her breath hitch.

Dominic's early arrival surely drew attention. Had anyone heard...?

She prayed not.

The room reeked of sex and sweat.

When Evelyn struggled to focus, Dominic stood before her - immaculate in his three-piece suit, damp towel in hand.

Only his flushed cheeks betrayed their recent activities.

"Shower yourself or shall I?" His deep voice vibrated through her.

Too humiliated to move, Evelyn stayed buried under covers.

Dominic peeled them back with surprising gentleness, carefully wiping her down as if handling fragile porcelain.

"I'll do it." She somehow found strength to sit up.

Dominic paused, towel suspended. Towering over her, his hungry gaze made her shiver. Without warning, he scooped her up.

"No! Put me down!" Panic laced her voice as she stared at his chiseled features.
###Chapter 203

Evelyn could feel the dangerous energy radiating from Dominic's powerful frame. Yet she also remembered how tender he could be when they were alone.

He wasn't threatening - just insatiable.

Her pulse quickened as she recalled the impressive bulge in his trousers last night. Just the memory made her mouth go dry.

"You... should wait outside. I can shower alone."

After their multiple passionate encounters, Evelyn couldn't meet his gaze without blushing.

That shabby old house had transformed last night, filled with heat and passion instead of dust and decay.

Dominic's hungry kisses and ragged breathing had drowned out the musty smells. She'd surrendered completely, melting into his embrace.

Then came the car ride this morning...

Evelyn was convinced Dominic was some kind of incubus. Day or night, he always wanted her.

Hadn't they done it enough times already?

Thankfully, darkness had hidden her flushed face last night. But morning light revealed everything - including their early session.

She was shocked at how quickly she'd adapted. From untouched to thoroughly claimed in such a short time...

"Still shy? I've explored every inch of you." Dominic's deep voice rumbled as he captured her lips again, teasing them open with his tongue.

Evelyn's weak protest only seemed to encourage him. Her half-hearted resistance looked more like an invitation.

Soon, she was thoroughly ravished once more.

Afterwards, Evelyn could barely stand. Her legs felt like jelly.

When they finally emerged, she deliberately kept her distance, pretending they were just employer and employee. She needed to remember that - before he literally loved her to death.

Sebastian watched as his boss and Evelyn exited separately. Dominic looked impeccable as always in his tailored suit.

Evelyn wore faded jeans and a simple blouse, clutching her laptop. The picture of professionalism.

No one would guess what they'd been doing.

The other colleagues noticed their arrival too.

One woman approached Evelyn with genuine concern. "We saved you some breakfast - oatmeal and buns."

She'd definitely noticed Dominic carrying a food bag upstairs earlier.

Evelyn hesitated. "Thank you, but I've... already eaten."

Dominic had force-fed her a nutritious meal upstairs. She couldn't stomach more food now.

Besides, everyone had seen him visit her room. Lying would only raise suspicions.

"Miss Evelyn!" Isabella came running, hugging Evelyn's legs with her chubby arms.

Evelyn had known the twins were here, but Dominic had kept her occupied. She set down her laptop and knelt to embrace the little girl.

"I missed you..." she whispered, pressing her forehead to Isabella's.

The child misunderstood and planted a wet kiss on Evelyn's cheek instead.

Evelyn smiled, relieved. She didn't want anyone hearing how much she'd missed her boss's children.

Especially since everyone thought she was still married to Maxwell.

In their eyes, it made sense she'd be close with Dominic's kids - he was Maxwell's cousin after all.

Family ties explained everything.

Jason waited patiently before approaching. "Ms. Sinclair claims to be your aunt."

Evelyn turned to see the expensively dressed woman beside him.

Gwendolyn's designer handbag and jewelry outshone even the T Corporation executives.

"Bea?" Gwendolyn smiled brightly.

Evelyn nodded cautiously. "Nice to meet you. I'm Evelyn Sinclair."

She barely knew this aunt who'd married a Japanese man and moved abroad. They'd never spoken.

Her grandfather had mentioned Gwendolyn's recent divorce and return. She'd brought him back to this old house before disappearing.

Oddly, Gwendolyn had arrived with luxury luggage. If she was so wealthy, why abandon her elderly father in this backwater town?
###Chapter 204

Evelyn and Gwendolyn retreated upstairs for a private conversation.

Dominic was engrossed in an international conference call.

Through the glass doors, he observed their stiff body language. Though he couldn't make out their words, the tension between them was palpable. As he ended the call, his gaze followed their disappearing figures around the corridor bend.

"She claims to be Evelyn's aunt."

Sebastian approached with his report.

Dominic turned, his voice clipped. "Run a full background check on this so-called aunt."

Sebastian gave a curt nod before withdrawing.

Dominic's piercing stare lifted to the second-floor window left ajar. His expression remained unreadable, though his pulse betrayed him.

Upstairs, Evelyn fidgeted nervously.

This wasn't just their first meeting—it was the first time she'd encountered the mysterious aunt from family whispers. Worse, she feared the room still carried traces of Dominic's lingering cologne.

She felt like a teenager caught in a lie.

Gwendolyn's curious gaze swept the space. "That man who came down with you—"

"My employer," Evelyn cut in too quickly.

At twenty-three, Evelyn hadn't mastered the art of deception. Her tells were obvious—the slight tremor in her hands, the way her gaze darted away.

Gwendolyn noted everything. Her niece remained refreshingly transparent, lacking the polished deceit of high society.

Or perhaps, she mused, the girl simply didn't trust her enough yet to bother with proper lies.

Strangely, this endeared Evelyn to her more.

Gwendolyn patted the bedspread. "Sit with me."

Evelyn perched on the edge, fingers nervously smoothing nonexistent wrinkles. A fresh wave of guilt hit—until she remembered the housekeeper had changed the linens that morning.

The crisp autumn breeze carried away any lingering traces of their earlier indiscretion.

"Your grandfather and father—they're with you now?" Gwendolyn's question held weight.

Evelyn's nod was stiff with unspoken accusation.

"My father stayed in A City, but I brought Grandfather with me." Her voice turned sharp. "No granddaughter could abandon him in that crumbling house—eating alone, sleeping alone, living like some forgotten relic."

Gwendolyn's shoulders slumped. "My fault entirely." Her fingers twisted the watch on her wrist. "Post-divorce depression nearly killed me—literally." With sudden decisiveness, she removed her timepiece, revealing a lattice of silvery scars.

Evelyn's breath caught.

"Multiple attempts," Gwendolyn said matter-of-factly. "Your grandfather found me bleeding out once." A humorless smile twisted her lips. "Funny how we develop preferences—wrist-cutting's terribly inefficient. Messy. Painful."

Evelyn studied her aunt's composed face. How could someone recount such darkness with clinical detachment?

The chill down her spine had nothing to do with the autumn air.

Cancer had ravaged her father's body, yet never his spirit. What demons had broken this woman so completely?

The watch clicked back into place. "I need a favor." Gwendolyn's voice softened. "You're the only family I have left."

"Name it." Evelyn would help—within reason.

"A trust for your grandfather." Gwendolyn chose her words carefully. "Elderly care is expensive, and illness strikes without warning. I'd feel better knowing funds are immediately accessible through your account."

Evelyn frowned. "You're not staying in A City?"

Gwendolyn hesitated, then laid bare her constraints—legal entanglements preventing direct contact. The truth, she hoped, would secure her niece's cooperation.

When the white sports car disappeared down the lane, Evelyn remained rooted at the gate, grappling with her aunt's revelations.

The survey team had already left for the riverside site. Evelyn retrieved her laptop, stepping onto the sidewalk to hail a ride—only to spot a familiar sedan idling nearby.

The window lowered, revealing Sebastian's expectant face.

Evelyn hurried over, apologies tumbling out. She'd kept them waiting—again.

Inside, Isabella immediately glued herself to Evelyn's side, humming off-key.

"Must you smother Miss Sinclair? She'll think you're a pest." Alexander didn't glance up from his book, but his tone carried brotherly exasperation.
###Chapter 205

"Is it true, Miss Evelyn?" Isabella gazed up at Evelyn with tear-filled puppy eyes.

Evelyn bent down, pressing a kiss to the girl's forehead before ruffling her hair. "Never. I could never think of you as a nuisance."

Her tone was so firm, so absolute, that not only did the little girl believe her instantly—Sebastian, who was driving, nearly missed a turn.

Sebastian prided himself on being a man who had seen it all. Years of working alongside Dominic had exposed him to every kind of person, from the noble to the despicable. He considered himself an expert at spotting lies.

Yet, in that moment, he couldn't detect even a hint of deception in Evelyn's words.

His eyes flicked to the rearview mirror, studying her for a brief second. For a heartbeat, he could have sworn he was looking at the twins' real mother.

A City Hospital

When Reginald Blackwood woke, his grandson and great-grandchildren were nowhere in sight.

Panic flared in his chest.

Beatrice Lockwood seized the opportunity to plant doubts. "Father, should we call Dominic?"

"What for?" Reginald grumbled between bites of his breakfast.

The nurse feeding him kept her head down, silent. She knew better than to get involved in this family's affairs.

"You know how reckless young people can be. I underestimated Evelyn Sinclair. Dominic must have gone to that backwater town for her!" Beatrice didn't understand her son well, but she knew exactly what kind of woman Evelyn was.

No man could resist her.

Reginald scowled at Beatrice's tone, though he shared her concern.

If a man and woman were left alone without restraint, mistakes were bound to happen.

"Give me the phone," he ordered. "Call Dominic's office first."

Beatrice had already tried. No answer—just the secretary's voicemail.

She dialed again in front of Reginald, speaker on.

Still nothing.

After several attempts, the result remained the same.

Reginald's frown deepened. "Call his personal line."

Beatrice didn’t want to. Even if she reached him, he’d brush her off with excuses.

But if Reginald spoke to him? That was different.

Dominic never disobeyed his grandfather—especially not when the old man was bedridden.

The call connected almost immediately.

Sebastian answered. "Good day, Mrs. Lockwood."

"It's Reginald Blackwood!" the old man barked into the phone.

"Mr. Blackwood! How may I assist you?" Sebastian replied smoothly.

"Where’s Dominic? Why are you answering his phone?" Suspicion laced every word.

"Ah, we’re in a small town surveying for a potential development project. We’ve been meeting with the town council since dawn—haven’t even had time for water."

He hesitated, then added, "You haven’t traveled in years, sir. Would you like me to send a video of the area? It’s quite scenic. Mr. Blackwood values your opinion—he’d appreciate your thoughts!"

"Send it," Reginald snapped. He didn’t care about the scenery—he wanted to see what his grandson was really doing.

Still, the mention of Dominic seeking his approval stroked his ego.

Sebastian switched to video, panning across the riverbank. Lush hills, dense foliage, crisp air—nothing like the city.

"That mountain in the distance, sir? Famous for its mushrooms. We’ll bring some back for you. Just as good as Italian truffles."

He sent the clip to Reginald’s phone.

In it, Dominic stood by the river with town officials, gesturing toward the landscape, expression serious. The rest of the team was barely visible.

Reginald relaxed.

He recognized those officials from news segments—had even dined with a few. No way Sebastian could fake that.

Town administrators didn’t play around with development deals. As CEO of Blackwood Enterprises, Dominic would be tied up in meetings, lunches, dinners—no time for distractions.

Certainly no time for her.

Reginald handed the phone back to Beatrice. "As his mother, you should trust him more. Even if he wanted to misbehave, with so many people around, he knows better."

Beatrice’s hand shook with fury as she took it.

The Riverbank

Dominic was mid-explanation to the officials about the project’s impact when movement caught his eye.

Evelyn had one hand gripping Isabella’s, the other balancing her laptop. Her attention was fixed on Alexander, who was practically vibrating with excitement near the water’s edge.

The current was strong. One misstep, and—

"Miss Evelyn, look! A fish!" Alexander kicked off his shoes, ready to bolt into the river.

Evelyn didn’t see Dominic approaching with the officials.

She dropped Isabella’s hand, set the laptop down, and lunged for Alexander.

The riverbed was uneven. She stumbled—

A strong arm wrapped around her waist, yanking her back against a solid chest.

Evelyn clutched a wriggling Alexander, but the fish was long gone.

She turned.

Dominic’s face was inches from hers, his presence overwhelming. His glare at Alexander was enough to make the boy shrink back, too scared to even apologize.

Dominic’s hands burned through the fabric at her waist. His lips brushed her ear as he murmured, "Are you hurt?"
###Chapter 206

Evelyn shook her head stiffly, signaling she was fine. Worried his dark expression might scare the children, she quickly stepped out of his embrace and gave him a grateful nod.

Dominic's arms felt abruptly empty. He watched as Evelyn led their children away, his gaze a turbulent mix of concern and growing resentment.

Her coldness earlier had stung, even if she'd only acted that way because others might see. What frustrated him more was this unbearable need to claim her as his own. How he longed to stride over, pull her into his arms, and declare to the world that Evelyn Sinclair belonged to Dominic Blackwood!

That this woman had borne his children.

Not just one, but two perfect twins.

Evelyn kept her head low as she nodded at the town officials before practically fleeing the scene. The last thing she needed was for them to get the wrong idea.

"Quite the tender moment, Mr. Blackwood! Why don't we ever see that side of you during our dinners?" One of the middle-aged officials chuckled at the display.

Dominic's masculine appeal was undeniable.

He carried himself with mature authority, yet possessed striking features that put even celebrities to shame. That chiseled jawline and intense gaze could make any woman's heart flutter with just one look.

Yet this seemingly unattainable man had never shown interest in any of the women who'd thrown themselves at him.

Everyone present witnessed how his eyes tracked that ordinary young woman's retreating figure...

Evelyn overheard the comment and quickened her pace, putting more distance between them.

Throughout the river survey, she deliberately avoided Dominic, terrified someone might notice their interactions and start rumors.

They skipped lunch, settling for an early dinner instead.

Dominic and Sebastian were dining with the officials, leaving the communal table unusually quiet.

According to veteran colleagues, these official dinners were merely preludes to more... colorful after-hours activities.

The ways men entertained themselves could defy imagination.

Everyone had seen Dominic steady Evelyn by the waist earlier. Since she was his cousin's widow holding his son, they assumed it was just familial concern.

They saw it as proof their cold exterior boss had a warm heart—at least toward relatives. No one suspected anything more.

As chatter continued, Julian spoke up in defense of men. "Stop generalizing! We're not all walking stereotypes!"

A female colleague scoffed. "Relax, you're not even on our radar." She turned to Evelyn. "You don't mind us gossiping about the boss, right?"

They wanted to indulge but needed to consider Evelyn's position.

"I'm not that close to him anyway," Evelyn said carefully.

They bought it.

The woman leaned in. "Last year, a young actress was hospitalized for a month after one of those after-dinner parties. Rumor has it she was sitting in the boss's lap. Of course, no photos ever surfaced."

How horrifying...

Evelyn prayed it was just vicious gossip.

At dusk, she brought the twins inside from the courtyard.

Colleagues asked if Dominic would collect them, but Evelyn made excuses.

By nine, everyone had retired, lulled by the town's nighttime tranquility.

Her vibrating phone startled her awake.

She'd silenced it to avoid disturbing the children.

Recognizing the number, she hesitated before answering. "Yes?"

"Why the delay? Open the door." Dominic's deep voice commanded through the phone.

Glancing at the sleeping children, she whispered, "It's late. Let them stay tonight. You can return to A City alone." She couldn't bear to wake them—or part with them.

One more night was all she asked.

Business dinners meant alcohol. Surely he'd forget about the kids tonight.

But his next words proved him sober. "I'll decide after I'm inside. Open the door."

Evelyn eyed the door warily. "Have you been drinking? Maybe Sebastian should take you to an inn—"

The small town's silence amplified every sound.

If alcohol-fueled Dominic caused a scene, she'd have no explanations left.

"Afraid I'll want you? We've done it before. Didn't you enjoy it?" His husky voice sent heat rushing from her ears down her neck.

"Quiet!" Her pulse raced.

The upstairs landing connected multiple rooms where colleagues slept.

If they saw Dominic at her door, they'd assume he came for the children.

But if anyone overheard that remark... How would she ever face them at work again?
###Chapter 207

Evelyn had no choice but to quietly open the door.

Moonlight streamed through the window, illuminating the small three-hundred-square-foot room where Alexander and Isabella slept soundly.

The moment the door opened, Dominic pulled her into a tight embrace.

She tried to turn back toward the children, but his arms locked around her slender frame like steel bands.

"Stop. The children might wake up and see us..."

Her breath came in short gasps against his chest. Dominic was already dangerously unrestrained when sober - now with alcohol in his system...

Evelyn didn't dare imagine what might happen.

She could only pray he wouldn't go too far.

"I won't force you. Tell me if I hurt you. Don't hold back." Dominic's lips brushed against her ear as he spoke, his voice rough with restraint.

Evelyn remained silent in his arms.

His promise gave her some small comfort.

It was ironic - the normally untamable beast became more considerate when intoxicated.

They stood entwined for what felt like hours until Isabella stirred in her sleep, murmuring for her mother. Evelyn broke free to attend to her daughter.

Dominic remained by the door, his expensive jacket still perfectly in place. His heavy-lidded gaze betrayed the alcohol's effect.

He watched as Evelyn settled beside Isabella, gently stroking the child's back. A fleeting smile touched his lips before vanishing.

"Mommy's here..." Evelyn whispered, hoping Isabella would dream of having both parents by her side.

The child soon quieted, though her chubby fingers remained curled around Evelyn's pajama hem. Not daring to move, Evelyn stayed put.

Dominic removed his shoes. The spotless floor - scrubbed five times over - served as their bed since the single mattress couldn't accommodate them all.

At least the wooden planks weren't cold or damp.

He disappeared into the bathroom to wash up.

Her conscience nagged: "You can't let him stay overnight. The others might not notice the first or second time, but eventually..."

Until her divorce from Maxwell was finalized, she couldn't risk tarnishing Dominic's reputation.

Isabella's grip on her pajamas remained firm. Exhausted from sitting so long, Evelyn finally lay down.

The soft rush of water from the bathroom distracted her. Dominic was clearly trying to be quiet for the children's sake.

Though her marital status made little practical difference, Evelyn longed for the day the divorce papers were signed. Dominic might claim not to care, but that marriage certificate still stood between them.

When Dominic emerged, Evelyn was still awake.

"Where should I sleep?"

He stood over her and the children, stripping off his jacket and tossing it carelessly onto the floor with their clothes.

Evelyn, lying beside the children, didn't dare respond for fear of waking them.

Her dilemma deepened when Dominic lay down beside her...

His body heat enveloped her back as his arm draped possessively over her.

She wanted to turn and tell him to return to A City.

But Isabella's fingers still clutched her pajamas. Guilt over her years of absence made Evelyn indulge her children's every whim - she wouldn't risk disturbing their sleep.

Dominic's hand slid beneath her waistband, his calloused palm rough against her skin. Isabella's grip on the fabric became an unexpected barrier to his advances...

Evelyn shifted closer to her daughter, smiling at the sleeping child who'd unwittingly protected her.

"What's wrong?" Dominic frowned and sat up to investigate.

Moonlight revealed Isabella's small hand clutching her mother's pajamas. With surprising gentleness, he pried the tiny fingers loose.

Then he pulled Evelyn against him so forcefully her face collided with his chest.

"Why are you so eager to keep my children but send me away? Expecting me to return to A City alone?" His domineering tone matched the intensity of his stare.

"I just... worry about being seen." Evelyn avoided his gaze.

His arms tightened around her. When she lowered her head, it seemed she was burrowing into his embrace...

The gesture pleased him, diffusing half his anger. He studied the woman in his arms. "They probably already suspect something. When I arrived this morning, the first thing I did was bring breakfast to your room. They saw that."

"No," Evelyn countered, "It might be unusual for a boss to personally deliver breakfast, but... they think we're cousins. It's normal between family."

"Cousins?" His gaze turned dangerous. He waited for her to correct herself.

Unaware, Evelyn continued, "To them, I'm still your cousin's wife. It's plausible you'd bring breakfast to a divorcing relative..."

"Is that so? Then would it also be plausible that their boss is sleeping with his cousin's wife?"

As he spoke, Evelyn felt sudden coolness on her skin.

Dominic had yanked down her pajama bottoms!

Her eyes flew open wide as she stared at him, not daring to struggle too violently with the children sleeping just behind her...
###Chapter 208

"Stop. You're drunk."

Evelyn finally gathered the courage to meet his gaze, but her timid eyes were instantly overwhelmed by Dominic's commanding presence. She was clearly outmatched.

She needed to defuse the situation. Compromise was acceptable, as long as he didn't become aggressive.

The last thing she wanted was to wake the children or have her colleagues overhear anything suspicious. They might assume she was having an affair...

Dominic remained fully clothed. As their bodies pressed together, she could feel the cold metal of his belt buckle digging into her abdomen.

His overwhelming presence was impossible to ignore.

"Can't you say something sweet?" The man had worked all day and consumed too much alcohol. Exhaustion lined his features as he adjusted her pajama bottoms and ensured her top covered her lower back against the chill.

Now that he seemed calmer, Evelyn decided silence was safest...

She began counting sheep, hoping the intoxicated Dominic would fall asleep quickly.

At seventy-eight, he suddenly pulled her closer, eyes still closed. "I told you to say something nice. Are you ignoring me?"

Evelyn had nearly drifted off when his rough, resonant voice startled her awake. Blinking sleepily, she took in his sharp nose, furrowed brows, and angular features.

He clearly wouldn't sleep without hearing "something nice." "I...I don't know what you mean by that..." Evelyn had never seen this side of Dominic.

This drunken man craving sweet nothings was the complete opposite of her usual aloof boss.

Still, she considered herself privileged. Without their unique relationship, she'd never have witnessed this domestic side of him.

Dominic's eyes remained shut as his muscular arms pulled her tighter.

"Don't..." Her protest was cut off when his lips captured hers.

The small room fell silent except for Alexander kicking off his blanket, the thump of his foot hitting the floor startlingly loud...

Evelyn tried pushing away the man devouring her mouth. "Mmm," his tongue invaded, exploring every corner, teasing and sucking until their mouths moved as one.

The wet sounds of their kiss made Evelyn's cheeks burn.

She could feel Dominic's growing arousal and panicked as he neared his limit...

'The children are right here...'

She couldn't let this continue, no matter what.

The drunk man might have forgotten his children slept mere feet away...

"Miss Evelyn..."

Isabella rolled over, tiny hands clutching Evelyn's pajama top.

The child remained asleep, likely dreaming of their sleepover arrangement with her brother and Miss Evelyn.

Dominic's breathing grew ragged as he struggled to stay quiet. When his eyes snapped open, they burned with barely restrained desire. Continuing would crush Isabella's small hands.

"Get off! If you won't leave...rest here awhile. I'll wake you later..." Evelyn panted.

She lay sprawled on the floor, pajama top partially undone, chest heaving - a tempting sight.

Isabella had nearly turned completely in her sleep. On the floor, there was no risk of falling, so Evelyn didn't reposition her.

Shifting slightly, Evelyn realized Isabella had snuggled into her chest, arms wrapped around her.

She kissed the girl's cheek tenderly, relieved the child had unwittingly become her shield.

Meanwhile, Dominic lay flat on his back. Never had he slept in worse conditions as the bulge in his pants slowly subsided.

Only the remnants of intimacy and soft breathing remained in the quiet room.

Morning arrived with Isabella giggling and playing with Evelyn's earlobes.

Blinking awake, Evelyn was greeted by her daughter's angelic face.

She pulled the girl close for a morning kiss, then suddenly remembered last night and turned. Only traces of Dominic remained.

"What's wrong, Miss Evelyn?" Isabella pouted, kneading Evelyn's hair.

Hearing only her daughter's voice, Evelyn relaxed. He must have left before anyone woke.

She was grateful for his discretion.

After washing up, she took the children downstairs for breakfast.

"Oh? The boss's kids are still here?" a colleague asked.

Evelyn shrugged. "I'm not sure. It's Sunday, but they have school tomorrow." "That means the boss will return. Who else would take them back to A City? You're so lucky, Evelyn. The boss's cousin must be wonderful. If the boss ever looked at me, I'd be smiling in my sleep! Then we'd be relatives too!"

Evelyn offered an awkward smile.

Meanwhile, Julian scrolled on his laptop. "The boss never makes mistakes in judgment. Don't get your hopes up!"

The woman was about to retort when Julian suddenly froze, eyes widening at breaking news. He turned to stare at Evelyn...
###Chapter 209

"What's the matter?"

Evelyn felt uneasy under her colleague's intense stare. Julian's expression sent chills down her spine.

"See for yourself!" At a loss for words, Julian shoved his laptop toward Evelyn.

Still confused, she took the device and scanned the screen.

Her coworker leaned in closer, eyes glued to the display.

By now, every young adult in the country must have seen the viral news.

The headline alone proved Lillian Prescott's celebrity status.

"Shocking! Married Man Spotted Leaving Lillian Prescott's Mansion After Midnight Affair!"

Just reading the headline made Evelyn's hands tremble.

She clicked through to the article, which featured a screenshot of a newly created Twitter account. The first post? A marriage certificate photo!

The account belonged to none other than Maxwell Lockwood.

Evelyn's full name, birthdate, and photo were clearly visible on the document.

Her colleague immediately pulled out her phone and searched for the verified Twitter account mentioned in the article.

"Your husband owns that downtown bar, right Evelyn?" The question hung in the air.

Evelyn didn't respond. Her vision blurred as she devoured every word of the scandalous piece.

The thousand-word article painted a clear picture: last night, rising star Lillian Prescott had been driven home by Maxwell Lockwood.

Normally, a civilian like Maxwell wouldn't warrant paparazzi attention - except when caught with a famous actress after dark.

Another colleague burst into the office, nearly tripping over her own feet. "Evelyn! You're trending with Lillian Prescott!"

The woman beside Evelyn hesitated before asking, "You do know who Lillian Prescott is, right? Should I... fill you in?"

Evelyn nodded absently, her delicate brows furrowing deeper with each passing second.

The office fell silent. No one wanted to accidentally make things worse.

While celebrity gossip often contained exaggerations, there was usually some truth at its core.

Evelyn scrolled through the comments section.

Top comment from Lillian's fans: "Mr. Lockwood is clearly just a friend! I've studied micro-expressions - nothing inappropriate happened. Relax, everyone!"

This had thousands of upvotes, as if it were gospel truth.

Another comment pleaded: "Can we leave these civilians alone? If they know Lillian, they must be decent people."

Then came the trolls: "Face it - your precious Lillian got lonely and brought home some eye candy. The video speaks for itself!"

"Is this guy her sugar daddy?"

Some showed sympathy: "Ms. Sinclair is the real victim here. Her private life exposed, her marriage humiliated..."

"Posting their marriage certificate wasn't protective - it sacrificed her privacy to clear Lillian's name. Where do his loyalties really lie?"

A bombshell comment revealed: "Wake up, people! This 'bar owner' is actually Dominic Blackwood's cousin! He served prison time five years ago!"

"Typical celebrity - drawn to bad boys. Poor Ms. Sinclair..."

Evelyn slammed the laptop shut.

Julian quickly retrieved his device before it suffered further damage.

The office divided into two camps: Evelyn, the betrayed wife, and everyone else watching the drama unfold.

Evelyn pulled out her phone and dialed Maxwell - an unusual move for her. The line was busy.

Meanwhile, her phone buzzed incessantly with messages from curious colleagues and acquaintances. Only Olivia and Abigail seemed genuinely concerned.

Giving up on the call, she texted Maxwell: [Delete our marriage certificate immediately! You've violated my privacy!]

Across town...

Sophia Montgomery was leaving when Victoria grabbed her wrist. "Where are you going? Don't you have money for your mother?"

Sophia glared at the woman before tossing two twenties by the door. "That's all I have! Maybe sell this place and move back to the countryside!"

Victoria pocketed the cash, muttering about it not being enough, and retreated inside.

Sophia stood fuming for several minutes before storming out.

She'd seen the headlines.

'Evelyn married to Maxwell Lockwood? The man she slept with? How dare she!'

While waiting for her ride, she fired off a text to Maxwell: [We need to meet. Or you'll regret it!]

His icy reply came quickly: [Have you lost your mind?]

[Not at all. Evelyn's my sister. I know all her dirty little secrets. Unless you want me sharing them with the press... or creating my own Twitter account?] Sophia threatened.
###Chapter 210

The private hospital suite was filled with tension.

A towering figure stormed out, followed by the enraged bellow of an elderly man.

"Dominic, you ungrateful wretch!" Reginald Blackwood slammed his fist on the bedside table.

Though Dominic heard his grandfather's fury, his steady footsteps never faltered as he walked away.

The marriage between Maxwell Lockwood and Evelyn Sinclair would have been insignificant if not for Lillian Prescott, the rising starlet who dragged it into the spotlight.

When news outlets published Maxwell and Evelyn's marriage certificate, Dominic - the man who'd shared Evelyn's bed - saw red.

Outside the hospital, fallen leaves swirled along the pavement, mirroring the autumn melancholy. A sleek Bentley waited curbside. Sebastian emerged to open the rear door when he spotted his boss.

Once inside, Sebastian navigated through traffic while updating his phone-scrolling employer. "The PR team's handling it. The news should be buried within the hour."

Silence. Sebastian knew better than to press further - no man could stomach seeing the woman he loved legally bound to another.

Now the entire world knew Maxwell Lockwood and Evelyn Sinclair were lawfully wedded.

The circumstances didn't matter.

Sebastian's phone buzzed with a message from a media contact:

[Damage controlled. Please assure Mr. Blackwood.]

Meanwhile, back in the hospital...

Beatrice Lockwood arrived with Margaret and Julian in tow.

Reginald's headache worsened at the sight of them.

"Where's Dominic?" Beatrice demanded when she didn't see her son.

The old man had arranged with his physician to exaggerate his condition, but the morning intern ruined everything. "Your vitals are excellent, sir. Better than most your age," the clueless doctor had announced. Reginald was mid-bribe attempt when Dominic - fresh from rushing back from the countryside - overheard.

Now the patriarch sat in mortified silence.

"Father, you saw the news. If you don't rein Dominic in, this scandal will destroy him!" Beatrice knew only the family head could control her son.

Reginald massaged his temples. "Discharge me first. Then we'll talk."

Margaret quickly restrained him. "Father, you're not well enough!"

Julian joined in. "Grandfather, Dominic wouldn't want you leaving prematurely."

Reginald thought bitterly, If Dominic were here, I couldn't face him after this charade.

Beatrice pressed on. "Father, Dominic is—"

"Enough!" Reginald feigned a coughing fit. "Dominic will... handle this... appropriately."

"Stop agitating him!" Margaret scolded. "Must you worsen his condition?"

Across town, at an exclusive A City lounge...

Sophia Montgomery was a regular here.

The establishment belonged to Maxwell, accessible only to vetted patrons. The bouncer recognized Sophia's special connection to the owner and waved her through.

Upstairs, Maxwell was just dressing when she entered.

"Let me help." Sophia approached, her manicured fingers fastening his shirt buttons while tracing his sculpted chest.

"State your business. I'm not in the mood."

He wasn't desperate enough to bed a woman who'd just blackmailed him.

Reading his disinterest, Sophia pouted. "I'm unemployed now. Menial jobs don't suit me." She batted her lashes. "Help me break into showbiz. Consider it payment for all those nights together... or because I'm Evelyn's sister."

Maxwell sipped his water, frowning. "How?"

"Get me an acting role. Any role." Her eyes gleamed. "You pulled strings for Lillian Prescott. Surely you can manage something smaller for me?"

She'd done her research - a five-year sentence for his crime suggested powerful connections.

"I'm not asking for Lillian's treatment," she purred, pressing against him. "Just a stepping stone..."

Meanwhile, in the countryside...

A coworker gasped while scrolling her phone during work. "What the—? All related searches are blocked!"

Brows furrowed, Evelyn picked up her own phone.

Every search for names connected to the scandal returned zero results - or warnings about violating terms.

The office chatter died instantly.

Even searching "Evelyn Sinclair" triggered a firewall alert.
###Chapter 211

"What's happening?"

"Why would searching for 'Evelyn Sinclair' trigger a violation warning?"

As Evelyn pondered this, her coworkers noticed a sleek black Bentley entering the courtyard, followed by two equally luxurious vehicles.

The cars kicked up dust from the unpaved road, but what caught everyone's attention were the consecutive license plate numbers.

T Corporation employees immediately stood at attention, discreetly pocketing their phones as they regarded the newcomers with utmost seriousness.

Sebastian stepped out of the lead car.

He walked straight toward Evelyn.

Evelyn rose from her seat, still puzzling over the internet comments when Sebastian announced, "Mr. Blackwood requests your presence, Ms. Sinclair."

She didn't move.

'If Dominic is here, why isn't he getting out himself?'

"Official business only," Sebastian clarified, seemingly understanding her hesitation.

Just then, two senior executives emerged from the third car. They approached Julian and another female colleague. After a brief discussion, both employees packed their equipment and followed the executives into the vehicle.

'So this really is official business.'

'But it's only been hours since last night. Isn't he exhausted from traveling between A City and this town?'

"Give me a moment," Evelyn said as she packed her laptop.

Meanwhile in A City...

Maxwell was dealing with Sophia's pestering when his phone rang.

Recognizing the number, he answered impatiently. "What?"

"The biggest news, obviously!" Lillian's spoiled voice came through. "Did you arrange the media blackout? It happened so fast."

"Media blackout?" Maxwell, freshly awake, had no idea about recent developments.

"Yes! Earlier the internet was buzzing, now there's not a trace. Clearly someone powerful intervened. My agent says searching your wife's name brings up violation warnings now..."

This led Lillian to conclude someone was suppressing the news.

And she wasn't pleased Evelyn received better treatment than her!

Maxwell's frown deepened as Lillian spoke. Lighting a cigarette, he snapped, "I didn't arrange anything."

"Is that... Lillian Prescott?" Sophia ventured a guess based on Maxwell's words.

His irritation turned to fury. He jabbed the cigarette toward her. "Shut your damn mouth!"

Sophia paled.

Lillian didn't care who Maxwell was speaking to. She hung up after confirming he wasn't behind the suppression.

A luxury RV rolled down a guarded private road toward an estate.

Before exiting, Lillian stopped her agent. "Not today, Beatrice. I want private time with Mother."

Beatrice understood, lighting a cigarette and signaling the driver to leave.

Alone at the mansion's entrance, Lillian adjusted her appearance. Removing her heels, she limped inside barefoot.

Genevieve was watching TV when she spotted her daughter's limp through the window. Setting aside her glasses, she rushed to help. "What happened, darling?"

"Just a sprain." Lillian sat heavily on the couch, wincing. "These heels are torture. I'll speak to your agent - no need for such discomfort at press events. Bring comfortable shoes tonight," Genevieve fretted.

"Mother, I've missed you..." Lillian suddenly embraced her, voice trembling.

Genevieve stiffened slightly before patting her back. "Still my little girl. I saw the news today. This industry... if it's too much, come home. You don't need to act."

"But... it was your dream. Since you couldn't pursue it, let me fulfill it for you..." Lillian said earnestly.

Genevieve fell silent, melancholy washing over her.

Her own acting dreams had been crushed when she married Jonathan Prescott from the military family. The Prescotts forbade their daughter-in-law from public appearances.

Then her hopes for children were also dashed... until they adopted bright, talented Lillian ten years ago.

"Mother, who ordered the media blackout? Did Father arrange it?" Lillian pressed.

If not Maxwell, surely her father had intervened.

Jonathan Prescott, Provincial Committee Secretary, certainly had that power!

Genevieve summoned a maid to tend to Lillian's ankle. "Your father's still in meetings at the Capital. He likely doesn't know yet."

Lillian frowned. 'Then who...?'

She quickly texted Maxwell: [I must know who's protecting her. Arrange a meeting with your wife immediately.]

Meanwhile, in the small town...

Sebastian escorted Evelyn to the car. She shivered upon entering, sensing an overpowering presence. Stowing her laptop bag, she stole a glance at the man beside her.

Dominic lounged casually in his custom suit, tie absent to reveal sharp collarbones and a prominent Adam's apple.

His expression was unreadable, lips pressed into a thin line.

'He must have seen the news,' Evelyn realized.
###Chapter 212

Dominic's entire being radiated an icy chill that warned everyone to keep their distance.

Evelyn tightened her jacket and turned her head weakly toward the window. She remained silent.

After Sebastian helped Evelyn into the car and shut the door, he went to retrieve the two children who were doing their homework and brought them to the vehicle.

The backseat of the Bentley was spacious. The children climbed in one after another, but their father made no move to assist them. His gaze held nothing but disdain when it landed on them.

The twins were accustomed to this treatment and didn't seem particularly upset.

Isabella scooted closer to Evelyn. "Can I sit with you, Miss Eve?"
"Of course, come here..." Evelyn replied softly.

She took Isabella's small hand and pulled the girl into her arms.

To an outsider, it might have looked like a family outing, except for the father's obvious detachment...

Alexander wanted to join them too, but when he saw his father's stormy expression, he hesitated and stayed put.

The observant boy could sense his father's foul mood.

He sat across from Dominic on the plush leather seat, buckled himself in, and stared wordlessly at his father.

———

In the city...

After Maxwell cleaned up and changed clothes, he left the bar with Sophia in tow.

His only reason for bringing her along was her claim of being Evelyn's elder sister...

To Maxwell, Sophia was no different from any other cheap woman—until he learned she was a Montgomery and Evelyn's half-sister. That made her suddenly interesting.

Being with Sophia gave him a twisted sense of satisfaction, even though they shared no blood relation to Evelyn.

He even entertained the sick fantasy that they were full sisters. That way, he'd have some twisted victory over Evelyn.

Unfortunately, they weren't.

From the passenger seat, Sophia studied Maxwell's expression carefully.

The car sped down the road as Maxwell's face remained unreadable. His eyes were dark and dangerous, lips pressed into a thin line. Occasionally, he took a drag from his cigarette and exhaled through his nostrils.

He parked outside an exclusive restaurant.

Lillian was dressed casually in a hoodie and oversized sunglasses, her hair in a ponytail. She looked like any ordinary college student.

The restaurant belonged to a close friend, so she didn't worry about paparazzi. Still, she remained cautious—they seemed to lurk everywhere. Just last night, despite her precautions, they'd managed to snap photos...

When Maxwell entered the private dining room, Lillian glanced at his companion. "Who's this?"

Sophia froze. This was her first time meeting a real celebrity face-to-face. Up close, Lillian wasn't as flawless as she appeared on screen—most of her photos were clearly edited.

Even so, Lillian's beauty was undeniable. Her features were striking, her figure enviable.

Sophia burned with jealousy—why were some people simply born luckier?

"A friend," Maxwell answered dismissively. He sat down and stared at Lillian without preamble.

Lillian knew what he wanted. "My mother says my father's in a meeting at the Capital. He probably hasn't heard about the incident yet."

Realizing the suppression didn't come from Lillian's parents or agency, Maxwell lit another cigarette and pondered. When his thoughts landed on Dominic, he smirked coldly. "He's always one step ahead."
"What? Who is?" Lillian asked.

"Nothing." Maxwell tossed his lighter onto the table, ignoring Sophia completely. "Didn't you want to meet my wife? We'll go after lunch."
"So soon?" Lillian looked surprised.

Sophia watched their exchange silently. When her eyes met Lillian's, she offered an awkward smile.

Noticing Sophia's nervousness, Lillian remained polite despite not knowing who she was. "Nice to meet you."
"N-Nice to meet you too! I'm Sophia Montgomery!" Sophia stammered, flustered by the celebrity's attention.

Maxwell eyed her pathetic display with disdain. He took another drag and closed his eyes. "She wants into the entertainment industry. If possible, mentor her. She says she doesn't mind starting as an extra."

Though not part of high society, Lillian and Maxwell moved in exclusive circles far removed from ordinary wealth.

Recognizing Sophia's surname and Maxwell's tone, Lillian nodded. "You want to be an actress? It requires patience. If you're willing, I'll mentor you and pass along suitable opportunities."
"Really?" Sophia's jaw dropped. "Thank you, Ms. Prescott! Thank you so much!"

Her shrill voice echoed through the room. She looked ready to kneel in gratitude.

With Lillian's agreement secured, the three set off for the small town to find Evelyn.

———

Meanwhile, in the small town...

The entire car ride passed in silence.

Isabella sat comfortably on Evelyn's lap and soon dozed off.

The other two cars arrived first. T Corporation executives, town officials, and Evelyn's colleagues stepped out.

Evelyn glanced at the sleeping girl in her arms, conflicted.

Sitting beside Dominic already felt unbearable, but the man's terrible mood made her hesitate to switch cars—who knew what he might do?

She didn't dare show too much affection toward his children in front of strangers either, lest it spark gossip. "Could you carry the children?" she asked the man beside her.

Dominic had drunk too much last night and slept poorly. His physical intimacy with Evelyn had left him frustrated, his temper fluctuating with his hormones.

This morning brought no peace either—photos of Maxwell and the woman in his arms were plastered all over the internet...

His anger wouldn't subside until his and Evelyn's names appeared on a marriage certificate.

Rubbing his temples, Dominic exited the car and walked to the other side. As he took his daughter from Evelyn's arms, his hand accidentally brushed against her chest.
###Chapter 213

"I'm sleepy, Daddy..." Isabella slumped drowsily against Dominic's shoulder, her tiny lips forming a pout.

Evelyn stepped out of the car, lifting her gaze to meet Dominic's intense dark eyes.

Her chest still ached where he'd touched her earlier—more sensitive than yesterday. A quick mental calculation confirmed her suspicion. It must be that time of the month.

Dominic adjusted his daughter in his arms, glanced at his son who was preoccupied with a stick, then locked eyes with Evelyn. "Stay here with the kids."

At the same time, he signaled the nanny inside the vehicle.

Sebastian had his own tasks. An executive assistant's job never ended—always juggling his boss's needs alongside his own workload, often busier than the man himself.

The car was parked near the rural outskirts, with a five-year-old girl napping inside. No responsible parent would leave her unattended.

Evelyn was more than willing to stay, but she hesitated, eyeing her coworkers gathered nearby. "What will they think—"

"Let them speculate," Dominic said coldly. After setting Isabella down, he lit a cigarette, took a deep drag, and exhaled slowly. As he passed Evelyn, his gaze bore into hers. "Regardless of anything else, remember—you're the one who shared my bed."

His voice was low, but the words pierced Evelyn's ears like shards of glass.

She suspected jealousy drove Dominic's behavior today, though he'd never admit it.

A truly considerate man would prioritize the bigger picture, ensuring no situation escalated. That was maturity. Responsibility.

Evelyn admired men like that—strategists, thinkers. Not arrogant brutes who defaulted to aggression.

Dominic's exterior radiated calm control, but beneath it simmered possessive fire.

Evelyn exhaled in relief as he walked away, his brow furrowed. She slid back into the car, leaning over to press a tender kiss to her daughter's rosy cheek.

Meanwhile, the team continued their site tour. Workers jotted down the boss's notes for later revisions.

Lunch arrived via a town delivery—limited options in this rural area meant identical meals for all.

Once Isabella woke, Evelyn led both children outside. She couldn't hide in the car all day—people might accuse her of slacking.

She refused special treatment, even as the boss's cousin's wife. Her colleagues would resent that.

Isabella played with her brother while Evelyn alternated between work and keeping watch.

As Evelyn fed Isabella sauerkraut—the child's first taste, judging by her delighted expression—a Porsche kicked up dust in the distance.

The car splashed through a puddle before halting before the group.

Evelyn's hand froze mid-air.

She recognized that vehicle instantly. Maxwell's.

Why was he here?

"Uncle Max!" Isabella chirped, spotting the man exiting the car. He looked well-rested, energetic.

Evelyn's coworkers erupted in whispers.

She couldn't decipher the words, but the topic was obvious—this morning's scandalous headlines.

They assumed Maxwell came to apologize for his affair with celebrity Lillian Prescott.

Some probably believed Evelyn had known all along—hence the divorce filing.

Now the entire world knew.

No woman would tolerate such humiliation.

Why Maxwell resisted the divorce remained a mystery.

Wealthy families bred endless scandals. The truth behind their gilded walls often surpassed the wildest rumors.

Maxwell carried a crate of premium imported drinks—the kind that cost six dollars per tiny bottle at gourmet stores.

Average office workers rarely indulged. Six dollars bought a Starbucks coffee.

"Appreciate everyone's hard work," Maxwell announced, setting the crate down. "Enjoy."

"Hello, Uncle Max," Isabella greeted politely.

Maxwell crouched, arms outstretched. "Give uncle a hug!"

"Finish your lunch first." Evelyn pulled Isabella closer, settling her on a rock before resuming feeding.

Isabella obediently opened her mouth for another bite of sauerkraut, savoring the new flavor.

Colleagues collected drinks with murmured thanks.

One woman gulped hers and nudged Julian. "See? He probably does this on Lillian's film sets too. Recycling his playbook for the wife."

Julian pretended not to hear. Some battles weren't worth fighting.

No one recognized Lillian in her casual disguise—just two women accompanying Maxwell. Perhaps here to convince Evelyn to reconsider.

Workers dispersed with their drinks, stealing glances at Evelyn while pretending to review blueprints.

Someone snapped photos—Evelyn, Maxwell, and the slender mystery woman whose face remained obscured.

Evelyn stood abruptly, preparing to leave with Isabella.

"Excuse me, I have work—"

She turned directly into Dominic descending the hill with Sebastian and two surveyors.

The employees collected their lunches while Dominic approached Evelyn.

His gaze flicked to Maxwell, then the woman—undoubtedly Lillian, though he showed no reaction.

"Unexpected visit?" Dominic's tone was neutral. One hand ruffled Isabella's hair while the other claimed Evelyn's water cup, drinking deeply from the rim where her lipstick faintly lingered.

Evelyn's pulse stuttered.

Lillian's eyes widened. That cup bore the imprint of Evelyn's lips...
###Chapter 214

The employees of T Corporation stared at the gathering crowd, their attention undoubtedly drawn by the sudden appearance of their CEO.

Lillian Prescott hesitated.

She couldn't risk being recognized if she lingered too long. With a quick turn, she retreated.

Back in Maxwell Lockwood's Porsche Cayenne, she frowned slightly.

Sophia Montgomery wasn't yet familiar with Lillian. To her, Lillian was an untouchable celebrity, while she was just a nobody. For a moment, Sophia didn’t know how to speak to her.

Lillian barely noticed Sophia. Her mind was still replaying the scene from earlier.

She already knew exactly who Dominic Blackwood was.

As one of A City’s most eligible bachelors and now one of the most powerful businessmen, he held two enviable identities.

Once, a friend had asked Lillian what kind of man she wanted to marry.

She’d admitted she had someone in mind—though she wasn’t sure if fate would bring them together.

But with a target, she could work toward it.

Of course, the target had to be worth the effort.

Her father, Jonathan Prescott, had high expectations. He wanted his daughter to marry someone equally influential. She knew he had already lined up potential suitors—all rising politicians.

Lillian had once thought marrying a politician was fine.

Her status would rise with her husband’s career.

But after entering showbiz, her perspective changed.

She found businessmen—those who controlled markets and empires—far more compelling.

She was a woman who appreciated power and allure. She often wondered what lay beneath those impeccable suits, what thoughts hid behind those unreadable gazes.

Dominic Blackwood checked every box.

A City’s elite social circle wasn’t large. When single women gathered, they inevitably gossiped about the most desirable men.

Someone had once suggested introducing Lillian to Dominic, but she’d hesitated.

She knew about his two children.

She had access to information the public didn’t—wealthy, successful men often had women bear their children discreetly.

But Lillian was young. She didn’t want to be a stepmother, no matter how perfect Dominic was.

Two children?

The thought alone made her uncomfortable.

Yet, seeing Dominic in person had changed everything.

Within ten minutes, she was utterly captivated.

Drinking from his cousin’s wife’s cup, his lips touching where her lipstick had been—wasn’t that an indirect kiss?

And he’d done it right in front of her husband, Maxwell.

Lillian didn’t believe it was a coincidence.

This trip had given her much to think about—but it had also stolen a piece of her heart.

She knew exactly why.

On the drive back to A City, Maxwell chain-smoked, his expression dark. Lillian had deliberately sat beside him, watching his reactions.

His dangerously sullen face made her wonder—

What was Evelyn Sinclair’s relationship with these two cousins?

Back in A City, Lillian returned home in a daze. After showering and changing into pajamas, she picked up tomorrow’s script, trying to focus.

But Dominic’s sharp, sculpted features kept invading her thoughts.

She set the script down, taking deep breaths to steady herself.

Meanwhile, Sophia followed Maxwell upstairs to the room above the bar.

The street was quiet in daylight, the silence broken only by the occasional bird chirping.

Maxwell opened the window, letting in the crisp autumn air. As he unbuttoned his shirt, he turned and pinned Sophia to the bed.

"Ah!" Sophia gasped, startled.

Then she felt the chill of the air against her bare legs as he yanked off her pants.

The cold wind made her shiver. The sheer white curtains brushed against her cheeks.

"The door’s open..." she murmured coyly, playing the role she knew so well.

She was experienced—she knew how to tease a man’s interest.

The atmosphere was perfect. Her body, her voice—everything was designed to entice.

But just as Maxwell moved to take her, he stopped.

He wasn’t in the mood.

Sophia waited, still playing her part.

Then she stole a glance at his face—and realized something was wrong.

Had she lost her appeal?

The tabloids said he’d been with Lillian last night.

Sophia knew her fate depended on Maxwell’s whims.

She didn’t care about pride. She was used to this.

She knelt before him, reaching between his legs.

"Let me... help you," she whispered.

In the small town, the sun was setting.

Evelyn Sinclair was troubled.

She didn’t want scandals—but they always found her.

As the saying went, man proposes, heaven disposes.

She could only leave it to fate.

The twins climbed into the black Bentley, settling in. Dominic shut the door and turned to Evelyn, who clutched her laptop.

"I’m taking them to a children’s movie at eight. Want to come?"

Her first instinct was to say yes—but guilt held her back.

"Get in the car," Dominic said, reaching for her hand.

She flinched away, glancing at her colleagues nearby.

"Not this time. Maybe next. You should go with them."

She couldn’t bear the guilt of not being the mother they deserved.

Dominic tossed his jacket through the car window, loosened his tie, and stepped closer, towering over her.

"What are you afraid of?" His voice was low.

"Someone seeing us together? Another headline?"
###Chapter 215

"It's not that..." Evelyn's protest was feeble. "I know even if we're caught, you have the power to silence the media. I'm just exhausted after work and want to go back to my room to rest."

Dominic studied her with an intense gaze. He leaned in, deliberately lowering his voice, enunciating each word. "I won't suppress the scandal if it breaks. When I saw the headlines this morning declaring you as his lawfully wedded wife, I nearly lost my mind from jealousy. Now that you're making headlines with him again, do you really care if the world finds out about us?"

Evelyn glanced around, worried the children might overhear. Though startled, she kept her voice hushed. "That was just for identification purposes. There's nothing to be jealous about. Don't be ridiculous."

She knew Maxwell had no love for her—their marriage was forced out of spite. Even if he harbored any twisted affection, that warped union was nothing to be proud of.

But she wasn’t a man. She couldn’t comprehend the depths of male jealousy.

Evelyn didn’t push further, afraid of provoking him. Her main concern was the children—whether they’d bear the brunt of his temper on the drive home.

Without her there to shield them, she feared he might take his anger out on them.

The twins had been unusually quiet around their father lately.

While Dominic was consumed by envy, Evelyn remained clear-headed.

She couldn’t leave with him.

"If you don’t let me stake my claim this once, I’ll never forgive you." Dominic’s expression darkened as he spotted Sebastian approaching. "If pushed, I won’t hesitate to leak our intimate photos to the press. Imagine the scandal—the virtuous Mrs. Lockwood caught in an affair."

He turned away.

Evelyn froze, her grip tightening on her laptop. His words echoed in her mind.

Intimate photos…

How does he have those?

She was a light sleeper. She didn’t recall either of them using their phones at the old house or the hotel.

Where did those photos come from?

Sebastian greeted her politely before slipping into the car and driving off.

He respected—and feared—his boss’s woman. He never knew whether to treat her as a colleague or something more.

Even after the Bentley disappeared, Evelyn remained rooted in place.

Maybe I’m not as light a sleeper as I thought. Did he take those photos while I was unconscious?

Her face burned at the memory of his relentless stamina, how she’d nearly blacked out during their heated encounters. Maybe she had passed out, and he’d seized the opportunity…

As she rejoined her colleagues, she texted Dominic.

[When did you take those photos?]

Ten minutes passed with no reply.

[Did you get my message? If you took them, delete them immediately.]

She wanted to send a voice note but feared Sebastian or the children might overhear if he played it aloud.

Half an hour later, the group started preparing dinner. Evelyn tucked her phone away and helped.

Dinner ended by 6:30 PM, though daylight lingered.

Still no response. He was clearly still furious. She had no choice but to call him…

She also needed to know if he’d taken his anger out on the twins…

"The number you have dialed is currently unavailable—"

She hung up, defeated.

That night, sleep eluded her.

At 9 PM, her aunt Gwendolyn messaged her. The profile picture didn’t look like her.

After some small talk, Evelyn promised: [I’ll return to A City with my colleagues this weekend. I’ll visit Father and Grandfather first, then record videos for you.]

By 11 PM, exhaustion finally pulled her into a fitful sleep.

The next morning, she woke to blinking notifications.

Olivia had sent multiple texts.

[Are you awake, Evie? Didn’t want to call and wake you. Reply when you see this.]

[You’re trending again. Please tell me you’re still asleep?]

[Never mind. Rest well. The news isn’t worth losing sleep over.]

Evelyn immediately opened a browser.

The headlines were everywhere—accompanied by photos.

No surprise—they were from yesterday. Her sitting in the countryside, eating lunch. Beside her, Lillian in casual wear and Maxwell laughing while holding a child.

The background crowd was blurred, but the narrative was clear: Evelyn and Lillian are friends.

If Evelyn was Maxwell’s wife, and Maxwell treated Lillian like a sister, then Lillian would naturally respect her as a sister-in-law.

Lillian’s fans rallied. "Why is she getting hate right after her debut? Look at the proof—Maxwell and Lillian are like siblings! Their relationship isn’t shady!"

Evelyn didn’t care how the media spun it.

She couldn’t afford to. Ignoring it was her only option.

But she couldn’t shake the worry—would that man lose his mind all over again seeing Maxwell and her in the headlines?

Uneasy, she tried calling Dominic again. No answer.

She had no choice but to call Sebastian.

It was still early. Sebastian had been fielding calls from media outlets all morning. His boss had been livid seeing Evelyn publicly tied to Maxwell again.

Mid-call, his phone rang.

He glanced at Dominic, who had buried himself in work since returning to A City, then said, "Mr. Blackwood, it’s Ms. Sinclair."

Dominic’s phone was off—hence Evelyn calling Sebastian.

Dominic nodded. Sebastian answered on speaker.

Evelyn fired off questions. Sebastian answered patiently.

Finally, she sighed. "Thank you, Mr. Whitmore. I’m just worried he might take his temper out on the children…"

The "bad-tempered man" said nothing.
###Chapter 216

Sebastian went completely silent.

Evelyn was unpacking teacups from the cabinet when she paused. "Mr. Whitmore? Are you still there?"

One minute ticked by. Then two.

No response came from the other end.

Outside, the rest of the team had woken up. Julian was watering the plants in the courtyard, chatting loudly. "Weather forecast says temperatures will drop starting Wednesday. These pots need to come inside. Anyone want to take two? Otherwise I'm keeping them all in my room."

The noise made it impossible for Evelyn to hear anything through the phone.

After three full minutes, she decided to hang up. Either the connection was bad or Sebastian had gotten busy with work.

Then his voice came through crystal clear. "Apologies, Ms. Sinclair. We had some signal issues earlier."

"That's what I figured. I was about to end the call." Evelyn handed the dishes to another colleague.

The woman carried them toward the communal table.

"Could you repeat what you said before? I missed it." Sebastian had heard perfectly but wanted confirmation.

Evelyn's concern about potential emotional neglect resurfaced. "I said... I'm worried he might take his frustrations out on the children."

Sebastian wondered why Evelyn cared so deeply about his boss's kids.

That was between Dominic and his woman. He was just an assistant following orders. "Honestly Ms. Sinclair, I can't say whether Mr. Blackwood lost his temper after returning to A City. But I did hear..."

He hesitated.

"What?" Evelyn's pulse spiked.

"Yesterday after returning, the boss attended a dinner engagement. He left Alexander and Isabella alone in the penthouse with no supervision. Around dinnertime, Alexander took his sister downstairs with some cash to buy food. The building security saw them leave but didn't intervene. They haven't been seen since..."

"What?" Evelyn's voice shook. How could children just disappear?

"I only learned about it this morning. The boss drank heavily last night and we haven't been able to reach him at his hotel."

The line went dead.

Evelyn raced back to A City immediately. She only told team leader Julian, "Family emergency. I have to go."

Julian nodded understandingly.

No one would deny leave for a family crisis.

On the high-speed train, she repeatedly called Dominic's number.

His phone remained off.

Meanwhile, across town...

The Prescott estate's front lawn blazed with autumn colors - golden yellows and fiery reds creating a breathtaking display. Three identical luxury cars approached, the center vehicle slightly more distinguished. Inside sat Jonathan Prescott, returning from the capital.

Genevieve descended the stairs with their daughter upon receiving the call.

Lillian stepped forward to take her father's briefcase. "It's getting colder, Dad. How was the capital? You should take better care of yourself when traveling."

Jonathan nodded. "Have you two eaten?"

"We waited for you," Genevieve said, handing his coat to a maid.

The maid hung it neatly while another served steaming porridge.

Jonathan's breakfast always included the morning paper. All Prescott men shared this habit.

Noticing her father's fatigue, Lillian stood. "I'm full. You two continue."

"You barely ate. Don't starve yourself," Genevieve fretted, suspecting her daughter's weight concerns.

"I snuck a bun from the kitchen earlier," Lillian admitted sheepishly.

"You naughty girl," Genevieve chided.

"Let me read the paper for you, Dad." Lillian took the newspaper. "By the time I finish, you can rest."

Genevieve appreciated her daughter's thoughtfulness.

Lillian knew exactly which sections interested her father after years in the Prescott household. She saved the financial news for last, having already previewed today's edition.

She'd specifically chosen to read today because of Dominic's coverage.

"With suburban development underway, A City's eastern property values hit record highs, boosting the local economy."

Lillian lingered on this section, anticipating her parents' discussion.

A black-and-white photo accompanied the article - a formal ribbon-cutting ceremony.

Dominic stood among town officials and politicians, his commanding presence making him the group's standout figure in his tailored suit and polished shoes.

Lillian's fingers traced his imposing form in the photo.

"Lillian?" Genevieve noticed her daughter's prolonged attention to the page.

As a woman who'd once been young, she understood.

"Nothing... I'm done. I'll go rehearse my script upstairs." Blushing, Lillian hurried away.

Jonathan, ever the oblivious patriarch, looked puzzled at his wife.

Genevieve sighed. "Our daughter has feelings for Beatrice Lockwood's son."

Understanding dawned. Jonathan glanced at the paper. "Simple enough. I'll make some calls. She's got excellent taste," he approved.

Back in A City, Evelyn first retrieved the penthouse key from Sebastian.

During the ride over, his words replayed in her mind:

"Frankly, I have no complaints about Mr. Blackwood's professional conduct. But raising children? That's another matter."

Inserting the key, she wondered what clues the children might have left - perhaps a note.

The door opened to reveal the man who was supposedly passed out drunk in a hotel, now asleep on the couch with a deep frown.

He held Isabella tightly against him, her tiny mouth slightly open with drool.

Meanwhile, Alexander sprawled like a starfish across the other half of the sofa...
###Chapter 217

Evelyn tucked the keys into her purse, slipped into her house shoes, and crept toward the bedroom. Two small figures lay sleeping - one curled on the bed, the other sprawled across Dominic's chest.

She carefully draped blankets over both Isabella and Alexander before turning to leave. That's when Dominic's bloodshot eyes snapped open. Exhaustion carved deep lines beneath his furrowed brows, crimson veins spiderwebbing across his tired gaze.

Normally, she'd remind him to rest - whether as his employee or the mother of his children. But tonight, words failed her. Sebastian's frantic phone call still echoed in her mind.

"Mr. Blackwood attended a dinner meeting after returning yesterday. The children were left alone in the penthouse with no supervision."

"He overindulged last night. We've lost contact at the hotel..."

Dominic Blackwood was failing spectacularly at single parenthood.

As Dominic stirred, Isabella woke with a start, jostling Alexander awake in turn. The little boy rubbed his eyes, blinking up at Evelyn before clutching her leg. "Why are you here, Miss Eve?" His voice wobbled with sleep.

Tears pricked Evelyn's eyes as she knelt to cup his face. "Where did you take your sister yesterday? Do you know how worried we all were?"

Alexander's mind raced back to yesterday's events - napping with Daddy and Isabella, Dominic's disastrous attempt at breakfast despite his foul mood, then the stern instructions before he left for work. They needed to make Daddy the villain in their story if they wanted Miss Eve to stay forever.

Now the boy buried his face in Evelyn's sweater. "I'm sorry, Miss Eve. I won't do it again."

Evelyn pulled him close, kissing his tousled hair. "Where did you go last night? Were you frightened? How did you get home?" The rapid-fire questions overwhelmed the unprepared child, who shot a panicked look toward the bathroom where Dominic was washing up.

"Took shelter in a McDonald's overnight," Dominic called hoarsely over running water. "My phone died. The manor was empty."

Perhaps the children had called the estate. Perhaps they'd considered a taxi. But with no one answering and no way inside, what choice did they have?

"Why didn't you contact your father or Uncle Sebastian?" Evelyn pressed.

Alexander bit his lip. Stupid Daddy! You expect me to spin all these lies? "I... didn't have cab money. Scared of bad drivers who might kidnap us."

Isabella's trembling lip and wide eyes sold the story better than any words. After comforting both children, Evelyn tucked them in. "You must be exhausted after your adventure. Try to sleep."

The children obediently closed their eyes, though neither felt tired. Evelyn waited until their breathing evened out before slipping from the room.

She found Dominic on the balcony, cigarette smoke curling around his broad shoulders - shoulders that once made her feel safe. Now they only reminded her of his unreliability.

Stepping outside, she spoke without thinking. "If you can't care for them properly, let me help."

No mother should endure the terror of missing children.

Dominic stubbed out his cigarette. "I've never denied you that right." The cramped balcony forced them into uncomfortable proximity. Evelyn searched his face for answers, but the polished businessman remained inscrutable.

She remembered Sebastian mentioning an important dinner. What could possibly justify abandoning your children overnight? Anger simmered beneath her skin, but she bit it back. What right did she have to judge?

Dominic's next question struck like a blade. "In your current situation, how exactly would you care for them?"

Evelyn's mouth opened, then closed. She stood frozen until Dominic brushed past her, leaving her alone with her thoughts.

Five-year-olds couldn't care for themselves. Grandfather Blackwood was hospitalized. The manor staff had other duties. That left only Beatrice Lockwood - capable, but unpredictable.

Evelyn found Dominic shaving in the bathroom. "I could commute between towns. The trains run frequently, though school pickups would be difficult."

Dominic continued scraping the razor across his jaw, his reflection revealing nothing. When he finally turned, the sharp scent of aftershave filled the space between them. "I won't object. But my mother might."

Beatrice. Of course.

Dominic seemed to reach a decision. "We'll do a DNA test this afternoon." His gaze held hers. "No one can keep a mother from her children."
###Chapter 218

Evelyn's breath hitched when Dominic casually mentioned the DNA test.

What if he was wrong?

What if Alexander and Isabella weren't really hers?

Fear coiled around her heart like a venomous snake.

Her longing to be their mother was so intense that even the slightest possibility of losing them felt like a dagger twisting in her chest.

She deliberately avoided asking about the test schedule. Part of her wanted to flee.

The conversation died after that awkward topic. Silence stretched between them.

Alone in the bedroom, the air grew thick with tension.

"I should check emails from the town office." Evelyn practically bolted for the living room.

Dominic's strong fingers closed around her wrist. He pulled her back against his muscular frame. Her lashes fluttered as she looked up.

Those expressive doe eyes held a vulnerability that made his restraint waver.

Evelyn couldn't meet his gaze. Watching his Adam's apple bob, she flushed when his lips claimed hers. Her pulse skyrocketed, breaths turning ragged...

She nearly bit his lip from nervousness.

Dominic didn't release her. Breaking the kiss, he murmured against her ear, "You're unusually tense. This isn't our first rodeo."

Scarlet flooded her cheeks.

Summoning courage, she shoved him away and fled, hands covering her burning face.

Evelyn had brought her laptop from the small town, anticipating work emergencies.

Now she typed furiously, coordinating with colleagues back home.

At 11:30, two sleepy voices called, "Miss Evie, we're awake!"

Alexander and Isabella rubbed their eyes, scanning the room for the missing adult before draping themselves over Evelyn's back.

"Where's Daddy?" Alexander asked, peering at the complex designs on her screen.

Dominic was in the study.

Through the closed door, Evelyn heard two muffled phone conversations.

"Miss Evie, I'm hungry..." Isabella nuzzled into Evelyn's lap, wrapping chubby arms around her neck.

Evelyn kissed the girl's forehead. "What would you like, sweetheart?"

Dominic emerged to find this domestic scene - Evelyn laughing breathlessly with Isabella while Alexander clung to her side.

His presence made Evelyn freeze mid-laugh.

"We're dining out. Reservation's at twelve." Dominic addressed Evelyn before turning to the children. "Change clothes. Stop smothering her."

The quartet exited the apartment - Dominic striding ahead, Evelyn trailing with a child on each side.

The concierge watched wistfully, wishing she could snap a photo of T Corporation's CEO with his apparent family.

Evelyn's stomach churned during the drive, dreading the test results.

The restaurant owner greeted them personally, scrutinizing Evelyn.

For someone of Dominic's stature, the DNA test required absolute discretion.

High society knew about his twins but not their mother's identity. Surrogacy rumors swirled, yet the truth remained hidden.

Evelyn squirmed under the woman's appraisal.

"Dominic mentioned you're Evelyn? Any dietary preferences?" The owner's gaze lingered on Evelyn's face, searching for something familiar.

"Yes, Evelyn Sinclair. No preferences." Evelyn forced politeness.

"I'll prepare our specialties then."

After she left, Dominic explained, "Aunt Sylvia knew Mother and Aunt Genevieve in school. They had a falling out."

Evelyn panicked. "Will she tell—"

"She won't. Their friendship ended decades ago."

Evelyn found this oddly endearing.

When the DNA collector arrived, Evelyn's throat tightened.

The professional woman shook hands with the adults before noticing the children's outstretched palms.

"Pleasure to meet you," she said, amused.

"Nice to meet you, Miss!" The twins chorused.

The sampling took under ten minutes. As the woman departed, Alexander asked, "Daddy, why'd she take our hair?"

"To check if you're geniuses." Dominic lied smoothly, then slid a plate of perfectly sliced steak toward Evelyn.

Evelyn stared at the meticulously arranged meat...

Downstairs, the restaurant owner racked her brain.

That young woman looked strikingly familiar.

She resembled... a younger version of Genevieve Prescott.
###Chapter 219

The waiters finished serving and discreetly exited the private dining room.

This restaurant operated on exclusivity. The owner, Sylvia Kingsley, didn't subscribe to the notion that customers were always right. She reserved the right to refuse service to anyone.

Her clientele consisted either of regulars or those whose personalities met her exacting standards. Naturally, they also needed the means to afford the exorbitant prices. Anyone displaying rudeness would never taste the culinary masterpieces created here.

Sylvia had built a reputation for her fiery temperament. Over the years, she'd offended countless nouveau riche types - those with wealth but lacking refinement.

She could afford such behavior. Her husband and son held considerable influence in high society.

Evelyn took a few bites before turning to feed Isabella, who clung to her side. The little girl's affection melted Evelyn's heart. Had Isabella refused the gourmet meal, Evelyn would've abandoned Dominic and Alexander without hesitation to cook for her at home.

"You should try this too, Miss Eve! It's sweet!" Isabella mumbled through a mouthful of food, her large eyes blinking up at Evelyn.

Evelyn smiled, using her fingers to wipe sauce from the corner of Isabella's mouth.

The restaurant owner reentered unexpectedly.

Dominic stiffened. It was highly inappropriate for outsiders to interrupt a family meal.

Sylvia cleared her throat delicately. She knew her intrusion broke protocol - not her usual style, despite her senior status.

But Evelyn's striking resemblance to a younger Genevieve Prescott had overwhelmed her curiosity.

Sylvia pulled up a chair unceremoniously, studying Evelyn. "How's the food, dear? Does it meet your standards?"

"It's exquisite. Now I understand your reputation," Evelyn replied.

Earlier, Dominic had explained the restaurant's exclusive nature.

Sylvia nodded, satisfied. After a pause, she voiced her burning question: "Evelyn, may I ask how old you are?"

"I'll be twenty-four this year," Evelyn answered honestly, though puzzled by the inquiry.

"Twenty-four..." Sylvia murmured, lost in thought.

Hadn't Genevieve borne her first child twenty-four years ago? The timeline blurred in Sylvia's memory.

That child hadn't survived.

It marked the darkest period for Genevieve and Jonathan. As Genevieve's childhood friend and confidante, Sylvia never inquired about the loss.

Afterward, Genevieve never conceived again.

Jonathan came from political aristocracy. His family couldn't tolerate the lack of an heir.

Sylvia never learned how they resolved it, though rumors suggested Jonathan claimed infertility to protect Genevieve.

They'd been friends since elementary school. Sylvia remembered Genevieve's pregnancy vividly - they'd gone to the doctor together for confirmation.

When Jonathan learned of his fiancée's condition, he'd accelerated their wedding plans.

After marrying, they'd gone abroad.

Then the child was gone. Sylvia never dared ask if it was stillbirth or miscarriage.

Genevieve never became pregnant again.

Studying Evelyn's face, Sylvia wondered: Had the child been stolen at birth?

Could Evelyn be Genevieve's lost daughter?

In the kitchen, Sylvia had dismissed such coincidence. But recent news haunted her - a man discovering his adoption through culinary preferences.

If that could happen, perhaps...

"Mrs. Kingsley?" Dominic interrupted her reverie.

Sylvia blinked. "Forgive me. You know how critical your mother can be, Dominic. Even if Evelyn is the twins' birth mother, Beatrice Lockwood's standards are... exacting."

Everyone present knew Beatrice's temperament well.

Yet Beatrice had never truly been an obstacle between Dominic and Evelyn.

If Evelyn wished it, nothing could stop Dominic from claiming her.

Sylvia studied Evelyn again. "Don't misunderstand - I'm not suggesting you're unworthy. But Beatrice isn't someone to cross lightly. I worry your gentle nature might clash with hers. May I ask... what do your parents do?"

This was her true question.

The preamble made it seem less intrusive.

Sylvia desperately hoped Evelyn would say, "I'm an orphan. I don't know my parents."

That would leave room for possibility.

Dominic watched Evelyn, ready to intervene if she seemed uncomfortable. But Evelyn answered calmly, "My father does manual labor. As for my mother... I've never met her."
###Chapter 220

Dominic studied Evelyn's face, searching for any flicker of emotion.

His childhood had been marked by absence - no father, a mother who'd abandoned him to an orphanage. Though she'd visited occasionally, young Dominic had carried unanswered questions like stones in his pockets.

'Who is my father?'
'Why doesn't he want me?'
'Does anyone want me?'

That hollow ache of abandonment fueled his determination to pour unconditional love onto Evelyn.

Yet he knew no affection could replace what only parents could give.

Evelyn had never known her mother.

Like Alexander across the table and Isabella beside her, she'd spent years longing for a mother's embrace. A dream that remained unfulfilled, even when she became a mother herself...

Alexander sat primly beside his father, fork poised with perfect manners. His solemn gaze lifted to study Miss Sinclair opposite him, realizing with childlike clarity that she shared their motherless state.

Sylvia pressed her lips together, absorbing Evelyn's revelation. Her pulse had raced during the questioning - desperate for answers yet fearing she'd overstepped. The confirmation that Evelyn had never met her mother sent conflicting waves through her.

"Why haven't you met her?" Sylvia pressed, leaning forward.

Evelyn's hand froze mid-air, a spoonful of food hovering near Isabella's lips. The personal probing felt intrusive.

"I didn't realize you'd taken up gossip, Aunt Sylvia," Dominic interjected smoothly, drawing protective boundaries.

Evelyn shot him a grateful look. No one enjoyed having wounds prodded by strangers.

Unfazed, Sylvia turned earnest eyes to Dominic. "You know I've severed ties with your mother. Finding someone she despises... naturally I'd take interest."

The "someone" being Beatrice Lockwood's nemesis - Evelyn Sinclair.

"Here, sweetheart," Evelyn murmured, offering Isabella another bite of garlic-roasted broccoli.

Isabella chewed thoughtfully, concern shimmering in her wide eyes. She longed to comfort Miss Sinclair but hesitated with so many watching eyes.

Evelyn understood Sylvia's meaning perfectly. Beatrice didn't merely dislike her - she loathed her with venomous intensity.

"Visit anytime, Evelyn," Sylvia said suddenly, reaching to clasp her hand. "I'll cook whatever you crave. And if Beatrice troubles you, come to me."

Evelyn stared blankly at their joined hands as Sylvia gave an affectionate pat.

Recognizing Dominic's silent warning, Sylvia rose gracefully. "Enjoy your meal. I've overstayed my welcome." With a playful wink at Dominic's stern expression, she teased, "Relax, I'm not stealing your bride-to-be."

"Bride?" Alexander gasped.

His head swiveled between Dominic and Evelyn, cheeks flushing pink. "Miss Sinclair, are you marrying Daddy?"

Isabella turned hopeful eyes upward.

Evelyn tightened her embrace instinctively as Isabella whispered, "Please be our mommy. We could be a proper family..."

Dominic's intense gaze locked onto Evelyn, fork suspended mid-air.

Her grip on Isabella's small hand tightened unconsciously.

She yearned for this - to wake each morning to Alexander's serious eyes and Isabella's giggles. To mend the years stolen from them...

Outside, a black Mercedes purred to life.

Dominic's sharp gaze tracked Sylvia's departure.

Across town, Sylvia settled into the leather seat, extracting her phone. The screen illuminated with "Lillian Prescott."

Lillian stood outside her trailer on a forested film set. "Aunt Sylvia? What's wrong?"

Hearing that sweet voice, Sylvia felt a pang for Genevieve - bereft of her biological child yet blessed with this devoted adopted daughter.

"I need to discuss your mother's past. A favor too. Not suitable for phones. Are you available?"

Lillian halted, causing her assistant Sophia to nearly collide with her.

"I'll send my location. Filming all afternoon, but you're welcome here."

"Perfect." Sylvia ended the call.

As she shared coordinates, Lillian puzzled over Sylvia's sudden interest in her mother's history.

The crew bustled around the woodland set. With an hour until Sylvia's arrival, Lillian shed her coat and moved toward makeup chairs, trailed by attendants.

Sophia clutched the discarded coat, eyeing the camera equipment with poorly concealed ambition. She wondered when Lillian would make proper introductions to industry elites.

Noticing the chill, Sophia decided waiting outside wasn't worth pneumonia. She'd find somewhere warm to bide her time.
###Chapter 221

The icy wind bit into Sophia's skin, making her face numb and her limbs feel like frozen sticks.

She turned her head, spotting the RV parked a distance away.

After that morning's incident, she'd become familiar with the RV driver. Clutching the coat tightly, she hurried toward the vehicle and knocked urgently.

The driver recognized Sophia immediately, assuming she was Lillian's new assistant. He opened the trailer door without hesitation.

Sophia rushed inside, rubbing her stiff fingers together as she tried to regain feeling in her hands.

Meanwhile on set, Lillian Prescott was struggling with her performance.

The director was a national treasure, his films consistently winning awards. Actresses fought tooth and nail for roles in his projects, but few met his exacting standards.

He'd only cast Lillian as the lead out of desperation. When his primary investor pulled out, production had nearly collapsed.

Then came an anonymous backer with one non-negotiable condition - Lillian Prescott must star in the film.

Torn between artistic integrity and financial necessity, the director had agonized for weeks.

In the end, his dream project won out over principles.

Lillian's debut had been decently received, and her political family connections were impressive. The director hoped he could polish her raw talent while securing his funding.

The first two shooting days went smoothly, but today was proving disastrous.

"Cut!" The director bellowed in frustration for the twelfth time.

Lillian's co-star, a respected forty-something actor known for his award-winning performances, wiped his face in clear annoyance before walking off set.

She caught his agent shooting her a contemptuous look.

"Maybe take five, Lillian," her assistant murmured, offering a steaming mug of lemon water.

The warm drink did little to soothe Lillian's rising temper. Her mood darkened further when she realized Sophia wasn't waiting with her coat.

"Where's that useless girl?" she snapped.

Her assistants scrambled to locate Sophia.

"Never mind. I'll find her myself."

Lillian needed an outlet for her mounting frustration.

When the driver opened the RV door, Lillian's eyes narrowed. There was Sophia, curled up on the plush couch, fast asleep.

Using Lillian's designer coat as a pillow, no less.

"Well..."

The two senior assistants exchanged shocked glances. This new hire had serious nerve.

Lillian shook her head with false patience. "She's new. Doesn't know better. I should be more understanding."

Her assistants nodded, relieved their boss was taking the high road. Other stars would have caused a scene.

Once inside, the assistants closed the door to give Lillian privacy.

The spacious trailer was soundproofed from the driver's cabin.

Only Lillian and the sleeping Sophia remained in the luxurious space.

Sophia didn't stir as Lillian approached. With a cold smile, Lillian lifted her designer boot and brought it down hard on Sophia's exposed hand.

"Ahhh!"

Sophia jolted awake, cradling her injured hand.

It took her ten seconds of blinking to process that Lillian Prescott had deliberately stomped on her.

The malicious glint in Lillian's eyes confirmed it.

"Are you brain dead? When I finish a scene, you bring my coat immediately. Is that too complicated for you?" Lillian shrieked.

Sophia bit back the urge to slap the actress. "I'm sorry. It was freezing outside. I didn't mean to fall asleep..."

"Freezing?" Lillian's gaze raked over Sophia's outfit before smirking. "Yet you parade around half-naked? Who are you trying to seduce? Look at yourself - do you really think this pathetic act will get you anywhere?"

Sophia's face cycled through several shades of red.

She was saved by the timely arrival of Sylvia Kingsley's car.

Sophia made herself scarce as Lillian helped Sylvia inside, retreating behind a tree to chain-smoke while mentally cursing Lillian to hell.

Inside the trailer...

After exchanging pleasantries, Sylvia cut to the chase. "Lillian, I need to ask about your mother."

Lillian blinked. "What about her?"

"I know you're searching for fertility treatments so your parents can conceive. But I may have found... the child your mother lost."

Lillian's smile froze. "Excuse me?"

"I'm not certain yet. I didn't want to get your mother's hopes up. Could you discreetly find out how she lost her child?"

Lillian forced a bright smile. "How wonderful! My parents would be overjoyed to reunite with their biological daughter..."

As Sylvia departed, Lillian's expression darkened.

"Reunited? Don't make me laugh."

Meanwhile, Dominic Blackwood drove while Evelyn Sinclair sat in back with their twins.

"Miss Evelyn..." Isabella fidgeted with a button on Evelyn's blouse, her chubby fingers twisting nervously.

Evelyn leaned down, pressing her forehead to the little girl's. "What is it, sweetheart?"

The child took a deep breath. "Mommy..." she whispered.
###Chapter 222

That single word shattered Evelyn's composure completely.

"Mommy."

For most people, it was the most natural word in existence. Often the first utterance from a baby's lips.

But for Evelyn Sinclair, it was a foreign luxury.

Foreign because she'd never had anyone to call "Mommy" since learning to speak.

Twenty-four years of life without ever speaking that cherished word.

Pregnant at eighteen. Separated from her babies at birth.

During her studies abroad, she'd seen countless young mothers. Some single, some clinging to equally young husbands. All with toddlers calling them "Mommy" in different languages.

Those sidewalk encounters always made her wonder about her own children.

Did they get to say that word like other kids? Maybe their fate would be kinder than hers.

Seasons changed, but she remained the solitary figure wandering foreign streets.

Wondering where they were. What they were doing. If they ever missed their mother like she'd missed hers.

Then reality struck when her father fell ill. Sentiment became a luxury she couldn't afford.

No room for fantasies about maternal love or family bonds.

She'd failed as a mother.

When Isabella called her "Mommy," Evelyn's breath caught. She pressed her lips tight, clutching the girl fiercely.

Silence filled the car's interior.

Through the rearview mirror, Dominic watched his daughter clinging to Evelyn.

Hearing that word, he finally felt like a real father. Sharing in Evelyn's parental pride.

Tears burned Evelyn's eyes, turning them crimson.

"What's wrong, Miss Eve? Don't you like me calling you Mommy?" Isabella blinked up at her with crystalline innocence. The resemblance struck Evelyn anew.

"No, darling. I love it." Evelyn's voice cracked as she gazed at the child who felt like her missing piece.

Confused by the tears, Isabella reached chubby fingers toward Evelyn's face—when her phone rang.

"Back to your seat, Isabella." Dominic's command held no warmth, only authority.

The girl obeyed instantly.

"Aunt Gwendolyn?" Evelyn answered shakily.

"Are you still in town? I'm transferring funds to you this afternoon."

"I'm in A City actually." Evelyn swallowed hard. "Aunt Gwendolyn, this amount is too much—"

"Your voice sounds strange. Are you crying?"

"Just...a cold."

"Since you're here, let's meet. You can tell me what's troubling you."

At 3 PM, they sat in a fifth-floor café overlooking the mall atrium. Gwendolyn sipped coffee from a brown cloth seat.

"I've never kept secrets from you, Evelyn. No children. Elderly father. Sick brother. Your grandfather said my brother feared your stepmother—that she was cruel. Did she hurt you?"

Evelyn avoided those painful memories. "It's in the past."

"I'm your only mobile relative. Who else should inherit my wealth?"

Evelyn couldn't accept it.

The woman before her wasn't old. Beautiful. Educated. Her previous marriage had been happy.

Yet fate had cursed her with an incurable disease.

During their first meeting in town, Gwendolyn had revealed her diagnosis and life expectancy.

That explained why she'd sent Evelyn's grandfather back alone before disappearing.

The initial terror and suffering had been unimaginable.

"If the money burdens you, here's an idea. You studied design, yes? Start your own studio. I have college friends in the industry who could help."

Evelyn remained hesitant.

"Consider it employment. Better than your current job with its overtime and no time for family. Working for others won't fulfill your dreams. Does your company even value you?"

The words struck deep.

Every design student entered the field with passion, but few achieved success.

Without connections, they became cogs in others' machines. A thankless grind.

Finding Evelyn stubborn, Gwendolyn took her shopping after coffee.

Evelyn insisted she didn't need skincare products.

They eventually reached a lingerie boutique.

"Seeing anyone?" Gwendolyn asked abruptly in the intimate apparel section, eyeing her niece's conservative attire.

"Sort of..." How could Evelyn explain this complicated situation?

"Crushing on someone but don't know how to attract him?"

Evelyn stayed silent.

"You should embrace your femininity. Judging by your clothes, your undergarments must be dreadful."

Gwendolyn selected three silk lingerie sets.

"Genuine silk. Follows every curve. No man can resist such delicate femininity."

Evelyn flushed crimson.

The designs were scandalously bold.

If Dominic ever saw her in these...
###Chapter 223

"No, Aunt Gwendolyn, I can't wear those..."

Evelyn pushed the scandalous lingerie away, her cheeks burning crimson. The delicate fabrics her aunt had selected looked more like trouble than clothing.

She kept her gaze firmly on the floor, unable to even glance at the provocative items.

Gwendolyn sighed dramatically. "You're twenty-four, Evelyn! Not some prudish old maid! If you don't wear these now, when exactly do you plan to? When you're sixty?"

With surprising strength, Gwendolyn dragged her reluctant niece toward the fitting room.

"I really can't—they're too—" Evelyn's protests fell on deaf ears as both her aunt and the enthusiastic saleswoman bombarded her with reasons why every young woman should own seductive lingerie.

Evelyn understood the importance of celebrating one's femininity, but these selections crossed every line of decency she knew.

Gwendolyn lived life with reckless abandon. Given her terminal diagnosis fifteen years ago, she'd vowed never to deny her body or soul any pleasure.

Inside the fitting room, Gwendolyn efficiently stripped Evelyn of her modest clothing while lecturing, "Thank heavens I never had daughters. I'd go mad dealing with your puritanical attitudes. There's nothing shameful about desire, especially with someone you love. Life's too short for such ridiculous modesty."

"Please, Aunt Gwendolyn..."

Evelyn stared at the flimsy scraps of fabric that supposedly constituted underwear. Her face burned so hot she could have powered a small generator.

Gwendolyn fixed her with a serious look. "Listen to me. A woman is like a rare orchid—she needs proper cultivation. Pleasure should be your priority, whether physical or emotional. Why must you act so embarrassed?"

Evelyn wanted nothing to do with the lingerie. "Stop resisting," Gwendolyn warned. "My health isn't what it used to be. One wrong shove and I might collapse right here."

Through a combination of persuasion and veiled threats, Gwendolyn finally succeeded in dressing Evelyn in the scandalous undergarments.

Evelyn's porcelain skin glowed under the boutique lights. She flushed deeper when Gwendolyn remained in the fitting room, critically examining her niece's transformation.

"Wait here," Gwendolyn ordered, scooping up Evelyn's sensible cotton underwear. "I'll be right back."

"Where are you taking those?" Evelyn called out too late.

Gwendolyn unceremoniously dumped the plain underwear in a trash bin. She couldn't tolerate such prudishness.

Alone in the fitting room, Evelyn studied her reflection. Her breathing quickened as she took in the daring design. This wasn't lingerie—it was a provocation.

"Try these next."

Gwendolyn returned with another set, freshly sanitized and warm from the steamer.

Evelyn examined the new offering with trepidation. "What is this?"

She reluctantly put it on, then gasped at her reflection. "This isn't underwear—it's practically nothing!"

"Don't you dare take it off," Gwendolyn commanded, admiring how the fabric accentuated Evelyn's curves. "You look exquisite. At your age, I'd own fifty sets and wear them daily."

Evelyn had reached her limit. Silk and lace were one thing, but this bordered on fetish wear. She'd never voluntarily wear such a thing.

"Your old underthings made you look like a nun," Gwendolyn said bluntly. "I threw them all away."

"You what?"

Realization dawned—this was an ambush.

"It doesn't matter," Evelyn said stubbornly. "No one will see under all my layers anyway." Thankfully, autumn's chill meant heavy sweaters and coats. She'd rather freeze than wear such scandalous lingerie.

An odd mixture of shame and guilt twisted in her stomach.

Gwendolyn finally relented. When she emerged from the fitting room with the lingerie, Evelyn was already waiting outside the store.

At the register, Gwendolyn scribbled an address. "Deliver everything here."

Meanwhile, across the mall, Sophia stood frozen before a display of bras, watching Evelyn disappear into the crowd.

She pulled out her phone and texted Maxwell: "Where are you?"

"Just got off the escalator," came the immediate reply. "Your location?"

After Lillian's latest tantrum—crushing Sophia's fingers under her heel—the other assistants had taken over pampering the starlet. Sophia had gone to get her injuries treated, then sought solace in retail therapy.

Forty minutes ago, she'd spotted Evelyn having coffee with an elegant older woman.

The green-eyed monster of jealousy reared its head. Sophia had always envied Evelyn—what made her so special to capture first Nathan's heart, then Dominic's?

Now Maxwell—the man of Sophia's dreams, her provider and protector—turned out to be Evelyn's husband!

If not for that news leak, she'd never have known. How did Evelyn keep attracting such men?

The injustice burned. Sophia couldn't bear to see Evelyn happy. If Maxwell's marriage was as troubled as rumors suggested, she'd make sure it ended in ruins.

After all, Evelyn clearly didn't value what she had.
###Chapter 224

Evelyn strode toward the elevator, where Maxwell was already waiting impatiently.

Maxwell didn't even spare her a glance. His eyes scanned the area, searching for someone who wasn't there.

"Where is she?" His voice was sharp as a blade.

The icy glare he shot Evelyn conveyed an unspoken threat: "You'll regret it if this is another lie."

"She left. I didn't stop her." Evelyn swallowed hard. "I think I saw her purchasing... intimate items."

Intimate items?

Maxwell's gaze swept across the luxury mall. Every store here specialized in lingerie, but was there something more scandalous available?

The Evelyn he knew would never dare buy such things.

"Check for yourself if you don't believe me." Evelyn led him toward the boutique.

At the high-end lingerie shop, Evelyn approached the sales associate. "Could you describe what the beautiful lady bought earlier?"

"Several lingerie sets," the clerk answered brightly.

Of course - this store sold nothing but lingerie. No secrets there.

"May I see the designs? I'm considering purchasing similar pieces," Evelyn pressed.

The clerk guided them to the display. Maxwell watched as three sets were presented.

The first two were already provocative enough.

The third set made Maxwell's blood boil. Sheer black fabric barely qualified as clothing.

Evelyn traced a finger over the scandalous garment. "Is this... even wearable?"

"Our bestseller this season," the clerk chirped, oblivious to Maxwell's identity. "Ultra-soft fabric that protects while revealing. Perfect for spicing up marital relations."

Maxwell's jaw clenched. Who was Evelyn buying this for?

When Evelyn reached for her wallet to purchase a set, Maxwell spat out two venomous words: "Disgusting slut!"

Evelyn froze. "Maxwell, where—"

But he was already storming out. She hastily returned the lingerie and chased after him.

As she followed, a thought nagged at her: Had that insult been meant for Evelyn?

Exiting the parking garage, Maxwell spotted Evelyn waiting at a bus stop.

That slender figure should have blended into the crowd, yet his eyes locked onto her instantly.

Evelyn noticed Maxwell's focus and panicked. Evelyn carried no shopping bags.

Earlier, she'd seen a well-dressed woman drag Evelyn into the lingerie store. They'd left empty-handed, though the other woman had remained at the register.

Had Evelyn not received the purchased items?

When Maxwell pulled his Porsche up to the bus stop, blocking it entirely, irritated commuters glared.

Evelyn was among those who turned—and nearly fainted when she saw Maxwell emerge.

He slammed the car door, seized her wrist, and dragged her away with murder in his eyes.

"Let go! Have you lost your mind?" Evelyn stumbled, grabbing the bus stop pole with her free hand.

Maxwell's glacial stare pierced her. "We're going home. Isn't this what you wanted? Your precious divorce papers?"

Evelyn knew better than to trust him.

She shook her head violently. "My lawyer will handle the divorce. I won't fall for your tricks again."

Last time, he'd kidnapped her grandfather to force the marriage. Who knew what he'd do now?

Even if he promised divorce, it was surely a trap.

Sophia exited the car just in time to hear the word "divorce." A spark ignited in her cold heart.

"Where else would you go, dressed like a saint but acting like a whore?" Maxwell's gaze raked over Evelyn. "Even if you are one, I'll be the first to sample your wares."

Noticing Evelyn's lack of shopping bags, he grabbed her purse instead.

Inside were only IDs and bank cards. As bystanders watched, they wrestled for the bag.

"Stop it, Maxwell Lockwood!" Evelyn clung desperately to her belongings.

Maxwell sneered. "Stop? So you can meet your lover with those filthy things?"

Evelyn had no idea what he meant.

He upended the purse, scattering its contents across the pavement.

Nothing scandalous—just ordinary items.

Maxwell looked stunned.

Evelyn snatched back her purse and crouched to collect her things.

"Miss! The bus is coming!" Two middle-aged women yanked Evelyn to safety just as the bus screeched to a halt.

They shot Maxwell disgusted looks before paying Evelyn's fare and ushering her aboard.

As the bus pulled away, Sophia shrank into the shadows, silent.
###Chapter 225

Maxwell sat slumped in the leather seat of his Porsche Cayenne. His eyes were shut tight, fingers massaging his temples. A cigarette dangled from his other hand, its ember glowing with each occasional drag.

Sophia hesitated outside the car. She wanted to explain herself but couldn't summon the courage. Maxwell's current expression promised nothing but trouble for whoever crossed him now.

Yet staying silent would be just as dangerous.

Maxwell had introduced her to Lillian. That woman treated her worse than dirt, even crushing her fingers beneath her heel. But if she left Lillian's side, who else would give her the time of day?

Not even Sophia valued herself anymore.

Perhaps if she endured long enough, Lillian might finally grant her a real opportunity.

As the Porsche sped away, Sophia flagged down a taxi. "Follow that car," she instructed the driver.

Maxwell returned to his bar.

He chose a secluded window seat, letting the night breeze cool his face while swirling the dark red liquid in his glass. Within minutes, half the bottle was gone.

A waiter approached cautiously. "Sir, that's too strong for an empty stomach." The high-proof liquor could knock out most men.

Maxwell dismissed him with a wave.

Pouring another glass, he'd hoped the alcohol would dull his thoughts. Instead, his mind grew sharper.

Evelyn Sinclair!

That breathtaking woman!

Her graceful silhouette at the bus stop haunted him. The alcohol dragged him back five years - before prison.

His childhood friend had invited him for drinks after asking a favor. The friend boasted about acquiring a virgin through a broker, offering Maxwell first rights.

Such transactions never interested him.

Still, he'd agreed to look.

In the dim nightclub, Maxwell sat regally on the couch as a fragile figure entered his line of sight.

Evelyn stood bathed in soft light, eyes downcast, too shy to meet anyone's gaze.

Among all the women Maxwell had known, Evelyn was the most delicate - like a flower that would bruise at the slightest touch.

Her cheap white dress and worn canvas shoes screamed poverty.

Strangely, Maxwell couldn't bring himself to touch this timid girl with her innocent face.

Despite his experience with women, something about her made him hold back.

Eighteen-year-old Evelyn was like an unripe peach - showing promise but still bitter and hard.

"Do you know how to please a man?" Maxwell had asked.

"N-no... but I can learn..." Her stammered reply took visible effort. She bit her lip afterward, brows knitting in pain.

Maxwell imagined how she'd blossom with time.

Rather than corrupt her, he'd negotiated with the broker that night to purchase her freedom.

Everything was settled - just the payment remained.

Then came the call.

Another buyer had closed the deal, offering full financial and medical support to Evelyn's family.

"Who?" Maxwell's voice shook.

"The buyer's assistant completed the transaction. Said his employer was a man in his fifties wanting a childbearer," the broker admitted.

Maxwell smashed his phone against the wall.

He despised that old man preying on a young girl.

That memory festered for years.

Five years after prison, he saw that familiar face at Blackwood Manor...

No longer wearing that cheap dress, Evelyn had matured into a luscious, ripe peach.

Someone had stolen what was rightfully his.

Dominic Blackwood - that beast - had taken the girl Maxwell once protected!

Now consumed by revenge, Maxwell would stop at nothing to claim Evelyn.

Was it the mature woman who tempted him now? Or did he still yearn for that unripe girl from years past?

Evelyn Sinclair wasn't some fruit to be plucked.

Humans had souls.

Playing with them was easy. Truly possessing one? Nearly impossible.

Sophia watched from a distance as Maxwell drained glass after glass. Only when he swayed drunkenly did she approach.

"Let me help you upstairs," she offered, hoping to curry favor.

"Who... who are you?" Maxwell's bleary eyes saw only Evelyn's face.

Sophia guided him upstairs.

Maxwell staggered but kept most weight off her, gripping the banister instead.

Inside the room, he pinned Sophia onto a blood-red couch near the door.

Never had he been so gentle. His heated kisses trailed her skin, each breath heavy with desire...
###Chapter 226

Maxwell froze mere centimeters from Sophia's lips. "I'll admit I'm not some beast like him," he slurred bitterly. "Otherwise you'd have been carrying my child five years ago..."

Sober as could be, Sophia blinked in confusion.

What beast was he talking about?

Who had gotten pregnant five years ago?

Her arousal evaporated instantly.

Drunk men always spilled truths they'd never dare speak sober.

She needed to hear more.

"Maxwell, what do you—ah!" Her question dissolved into a gasp as his wandering hands reignited her desire.

He dragged her to bed, pinning her beneath him with eyes closed. One hand cradled her head while the other traced her cheekbones. "Why couldn't you wait one more day?" he murmured. "I had the money ready. How could you sell yourself to that fifty-year-old? Weren't you disgusted?"

Later he'd learned it wasn't some aging businessman but the dashing Dominic Blackwood who'd funded Evelyn's father's treatment. But the middleman had lied.

"Such a fool," Maxwell whispered, forehead pressed to hers, the alcohol only amplifying his torment.

The liquor loosened his tongue further. "Five years ago... I wanted to storm that hospital and tell your dying father how his precious daughter whored herself to save him..."

Sophia's eyes flew wide.

No amount of touching could rekindle her desire now.

Five years ago... liver disease...

He meant Robert Sinclair, Evelyn's father.

The timeline matched perfectly.

Sold her body?

Sophia's mind reeled.

She pieced together his drunken ramblings. Had Maxwell intended to buy Evelyn but failed? Had some middle-aged man purchased her instead? To bear his child?

The revelation left her speechless.

The prominent bulge in Maxwell's trousers snapped her back to reality.

His desire remained painfully evident.

Did he think she was Evelyn?

Were all these cruel words meant for her stepsister?

Now his recent disinterest made sense. Every time they undressed, he'd push her away. She'd assumed performance issues or waning attraction.

But the evidence straining against his pants proved otherwise.

Tears pricked her eyes—from humiliation or fury, she couldn't tell. Was she truly so undesirable?

She'd accepted being less fortunate than Lillian, but losing to Evelyn? Unbearable.

"Look at me," she demanded. "Who am I?" She'd devoted herself entirely to Maxwell. He provided everything—he was her perfect match.

But being mistaken for Evelyn? The ultimate insult.

She'd despised Evelyn since the day her mother married into the Sinclair family.

If Evelyn dared claim the Sinclair legacy, Sophia would take everything from her.

Maxwell's drunken confession felt like a knife to the heart.

Tears streamed down her defiant face as he gripped her chin. "We share no blood. We look nothing alike. How could you confuse me with her?"

Alcohol transported Maxwell to some twisted fantasy. The more he fixated on Evelyn, the more every woman became her.

He studied the woman beneath him through hooded eyes, sculpted brow furrowing. Evelyn's face and Sophia's voice blurred together. The confusion enraged him.

"Get out!" He shoved her toward the door. "Who gave you the right to be in my bed? A thousand beauties exist, yet you chose to be this repulsive!"

He'd never admit caring for any woman—especially not that used goods who'd borne Dominic Blackwood's brats.

Meanwhile, Evelyn rode the bus to visit her grandfather. After ensuring his health and medication regimen, she headed to her father's hospital.

At dinner, Dominic texted: [Where are you?]

[Staying with Dad tonight. We have catching up to do.]

Respecting father-daughter time, Dominic replied he'd return to town tomorrow but head back to A City tonight. He'd take the twins to school but asked if she could pick them up.

[No problem.]

Morning came.

Dominic spent the day revisiting childhood haunts, finding solace in nostalgia.

Before leaving town, a courier arrived at the courtyard. "Package for Evelyn Sinclair!"

A female employee rushed to sign when her imposing boss intercepted the parcel, scrawling his signature with elegant fingers before tossing it into his car.

The entire courtyard gaped.

Even the yard dog barked in disbelief at the theft.

Dominic drove off toward A City. If people misunderstood his actions? All the better.
###Chapter 227

In Robert Sinclair's residence.

Victoria Montgomery returned from her weekly bridge game. She went to check on her daughter Sophia, only to find the girl curled up under her blanket.

"What's wrong with you? Still not done sleeping?" Victoria yanked the blanket away.

Sophia turned with a scowl. "Get out! This is my room!"
"Are you ill?" Victoria noticed her daughter's flushed face. She pressed a hand to Sophia's forehead.

The fever was undeniable.

Last night's humiliation still burned in Sophia's memory. Maxwell Lockwood had nearly taken her to bed in that room above his bar. Clothes discarded, passion rising - until he realized his mistake and threw her out into the chilly autumn night.

No wonder she'd caught a fever.

She'd called Lillian Prescott's agent first thing, claiming illness.

But her mind wasn't on Lillian. All day, one name had haunted her - Evelyn Sinclair.

Head swimming, Sophia propped herself against the headboard. Victoria returned with aspirin and water.

"Take these." The older woman sat on the bed's edge.

Sophia accepted the medicine but hesitated. "Mother, do you remember Uncle Robert's liver cancer five years ago?"

"Of course. Why ask now?" Victoria looked startled.

Sophia had spent all day brooding over this. "Then who paid for his transplant and treatment?"

Victoria frowned. "Evelyn mentioned... some charity foundation for liver cancer patients. Yes, it must have been a charity."

Otherwise Robert would have refused treatment to save money for Evelyn's education.

Sophia swallowed the pills with a bitter smile. "My sources say it wasn't a charity."

"Then how—" Victoria looked genuinely confused. Without charity funds, where would he get that kind of money?

Even their family savings wouldn't have covered it!

Sophia's eyes gleamed with malicious triumph. "Evelyn sold herself to a man in his fifties for that money."

Victoria gasped. "That's impossible!"

Feverish but energized, Sophia outlined her plan. "Come to the hospital with me tomorrow."

"Why?"

"We'll convince Uncle Robert to transfer the house title to us." Sophia massaged her injured fingers, already rehearsing tomorrow's conversation.

Downtown Apartment

After picking up the twins from school, Evelyn stopped at the grocery store for vegetables, meat, milk and bread.

She was preparing dinner when Dominic Blackwood arrived home unnoticed.

In the living room:

Alexander focused on his homework, pencil gripped tight as he copied vocabulary.

Isabella lay facedown on the couch, clearly upset.

"Why isn't your sister doing homework?" Dominic asked his son.

Alexander glanced at his father, then his sister. "She says she doesn't want to go to school anymore."

Isabella squirmed. "No homework! Hmph!"

Dominic didn't press the issue. He went to shower first.

By dinner time, Dominic emerged in dark casualwear - comfortable yet commanding.

"Come eat," he called softly.

The children reacted like subjects to a king.

Alexander nudged his sister. "School can be fun, Isabella."

"No it's not!" The little girl's pout trembled on the verge of tears.

Evelyn avoided looking at Dominic, focusing on the children. While Alexander adjusted well, Isabella struggled after the initial excitement faded.

This phase was normal. They just needed proper guidance.

"Dinner first, then we'll talk, okay?" Evelyn soothed, carrying Isabella to the table.

Dominic's stern expression darkened. "Explain."

Evelyn worried he'd frighten them.

Alexander picked up his spoon but didn't eat. "Isabella doesn't want to go to school or do homework anymore."

Dominic took a bite. "Not tomorrow? Or never?"

Evelyn observed quietly, unfamiliar with Dominic's parenting style.

Isabella's eyes welled up. "Never."

Noticing Dominic's expression shift, Evelyn intervened. "Let's eat first."

The tense meal ended quickly. While cleaning up, Isabella clung to Evelyn's leg, sobbing.

"Miss Evie...I'll...be a delivery girl...make money...take me away...I'm scared of Daddy..."

The red-faced child hiccuped through tears.

Evelyn carried Isabella to the couch, calming her for an hour until Dominic emerged from his study with a package.

"For you. Open it."

Isabella peeked at her father. "Mean Daddy..."

Evelyn booped the girl's nose. "I'll go scold Daddy now. Bad daddies need scolding."

Isabella nodded eagerly.

Approaching Dominic's study with the package, Evelyn sought an opening to discuss parenting. "Where's this from?"

As she opened the padded envelope, she continued, "Couldn't you be gentler with—"

The contents slipped from her fingers.

Evelyn's face burned crimson when she saw what lay on the floor.

"You bought this?"

Dominic's gaze traveled from the fallen items to her chest...
###Chapter 228

A scandalous pile of black lace lay sprawled across the study's marble tiles. The delicate fabric left little to the imagination, designed purely for seduction.

Evelyn's cheeks burned as she scooped up the lingerie and fled Dominic's study.

She locked herself in the bathroom, staring at the sinful garments in her hands.

Each piece used shockingly little fabric. The entire collection could fit in one palm...

How utterly mortifying!

She grabbed her phone and texted Gwendolyn.

These were the exact same pieces her aunt had picked out at the boutique!

How had they ended up in Dominic's possession?

Gwendolyn replied instantly. [Of course I bought them for you. What else was I supposed to do when you refused them at the store?]

[I really don't need these, Aunt Gwen. Can we return them?]

Evelyn struggled to articulate her discomfort.

People had different preferences. Evelyn valued comfort above all else in undergarments.

None of these three sets looked remotely comfortable. Just imagining wearing them made her skin crawl.

[Lingerie can't be returned after trying on, darling. That poor salesgirl worked so hard for her commission. Would you really take food from her mouth?]

Evelyn abandoned the return idea, feeling suddenly like a heartless villain.

As she typed a response, Gwendolyn sent a voice message.

Evelyn pressed the phone to her ear, wary of Dominic or the children overhearing.

"You told me you have a boyfriend. Listen - no matter how close you are, things get stale. You need to keep him hungry, keep him wanting more. It benefits you both. Why not try something new?"

Gwendolyn's tone was matter-of-fact, like a professor lecturing a student. Evelyn's face burned crimson.

Her questioning had backfired into an impromptu love lesson.

A knock interrupted her thoughts. Alexander stood outside, legs crossed tightly.

"Miss Evie! I need to pee!"

"Quick, come in." She ushered him inside, closing the door behind them.

The torn packaging had to be discarded.

After disposing of it, Evelyn still clutched the lingerie. She couldn't bring herself to trash such expensive items.

Finally, she stuffed them into her purse. She'd deal with them later.

"Sleepy, Isabella?" Evelyn cradled her drowsy daughter, kissing her soft cheek. "Bath time then bed?"

Isabella nodded sleepily, arms looped around Evelyn's neck.

The warm weight of the child in her arms felt precious as Evelyn carried her to the bathroom. Isabella dozed peacefully, safe in her embrace.

"Who bathed you before I came?" Evelyn wanted to understand her daughter's past.

The sleepy mumble came against her shoulder. "The nannies took turns. One fell... then the other bathed me. After that I did it myself so they wouldn't get hurt."

These "nannies" were clearly the caretakers at Blackwood Manor, not Beatrice.

"Did Daddy ever bathe you?" Evelyn's heart ached for the little girl. No matter how hard she tried, she could never fully compensate for five lost years of motherhood.

Isabella's lips pursed at Dominic's mention. Her lashes fluttered but didn't open. "Once. I splashed water on his shirt. He got angry. Never asked him again."

Evelyn's chest tightened with complicated emotions.

'I'll be the mother you deserve. Daddy won't scare you anymore,' she vowed silently.

'If the DNA test confirms I'm your mother...'

After tucking both children in, Evelyn organized their schoolwork. 9:30 PM.

She left quietly, not disturbing the man working in the study. The apartment door clicked shut behind her.

Checking her watch, she hurried to catch the last subway home.

Forty minutes later, she unlocked her silent apartment.

Days of absence left the space feeling foreign.

She flicked on lights, boiled water, then rolled up her sleeves to clean.

Dust had settled everywhere. She couldn't sleep surrounded by neglect.

The doorbell startled her mid-task.

Evelyn set down the bedsheets, uneasy about nighttime visitors.

Her phone showed no messages. Anyone she knew would have called first.

The bell rang again.

Peering through the peephole, she exhaled when she recognized the figure outside.

"Why are you here?" she asked, opening the door.

Dominic's gaze traveled over her before he wordlessly stepped inside.

Confused, Evelyn closed the door behind him.

She moved to pour water when his voice stopped her. "Why leave when you were already there?"

It took her a moment to understand.

"I thought you didn't have enough beds..."

Dominic's mood visibly lifted. "Wasn't ours big enough for two?"

Evelyn's cheeks warmed. "Let me get you some water," she deflected.

Strong arms pulled her close. His breath fanned across her flushed face. "Did you lure me here because you prefer this small bed?"
###Chapter 229

"Stop! Put me down!"

Before Evelyn could react, Dominic had already swept her off her feet and carried her into the cramped bedroom.

Her hands pressed against his firm chest through the thin fabric of his shirt as she stared up at his dangerously handsome face. She refused to let herself be seduced by his masculine charm again.

Swallowing hard, she whispered nervously, "What... what are you planning to do?"

They weren't married, making this intimacy inappropriate. More importantly, she couldn't handle this constant physical demand.

Ever since coming to this small town, Evelyn had lost count of how many times Dominic had taken her like this. Each encounter left her exhausted and unfocused for work the next day.

It reminded her of five years ago with her mysterious benefactor.

At this point, she hardly needed the DNA test results. The way Dominic took her with such primal hunger convinced her he was that man from five years ago.

What frustrated her most was how unaffected he seemed afterward - always ready to return to work as if nothing happened.

Her body still ached from yesterday's passion, yet here he was, hungry again.

Ignoring her weak protests, Dominic carried her toward the bed, his dark eyes burning with desire as they raked over her trembling form.

Evelyn could only stare up at him helplessly.

Just when she thought he might release her, his expression darkened. In one swift motion, he flipped her over his shoulder.

Dizziness overwhelmed her as blood rushed to her head. Before she could adjust, a cold draft hit her bare legs - he'd already stripped off her pants and tossed them aside...

Only when he pinned her to the slightly worn secondhand bed did Dominic realize how much he enjoyed this.

The partially undone sheets carried her faint, familiar scent.

As he leaned down to claim her lips, Evelyn arched away. "No... please... mmm..." Her weak protest was swallowed by his kiss.

"I need you... now," Dominic growled, one hand gripping her slender waist while the other pushed up her white sweater.

She'd been wearing the same clothes since rushing back to the city from the small town.

Autumn's chill required thicker fabrics than summer's light dresses. Between work and family emergencies, she'd forgotten to change.

Her hurried return to the city - worried about the twins - meant she hadn't packed extra clothes.

Between hospital visits with her father and grandfather, picking up the children, cooking meals, and putting them to bed, she hadn't found time to retrieve clothes from her rental apartment.

Now, after finally getting free time to return home, the grown man in her life had followed her demanding attention of a very different kind...

When Dominic pushed up her sweater, he discovered she wore nothing beneath.

The lingerie Wanda had discarded at the mall left her with no undergarments.

The thick sweater and jacket had concealed this secret all day, but now...

Exhausted yet aroused by his touch, Evelyn's lips parted in soft moans...

"First you buy that lingerie, now you go without anything underneath. Who taught you these tricks?" Dominic murmured between kisses.

Their pounding hearts created a rhythm in the quiet room, sometimes fast, sometimes slow.

Late night silence enveloped the small rental apartment, broken only by the creaking of the old wooden bed...

"Oh God... ahh... mmm..."

"Dominic... ah! Ah!"

Evelyn felt her soul being consumed, her body trembling uncontrollably as pleasure overwhelmed her...

When peace finally returned to the apartment and Dominic went to shower, Evelyn faintly heard her phone ringing.

She'd taken her pajamas to the small town, leaving none here.

If Dominic had his fill tonight, she planned to change the sheets and sleep naked.

Now alone, she removed her sweater before answering.

Wincing from sore muscles, she picked up the phone from the floor.

Olivia's name flashed on screen.

Nine missed calls.

This was the tenth.

"Hello?" Evelyn answered breathlessly.

"Where have you been? I was about to come looking for you! Ten calls!" Olivia sounded frantic.

"I... I was showering," Evelyn lied, still panting.

Olivia assumed she'd rushed to answer. "Your small town colleague said you returned today. Are you going back tomorrow? If so, come to the office first thing. They need an original certified document delivered urgently."

"I'll be there in the morning." Evelyn felt relieved she hadn't booked her train ticket yet.

Just then, the bathroom door opened.

Evelyn's face burned when Dominic entered, her breath hitching as the room's temperature seemed to rise with his approach...

"Shower now, or wait until we return to my place?" Dominic asked coolly, his impeccable appearance restored after washing.

Whether in a fitted shirt or tailored suit, his devastating handsomeness remained undeniable.
###Chapter 230

Evelyn had just hung up with Olivia. She curled into herself, tucking her knees beneath the oversized sweater.

She couldn't meet his gaze. Not when she felt this vulnerable.

But avoiding his eyes didn't make her any less affected.

Their bodies had memorized each other by now, yet Evelyn still couldn't look directly into those piercing eyes. Even fully clothed, Dominic's presence alone was enough to ignite sinful thoughts in her mind...

Just the sight of those long, powerful legs was dangerously intoxicating.

Dominic lowered his head, his gaze softening as he studied her silence. He stroked her hair. "Not ready to leave? I didn't bring pajamas. We could stay. I'm not done with you yet."

His lips brushed her hair, trailing down to her forehead.

Then his tongue traced the flushed heat of her cheek...

Evelyn couldn't deny the lingering tremors from earlier. When his mouth found hers again, the slick sound of their kiss made her shiver.

Their breathing grew ragged, syncopated.

Evelyn's senses slowly returned. Her face burned. Her throat felt parched...

She tried to pull away, but Dominic's eyes had darkened with hunger, his Adam's apple bobbing.

As he savored her taste, he captured her hands, guiding her slender fingers down his body. His voice was rough. "Too late. Neither of us is leaving."

I can't take much more of this, Evelyn thought.

This man might actually be the death of me...

Though he is older—maybe he'll go first...

His dominating aura left no room for escape.

"I have an early meeting tomorrow," she murmured, trapped beneath him. "Then the train. If we... do this again, I won't make it. Can we... not?"

"Take the day off." Dominic kissed her hair, his tone gentle but final.

Sensing her limits, he didn't push further. Instead of removing his coat, he unbuckled his belt.

"Ah!"

He lifted her effortlessly.

In one motion, he pinned her against the wall.

Her arms instinctively locked around his neck, legs wrapping his waist.

An embarrassing position.

Dominic gave her no time to recover. His mouth claimed hers, stealing her breath...

Midnight came before the house settled into quiet.

The shower in her rented apartment was cramped—barely enough for one.

Clearly not designed for shared use.

Evelyn barely registered how long he remained inside her after they finished.

Eventually, he carried her to bed.

His movements were careful, but she was too spent to care.

She curled under the blanket and slipped into unconsciousness.

In her dreams, Dominic was relentless—a demon who wouldn't stop.

For someone with her stamina, it was torture. She jolted awake, gasping.

Her vision cleared to find him standing over her. "What... are you doing?"

"Cleaning you up. You'll sleep better." He held a warm towel.

The water heater was ancient. He'd drained it, and it needed time to refill.

He'd boiled water in the kitchen, soaked a towel, waited for it to cool.

Dominic hadn't done menial tasks like this since childhood.

Not even his twins received this level of care from their father.

"I'll shower," Evelyn mumbled, trying to rise.

Dominic handed her the towel. "No hot water left."

What happened to it?

Then she remembered—his two showers had emptied the tank.

"I'll manage. You should go back." She stayed burrowed under the blanket.

Dominic didn't move. His stare was unyielding.

Evelyn pressed, "Alexander and Isabella will be upset if they wake up alone. Neither of us is there."

Earlier, while comforting Isabella, she'd learned their father rarely smiled at them. It angered her. She wanted to argue, but without the DNA results, she felt she had no right.

Dominic's patience frayed. "Then come back with me."

His voice hardened. "If you don't, I can't promise Isabella won't cry tomorrow."

The children were her weakness.

Dominic knew Evelyn carried guilt for missing five years of their lives.

Time was slipping away. If she didn't seize every chance to spoil them now, she might never get another.

From his threat, Evelyn saw how easily Dominic switched between cruelty and care. She dressed quickly before he reconsidered.

Dominic hadn't smoked all night. He stood outside, lit a cigarette, but couldn't enjoy it.

Inside, Evelyn examined the marks on her body.

Her face burned.

Faint red streaks marred her chest—the imprint of his hands.

How hard did he hold me...?

Will he break me one day?

After cleaning up, she returned to the penthouse with Dominic.

The children had become leverage.
###Chapter 231

The apartment was quiet when Evelyn and Dominic returned.
Evelyn tiptoed into the children's rooms to check on them.

Alexander and Isabella were fast asleep, though the boy had kicked off his blanket again.
She picked it up from the floor and gently tucked him back in.

The beds were too small for an adult.
With no other option, Evelyn had to share the master bedroom with Dominic.

She climbed into bed, exhaustion weighing her down.
Through the half-open door, she could see Dominic still working in the study.

Sebastian had warned her about Dominic's work habits.
When immersed in projects, he often forgot to eat or sleep.

The small town development project consumed him completely.
Stacks of documents and endless meetings filled his days.

Between work and...other activities, he was burning the candle at both ends.

Morning light filtered through the curtains.

Sophia's fever had finally broken.
"Are you ready yet, Mom?" Sophia stood by the door, tapping her foot impatiently.

"Almost! Just one more second!" Victoria fussed with her makeup in the hallway mirror.

As Victoria struggled with her heels, Sophia sighed.
"Maybe bringing you was a mistake."

Victoria's face fell. "What's that supposed to mean?"

Sophia gestured at her mother's garish makeup.
"If you don't know how to apply it properly, just go without. You're embarrassing."

Victoria touched her face self-consciously.
"I think it looks fine."

Sophia rolled her eyes and marched out.
Victoria hurried after her.

The hospital corridor was eerily quiet.
As they stepped off the elevator, both women froze.

Armed guards lined the hallway.
It looked more like a VIP protection detail than a hospital ward.

"State your business." A plainclothes security officer blocked their path.

Sophia stepped forward confidently.
"We're here to see Robert Sinclair. This is his wife."

The officer's eyes narrowed in suspicion.

Sophia continued smoothly, "Could you please inform Uncle Robert we're here? He'll want to see us."

Five guards watched them closely.
Dominic had ordered Sebastian to station them there.

It was a precaution against Beatrice's schemes.
Unable to target Dominic or Evelyn directly, she might go after Robert instead.

The head guard disappeared into the private room.
When he returned, he motioned them forward.

Robert looked worse than they remembered.
Chemotherapy had ravaged his body.

Victoria perched on the edge of the bed.
"I haven't visited because I've been working three jobs. You know how tight money is since the kids' tuition."

Robert's breathing grew labored.

Undeterred, Victoria pressed on.
"I'm your legal wife now. I've spent more years with you than Evelyn's mother ever did. You promised to treat Sophia like your own daughter..."

Sophia studied the dying man.
His skin had taken on a grayish hue.

A coughing fit seized Robert.
Victoria didn't reach to comfort him.

"Listen," she said urgently, "Evelyn landed herself a billionaire. I don't care if she's his mistress or wife - she's set for life. All I'm asking is you sign over the house to Sophia before..."

Robert's coughs turned violent.
His frail body convulsed against the pillows.

Sophia stepped closer.
"Uncle Robert, are you upset? Surely you agree it's a fair request?"

Victoria elbowed her daughter aside.
She knew Robert's weakness - persistence always wore him down.

Sophia shoved her mother away.
Her voice turned icy.

"Let's cut the act. Sign over the house today, or I'll expose all of Evelyn's dirty secrets. If you're too weak to discipline your daughter, I'll do it for you."

Robert's breathing became a death rattle.
His fingers clawed at the sheets.

Neither woman noticed.
They were too busy plotting how to spend the inheritance.
###Chapter 232

Robert Sinclair struggled to speak. His frail hand trembled as he pointed accusingly at Evelyn.

Victoria Montgomery turned sharply. Her daughter Sophia stood defiantly before Robert, her face twisted in contempt.

Robert gasped for air, his mouth hanging open. But a late-stage lung cancer patient in distress could never catch his breath...

"Enough, Sophia! Get out!" Victoria grabbed her daughter's shoulders, pushing her toward the door. As her back faced Robert, she flashed Sophia a meaningful look and hissed, "Let me handle this. You'll get what you want."

"You can't handle anything!" Sophia spat, shoving her mother away violently.

To Sophia, her mother was nothing but dead weight. She marched back to the hospital bed, looming over the pitiful figure beneath the sheets with a cruel smirk. "You've been rotting in this hospital too long, Uncle Robert. You don't know what's happening outside. You just swallow whatever lies Evelyn feeds you."

She pulled out her phone, displaying a screenshot of a news article. Robert strained to focus his fading vision on the screen.

"See this? Your precious daughter is already married." Sophia lied smoothly. "This man... treats her like a queen. You want Evelyn to be happy, don't you?"

Robert's face remained flushed from coughing, but his eyes locked onto the screen.

Sophia continued sweetly, "Her husband gives her everything - mansions, luxury cars. Tell me, Uncle Robert, why isn't life fair? Evelyn lives in paradise while I have to beg you for that tiny two-bedroom apartment!"

Her shrill voice echoed through the sterile room.

"You don't know what your daughter did five years ago, do you? Should I tell you everything?"

Meanwhile, at the penthouse...

Evelyn woke early to make breakfast, only to find little Isabella clinging to her leg.

"It's too early, sweetheart. Go back to sleep..." Evelyn scooped up the drowsy child. Isabella nuzzled against her neck. "I want to sleep with you..."

"You can, but promise me you'll go to school today." Evelyn worried Isabella's tantrums would provoke her temperamental father at breakfast, leaving the girl in tears.

As predicted, Isabella erupted at the mention of school. "No! No! No!" she screamed.

Evelyn carried the thrashing child back to bed, patiently reasoning with her.

By eight o'clock...

Isabella finally slept. Evelyn slipped out to prepare breakfast - warming milk in the microwave, simmering bone broth on the stove.

Dominic emerged from his study at three in the morning. As Alexander and Isabella's father, Evelyn prayed for his health. But a CEO's responsibilities never ended.

Working through the night was the price he paid for spending days caring for Evelyn and the twins.

That's why she prepared the nourishing broth.

When Dominic rose, the children were already awake. He marveled at how Evelyn had convinced Isabella - now dressed, washed, and packing her flowered backpack.

To Dominic, this was starting to feel like a real family.

In the bathroom...

Alexander hesitated before flushing. Dominic did it for him. "Stop dawdling. Wash your face properly."

Eight words!

Previously, Dominic would bark just three: "Wash your face!"

The boy scrambled to obey. His father handed him a fresh towel.

Though young, Alexander sensed something different about his father today.

"You're my son. Why wouldn't I treat you well?" Dominic said while brushing his teeth. They exited together.

At the breakfast table...

Isabella suddenly jumped up, insisting on helping "Miss Eve" serve. Evelyn wouldn't let her carry anything heavy - just a hard-boiled egg.

Finally, the family of four sat together.

Evelyn silently placed a steaming bowl before Dominic, then poured milk for the children.

Dominic's gaze lingered on Evelyn - tender, intense. She kept her head down, cheeks burning under his silent admiration.

The chattering children missed the adults' exchange.

Dominic drained his bowl quickly. "Another," he said, handing it to Evelyn.

She'd planned to refill it anyway - and pack extra for his office.

As she stood, her phone rang.

"Hello?" She lifted the pot lid.

Dominic lingered at the table, savoring this domestic bliss. Checking his watch, his own phone rang - Sebastian calling.

As he answered, something shattered in the kitchen.

"Mr. Blackwood, Evelyn's father's condition worsened. He's in emergency..."

Simultaneously, in the kitchen...

The hospital's call left Evelyn numb. The pot lid crashed to the floor.
###Chapter 233

The hospital corridors were eerily quiet.

Robert Sinclair was in emergency surgery. The red light above the operating theater remained glaringly bright.

Sebastian Whitmore had rushed to the apartment first, ensuring Alexander and Isabella were safely dropped off at school. Dominic Blackwood had canceled all his morning meetings without hesitation, accompanying Evelyn to the hospital without delay.

This wasn't just a minor illness.

It was lung cancer.

Families of cancer patients lived in constant dread—the fear that one day, without warning, their loved one might slip away.

Evelyn had experienced this exact agony five years ago.

She knew the suffocating weight of waiting outside an operating theater all too well.

But recently, she had allowed herself to hope. Between her demanding job and reconnecting with her children, she had almost convinced herself that her father was getting better.

Every check-up, the doctors reassured her.

"Mr. Sinclair’s condition is stable. It’s a positive sign. No need to worry."

She had believed them.

Just yesterday, the specialist had even said, "His organ functions are improving. He’s responding well."

For a fleeting moment, Evelyn had thought fate was finally being kind.

Then, without warning, the nightmare returned.

Time blurred.

She didn’t know how long she had been sitting there when the operating light finally flickered off.

Evelyn stood on numb legs, her heart pounding as she searched the doctor’s exhausted face for any sign of hope.

Dominic had ensured Robert received the best care—VIP wards, top specialists, everything money could buy. Without him, none of it would have been possible.

"I’m sorry. We did everything we could." The doctor removed his mask, his voice heavy with regret.

Dominic turned sharply, catching the exact moment Evelyn’s knees buckled.

Tears spilled down her cheeks. "No… that’s not possible. He was fine yesterday—"

Five years ago, he had survived.

Now, when she least expected it, he was gone.

The doctor offered a final apologetic nod before walking away, leaving the corridor in suffocating silence.

Dominic pulled Evelyn into his arms before she could collapse. She clung to his coat, her fingers twisting the fabric until her knuckles ached.

There was no stopping the flood of grief.

She had braced herself for this once before, only for her father to pull through.

This time, she hadn’t been prepared.

And now, he was gone.

Sebastian had arrived at the hospital after dropping off the children.

The guards stationed outside Robert’s ward were acting strangely—shifty-eyed, uneasy.

Something was wrong.

"You’re still here?" Sebastian kept his tone neutral, but the guard flinched as if struck.

"Can… can we leave now?" The man stammered, crushing his cigarette underfoot.

Sebastian had spent decades reading people.

This man was hiding something.

"Tell me what happened. Now."

The guard hesitated. "Nothing unusual. The medical team just rushed in suddenly—"

Sebastian cut him off. "If you lie now, by the time the truth comes out, it’ll be too late for me to help you."

The guard paled.

"Alright, alright! Two people came by earlier. One claimed to be the patient’s wife. We didn’t stop them—what if he wanted to see them? We’re just here to keep strangers out, but if we refused family and something happened…"

Sebastian’s jaw tightened.

They had let someone in, and now Robert was dead.

But if they had turned them away and Robert had been distressed…

Either way, they were screwed.

Sebastian headed upstairs.

The operating theater was empty, the light off.

He found two nurses cleaning Robert’s former room. "Where’s the patient?"

"Didn’t make it. They took him to the morgue."

Sebastian froze.

Dead. Just like that.

He finally located Dominic in another ward, watching over Evelyn as she lay unconscious, an IV drip attached to her arm.

"Is Ms. Sinclair alright?" Sebastian asked carefully.

Dominic didn’t look up. "Hypoglycemia. She passed out from the shock."

The air was thick with unspoken grief.

And the unsettling certainty that none of this had been an accident.
###Chapter 234

Passing out from extreme grief was medically expected for hypoglycemia patients.

From Dominic's understanding, hypoglycemia wasn't life-threatening anyway.

When Sebastian informed him about Evelyn's collapse, instead of stepping into the hallway, he chose to deliver his findings right there in the hospital room.

"Before Mr. Sinclair's condition deteriorated, his wife brought their daughter to visit him..."

Sebastian carefully watched his employer's reaction.

Dominic turned sharply. "His wife and daughter came?"

"Yes. His wife is Victoria Montgomery, and their daughter is Sophia Sinclair. They share the same surname, but Sophia isn't his biological child. Victoria was already pregnant by her ex when she married Mr. Sinclair," Sebastian explained.

Dominic's frown deepened. This couldn't be coincidence.

Sebastian continued, "Mrs. Montgomery told security they needed to discuss ownership of their old townhouse. She claimed she'd been working multiple jobs to support the family and Mr. Sinclair's treatments, only finding time to visit today. The guard considered it urgent and permitted entry after verifying with Mr. Sinclair."

Dominic's expression darkened with each word.

On the bed, Evelyn's eyelashes fluttered.

Meanwhile at Robert's apartment...

Victoria unlocked the door mechanically, dropped her purse, and changed into slippers. She paced the living room muttering, "What now? How could he die so suddenly? This must be a nightmare."

Sophia watched her mother's frantic pacing with growing dread. She sat stiffly on the couch, unable to calm her racing heart.

Robert had seemed fine when they left the hospital. He'd even promised to transfer the house deed within the week.

They'd celebrated with a cab ride admiring the autumn foliage, even stopping at the mall.

Then the hospital called as they were leaving.

Robert had listed them as emergency contacts.

Victoria froze when the nurse said "passed away." She held the phone numbly for a full minute before stammering, "C-could you repeat that? He's... gone?"

Now home, Victoria suddenly whirled on Sophia. "I told you not to provoke him! Didn't you see how violently he was coughing? You knew he was critically ill!"

Sophia hung her head, tears falling - not from grief, but fear of consequences.

"I didn't mean... who knew he'd die so fast..."

After thirty motionless minutes, Sophia abruptly stood.

While Victoria lay nursing a migraine, her daughter booted up her computer.

Sophia frantically searched whether verbal provocation constituted a crime.

The childhood rhyme "Sticks and stones..." echoed in her mind. But what if words actually killed?

A legal website provided answers in dense jargon she barely understood.

Finally, a chat window popped up. Sophia typed her situation hastily and hit send.

[Depends on location. Public insults causing death could mean manslaughter charges. Private conversations carry no liability.]

Sophia's hands shook.

'It was a closed hospital room with just us three. That's private, right?'

But the realization still chilled her: 'My words killed Dad.'

After convincing herself it was private, some tension eased - though fear still gripped her throat.

"Get up, Mom!" Sophia yanked Victoria upright. "We're returning to the hospital."

"Why?" Victoria's headache spiked at the word.

"You're Evelyn's stepmother. We must show remorse, even if faked. Otherwise..." Sophia's tear-filled eyes betrayed her panic.

Meanwhile, on the hospital rooftop...

Renowned lawyer Victor Langley arrived after Sebastian's call.

After briefing, he approached Dominic, who stood smoking with his back turned.

"How do you want this handled?" Victor asked.

Dominic turned, eyes blazing. "You know exactly how."

"I do. But are you certain you want to destroy them irreparably?" Victor studied his friend, marveling at love's transformative power.

This marked the second time the elite lawyer had been personally summoned for Dominic's woman.

Dominic's expression turned deadly. He pointed his cigarette at Victor. "They've earned this."
###Chapter 235

Dominic didn't bother trying to persuade his friend again. Walter was as stubborn as they came - once he made up his mind, nothing could change it.

Grabbing his briefcase, Dominic left the rooftop without another word.

Meanwhile, Sebastian was on the phone downstairs. He gave several curt nods, muttered affirmations, provided the hospital address, then ended the call.

As he pocketed his phone, he turned and nearly jumped at the sight of Evelyn's ghostly pale face. Steeling himself, he approached. "The DNA results are ready, Mr. Blackwood."

Dominic took one last drag of his cigarette before crushing it. "Hand them over."

With a nod, Sebastian headed downstairs to retrieve the official report from the lab technician.

He made no attempt to peek at the contents.

As Dominic's right-hand man, professionalism dictated he maintain appropriate boundaries. Some secrets weren't meant to be known.

Curiosity had killed many assistants before him. He intended to keep breathing.

The moment Dominic and Sebastian left her hospital room, Evelyn's eyes snapped open.

This marked the first time her hypoglycemia had ever caused complete unconsciousness.

As a teenager living with her grandfather, she'd experienced dizziness and tremors, but always recovered after resting briefly.

Back then, she'd hide in her room to cry anyway, so no one noticed her episodes - though her pallor often drew comments.

Whenever her father Robert remarked on her sickly appearance, Victoria would interject: "She's stuffing herself with junk food instead of proper meals! Just look at that pasty complexion!"

"I don't eat junk food." Young Evelyn had learned early to defend herself.

Not that it mattered. Victoria wouldn't have believed her anyway.

She'd directed those words toward her father.

Of the four people in that household, Evelyn had been closest to Robert.

Yet he always sided with Victoria. "How many times must I tell you? Junk food will ruin your health! Your grandfather clearly spoiled you rotten back home."

Her kind, frugal grandfather would be dragged into it too.

That's when Evelyn learned the futility of explaining herself to those determined not to understand.

Motherless since childhood, with an absent father, she'd never suffered hypoglycemia during her grandfather's care. Small-town life might have been simple, but she'd eaten fresh vegetables from their garden and meat from the local market.

At least she'd received proper nutrition then.

Even when bullied in middle school, she'd never lost consciousness.

After moving to the city, Victoria cooked lavish meals only for Sophia. Evelyn survived on leftovers - when there were any, which was rare.

Dry white bread became her staple. Eventually, she grew accustomed to the taste.

College brought financial struggles, leaving no money for nightclubs like Sophia frequented. A small mercy, sparing her from darker human experiences.

Remembering her past filled Evelyn with complicated emotions.

She'd ultimately surrendered to harsh reality, willingly selling her body when her father fell critically ill - though her reasons differed entirely from Sophia's.

Nothing proved more pitiful than someone who'd given up completely.

After contacting the broker and enduring pregnancy, childbirth, and countless sleepless nights for her mysterious benefactor...

Discovering Dominic Blackwood as that man brought some relief.

But what if her benefactor had been some vile, perverted old man instead?

Would she have found equal comfort then?

Those five years would have remained nightmares.

To bear Dominic Blackwood's children rather than some degenerate's...

Most women would consider themselves fortunate in her position.

Yet Evelyn couldn't forgive herself for that transaction.

No happy ending could erase that truth.

Lost in thought, she walked down the corridor to the doctor's office. A knock, then she entered.

Earlier, Sebastian hadn't realized Evelyn overheard his conversation with Dominic.

The doctor hesitated when Evelyn made her request.

Private hospitals prioritized patient service above all else.

"Robert Sinclair is my father, Doctor. Are you saying I have no right to know what happened to him?" Evelyn's voice wavered weakly.

The doctor reached for his phone, about to call someone.

Evelyn stopped him. "Please don't notify my friend. I fear he'll prevent me from seeing the security footage. Surely I have that right? I appreciate everything you've done for my father, which is why I'd rather avoid involving lawyers..."

Her implication was clear.

After brief consideration, the doctor nodded. Nothing illegal about granting her request.

Ten minutes later, Evelyn held a copy of the security footage - the original had gone to Mr. Blackwood.

She pressed play.

Her hands trembled before she'd watched halfway.

'Victoria and Sophia. How greedy can they get?'

'After everything the Sinclairs gave them all these years. Does that adulteress deserve more, after betraying her husband during his cancer battle?'

Sophia's venomous voice rang out: "Now that I mention it, Uncle Robert, you must remember."

Robert appeared significantly weaker than earlier in the footage. Where he'd been coughing and struggling before, now he lay gasping...

Sophia continued coldly, "Think carefully, Uncle Sinclair. Five years ago when you were hospitalized, didn't Evelyn disappear for weeks? She was servicing some old pervert. Got pregnant and hid it from you. That's why she barely visited - always wearing baggy clothes when she came. Never wondered about her strange behavior?"
###Chapter 236

"A charity foundation that offers free medical aid without conditions? That's just Evelyn's disgusting fabrication..."

Sophia let out a mocking laugh, shaking her head. "Did any foundation representative ever check on you during treatment? Monitor your recovery? These organizations have strict protocols. You received a liver transplant! They'd track your health until your dying breath!"

Her words carried cruel logic.

Five years ago, whenever Evelyn visited Robert in the hospital, she never stayed long - terrified her father might discover the truth.

She'd counted on his critical condition to mask her deception, spinning elaborate lies he'd swallowed whole.

Now with Sophia's revelations, Robert must have recalled those hospital visits. Had he paid closer attention, he'd have noticed Evelyn's evasiveness...

The frail man on the bed grew weaker. His wrinkled fingers twitched, unable to form fists before going slack...

Tears pooled in Robert's clouded eyes.

Evelyn couldn't fathom his emotions, but the video showed his dawning horror at his daughter's betrayal. Then came the crushing realization that Sophia spoke the truth...

"Forgive me, Dad..." She whispered to the recording.

Words she'd never get to say to his face.

Tears fell unchecked.

On screen, Sophia strutted like a preening peacock. "I've told you the truth, Uncle Robert. I didn't want to shatter your image of Evelyn, but these are facts. Don't blame the messenger."

The dying man closed his eyes - whether in shame or despair, no one would ever know.

Sophia leaned over the bed with a predatory smile. "Now that Evelyn's landed a billionaire, I'll admit she's skilled at seduction. The tabloids prove she's living lavishly. Search online - they can't erase everything. Hand over the house to Mother and me within the week, or I'll expose Evelyn's sordid past to her husband's family..."

Suddenly, commotion erupted outside the ward.

Evelyn thought she heard Victoria and Sophia's voices. Was it hatred-induced hallucination?

She set the tablet aside and stepped out.

In the corridor, security blocked Victoria and Sophia.

"I'm the widow! That girl inside may not be my biological daughter, but she's still my stepchild! Can't I visit?" Victoria feigned grief, shoving guards while accusing them of cruelty.

Their orders were clear - only Dominic and Sebastian had access.

"Final warning. Leave now." The guards began forcibly removing them, showing no mercy.

Evelyn emerged, her gaunt frame swimming in the blue-striped hospital gown.

Sophia spotted her first, jabbing Victoria's side.

Victoria turned, meeting Evelyn's withering glare. Her rehearsed tears evaporated instantly.

"Evelyn... are you... recovering?" She managed weakly.

Evelyn moved past the guards, her pallor ghostly.

"Aren't you afraid of divine retribution?"

Sophia shuddered. She saw her mother freeze.

They'd forgotten about hospital surveillance. Of course Evelyn had seen the footage.

And they'd never anticipated Robert dying so abruptly - without a death, Evelyn wouldn't have checked the recordings.

"What do you mean? We didn't kill Dad! We're devastated—"

Evelyn cut her off with a glare that could flay skin. "I've known you both since I was thirteen. From the moment I moved to the city, you made me loathe urban life and yearn for my grandfather's countryside..."

The guards exchanged uncertain glances.

"You conspired against me for years. And my father trusted your lies over his own daughter. He was too kind to you both."

Memories flashed behind Evelyn's eyes.

Tears threatened. Dad, are you watching from heaven?

His dying moments must have been filled with regret over sheltering these vipers.

Why else would he have retched blood and died without final words?

"Listen to me—" Victoria tried.

"No!" Evelyn's voice cracked with hysterical grief. "I want Dad to see your true natures from heaven! If justice exists, may you suffer a thousandfold what you inflicted on him!"

As tensions peaked, Dominic and Sebastian arrived simultaneously.

Sebastian's expression darkened. "Why are they still here? Escort these lunatics to the police station!" He barked at security.

The guards immediately seized Victoria and Sophia.

Dominic's gaze flicked to Evelyn's distraught form before landing on the intruders. Clutching a DNA report, he extinguished his cigarette on Sophia's cheek. "Gender means nothing when you've harmed Evelyn," he said icily.
###Chapter 237

Dominic pressed the burning cigarette onto Sophia's flawless cheek.

She gasped, hands flying to cover the searing pain. Her perfectly shaped brows furrowed in agony.

The towering figure before her seemed to materialize from the shadows. It took her dazed mind several seconds to process his words...

Is he defending Evelyn?

Does he think I'm someone else?

"You... you're insane!" Victoria shrieked. She didn't recognize Dominic, but his dangerous aura screamed trouble.

Even if he had a grudge, he shouldn't have targeted Sophia.

Even if he wanted to hurt Sophia, a slap would've sufficed. Not this. Not branding her like cattle.

Victoria had traded on her looks at Sophia's age. Now she depended on her daughter's beauty. If that face got ruined, their meal ticket vanished.

She thrashed against the security guards, desperate to inspect the damage. Useless.

"Stay down!"

A guard shoved Victoria into a chair. Her skull cracked against the wall.

"Oww! I think I have a concussion!" she wailed, rubbing her head. "Help! This brute is attacking a helpless woman!"

"Silence."

The guard gripped her jaw, reducing her protests to muffled whimpers.

Dominic had dealt with every variety of snake in the business world. But these two? They redefined despicable.

Sebastian and the team handled the corridor chaos. Dominic turned, shrugging off his coat to drape over Evelyn's shoulders. Let the onlookers stare.

Sophia still clutched her stinging cheek. Through tear-blurred vision, she watched the scene unfold.

Recognition dawned.

That commanding presence. That unshakable authority.

After frantic mental searching, the name surfaced: Dominic Blackwood.

The titles flooded back. Business prodigy. T Corporation's CEO. A City's wealthiest man. Youngest self-made billionaire.

Her mind reeled.

Evelyn knows HIM?

A hysterical laugh bubbled up. The contrast was absurd.

How could someone like Dominic Blackwood be connected to that pathetic, malnourished bookworm?

Evelyn had been the girl clutching stale bread while Sophia dined on Oreos in the cafeteria spotlight.

The police station was nearby. Officers arrived within minutes of the call.

Victoria faked illness. Standard criminal playbook. The cops weren't fooled.

Sophia ignored her mother's hissed instructions during the ride.

She'd dropped out young, targeting rich boys at clubs. Endured their humiliating dares. Drank until she vomited. Let them grope her in back rooms.

All for one goal: snag a wealthy boyfriend.

And now Evelyn—that scholarship charity case—was wrapped in Dominic Blackwood's coat?

Another broken laugh escaped.

At the hospital, Dominic clenched the DNA report. Not the right moment to show Evelyn.

What should've been joyous news came shadowed by her father's death.

The test confirmed it: Evelyn was Alexander and Isabella's mother. No doubt lingered in Dominic's heart.

Not now. Not five years ago. Not even back in their school days.

His life held regrets. Neglectful parents. Children born outside marriage. A motherless upbringing.

But one sacred space remained untouched in his soul—labeled in bold: First Love.

By that metric, he counted himself luckier than most men.

Evelyn had finally collapsed onto the hospital bed, following the doctor's orders.

She'd ripped out her IV earlier when demanding security footage. Now her hand swelled, forcing a new needle into the other arm.

Dominic gripped the footboard, watching silent tears trail down her closed eyelids.

Sebastian waited by the door. Dominic leaned close, whispering, "Rest. I'll handle everything."

He left with the DNA report still crumpled in his fist.

The morning's critical meeting had been postponed twice. Now Dominic sat in the Bentley's backseat as it pulled away.

"Don't take Alexander and Isabella home after school," he instructed. "Bring them to my office."

Sebastian nodded. "Understood."

Is he finally telling them about their mother?

The thought warmed him. Those kids calling him "Uncle Sebastian" would finally know the truth.

And he'd stake his life on one certainty: Evelyn Sinclair was that truth.
###Chapter 238

The sleek black Bentley pulled up in front of the corporate tower exactly forty minutes later.

Dominic Blackwood stepped out, his polished leather shoes clicking against the pavement. Clutched in his hand was the DNA test report.

No employee would dare block the CEO's path—except one.

Seraphina Prescott stood arguing with the receptionists in the lobby. "My friend isn't some criminal! What harm could we possibly do on the top floor? There are cameras everywhere. Can't we just look around for ten minutes?"

The receptionists exchanged glances. They'd dealt with enough social climbers to recognize one when they saw her.

Seraphina just wanted to flaunt her nonexistent privileges.

The top floor was Dominic's private domain. No one entered without explicit permission.

"Ms. Prescott, you're welcome to show your friend your own department or the common areas," one receptionist replied politely.

Seraphina's face flushed with anger. She slammed her palm on the marble counter. "Are you robots? Is that the only line you know? Use some common sense!"

The receptionists maintained their professional smiles, though their eyes betrayed their contempt.

Seraphina caught their disdain and sneered. "Just wait. I'll have Brother Dominic fire both of you tomorrow!"

There was only one Dominic in the company. She expected them to cower at the name.

They didn't.

Instead, their faces lit up as they bowed toward the entrance. "Good afternoon, Mr. Blackwood."

Seraphina whirled around. Dominic strode through the revolving doors, his presence commanding silence.

Ignoring his icy aura, she rushed toward him with a simper. "Brother Dominic, they—"

The receptionists paled.

Their senior had warned them about T Corporation's strict hierarchy. Under Dominic, rules applied to everyone—including himself.

If Seraphina truly had personal ties to the CEO...

Dominic didn't let her near. He blocked her with the DNA report and asked coolly, "Why is she still employed here?"

The question was directed at Sebastian Whitmore.

Though Dominic's tone was calm, Sebastian recognized the danger. He knew exactly how much his boss despised Seraphina—especially today, with Robert Sinclair's passing.

She was digging her own grave.

"I'll handle it immediately." Sebastian stepped forward, his expression stern as he motioned for Seraphina to follow.

Her complaints died in her throat.

The receptionists exhaled in relief.

Dominic's stormy expression signaled this wasn't the day to test his patience. Seraphina had chosen the worst possible moment.

"'Why is she still employed?' What does that mean?" she wondered frantically. "Where else would I be during work hours?"

Sebastian sighed. "Ms. Prescott, please gather your belongings."

Her face twisted. "You're firing me? On what grounds?"

He didn't bother responding.

Nearby employees entering the elevator exchanged glances. This girl never learns. First the expedition disaster, now this.

They'd all shuddered at Dominic's earlier severity.

Upstairs, the board meeting began.

Sebastian knew it would run late. Dominic would push through the agenda to focus on Robert's affairs.

Had Robert lived, he would've been Dominic's father-in-law.

Meanwhile, police arrived in the lobby to arrest Seraphina for conspiracy to kidnap a colleague's grandfather.

She sobbed denials, while her department head frantically called upstairs.

Sebastian ignored the calls.

This was her own doing. Had she not repeatedly crossed lines and provoked Dominic, she wouldn't face prison at nineteen.

Time crawled until 4:30 PM.

Sebastian checked his watch, then left to fetch Alexander and Isabella from school.

They arrived at the office by five.

The meeting doors didn't open until seven.

By then, both children were fast asleep.
###Chapter 239

The boardroom meeting had drained everyone's energy, except Dominic Blackwood. He moved through the corridors like a machine, his polished shoes clicking against the marble floors.

"Papa...mmm..."

Isabella stirred first at the sound of her father's footsteps. She rubbed her sleepy eyes with tiny fists.

Dominic attempted a smile at his daughter, though it came out more like a grimace. Fatherhood had always been a duty to him, not a joy.

This was the first genuine attempt at affection he'd ever shown them.

Isabella froze. His forced smile looked more terrifying than when he'd cried yesterday. She needed to tell Evelyn immediately - Papa was acting strange, like a wolf pretending to be a sheep before pouncing.

Whoosh! She ducked behind the sofa.

Maybe aliens had replaced her father.

Dominic remained oblivious to his daughter's thoughts. In his mind, that smile had been perfectly paternal.

Settling into his leather chair, he pondered how to connect with his children. His secretary entered silently, placing a steaming espresso on his desk before retreating.

Dominic sipped the bitter brew. His gaze shifted between the confused twins before he opened a drawer, retrieving three items.

Two colorful picture books. One kraft paper envelope tied with string.

Alexander and Isabella blinked in unison, exchanging puzzled glances.

Dominic wasn't accustomed to spoiling children. He tossed the books onto the mahogany desk. "Take one each."

"For us?" Alexander scrambled down first, his small hands barely reaching the desktop. Isabella followed, her eyes darting between the books.

The vibrant covers immediately captured their attention.

"Thanks, Papa!" Alexander ripped off the wrapping and dove into his book.

Isabella tore at hers more slowly, sneaking glances at her brother's pages as if his story might be better.

Dominic observed them quietly.

Who knew such simple gifts could bring such joy? They'd even forgotten their hunger.

Pleased with himself, he turned to the DNA report in the envelope. If he'd guessed right about the books, surely his planned speech would work too.

Meanwhile, Katherine Prescott arrived at the police station with her lawyer.

After endless formalities, they were finally led to Seraphina.

Seraphina thought she'd cried herself dry after countless panic attacks in the holding cell. But seeing her mother unleashed fresh tears. "Mama! You have to get me out of here!"

Katherine embraced her daughter. "Hush now. Mr. Langley is here to help."

Though not particularly intelligent, Katherine had mastered the art of seduction, which secured her current wealthy husband. Now obsessed with having a test-tube baby to cement her position, she'd neglected her daughter.

Victor Langley remained impassive. "Ms. Prescott, your mother briefed me. But I need the complete truth - I'm your only hope when this goes to trial."

Seraphina nodded frantically. "I'll tell you everything."

"Were you involved in kidnapping Evelyn Sinclair's grandfather?" Victor's pen hovered over his legal pad.

Seraphina's eyes darted to her mother.

Katherine, who couldn't decide between bridge games and her latest cosmetic procedures, only shrugged. "Just answer him."

Her current husband had refused to help - the forces behind Evelyn were too powerful, their identities shielded even from the police.

"I only suggested the idea!" Seraphina blurted. "Maxwell Lockwood arranged everything! I just wanted Evelyn to marry him!"

Victor scribbled notes. "Explain your relationship with Mr. Lockwood."

Seraphina hesitated before naming Dominic's cousin, shifting all blame onto him.

Victor recorded every detail.

Seraphina relaxed slightly - until remembering she'd spend another night in custody. For someone drowning in fear, each minute stretched into eternity.

Dawn broke early the next morning.

Evelyn awoke stiffly in her hospital bed before six. Every bone ached from staying still all night.

Her eyes flew open when she saw the twins standing by her bed, their faces glowing.

"You two..."

Before she could finish, Isabella threw herself forward, planting a wet kiss on Evelyn's cheek. "Love you, Mama..."

Evelyn froze.

Alexander remained calmer, offering a glass of warm milk. "Morning, Mama. First of many morning greetings."

Evelyn accepted the glass numbly, throat too tight to speak.

Alexander's cheeks pinked. "We saw the DNA test. Don't understand all the big words, but Papa says it proves we're family."
###Chapter 240

The DNA test results had completely slipped Evelyn's mind until Alexander brought it up.

His words confirmed what she'd suspected - she was indeed the biological mother of both children.

Before this, Evelyn had been about seventy percent certain. Now, she could finally breathe easy.

This confirmation should have been a moment of pure joy, but Evelyn found herself strangely subdued.

Her father's death overshadowed everything.

That painful reality haunted her, whether awake or asleep.

Every bit of good news seemed tainted by grief.

Alexander kicked off his tiny boots and scrambled onto the hospital bed. Finding insufficient space to sit cross-legged, he settled on his knees beside Evelyn.

Thankfully, the bed was spacious enough.

He took the steaming mug of milk from his mother's hands, noticing sediment at the bottom. Immediately, he grabbed a spoon to stir it.

"Eat your breakfast, Mommy," Alexander said as he mixed the white liquid. "There's protein powder in it. The doctor said you're too weak and need more nutrients."

Evelyn accepted the mug and sipped slowly.

The persistent boy kept offering more food even after she finished drinking.

Isabella handed her mother a napkin to wipe her mouth.

Though overwhelmed with grief and finding everything flavorless, Evelyn appreciated her children's loving gestures.

Their care warmed her broken heart.

She wondered what she'd done to deserve such wonderful children.

When school time arrived, Sebastian knocked and entered, leading the reluctant children away.

Dominic had been waiting outside the ward the entire time. He chose not to enter, instead entrusting the children with their mother's care.

Their presence always brightened Evelyn's day.

After twenty-four hours in police custody, Victoria and Sophia were released.

Standard procedure for their minor offense.

The mother-daughter duo's hospital disturbance only qualified as a misdemeanor.

Sophia turned on her phone outside the station, immediately bombarded with messages.

One stood out - from Lillian's assistant, Cassandra: [Where are you, Sophia? A burned finger doesn't warrant skipping work. It's not like your entire hand is broken.]

Sophia hadn't responded earlier because the police confiscated her phone.

Cassandra's follow-up message arrived an hour later: [Think you're untouchable? If you want to make it in this industry, show some professionalism. No notice, no reply - who do you think you are?]

"Bitch!" Sophia sneered. She barely respected Lillian, let alone her assistant.

'Who does Cassandra think she is? Just another celebrity lapdog. Does she think she's famous too?'

'And that face - uglier than sin itself.'

Taking a deep breath, Sophia replied: [Sorry, Cassandra. Spent the night in jail, just got out. Where's today's shoot? Send location - I'm coming now!]

She snapped a selfie outside the police station and sent it.

Cassandra responded quickly: [Jail? What happened? Sending location. Hurry up.] [Thanks. Will explain when I see you.]

Celebrity assistant work was dull. No tabloid gossip compared to the juicy stories circulating among film crews.

Cassandra lived for drama. A colleague jailed overnight? That was prime gossip material.

Sophia hailed a cab and shoved her mother inside. "Go home alone. I've got work."

Victoria stumbled but caught herself on the doorframe. "Be careful with that burn on your face. And call Evelyn - politely."

"Relax, I know what I'm doing." Sophia turned and walked away.

Little did she know, greater troubles awaited - troubles involving Victor Langley.

Instead, she foolishly thought, 'What can Evelyn possibly do? Sue me for hurting her dead dad's feelings with words?'

'He deserved to die anyway!'

'The Sinclairs are all cursed with short lives!'

Victoria frowned as she watched her daughter skip away, then settled into the cab.

One night in jail had taught her fear.

But backed into a corner, she wasn't ready to surrender yet...

In his final years, Robert had focused on his second wife. Evelyn never resented this - she understood prioritizing a spouse over a child from a previous marriage.

After all, Robert had spent his life savings - tens of thousands - on Evelyn's tuition.

Though it only covered half a year, she remained grateful.

His death devastated Evelyn. Victoria worried that grief might turn to vengeance.

At the film set...

Sophia arrived bearing roasted chestnuts as peace offerings. She apologized and made up with Lillian's assistants.

The appeased assistants meant an easy workday for Sophia.

Night fell when Lillian finished shooting. Exhausted, she noticed Sophia but only offered a cold stare before retreating to her trailer.

Inside, Lillian checked her messages.

One stood out - from Genevieve:

[Lillian, keep the 26th free. Have your agent clear your schedule. Your father has a meeting and dinner that night - Dominic Blackwood will attend. You want to meet him, right? Your father agreed to introduce you. Don't waste this chance.]

Lillian's cheeks flushed as she typed her reply: [Understood, Mother. Thank you, dearest!]
###Chapter 241

Lillian felt a weight lift off her shoulders after responding to her mother's text. She pushed open the trailer door and called out, "Sophia, come here for a moment."

Her tone carried the casual authority of someone summoning a subordinate.

Sophia forced a smile despite her irritation and hurried over. "What do you need?"

'Obviously I need something, you idiot,' Lillian thought, masking her disdain with a practiced smile. 'Can't my assistant show some initiative for once?'

"You never respond when I speak to you," Lillian said sweetly, her flawless features glowing under the dim lighting.

Crew members carrying equipment passed by, glancing at the scene.

"It's just... you're six years my senior," Sophia hesitated. "I wasn't sure how to address you properly."

"Ms. Prescott" felt too stiff.

But calling her simply "Lillian" seemed inappropriate for a lowly assistant. Sophia still remembered the humiliation when Lillian had crushed her fingers under her heel.

Lillian's smile widened. "Just call me Lillian."

Nearby crew members overheard and murmured praises.

"You're so down-to-earth, Lillian!"
"I should've become your assistant instead of studying cinematography!"

Lillian basked in their admiration before retreating into her trailer to change.

As Sophia prepared makeup remover, she thought, 'The senior crew call her Lillian because they're her equals. If I do the same, she'll probably hold it against me.'

She resolved to find a more powerful patron and escape Lillian's shadow.

She would climb higher than Lillian Prescott ever could!

Later, in the RV returning to the city...

Lillian ignored the bustling cityscape, focused instead on repeatedly calling Maxwell's number.

At seven o'clock, he finally answered.

Lillian straightened, brows furrowed. "Why didn't you pick up sooner?"

Maxwell had just reclaimed his phone after leaving the police station. "What do you want?"

"I need your advice - you're the only one I trust. Meet me if you're free."

Lighting a cigarette outside the station, Maxwell exhaled smoke. 'Fine, pick a place.'

Their discreet dinner plans were inevitably leaked to the press.

But that publicity had served Maxwell well - it proved his legal marriage to Evelyn Sinclair!

The thought made him smirk around his cigarette.

As Maxwell approached his car, Katherine Prescott suddenly blocked his path, lawyer in tow.

"You can't frame my daughter, Maxwell Lockwood!" Her voice was raw from shouting.

The middle-aged woman lunged at him, only to be shoved away violently.

"Have you lost your mind? Want to join your daughter in jail?" Maxwell's gaze turned predatory.

The lawyer helped Katherine up.

"You're despicable!" Katherine laughed bitterly. "You claim my daughter orchestrated that kidnapping alone? Don't lie - you masterminded it!"

Maxwell remained composed. "Mrs. Prescott, Yvette and I are friends, and you know my family. If I'd done wrong, I'd admit it rather than blame a nineteen-year-old. I had no involvement."

Katherine scoffed. "The truth will come out!"

Maxwell continued calmly, "Yvette knew I loved Evelyn and suggested kidnapping her grandfather to force marriage. But I warned her - coerced relationships never last. Why would I resort to that when I could win Evelyn's heart properly? Yvette ignored my advice."

The lawyer stayed silent as Katherine wavered.

Could her daughter really be that reckless? Yet Maxwell seemed so convincing...

"Let's go," the lawyer urged.

Katherine left in a daze, still uncertain.

Maxwell knew if Yvette had been arrested, someone powerful was pulling strings.

Fortunately, all evidence pointed to Yvette alone.

What infuriated him was Dominic helping Evelyn.

At the hospital, Dominic and the children prepared to take Evelyn home. Sebastian opened the car door.

Alexander and Isabella behaved impeccably.

"Careful, Isabella..." Alexander steadied his sister as she climbed in.

Dominic's expensive watch glinted as he guided Evelyn into the vehicle.

Sebastian closed the door behind them.

Despite Evelyn's complicated history with Dominic, Sebastian thought her fortunate to have such support in difficult times.
###Chapter 242

The sleek Bentley glided out of the hospital driveway.

Evelyn's heart swelled as she gazed at the adorable twins. Their presence instantly lifted her spirits.

Dominic wasn't watching the children. His intense gaze remained fixed on Evelyn's face.

She remained oblivious to his attention.

Both children clung to their mother, chattering excitedly.

Dominic's jaw tightened. "Am I invisible now?" he thought bitterly.

A pang of jealousy shot through him.

Isabella pouted dramatically. "When I was three, Great-Aunt Eleanor visited for Christmas with her granddaughters." She tugged at her hair. "They had beautiful braids their mommy made. I cried because I didn't have a mommy then."

Evelyn's heart ached. She pulled Isabella close, pressing a kiss to her forehead. "I'll braid your hair every morning now, sweetheart."

"Thank you, Mommy!" Isabella snuggled deeper into Evelyn's embrace.

Suddenly, the little girl shivered. An eerie sensation crept down her spine - like someone dangerous was watching her.

Alexander took his turn next. "When Great-Grandfather took me to the park, all the other boys had their mommies giving them water after playing." He wiped his forehead dramatically. "I had to use my sleeve. Then I got in trouble at home."

He'd almost said "Daddy scolded me," but Dominic's warning glare stopped him.

The unspoken accusation hung heavy in the air.

It couldn't have been their doting great-grandfather.

Certainly not the nannies, who knew better than to discipline the patriarch's favorites.

That left only Dominic - the father who'd failed them.

Evelyn didn't glare at Dominic, but her opinion of him dipped slightly.

The neglected father finally cleared his throat.

He fixed the twins with a dark look. "Don't you think you're talking too much?"

The children opened their mouths to apologize, but Evelyn cut in. "Must you always be so harsh with them?"

She'd wanted to say this for ages.

Dominic looked wounded, but remained silent.

The twins exchanged glances. In their household, Daddy ruled supreme.

Until now.

Meanwhile, Lillian met with Maxwell.

Sophia waited nervously in the RV. After last time, she kept her distance from Maxwell.

Lillian had brought only Sophia - a calculated move.

Sophia assumed this meant more torment awaited her.

At the restaurant, Maxwell sliced into his steak. "You're pursuing Dominic Blackwood? That's... unexpected."

High society's elite maintained proper facades, but private lives often differed. Casual encounters weren't uncommon.

If Lillian could land someone of Dominic's caliber, it would elevate her status tremendously.

Maxwell approved - but wondered what made Dominic so irresistible.

Few dared pursue Dominic seriously. First, because he followed no one's rules. Second, opportunities to approach him were rare.

Lillian possessed both beauty and connections. How many women could claim Jonathan Prescott as their father?

After a thoughtful pause, Lillian answered, "I can't explain his appeal. There's simply no one else like him."

Jealousy twisted Maxwell's gut. "He's clearly bewitched you. Succeed, or I'll never respect you again."

Lillian remained composed, but Maxwell recognized her scheming expression.

There was a reason the Prescotts had adopted her specifically. Her cunning nature.

Since joining the Prescott family, Lillian had climbed to stardom through sheer determination.

"I can't promise much help," Maxwell lied. "But as Dominic's childhood friend, I know his preferences."

He'd move heaven and earth to assist Lillian.

If she won Dominic's heart, Evelyn would be discarded.

Then Maxwell could reclaim Evelyn for himself.
###Chapter 243

Evelyn stirred her coffee absentmindedly with a silver spoon. She lifted her gaze cautiously. "Maxwell, what concerns me most are those two children. Where did they come from?"

Maxwell blinked in surprise.

Brother Maxwell?

That saccharine title caught him off guard.

The last time Lillian had called him that was when she first emerged from the orphanage into high society, bestowing everyone with familial titles like "Brother" or "Sister."

As her status rose, she'd stopped using such terms, considering herself Maxwell's equal.

Of course, she could claim equality - being Jonathan Prescott and Genevieve Prescott's adopted daughter gave her that privilege. In fact, as a Prescott, she technically outranked him.

Maxwell had never considered Lillian an ally in his attempts to separate Evelyn from Dominic. Yet something clicked in his mind. "Honestly, I don't know their origin story either, though it's occasionally discussed in family circles. My guess? Dominic isn't close with their mother."

Exactly what Lillian wanted to hear!

She prayed Dominic had zero connection with the children's mother! From what she knew, Dominic never allowed women near him.

If some woman had borne his children, it meant they'd shared a bed...

Lillian needed to identify her rival before making her move. Knowledge was power.

"Care to share how you reached that conclusion?" She pressed for concrete evidence to ease her mind.

Maxwell had no desire to see Lillian fail, so he didn't sugarcoat it. "Truthfully, no one knows what transpired between Dominic and the mother except Dominic himself."

Lillian nodded thoughtfully.

"You should understand - Reginald Blackwood desperately wants an heir. Even if Dominic has no interest in women, if someone was willing to bear the Blackwood heir, the family would accept them readily." Maxwell's words held truth.

He simply omitted that Evelyn was the mother.

Lillian's expression darkened. "I wonder how Dominic convinced their mother to abandon them."

"Money talks." Maxwell recognized her concern.

That much was true. Dominic and Evelyn's relationship had indeed been transactional initially.

A sly smile crept onto Lillian's lips.

From Maxwell's account, Dominic remained distant, aloof, emotionally detached. Business took precedence over relationships.

What a thrilling challenge!

She would conquer him!

She wanted to become the center of Dominic's universe!

Stealing a glance at Maxwell, Lillian recalled that small-town scene where Dominic shared drinks with Evelyn, Maxwell's wife...

Downtown traffic showed no signs of easing.

Sebastian navigated the luxury sedan smoothly through congested streets.

Thirty minutes later, Dominic's family arrived at their penthouse.

After dropping them at the lobby, Sebastian drove off.

Before entering the elevator, Dominic said, "I've handed the case to Victor. I know you reviewed the security footage before your father passed."

Evelyn startled before comprehending his meaning.

Hypoglycemia still fogged her mind.

"If they come looking, call me immediately." Dominic worried about disruptions to Evelyn's life.

Evelyn twisted her fingers, meeting his gaze softly. "Thank you."

Silence lingered until the elevator arrived. Dominic's arm encircled Evelyn's waist as they stepped in.

The ascent passed wordlessly.

At their door, Isabella suddenly turned. "Mommy, remember our unit number - 3369. Should I write it down for your purse? So you won't get lost again. Alexander and I worry."

Perhaps she'd seen videos where elderly people carried address tags.

Evelyn's nose tingled as Isabella spoke.

Again?

Since when had she gotten lost?

Alexander seemed to read her thoughts. Darting inside, he bypassed the shoe rack to retrieve Evelyn's slippers, placing them before her. "Daddy said you got lost, that's why you weren't with us."

Isabella nodded, clutching Evelyn's sweater hem.

Evelyn stood speechless.

Once inside, Evelyn cast a grateful look at Dominic crossing the living room.

She'd agonized over explaining her abandonment to the children.

To them, it was unforgivable.

No justification could change "Mommy left us."

Those crucial first five years - spent motherless.

Guilt and helplessness consumed her, yet Dominic had provided the perfect cover story...

When older, they'd understand.

"Thank you," Evelyn murmured as Dominic stopped before her.

"How exactly will you thank me?" His husky voice brimmed with desire.
###Chapter 244

Evelyn raised her gaze to meet Dominic's piercing eyes.

She was instantly transported back to their passionate encounters five years ago, then to their recent rekindled intimacy. A profound sense of belonging washed over Evelyn.

It felt as though her emotions had been imprisoned for half a decade, suddenly set free.

Like finally finding shelter after wandering endlessly through a tempest.

"Your eyes are red. What's troubling you?" Dominic's voice softened at Evelyn's vulnerable expression.

He couldn't deny the primal urges surging through him whenever he looked at her. His pulse quickened just from her proximity.

'Have I developed an addiction to her?'

'Perhaps I have.'

As a man who'd experienced carnal pleasures, he craved the sensations only her body could provide.

More than that, he wanted to possess every part of her.

Anything less left him unsettled.

Evelyn couldn't withstand the heat in his gaze. When Dominic's fingers brushed her eyelids, she forced herself to focus on the present, pushing away painful memories.

A sudden crash from the bathroom interrupted them, followed by Isabella's murmuring...

Evelyn pushed Dominic away and rushed toward the sound.

Once again, their children had interrupted an intimate moment.

In the bathroom.

Isabella stood on tiptoes atop a stool, stretching for a small box on the shelf. Her fingers missed, sending toiletries tumbling to the floor.

She climbed down carefully, retrieving a tube of toothpaste.

"Are you hurt?" Evelyn crouched to examine her daughter.

"I'm fine." Isabella proudly presented a new strawberry-flavored toothpaste and matching toothbrush. "I picked this for you, Mommy."

Evelyn accepted the cheerful tube, noticing the child-friendly design and sweet scent.

Isabella then produced an entire collection of strawberry-scented toiletries - shower gel, shampoo, even slippers embroidered with strawberries.

"Who took you shopping for all this?" Evelyn asked gently.

"Daddy did," came the honest reply.

By nine o'clock, Evelyn found herself being pampered not just by Dominic, but by both children.

After their shared bath - where Isabella insisted on helping despite being perfectly capable herself - Evelyn emerged to find Alexander waiting with slippers and peeled fruits.

The boy had delivered more fruits to Dominic in the kitchen.

Dominic, clearly inexperienced with domestic tasks, followed Alexander's precise instructions about washing and wrapping the fruit in cling film.

"Granny Lockwood always did it this way," Alexander explained seriously.

Though unaccustomed to being served, Evelyn appreciated their efforts.

Later, propped against the headboard in a pink nightgown, Evelyn listened as Isabella read from a picture book.

"Don't sleep with wet hair, Mommy," the girl cautioned between stories, repeating wisdom from Granny Lockwood.

These moments filled Evelyn with bittersweet emotions.

She rejoiced in her children's independence yet ached that these life lessons came from a housekeeper rather than herself.

Dominic, passing the bedroom repeatedly, cast impatient glances not at Evelyn, but at Isabella who stubbornly remained by her mother's side.

An hour later, when he found Isabella finally asleep - mouth slightly open, blowing tiny bubbles - Dominic moved silently to carry her away.

"Be careful," Evelyn whispered.

Their eyes locked as Dominic loomed over the bed, his expression unreadable.

Carrying Isabella to her room, Dominic realized this might be the first time in five years he'd truly acted as a father.

'Women are naturally more nurturing,' he mused, remembering Evelyn's gentle warning.

Back in their bedroom, the sound of running water signaled Dominic's shower.

He returned wearing only a towel, plucking the childish picture book from Evelyn's hands.

"What's so fascinating about this?" he muttered, tossing it aside and switching off the lights.

In the darkness, Evelyn lay awake. Now officially Alexander and Isabella's mother, she had no excuse to refuse sharing Dominic's bed.

The arrangement left her unsettled, but she'd have to endure it.
###Chapter 245

Evelyn shut her eyes tight and began counting backwards from one hundred.

Ninety-nine, ninety-eight... at seventy-six, she sensed Dominic's body pressing closer against her back.

His calloused palms slid beneath her silk nightgown, fingers tracing the delicate curve of her waist before dipping below the elastic band of his sleep pants.

Curled on her side, Evelyn felt his warm hands kneading slow circles across her abdomen. Her knees instinctively drew upward...

The movement arched her hips backward until they met the hard ridge of his arousal pressing insistently through thin fabric.

"What are you doing?" Evelyn's brow furrowed. She wasn't in the right headspace tonight.

Moonlight filtered through the curtains, gradually revealing Dominic propped on one elbow studying her. He leaned in, brushing his lips against her flushed cheek.

"Doctor's orders," he murmured against her skin. "Regular physical activity helps manage hypoglycemia."

"Exercise..." Evelyn's thoughts stuttered.

Surely the physician meant brisk walks or pilates, not Dominic's interpretation of therapeutic movement between sheets.

Though reserved in intimate matters, Dominic approached them with single-minded determination, like a man possessed.

No amount of protest could deter him once his mind was set...

"Exhaustion leads to better sleep," he reasoned while already pushing her nightgown upward. "Otherwise you'll stay up overthinking again."

Silver moonlight painted Evelyn's bare skin as it was revealed inch by inch...

Tonight taught Evelyn how inventive men became when justifying their desires.

Every "for your health" masked selfish craving.

Dominic's kisses came slow and deep throughout the long night, each one stealing her breath until dizziness threatened.

She barely registered when he finally stilled, only pushing weakly at his shoulders moments later. "Get off me..."

Dominic chuckled as she buried her face in pillows. "Still blushing like a schoolgirl after all this time?"

"About what?" Evelyn feigned ignorance, though heat flooded her cheeks.

His thumb traced her hipbone. "Everything. After two children together, what's left to be shy about?"

Evelyn considered this as Dominic continued, "Not that I mind. Your embarrassment is... charming."

The comment only deepened her flush.

"Sometimes this still feels unreal..."

Dominic's questioning hum prompted her to continue.

"Coming from nothing to this... your world operates by different rules. Even when I understand them, I don't know how to move through them." She shook her head. "I can't explain it properly."

Dominic pondered her lingering uncertainty. Perhaps he hadn't done enough to make her feel secure.

Yet he understood her disorientation.

Since returning to Blackwood Estate, he'd watched countless outsiders lose themselves navigating elite society's labyrinthine expectations.

Always because of men like him.

As Dominic searched for reassurance, his body moved instinctively, sheathing inside her. "Real enough now?"

Evelyn experienced his "reality" until exhaustion claimed her...

Morning found Evelyn waking to two neatly dressed children presenting her with a toothpaste-laden brush.

Isabella beamed while Alexander adjusted his backpack straps. Their morning routine soothed the grief still lingering from her father's passing.

By 8:30, after breakfast preparations and shoe-tying assistance, Evelyn finally had a moment to herself.

Dominic leaned against the kitchen doorway. "Leave the dishes."

"I'm not made of glass," Evelyn insisted, scrubbing a plate. "You all don't need to treat me like an invalid just because—"

Dominic's sudden presence behind her cut off the protest. His breath warmed her ear. "Not fragile? You were begging me to stop last night..."

The plate slipped from Evelyn's fingers with a clatter.

Dominic spun her around, capturing her mouth in a searing kiss. "Stop distracting me and go to work," she gasped when they parted.

Across town, on a bustling film set...

Sophia froze when police officers approached.

That witch Evelyn actually pressed charges!

An hour earlier, Linda had taken the police call but informed Lillian instead during a shooting break.

Thus Lillian learned of Sophia's legal troubles.

Evelyn's father's death came as a surprise.

Yet Maxwell showed no signs of mourning a father-in-law's passing.

Lillian resolved to check on Evelyn after filming. Someone needed to handle arrangements since Maxwell clearly wouldn't.

Was Evelyn managing everything alone?

Preoccupied with these thoughts, Lillian barely registered Sophia's arrest.

"Rot in hell, Evelyn!" Sophia shrieked as officers led her away. "Just like your pathetic father! Think you can steal everything?"

"Enough!" An officer shoved her into the squad car.
###Chapter 246

After Sophia was taken away by the police, Lillian barely managed to finish her remaining scenes with half-hearted effort.

The emotional breakdown scene required reshoots from dawn till dusk, yet the director remained unsatisfied.

"Let's call it a day. Go home, rest, and reflect on the scene. We'll try again tomorrow," the director told the leads with visible disappointment.

Lillian had no intention of analyzing her performance. She wanted nothing more than to escape the set immediately.

While her acting career mattered, securing a meeting with Dominic to finalize their marriage plans took precedence.

As her trailer prepared to depart, Lillian dialed Maxwell's number.

Maxwell was engaged in a chess match with his father at home.

Lorraine smiled contentedly watching father and son bond over the game, serving them refreshments between moves.

When Maxwell's phone rang, he answered without looking away from the chessboard. "Yes?"

"Where are you? Can we meet?" Lillian's voice came through.

"Not tonight. Tomorrow perhaps. I'm in the middle of a close game with Father."

After speaking, Maxwell made his decisive move.

Frederick chuckled, lifting a piece but hesitating. Though puzzled by his son's sudden visit, he welcomed the quality time.

"Fine, we'll talk now. Did you know... Robert Sinclair passed away?"

Maxwell straightened abruptly. "What? Evelyn's father is dead? Where did you hear this?"

"So you weren't informed. I investigated after the police took Sophia away. They said she's responsible for his death. Two days ago—"

Maxwell ended the call before she could finish.

Both Frederick, still holding his chess piece, and Lorraine, midway through peeling an apple, overheard the shocking news.

"How did Robert die?" Lorraine gasped, accidentally nicking her finger with the knife.

"Careful now," Frederick said, rising from his seat.

Their housekeeper rushed over with the first aid kit to bandage the minor cut.

Maxwell grabbed his jacket, face dark. "Details are unclear. I'll get them from Evelyn."

He knew she wouldn't answer his calls.

But that wouldn't stop him from trying.

As he reached his car, Lorraine hurried out with her coat. "I'm coming with you."

Maxwell stopped her. "No. I'll update you when I learn more." He couldn't bear Evelyn's coldness toward his mother.

No parent should witness their child being rejected by their spouse.

It would only worsen their already strained relationship.

All night, Maxwell's calls went unanswered until his phone died.

He'd located the hospital where Robert had been admitted. Upon arrival, staff informed him Evelyn had left.

Presenting their marriage certificate, Maxwell identified himself as the deceased's son-in-law, demanding details about the death.

A nurse who followed celebrity gossip recognized him as Evelyn's husband.

She disclosed everything she knew.

Maxwell's expression turned icy. He'd known Sophia was vile, but this exceeded his worst expectations.

The incident in Robert Sinclair's ward had become hospital gossip, known by all staff.

Armed with the facts, Maxwell left the hospital.

He didn't return home or seek solace in a bar. Instead, he parked near the hospital entrance.

A Volkswagen Golf had just occupied the spot.

Maxwell approached the driver, offering a thick stack of bills. "Mind parking elsewhere? I need this spot."

The driver gaped at the money and the intense man before him.

'Is this for real?'
'It's just a regular parking space!'

Taking the cash, he drove off without protest.

Maxwell sat in his idling car, heater running, cigarette lit, staring at the hospital entrance.

He could've gone home and returned at dawn.

But his turbulent thoughts demanded he secure the perfect vantage point to intercept Evelyn first thing.

The nurse mentioned Robert's cremation was scheduled for tomorrow.

For Maxwell, the night dragged unbearably. For Evelyn, it passed too quickly.

A nightmare startled Evelyn awake.

She'd dreamed of her school days, with Victoria and Sophia bullying her mercilessly.

The lunch money hidden in her backpack—stolen by Sophia!

The emergency cash sewn into her uniform—snatched by Victoria!

The dream shifted abruptly.

They stood in a courtroom. Victoria and Sophia begged her to drop the lawsuit, and in a moment of weakness, she agreed.

But reality differed. After hearing Victor's legal counsel, Evelyn vowed never to forgive them!

Rising, she prepared breakfast while muttering, "Never mind... Dreams show the opposite..."

Isabella, rubbing sleep from her eyes, asked, "What's the opposite, Mommy?"

Evelyn turned to answer when she noticed the man in the doorway.

Dominic stood there, freshly shaven and impeccably dressed in a tailored suit.

He placed a distinctive black card with a gold stripe on the counter. "Keep this safe. It's my supplementary card."

Evelyn stared at the luxurious card, speechless.

Could dreams truly reveal opposites?

She'd dreamed of losing all her money, yet here she was being handed unlimited funds.

Evelyn knew she'd never max out this card's limit...

"If you have time, take the children winter clothes shopping. My schedule's packed." Dominic anticipated her refusal, using the children as justification.

As expected, Evelyn couldn't refuse when the children's needs were cited. She couldn't afford their winter wardrobe alone...
###Chapter 247

Evelyn felt an unexpected tightness in her chest and a strange prickling in her nose. No one had ever shown her such unconditional kindness like Dominic did.

Her long lashes fluttered as she blinked away the moisture gathering in her eyes.

The limited edition black credit card gleamed in her palm. She recognized it instantly from the financial magazines she'd read.

Morning light streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, illuminating Dominic's chiseled profile as he stood in the kitchen. The man was perfection incarnate.

She was just an ordinary woman, yet somehow she'd been blessed with his love and devotion.

"Thank you..." Evelyn's voice cracked with emotion.

He'd been her rock during the darkest period of her life.

Losing her father had left her shattered and adrift.

The pain had been unbearable. But Dominic had stayed by her side.

And their children - Alexander and Isabella - were like little miracles. Living proof of their love.

Perhaps fate had been cruel at first, but now she knew she was the luckiest woman alive.

Dominic gently kissed the tears from Evelyn's cheeks, his thumb brushing the bridge of her nose. "No thanks needed, darling. Finding you was the best thing that ever happened to me. You may have lost your father, but you'll always have me and our children."

His deep voice soothed her racing heart instantly.

"Big brother and I will never leave you, Mommy! We'll be together forever!" The little girl in princess pajamas hugged Evelyn's leg, her curly hair tickling Evelyn's skin.

Evelyn scooped up her daughter, kissing the giggling child's rosy cheeks. The sound drew Alexander's attention from the bathroom doorway where he stood, freshly brushed teeth gleaming.

The boy watched the scene with poorly concealed jealousy. He longed to be held too, but Daddy said big boys shouldn't act like babies.

Dominic noticed his son's expression immediately.

"Alexander..." He strode over and lifted the surprised boy into his arms.

Alexander's eyes widened comically, his mouth forming a perfect 'O'.

'Daddy's holding me!'

Fireworks exploded in his chest.

'Not just holding me - hugging me properly!'

Dominic inhaled the sweet, milky scent of his son. He'd always believed girls needed coddling while boys required discipline. Isabella received countless hugs, but serious little Alexander rarely got such displays of affection.

Though his face remained impassive, warmth shimmered in Dominic's eyes as he held his son. His voice, however, stayed firm. "You're a Blackwood. You must learn composure, not overreact to small things. Your earlier display was unacceptable. Remember - no second chances."

Alexander curled contentedly against his father's chest, beaming despite the lecture.

Evelyn shot Dominic a disapproving look. "He's just a child. Must you be so harsh?"

Her voice triggered memories of last night - Evelyn writhing beneath him like some woodland nymph, her body arching in pleasure...

Heat flooded Dominic's veins.

An unmistakable bulge formed in his trousers.

"Ouch! Daddy, what's that?" Alexander wriggled as his bare foot brushed against the hardness. "Are you hiding something in your pants?"

Isabella gasped. "Mommy! Does Daddy have a tumor like Granny Florence? We need to take him to the hospital!"

Granny Florence, their beloved nanny, had recently undergone surgery to remove a neck tumor.

Dominic and Evelyn exchanged mortified glances.

'You want me to remove the very thing that brings your mother joy?' Dominic thought wryly.

Evelyn's cheeks burned as she averted her eyes from Dominic's obvious arousal. After last night's activities, she hadn't expected him to be ready again so soon...

Dominic shrugged helplessly. His traitorous body betrayed him whenever Evelyn was near.

Clearing his throat, he set Alexander down. "Daddy's fine. Just needs a cold shower. Be good for your mother."

He strode toward the bathroom, leaving two confused children and a flustered Evelyn behind.

"Mommy, can cold showers cure tumors?" Isabella persisted.

"Well... Daddy ate something too spicy last night. The shower will help. Remember, no spicy food when you're older." Evelyn maintained a straight face despite her flaming cheeks.

"We promise, Mommy!" The children chorused.

Guilt pricked Evelyn for the white lie. She settled the children with picture books before returning to breakfast preparations.

But thoughts of her father's death and Victoria and Sophia's smug faces soured her mood.

This time, she wouldn't forgive those vile women. No matter what.
###Chapter 248

Evelyn wasn't used to cooking for a family yet.

She wanted to make sure Alexander and Isabella had plenty of options, so she prepared an elaborate spread.

The dining table was laden with ham sandwiches, fluffy scrambled eggs, and golden French toast.

Fresh milk steamed in porcelain cups beside bowls of cinnamon-vanilla oatmeal.

At the center sat a perfectly grilled salmon steak, its aroma filling the air.

Dominic sat impeccably dressed in his tailored suit, his aristocratic bearing evident even in his relaxed posture.

His chiseled features remained impassive as he ate with refined elegance.

The twins sat quietly beside Evelyn, struggling with their utensils.

Seeing their clumsy attempts, Evelyn's maternal instincts kicked in.

She speared a slice of ham and brought it to Isabella's lips. "Open wide, sweetheart," she cooed.

Isabella's eyes sparkled as she accepted the bite. Though she'd eaten ham before, this tasted infinitely better.

She flashed a triumphant look at her brother, silently boasting about their mother's attention.

Alexander watched with wide eyes, shoveling oatmeal into his mouth.

After swallowing, he gazed hopefully at Evelyn.

"Feed yourself," Dominic interjected sharply, anticipating his son's request.

Even he hadn't been fed by Evelyn - he wouldn't tolerate such indulgence in his children.

Alexander reluctantly picked up his spoon.

Isabella, sensing the reprimand applied to her too, pushed away Evelyn's helping hand.

Evelyn frowned at Dominic's harshness.

Suddenly, a forkful of salmon appeared before her lips.

The twins gasped. Daddy was feeding Mommy!

Blushing, Evelyn accepted the bite, searching Dominic's enigmatic expression.

Their children stared with hopeful eyes.

Under their expectant gazes, Dominic's stern facade cracked slightly.

He portioned the salmon between their plates.

"But Daddy," Alexander protested, "we don't like fish!"

Isabella nodded vigorously. "Daddy's being mean on purpose!"

She turned to Evelyn for support.

"You don't have to eat it, darlings," Evelyn soothed.

Dominic's voice cut through like steel. "Children shouldn't be picky. You'll finish every bite."

He knew their preferences, but refused to enable bad habits.

"Mean Daddy! I hate you!" Isabella shouted, emboldened by Evelyn's presence.

She shoved her plate away dramatically.

Dominic's fist slammed the table, making the dishes rattle.

Alexander recoiled. Daddy's temper was legendary.

"See, Mommy? Daddy's bullying us!" Isabella wailed, sliding off her chair.

Dominic's icy command froze her mid-escape. "Leave now, and don't come back."

The ultimatum worked instantly.

Tearfully, Isabella returned to her seat and picked at the fish.

Evelyn was appalled. "They're only five, Dominic! This is too harsh!"

"Not a single scrap remains," he ignored her, watching the children.

Isabella viciously mashed her fish in rebellion.

"Please Daddy, I'm full," Alexander tried negotiating.

Dominic's glare silenced further protests.

The twins ate their portions with miserable resignation.

Evelyn stared in shock. She'd seen Dominic's gentle side - this authoritarian behavior was new.

Now she understood why the children feared him.

There were better ways to handle this!

Evelyn's fork clattered loudly. "Is this how you always treat them?" she demanded.

Dominic finally noticed Evelyn's disapproval.

In his household, mealtime discipline was routine.

He'd forgotten Evelyn's presence complicated matters.

How would he smooth this over?
###Chapter 249

Dominic exhaled softly. Having successfully disciplined the twins, he now faced his greatest challenge - comforting Evelyn. He felt like a failure as a father.

Rising from his seat, he approached Evelyn and enveloped her delicate frame in his powerful embrace. His fingers traced soothing circles on her back. "This is entirely my fault," he murmured. "Please don't be angry. I only worry about their eating habits affecting their health. I'll be more lenient next time."

Seeing his genuine remorse, Evelyn relented. "Promise me you won't repeat today's behavior. They're just children."

Dominic's tension eased as Evelyn's anger subsided. Her happiness meant everything to him.

Alexander and Isabella rested their chins on their hands, wide-eyed. Daddy had transformed completely since Mommy's return. They marveled at how she tamed their usually strict father.

The breakfast drama concluded peacefully.

Later that morning, Dominic escorted Evelyn and the twins to the hospital for her father Robert's funeral. This would be the children's first - and last - meeting with their grandfather.

At the hospital parking lot...

Maxwell sat in his smoke-filled car, chain-smoking through the night. The burning cigarette between his fingers mirrored the fire in his chest.

He knew exactly who stood by Evelyn's side now. Knew how she despised him. Yet his feelings remained unchanged.

Her coldness cut deeper than any blade.

The irony wasn't lost on him - a husband forced to stake out a hospital to see his own wife. Especially when he'd secured their marriage through deception.

The sight of the perfect family unit at the hospital entrance made his vision blur with rage.

Dominic, tall and imposing, shielded Evelyn like a fortress. Between them, the angelic twins completed the picture of domestic bliss.

Maxwell crushed his cigarette and stormed from the vehicle.

He'd known Evelyn first. Back when she was young and innocent, like unripe fruit he'd planned to let mature. His patience had been rewarded with theft - Dominic Blackwood stealing what rightfully belonged to him.

"Evelyn!" Maxwell seized her wrist, bloodshot eyes blazing. "I'm your husband! Yet I had to learn about my father-in-law's death through gossip? Were you planning to hide this from me completely?"

"Release me, Maxwell!" Evelyn struggled against his iron grip. "Husband? You know exactly how that farce of a marriage came to be. To me, you're less than a stranger - you're a scheming villain!"

Her words pierced like daggers.

Maxwell forced a laugh, masking his pain. "Doesn't matter. That marriage certificate binds you to me. While I live, you remain my lawful wife. Whatever you have with Dominic Blackwood means nothing!"

A sudden, excruciating pain forced Maxwell to release Evelyn. He turned to find Dominic crushing his wrist with bone-breaking force.

Dressed in his signature black bespoke suit, Dominic radiated aristocratic menace. The air around him turned glacial. "Today is for mourning, Maxwell. Pay your respects or leave. Cause trouble, and our acquaintance ends here."

The twins, sensing the tension, hid behind Evelyn, watching the confrontation with wide eyes.

Dominic released Maxwell's wrist and guided his family inside. Maxwell rubbed his bruised flesh, vowing retribution. But first, he had a funeral to attend.

In the morgue...

Robert lay in his casket, pale as marble. Only his stillness betrayed the truth.

"Come meet your grandfather," Evelyn said, fighting tears. She led the children to the casket. "This is your first and last chance to see him."

Seeing their mother's grief, the twins bowed solemnly.

"Grandpa Robert," Alexander began, voice trembling with unexpected maturity, "Mommy says you're in heaven now. I'll take good care of her for you. I promise."

Isabella added softly, "I'm Isabella. I know my ABCs and love drawing stories. I'll help Big Brother watch over Mommy too."

Evelyn covered her mouth as tears overflowed. Dominic enveloped her from behind, wiping her cheeks. "Rest easy," he told Robert. "I'll protect her with my life."

From the shadows, Maxwell watched the scene unfold, his lips twisting into a bitter sneer at the picture-perfect family farewell...
###Chapter 250

Maxwell was Evelyn's legal husband. He should have been in Dominic's position, doing what Dominic was doing.

What a cruel joke fate had played on him.

Maxwell approached Robert's casket, his chest burning with injustice. "I'm sorry we never met while you were alive. I'm Maxwell, your son-in-law. It's unfortunate Evelyn and I couldn't have our wedding before your passing. But I promise you this—I'll give her the grandest ceremony the world has ever seen. She will be my wife, and mine alone. Your grandchildren will want for nothing under my care."

He turned to glare at Dominic, whose eyes flashed with barely contained fury.

'Let him have this moment.'

Maxwell took petty satisfaction in seeing Dominic seethe silently.

But the sight of Evelyn collapsing into Dominic's arms reignited the fire in his veins.

'Control yourself.'

He massaged his temples, forcing calm into his voice.

Now wasn't the time for outbursts. Not when Evelyn's grief made her brittle as glass. One wrong move and she'd shatter—and blame him for it.

Evelyn's whisper cut through the funeral parlor. "You suffered so much, Father. Victoria and Sophia treated you like their personal ATM... I'll never forgive them for manipulating you. But I swear on your memory—they'll pay for what they did."

The security footage played in her mind—those venomous women provoking her dying father, hungry for their inheritance.

She'd watched helplessly as the light left his eyes.

Now she'd make sure Victoria and Sophia regretted ever crossing her.

Dominic had arranged everything—the funeral would be held at the Sinclair estate.

Maxwell had wanted the Tanner mansion, but Evelyn's icy words stopped him cold.

"Buy an urn if you want to host a funeral," she'd said. "You'll never lay a finger on my father's ashes."

Her fragility was a facade. Beneath it lay a spine of steel.

He'd surrendered—for now.

'Let her grieve. Our reckoning will come later.'

Black wreaths draped the Sinclair home. The air hung thick with sorrow.

Robert's portrait watched over the mourners, his gentle smile forever frozen in time.

Evelyn knelt before it, veiled in black. Only the tremble of her shoulders betrayed her silent weeping.

The twins stood vigil beside her, small hands clutching her sleeves.

Gwendolyn Sinclair dabbed her eyes. She'd never gotten to reconcile with her brother.

Dominic moved through the crowd with effortless authority, his black armband gleaming. Guests whispered behind their hands—why was the Blackwood heir playing host for an employee's funeral? And why were his children clinging to the grieving woman?

Businessmen seized the chance to curry favor, their condolences laced with calculation.

Across the room, Maxwell worked the crowd as the bereaved son-in-law.

Two rivals guarding one widow—the tension between them crackled like live wires.

Abigail Thornton and Gregory Peterson paid their respects quietly. Olivia Kensington arrived moments later, her wreath trembling in her hands.

"I'm so sorry," Olivia murmured, squeezing Evelyn's shoulder. "Uncle Robert loved you so much. He'd want you to be strong."

Evelyn lifted her tear-streaked face. Her gaze found Dominic commanding the room, then dropped to her children's worried faces.

She wasn't alone.

As long as she had them, she could endure anything.

In the shadows, Beatrice Lockwood removed her sunglasses. Her cold stare bored into Robert's portrait.

At last, the stain on her past was gone.

Only one obstacle remained.

Her eyes narrowed on Evelyn.

That girl would never be good enough for her son.

With a regal toss of her head, Beatrice swept out, her designer heels clicking like a death knell.
###Chapter 251

The mourners had all departed as evening fell, leaving only a handful of people in the quiet house.

Isabella and Alexander were hungry. Gwendolyn took them out for dinner.

Dominic received an urgent call. After informing Evelyn, he rushed off.

Evelyn stayed behind to clean up.

The Sinclair family home was modest - just two bedrooms. She glanced around, the surroundings both familiar and strange.

After all, she'd only been brought here as a teenager.

Memories of her father surfaced, though they belonged to another place.

A time before Victoria and her daughter had moved in.

When Robert would visit Evelyn in that small town, he'd carry her on his shoulders, calling her "my precious darling."

She remembered being six years old with a raging fever, drifting in and out of consciousness.

Even the doctors had been helpless.

Through the haze, she'd seen her father kneeling before the physician, begging him to save his daughter.

That moment of helpless desperation had stayed with her.

Miraculously, her fever broke. Fate had granted her a second chance.

Evelyn always knew her father loved her.

She understood his temperament - loving but timid in showing it.

If he hadn't cared, he wouldn't have left her this house in his will.

Yet this very house had led to Robert's death at Victoria and Sophia's hands!

Suppressing her emotions, Evelyn gazed at her father's portrait again.

Her nose stung. "Father..." she whispered.

The front door creaked open. Maxwell had slipped inside, having changed clothes.

He seized Evelyn's wrist coldly. "You're coming with me today."

He'd avoided causing a scene at the funeral, but watching Evelyn with Dominic and the children had become unbearable.

Evelyn yanked her hand free. "Don't touch me. We're strangers now."

Pain flashed in Maxwell's eyes. "Must we pretend? Need I remind you we're legally married?"

Evelyn suddenly laughed.

Her beauty wasn't the flashy sort, but subtle - like a lotus bud on a quiet pond. Her laughter carried a unique gentleness.

Maxwell's eyes darkened with desire.

She'd always been a treasure. In youth, her beauty was fresh; now, it held mature allure. How could he let her go?

He'd lost her once five years ago.

Now that she was within reach again, he'd cling to her even if it meant bleeding.

"Our farce of a marriage ends soon," Evelyn stated calmly.

The air froze.

Maxwell's gaze turned stormy, his handsome face tightening. His lips pressed thin, barely containing his temper.

"Divorce? Dream on!" Maxwell pinned Evelyn against the table, his face inches from hers.

His determined eyes bored into her pale face. "Think Victor Langley can help you? Even God couldn't tear us apart if I refuse!"

Evelyn shoved at him. "Get out..."

Maxwell gripped her chin, bringing his lips closer. "I'd rather chain you to me forever than let you go. Only death parts us!"

Evelyn gasped, eyes filled with disdain. "You're insane, Maxwell Lockwood!"

That disdain broke something in him.

He chuckled darkly. "How lively you are now. I wonder... would you be as spirited beneath me in bed?"

SMACK!

Evelyn's palm connected with Maxwell's cheek.

Shock flashed across his face.

How dare she?

Veins bulged at his temples, his expression turning glacial.

He seized her chin again, his gaze promising retribution. "Who do you think you are? Used goods striking me?"

Spoiled since childhood, Maxwell always got what he wanted.

Even as an adult, he struck others - never the reverse. No one dared lay hands on him.

Yet this seemingly fragile woman had slapped him. The humiliation burned.

His hand rose to strike back, but meeting her defiant, tear-filled eyes, he lowered it. Instead, he crushed his lips to hers.

Like a ravenous beast, he showed no mercy.

"Stop... let go..." Evelyn struggled furiously.

But his strength overwhelmed her. She could evade his kisses, not his iron grip.

Robert's portrait silently witnessed his daughter's violation. Even the air seemed to sigh in despair...

In her struggles, Evelyn knocked over a porcelain vase holding chrysanthemums.

The shattering sound alerted Gwendolyn and the children returning downstairs.

Evelyn's lashes fluttered, her tear-filled eyes shining with humiliation.

Just as fresh tears fell, Alexander charged in.

Seeing his mother attacked, the boy lunged at Maxwell's leg and bit down hard!

Sharp teeth pierced flesh.

Blood instantly stained Maxwell's trousers...
###Chapter 252

Even gentle Isabella snapped when she saw her mother being assaulted. She seized the nearest broom and swung it hard at Maxwell.

"Evil Uncle Maxwell! You monster! I'll end you!" Her tiny voice shook with fury.

Maxwell hissed in pain as the blow landed on his shin, forcing him to release Evelyn.

Evelyn scrambled away, her lips swollen and bleeding. The hatred in her eyes could have killed Maxwell where he stood.

Maxwell licked his injured tongue. That wildcat nearly bit it off.

Looking down, he found Alexander still clamped onto his leg like a pitbull. The boy had drawn blood.

"That savage cub. Definitely Dominic's spawn."

His gaze shifted to trembling Isabella, who stood guard before Evelyn despite her fear, brandishing the broom like a sword.

A smirk twisted his lips.

"Fascinating little beasts. Just as hot-tempered as their father."

Dominic Blackwood might appear as every woman's aristocratic fantasy - handsome, refined, elegant. But beneath that polished exterior lurked a ruthless predator.

His razor-sharp instincts and cutthroat business tactics made even veteran con artists flee. In mere years, he'd elevated T Corporation from near-collapse to unprecedented dominance.

With T Corporation's tentacles in every industry, the entire business world danced to Dominic's tune. Fellow tycoons called him "The Ice Demon."

Now Alexander and Isabella stood united before Evelyn, glaring at Maxwell like he was some rabid animal.

Their fierce protection moved Evelyn deeply, giving her strength to face Maxwell again.

Meanwhile, Gwendolyn stood utterly bewildered.

From what she understood, her niece was involved with Dominic.

That's what Evelyn had led her to believe.

Yet at her brother's funeral, this Maxwell Lockwood had declared himself Evelyn's husband, even producing a marriage certificate. She'd known nothing of this union.

'If Evelyn is legally married to Maxwell...'

'Then what is her relationship with Dominic?'

'Is my niece committing adultery?'

"Get out, Maxwell Lockwood! The Sinclairs want nothing to do with you! I will divorce you!" Evelyn declared firmly.

"You think the Blackwoods will accept damaged goods after our divorce, Evelyn? Reginald Blackwood values family reputation above all. Do you honestly believe he'd welcome some used-up woman? Dream on! I'd rather die than let you go. Mark my words - you'll return to the Lockwood family with me." Maxwell had descended into madness.

He dabbed his bleeding lip with a napkin, crumpled the bloodied paper, and tossed it aside.

The door slammed shut behind him with enough force to rattle the walls.

Gwendolyn jumped at the noise. Seeing Evelyn's ashen face, she rushed to her side.

"Are you alright, dear?" She fretted. "What was that about? Aren't you seeing Dominic Blackwood? Since when are you married to that man? You never mentioned a husband. Should I call Dominic—"

Evelyn shook her head wearily. "Another time, Aunt Gwendolyn. I just need rest."

The emotional battering had left her drained.

All she craved was peace.

"Of course, go lie down. I'll clean up here." Gwendolyn's heart ached seeing her niece so exhausted.

As she guided Evelyn to bed, the frailty beneath her touch was alarming.

With her brother gone, Evelyn and the twins were all she had left.

Soon she'd be gone too. Then what would become of them?

The children clung to their mother, sensing her distress.

Evelyn closed her eyes, the pain in her chest spreading.

Alexander and Isabella curled against her, clutching her shirt like lifelines.

She held them tight - her only anchors in this storm.

Maxwell's cruel words echoed painfully. Harsh, but true.

The Blackwoods stood atop A City's social hierarchy. Even unmarried, she'd never match Dominic's status.

Dominic might disregard public opinion to marry her, but to the world, she'd always be the fool.

What could she do?

Across town...

The dinner gathering comprised A City's elite.

Dominic knew most attendees, though some were new acquaintances.

He'd reluctantly accepted the last-minute invitation. Now irritation gnawed at him.

Evelyn needed him, yet here he sat, guilt twisting his gut.

At the head table sat Jonathan Prescott, the Provincial Committee Secretary, exuding authority.

Beside him, his daughter Lillian Prescott laughed coquettishly at his remarks.

Lillian's gaze kept drifting to Dominic. Under the chandeliers, his sculpted features looked carved by gods.

She was utterly besotted. This man would be hers - no matter the cost.

Currently, Dominic appeared engrossed in Jonathan's speech.

His striking eyes gleamed with apparent interest, lips curved in a faint smile.

Little did they know his mind was miles away - with a certain heartbroken woman and her fierce little protectors.
###Chapter 253

Dominic Blackwood studied the man who had captured his daughter's heart. The man exuded strength and maturity.

He carried himself like someone who had achieved success in life.

What's more, the man knew Dominic was the Provincial Committee Secretary yet made no attempt to curry favor. Polite, but distant.

Dominic nodded in approval. This was a man worthy of Lillian's affection. If his daughter wanted him, he would move heaven and earth to make it happen.

After introductions, Dominic inquired, "I've heard T Corporation's CEO is exceptionally talented. Meeting you confirms it. Tell me, are you married?"

"I'm unmarried, but I have two five-year-old children."

Every word from Dominic's lips made Lillian's heart flutter.

A flicker of disappointment crossed Dominic's face at the mention of children.

Yet it didn't matter. Not when he saw how smitten his daughter was. With Dominic's wealth and influence, Lillian could bear her own heirs later. Money was no object for raising children.

Meanwhile, Lillian sat transfixed, her gaze locked on Dominic.

She'd chosen her makeup carefully tonight.

Research told her Dominic preferred understated elegance. The silk gown hugged her curves just right - modest yet alluring. The light makeup enhanced her natural beauty.

Judging by the admiring glances from other men, her efforts had paid off.

Linking arms with her father, she smiled demurely. "Mr. Blackwood, I understand T Corporation is seeking a new perfume spokesperson. Might I be considered?"

Lillian knew exactly how to play her charms.

She never met a man's gaze directly. Instead, she'd glance sideways through her lashes, pairing it with her sweetest smile.

This technique had broken countless hearts before.

Dominic gave her a cursory glance. "Your beauty and talent speak for themselves, Ms. Prescott. You wouldn't need your father's connections for such a role."

The dinner guests quickly agreed.

"With you as spokesperson, sales would skyrocket!"
"Your debut performance was extraordinary - a true natural!"

These political figures excelled at flattery.

Everyone knew Lillian Prescott couldn't act.

Her orphanage background had lent authenticity to her first role, but subsequent performances were disastrous. Her latest film, "Seven Kingdoms at War," became legendary - for all the wrong reasons.

With a 3.9 IMDB rating, it destroyed several careers. Yet Lillian remained unscathed, thanks to her powerful backing.

Lillian basked in the praise but feigned modesty. "Acting is my passion. I owe everything to my father's support."

Dominic saw through the charade but held his tongue.

T Corporation used international stars to project prestige. Lillian would diminish their brand. Yet refusing outright would offend Jonathan Prescott.

The financial loss would be negligible compared to gaining Jonathan's favor.

Jonathan patted his daughter's hand. "I've spoiled her terribly, Mr. Blackwood. If she becomes your spokesperson, I trust you'll take good care of her."

"Mr. Blackwood is a gentleman, Father. He understands," Lillian purred, already claiming victory.

Dominic suppressed a shudder at her cloying tone.

Suddenly, he longed for Evelyn's genuine warmth...

Yet he maintained a diplomatic smile. "It would be our honor, Ms. Prescott."

Jonathan laughed heartily. "Excellent! I'll leave you young people to it."

Dominic's smile turned razor-sharp. "Speaking of which, our seaside resort proposal seems stalled at the Environmental Protection Agency. Has protocol changed?"
###Chapter 254

Dominic Blackwood set his wine glass down with a sharp clink at Jonathan Prescott's words.

The alcohol had flushed his cheeks slightly. "Consider it done, Jonathan. My team will handle the paperwork overnight. You'll have the signed approval by morning." His fingers tapped the stem of his glass. "Just remember our agreement regarding your daughter."

The more Jonathan studied Dominic, the more impressed he became. Their conversation revealed a razor-sharp intellect beneath that polished exterior - exactly the kind of son-in-law he'd envisioned for Lillian.

The shift from "Mr. Blackwood" to "Dominic" hadn't gone unnoticed. Every guest recognized the unspoken matchmaking at play.

Envious glances followed Dominic across the room. In mere minutes, he'd secured development rights to the billion-dollar coastal project. None could deny he'd earned it - not with that combination of striking looks and business acumen.

"Congratulations, Mr. Blackwood!" A balding executive raised his glass. "This resort will catapult T Corporation into new stratospheres."

"A visionary deal," another chimed in, adjusting his tie. "Your profit margins are the envy of the industry."

Dominic's lips curved in a practiced smile as he toasted Jonathan. "This project will benefit the entire city." Noticeably absent was any mention of Lillian Prescott.

The evening had been a masterclass in strategic deception. What surprised him was Jonathan's blatant push to pair him with Lillian - a woman he knew only through tabloid headlines and underwhelming box office numbers.

Only one woman held his heart: Evelyn Sinclair. Pretentious starlets like Lillian Prescott couldn't compare.

Years of corporate warfare had honed his instincts. That first glance at Lillian's calculating eyes revealed everything. He'd keep that viper at arm's length.

Unaware of his thoughts, Lillian gazed at him with doe-eyed admiration. With Dominic's endorsement, the spokesperson role was practically hers. Initial motivations didn't matter - proximity would breed affection.

Midnight found Evelyn in the living room, curled beneath a blanket with a novel. The amber lamp light softened her delicate features as she turned the page.

The story unfolded a forbidden love between half-siblings. "This isn't a love story," the heroine Bonnie declared on the first page, "but a story about love."

By the final chapter, Evelyn's lashes were damp. The male lead Lewis chose poison over separation, whispering, "I love you, Bonnie. Not for being good or wicked - simply for being you."

The tragedy lingered. If she and Dominic shared blood, would their love damn them? Her fingers tightened around the book.

Her solace came in two forms - Alexander and Isabella, sleeping soundly upstairs. Yet Allison's claims demanded verification. A DNA test would silence the whispers.

Love was said to be a sickness. Was that why her chest ached?

Suddenly, warmth enveloped her. Dominic's usual icy demeanor had melted into concern. "My melancholy mother," he murmured, brushing a tear from her cheek.

Evelyn's tears might resemble Byron's "violet dropping dew," but Dominic cherished her smiles more - each one like petals blessed by angels.

She studied his tired face - the rumpled shirt, the whiskey scent, the hair falling across his forehead. Even exhausted, his tenderness warmed her.

Her fingers worked loose his tie as she whispered fears into his shoulder: of shattered peace, of separation, of their children suffering.

Dominic cradled her cold hands, pressing kisses to her eyelids. "Let me carry the weight, darling. Your only task is loving our children. The storms won't touch you."

Their intertwined hands formed a study in contrasts - her alabaster skin against his sun-kissed bronze. In his grasp, her world regained its light.
###Chapter 255

Evelyn felt an overwhelming warmth filling the emptiness in her chest.

Dominic's strong arms enveloped her completely.

Their heartbeats synchronized - his powerful rhythm matching her fluttering pulse.

His lips descended upon hers with tender possessiveness.

Though a mother of twins, Evelyn still carried that innocent allure that drove Dominic wild.

Her natural floral scent intoxicated him, awakening primal desires.

"Mmm... Dominic..." Her body melted under his touch before she regained composure. "Not here," she whispered breathlessly, pushing against his chest. "The living room isn't appropriate... You must be exhausted. Go shower first."

They were staying at Robert's house with Gwendolyn and the children.

The funeral parlor-turned-living room was hardly suitable for intimacy, especially with Gwendolyn sleeping just down the hall.

Being caught would be beyond embarrassing.

Dominic knew she was right. With one last hungry kiss on her swollen lips, he reluctantly released her.

Evelyn's flushed face glowed in the dim light.

Her crystal-clear eyes shimmered with passion as she nervously bit her lower lip.

How could someone so angelic look so temptingly sinful?

Dominic traced her delicate jawline, fighting his urges. "I've worked nonstop today. Don't I deserve some pampering? Join me in the shower."

Evelyn's cheeks burned crimson.

"Stop teasing me, Dominic..."

Knowing her shy nature, he relented. Exhaustion weighed on him anyway. After a final kiss, he disappeared into the bathroom.

Steam filled the room as he stripped off his dress shirt, revealing sculpted abs that would make any model jealous.

Near midnight, Dominic emerged quietly, padding toward the bedroom.

Moonlight illuminated Evelyn and the twins' peaceful faces.

Seeing Alexander and Isabella's resemblance to their mother filled him with profound contentment.

At this moment, everything felt perfect.

Sliding carefully onto the bed, he wrapped his arms around his family. All carnal desires faded, replaced by something deeper - the pure joy of belonging.

Evelyn stirred as his body heat reached her.

Awakening, she found herself staring at his bare torso, her mouth suddenly dry.

She instinctively scooted closer to the children. "Did you shower? You should rest. Work awaits tomorrow."

Dominic noticed her retreat and pulled her closer without comment. His dark eyes reflected moonlight like ancient, mysterious pools.

Though silent, his gaze burned with unmistakable hunger.

Evelyn recognized that look. Experience taught her how quickly this man could transform into a predator.

With the children beside them, she couldn't risk it. "It's late," she reminded nervously. "Sleep now."

"Hmm," came his deep, velvety response.

Water droplets clung to his dark hair, making him look devastatingly attractive.

He stroked her silken locks. "Victoria and Sophia's trial starts next month. What do you want to do?"

Disgust laced his words. While he'd prefer eliminating them permanently, Evelyn's wishes mattered more.

Surprisingly calm, Evelyn replied, "They killed my father. They'll pay."

"Whatever you decide." His fingers traced her collarbone. "But first, I'll handle Maxwell. I want to make you my wife officially - Alexander and Isabella's mother."

Her floral scent intoxicated him, reigniting his desires.

Evelyn's clear eyes met his, warmth flooding her veins.

Then Allison's warning echoed in her mind. "Your mother said we're half-siblings. Society would never accept us. My mother was your father's-"

Dominic's frown cut her off.

He'd suspected something when Beatrice visited Evelyn. Though busy, he'd pieced together the truth.

Cupping her face, he kissed her forehead. "Silly girl, do you really believe her? If we were related, would our children be so perfect? Trust me, Evelyn. Just follow your heart."

"But-"

His fingers tilted her chin as his mouth crashed onto hers. "Too many words. Maybe we need some exercise first."

In one swift motion, he pinned her beneath him.

Evelyn felt her bones might dissolve under his weight as he pressed closer. His hardened length burned against her thigh.

"Not now... the children..." she gasped.

"They sleep like logs," he murmured, already tugging at her pajamas.

Just as he was about to claim her, a small voice piped up:

"Daddy? Why are you on top of Mommy?"
###Chapter 256

The childish voice made Dominic freeze instantly.

Alexander and Isabella had woken up moments earlier. Their wide eyes stared curiously at Daddy and Mommy tangled together.

Dominic scrambled off Evelyn's body, hastily pulling the silk sheet over them both.

Evelyn burned with embarrassment. She wished the floor would open up and swallow her whole.

Frustration and anger warred within Dominic at the interruption. But seeing the children's innocent confusion, he couldn't bring himself to scold them.

"Daddy, why were you on top of Mommy?" Isabella asked, tilting her head at Evelyn who was trying to hide beneath the covers.

Meanwhile, Alexander glared at Dominic with accusing eyes.

The boy noticed his mother's flushed face and teary eyes...

Pointing a chubby finger, Alexander shouted, "You're so big, Daddy! Were you hurting Mommy?"

Earlier, Evelyn's muffled cry had woken him. Seeing his father's massive frame crushing his delicate mother had shocked him.

'How could Daddy do that?
Mommy's still recovering. She's so small and Daddy's so heavy!'

For the first time in his life, Dominic felt thoroughly embarrassed.

Normally, these two slept through thunderstorms. Yet the one time he wanted intimacy with his wife, they'd caught them red-handed.

"Daddy wasn't hurting me," Evelyn lied unconvincingly. "I was cold... so he was keeping me warm like a blanket. Now go back to sleep, darlings. School tomorrow."

Alexander and Isabella inspected Evelyn for injuries, then shook tiny fists at Dominic in warning. Only after prolonged cuddles did they drift back to sleep...

Dominic didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

Evelyn had completely usurped his authority in the household.

Not that he minded. Her bond with the children delighted him. She'd won their hearts completely.

"Come here..." Dominic whispered, reaching for Evelyn now that the children slept.

Before he could touch her, the usually docile rabbit delivered a sharp kick between his legs.

Caught off guard, Dominic gasped in pain.

Evelyn's disdainful glare could freeze fire. "Don't touch me for a month."

Turning away, she hugged the children and closed her eyes.

Dominic stared at her back in dismay. A month without touching her? He'd go insane.

Now that he'd tasted Evelyn's sweetness, how could he return to celibacy?

He resolved to build the children a new bedroom - as far from theirs as possible!

Across town...

Neon lights pulsed through the smoky nightclub as bodies swayed to throbbing music. Strangers pressed together, igniting sparks of desire.

Maxwell Lockwood wove through the crowd, brushing off advances with practiced ease. Half-drunk, he looked every inch the playboy.

'See? Women still flock to me.
These club girls are sexy, eager to please. They adore me.
What does Evelyn have besides that innocent face?
She can't even keep a man happy. Used goods who bore my cousin's brats.
Why can't I let her go?'

Maxwell retreated from the dance floor with a beauty on each arm, settling at the bar.

The bartender slid cocktails toward them. "Your drinks, Mr. Lockwood..."

Maxwell pinched one girl's cheek while stroking the other's bare arm. "Tell me, do you love me?" he mocked.

"Of course! You're prettier than me - that's reason enough!" the first giggled.

Not to be outdone, the second planted a wet kiss on his cheek. "You're always so generous! We all love you!"

Maxwell's laughter died when glass shattered nearby. A woman's scream pierced the music.

Narrowing his eyes, he spotted thugs harassing a stunning woman in a white crop top and micro skirt.

Already in a foul mood, this worsened it. His usually smiling eyes darkened with violence.

Who dared cause trouble on Maxwell Lockwood's turf?

A wave of his hand sent security swarming. Normally he'd ignore such incidents, but tonight he needed an outlet.

Within minutes, the thugs fled in terror.

Maxwell fought with terrifying brutality, seeming not to care about consequences.

Blood dripped from his arm as he studied the woman before him through drunken haze.

'Who is she?
Why does she look familiar?'

Recognition dawned. A slow smirk spread across his face.

'Well, well.
Victor Langley's ex - the love of his life.
Serena Delacroix.'
###Chapter 257

Maxwell Lockwood sat at the dimly lit bar, swirling a glass of deep red wine. His injured arm was wrapped in white bandages.

Thick lashes shadowed the dangerous glint in his eyes.

"Thank you for your assistance, Mr. Lockwood. If you ever need anything, don't hesitate to contact me." The woman across from him slid a business card toward him.

Maxwell picked it up. Eminent Advocates & Solicitors.

Serena Delacroix. Senior Partner.

Memories flickered to life.

Back in university, Maxwell had attended the same school as Victor Langley and Serena.

Victor and Serena had been the golden couple of the law department—brilliant, ambitious, and inseparable.

Their relationship lasted all four years.

Then, for reasons no one knew, they broke up after graduation. Serena vanished overseas, while Victor drowned his sorrows in alcohol before eventually rebuilding his life.

"What a coincidence, Ms. Delacroix. I happen to be in the middle of a rather... complicated case." Maxwell swirled his wine. "I've devoted everything to my wife, yet she wants to leave me for another man. I refuse to grant her a divorce. I'd like to hire you as my lawyer—name your price."

"Mr. Lockwood," Serena said coolly, exhaling a thin stream of smoke, "you can't force love. With your status, countless women would gladly throw themselves at you. Why waste time on someone who doesn’t want you?"

"You've loved before, haven’t you?" Maxwell leaned forward. "Imagine seeing the most exquisite cake in a patisserie window. You crave it—dream about its taste—only to be told it’s already sold, and the baker is dead. Then one day, you see someone else eating your cake. How would you feel?"

Serena smirked, blowing a perfect smoke ring. "You’re being dramatic, Mr. Lockwood. The world is full of equally delicious cakes. You can afford any of them."

Maxwell’s lips curved. "Do you know who my wife’s lawyer is? Victor Langley. The legendary Victor Langley."

Victor Langley was indeed a legal titan.

He’d won landmark cases—high-stakes divorces among billionaires, custody battles, corporate wars. His record? Flawless.

At Victor’s name, Serena’s fingers tightened around her cigarette. Disdain flickered in her eyes before she schooled her expression.

"Fine," she said smoothly. "I’ll take your case."

Her fingers drummed the bar counter. Eyes closing, she whispered to herself, Victor Langley, I’ll take back everything you stole from me.

Maxwell’s smile turned razor-sharp.

You want a divorce, Evelyn?

Over my dead body.

The next morning, after breakfast, Dominic left for the office. Sebastian arrived to pick up the twins, but they refused to go without their mother.

Evelyn couldn’t say no.

The twins attended an elite kindergarten that taught trilingual immersion (English, French, German) alongside arts, sports, and science. The sprawling campus boasted swimming pools, gardens, even a mini aviary.

Luxury cars lined the drop-off zone. Celebrities were a common sight.

That morning, Evelyn’s heart clenched at a scene near the gates.

A chubby boy clung to his grandfather’s leg, sobbing. "I don’t wanna go! Take me home!"

The flustered old man patted his back. "School’s fun! You’ll make friends—"

A nearby mother chuckled. "They all cry at first. He’ll adjust."

Evelyn glanced down at Alexander and Isabella. Both watched silently, their small faces unreadable.

Had they cried like this on their first day?

She squeezed their hands tighter. Passing the wailing boy, she sighed.

Their teacher—a warm-eyed woman—beamed when she saw Evelyn. "You must be their mother! No wonder they’re so beautiful."

Evelyn smiled politely.

After settling the twins in class, she lingered by the window, observing.

Alexander sat rigidly upright, attentive and solemn. The spitting image of his father. Evelyn shook her head.

Like father, like son.

Isabella, meanwhile, was sunshine incarnate—chatty, talented, adored by her classmates. A natural-born star.

Evelyn’s chest ached.

My little sun and moon.
###Chapter 258

Alexander Blackwood was in a foul mood. The kindergarten classroom felt like a prison to him.

At just four years old, his intellect already surpassed most elementary students. His father had hired private tutors to nurture his exceptional mind.

Yet here he sat, surrounded by children who couldn't even master a simple French song after multiple repetitions.

His dark eyes scanned the room with thinly veiled disdain. The way his classmates bobbed their heads while singing irritated him. Only his twin sister Isabella received his tolerance - and even her high-pitched singing grated on his nerves.

The French teacher's nasal voice made him cringe. He'd memorized the melody after two hearings. Why couldn't these other children grasp it?

His small hands clenched into fists as the teacher began yet another repetition. The discordant chorus of off-key voices made his skin crawl.

Then he saw her.

Evelyn Sinclair stood outside the window, her warm smile cutting through his irritation like sunlight.

"Mommy!" The word burst from his lips, lost in the cacophony.

His mother pressed a finger to her lips, then gestured toward the singing children. Her unspoken command was clear: participate.

Alexander scowled but obeyed, reluctantly opening his mouth to mimic the lyrics. The corners of Evelyn's lips twitched at his dramatic sigh of resignation.

After ensuring her children were settled, Evelyn hailed a cab to Vivi Corporation. As a new employee, she couldn't afford extended absences.

The design department buzzed with activity when she arrived. Several colleagues exchanged glances as she walked to her workstation.

"Must be nice having special privileges," someone muttered.

"With that face, I'd get special treatment too," came the catty reply.

Evelyn ignored them, powering up her computer with practiced calm. The whispers still prickled at her composure.

Abigail Thornton cleared her throat sharply, silencing the gossipers. "Focus on your own work," she advised Evelyn with a reassuring pat.

The office door swung open with sudden force.

Click. Click. Click.

Vivienne Laurent entered like a storm front, her white stilettos striking the marble floor with military precision. The department supervisor carried a file like a weapon, her cold gaze sweeping the room before landing on Evelyn.

"Evelyn Sinclair?" Her voice dripped with disdain.

Abigail leaned in. "Vivienne Laurent - transferred from our Paris branch. Design department supervisor."

Evelyn's pulse quickened. Vivienne Laurent - the Vivienne Laurent? MIT graduate, winner of the Pritzker Emerging Architect Prize?

She stood hastily, extending her hand. "Ms. Laurent, it's an honor—"

Vivienne ignored the gesture, slamming the folder onto Evelyn's desk. "I don't care who hired you. In my department, we follow rules. You've missed two weeks this month. Is this your family's company?"

"I followed proper leave procedures—"

Olivia Kensington interrupted from two desks over. "I processed all her requests. They were approved by—"

"New policy," Vivienne snapped. "All leave requests go through me. And you," she turned back to Evelyn, "are forfeiting this month's bonus."

With that, she pivoted and disappeared into her office.

Evelyn stared after her, unease coiling in her stomach. That hadn't been professional disapproval in Vivienne's eyes. It had been something far more personal.

Olivia wheeled her chair over. "You okay?"

"Fine," Evelyn lied, forcing a smile.

"Oh, the department email password changed. It's 120886 now."

Evelyn froze.

Those numbers...

Dominic Blackwood's birthday.
###Chapter 259

Evelyn remembered that sequence of numbers vividly.

During one particularly heated moment between them, she'd asked Dominic about his birthday.

He'd whispered those digits against her skin, making her repeat them until they were seared into her memory.

"Something wrong, Evelyn?" Olivia looked puzzled.

Few knew the details of Dominic's private life.

Most employees remained unaware of his birthday, and it certainly wasn't information available online.

"Nothing. Why was the password changed?" She kept her tone casual.

"No idea. It happened when the new supervisor arrived. That woman's impossible to read. Between us? I can't stand her. All that humility she shows in interviews? Pure act." Olivia didn't hold back.

"Well, she's earned the right to be difficult. Let's discuss this later." Evelyn returned to her sketches.

Olivia had always been blunt, a trait that often got her into trouble.

But she'd been working on tempering her honesty since joining the company.

Noticing Evelyn studying various designs, Olivia offered, "I've got some senior designers' work you could reference. To really fit in here, you'll need to understand our signature styles. I'll email you our most notable projects."

Evelyn nodded her thanks.

Though she'd secured her place at T Corporation, staying required constant growth. To carve out her own niche, she needed to outshine the competition through sheer talent.

Meanwhile, in Vivienne's impeccably decorated office...

Vivienne sat before her computer, clutching a design document.

One corner bore the marks of repeated handling - crumpled and folded.

Her brief overseas trip had been interrupted by disturbing reports from her informant: Dominic was growing close to a new employee.

Rumors swirled about his protectiveness toward his cousin's wife. Whispers of physical altercations on her behalf.

He'd rejected Seraphina Prescott, his mother's chosen bride, for this woman...

The stories seemed outrageous, yet Vivienne couldn't shake her unease.

She'd coveted that man for years. How dare some newcomer threaten her position?

Other women's advances had never concerned her. Dominic always rejected them outright.

But Evelyn felt different. Dangerous.

Every instinct screamed that this woman was more than she appeared.

"Ms. Laurent." The design lead entered with steaming coffee.

This woman served as Vivienne's eyes within T Corporation, though even she could only gather scraps about Dominic's private life.

Vivienne massaged her temples, gesturing toward the desk. "Tell me about this Evelyn."

The lead recalled her clashes with Evelyn and spilled every detail.

"You may not know, Ms. Laurent, but the boss personally brought her in. No real skills, comes and goes as she pleases, yet no one dares question her... Last month during our town visit, colleagues saw Dominic enter her room. He didn't leave until morning. Next day? The little slut looked thoroughly ravished. Hickeys everywhere. Disgusting..." She embellished freely.

The lead watched with satisfaction as Vivienne's expression darkened.

She'd aligned with Yvette, bullying Evelyn based on Beatrice's preference. But Yvette had disappeared...

Now she feared retaliation.

Vivienne's return offered protection.

The lead had risen by currying Vivienne's favor, becoming her trusted spy.

Eager to continue her tirade, she was cut off by Vivienne's dismissive wave.

Left alone, Vivienne gripped the document, struggling to contain her rage.

Then she schooled her features into calm indifference.

Rising, she took the elevator to the top floor.

Her knock was answered by that crisp baritone: "Enter."

Dominic commanded attention effortlessly.

His custom suit accentuated his striking features - handsome yet dangerous.

More magnetic than when Vivienne had left six months prior.

She presented the design document. "The Nimbus International proposal."

Dominic set aside his pen, accepting the file while massaging his brow.

Vivienne recognized his tired gesture.

Evelyn festered in her mind, but she revealed nothing.

As he reviewed the designs, Dominic remarked, "Your style's changed, Ms. Laurent. Something troubling you?"

Her pulse jumped.

True, distracted, she'd overlooked details. Normally meticulous, she hadn't expected him to notice.

His perception unnerved her...
###Chapter 260

"Is something troubling you, Ms. Laurent? Or is the local climate not agreeing with you?" Dominic inquired, studying her expression.

Vivienne adjusted her blazer with a practiced motion. "The weather here takes some getting used to. I'll adapt soon enough to perform at my best."

Dominic gave an approving nod. "I've never doubted your competence, Ms. Laurent. Leave the documents here. We'll review them in detail tomorrow."

"Understood." Vivienne turned on her heel and exited without another word.

Dominic leaned back in his chair, satisfied.

This was the Vivienne he knew—cool, composed, untouchable. She carried herself with an icy elegance that no distraction could penetrate.

That unshakable professionalism was precisely why he valued her.

Capable. Disciplined. Unaffected by personal trivialities. The ideal executive.

"Ms. Laurent," Dominic called out just as her hand touched the doorknob.

Vivienne froze mid-step. A smirk curled her lips before she schooled her features back into neutrality. She turned, eyebrows arched. "Yes, Mr. Blackwood?"

"Your work in Argentina yielded impressive results. The subsidiary's growth exceeded projections. Name your reward—bonus or equity. We'll finalize details over dinner tonight."

"Very well." Her tone gave nothing away.

The moment the office door clicked shut behind her, Vivienne's smile returned, radiant as a sunrise.

She had mastered this dance. Dominic despised clingy women, and she'd watched countless others crash and burn trying to claim his attention.

Yet she remained. The only woman who'd stood by his side this long.

At six sharp, the workday ended.

In the design department, Evelyn had grown close to Olivia and Abigail. The others remained polite acquaintances.

Abigail waved goodbye and left first, while Olivia linked arms with Evelyn as they headed out together.

Olivia chattered about office gossip as they walked.

"Did you hear about the finance guy who embezzled half a million to impress some camgirl? Got arrested last week..."

"And that 'reliable' marketing manager? Turns out he was juggling two girlfriends until they found out..."

Evelyn half-listened, her mind elsewhere.

At the company entrance, Dominic's black Bentley glided past them.

The window was down. Evelyn caught a glimpse of his profile, but his gaze never strayed toward her.

Vivienne sat in the passenger seat, regal as a queen. A breeze carried her Chanel No. 5 perfume toward them.

When Vivienne noticed Evelyn, her eyes gleamed with mocking triumph.

Dominic spotted Evelyn in the rearview mirror.

A sudden impulse seized him—to order Vivienne out and beckon Evelyn into the car instead.

This was new. He'd never had a woman he actually wanted to claim before. The unfamiliarity unsettled him.

He shook his head, dismissing the thought. This was strictly business. Vivienne's performance merited recognition, nothing more.

He'd explain it to Evelyn later. She'd understand—corporate dinners were routine.

The Bentley disappeared around the corner.

Olivia shot Evelyn a concerned glance.

Everyone knew Evelyn shared something special with Dominic. Seeing him with another woman had to sting.

"You okay? Vivienne just got back from overseas. This is probably just a welcome-back dinner," Olivia offered gently.

Evelyn looked away.

She trusted Dominic. Vivienne was a stellar employee—this dinner made perfect sense.

Yet the unease lingered. She was only human.

"I'm fine." Evelyn pushed down the nagging doubt. "Our bus is coming."

The bustling square ahead featured a dancing fountain at its center. Beyond it lay the bus stop for Route 52.

Since starting work, Evelyn had dreamed of buying a car. But her savings were meager, and she refused to touch the credit card Dominic gave her.

By year's end, with her bonus, maybe she could afford something modest.

Halfway across the square, a hand clamped around her wrist.

Evelyn whirled to face Maxwell Lockwood.

"Let go, Maxwell." Her voice turned arctic.

"I'm your husband," he growled. "What's wrong with picking you up from work?"

Olivia stepped between them. "You're pathetic, Maxwell. Evelyn's with Mr. Blackwood now. Stop embarrassing yourself."

Maxwell's snake-like gaze flicked to Olivia before returning to Evelyn. "Quit this job. Let me take care of you." His eyes darkened as they raked over the T Corporation building. "Look at those dark circles. Dominic doesn't appreciate you. Come home where you belong."

Evelyn wrenched free. "I love my job. And we are not married—not in any way that matters. That forced arrangement ends soon. Stay away from me!"

She turned to leave, but Maxwell blocked her path.

"I'll never divorce you," he hissed. "You really think Dominic loves you? He's sleeping with Vivienne Laurent. You're just his plaything. Now that she's back, where does that leave you?"

Evelyn's breath hitched. The words struck like a physical blow.
###Chapter 261

Maxwell stepped forward and gripped Evelyn's shoulders, preventing her from leaving.

His intense gaze searched her eyes, watching for any flicker of emotion.

Evelyn's calm exterior was a facade. Inside, she was anything but composed.

Dominic's words had struck a nerve. Tears threatened to spill, but she shoved Maxwell away. "Stop trying to drive us apart. I'll always believe in Dominic, no matter what."

She grabbed Olivia's hand and marched defiantly toward the bus stop.

Maxwell didn't follow. His jaw clenched as his fists repeatedly tightened and relaxed.

'You'll come back to me eventually, Evelyn.'

Though she'd planned to take the bus home, Evelyn changed her mind in her agitated state. She decided to pick up the twins from kindergarten instead.

She called Sebastian, discovering he was already en route. She instructed him to wait if he arrived first.

After hanging up, Evelyn bid Olivia farewell and hailed a cab to the school.

The kindergarten was just four blocks away on the same street. She arrived within minutes.

At the entrance, childish voices bickered loudly.

"My father runs a Fortune 500 company! He's super important!" boasted a chubby-cheeked boy.

"Is he more important than my daddy?" came Isabella's familiar retort.

"Obviously! My dad's amazing!" the boy countered.

Isabella refused to back down. "My daddy's the most important! Nobody dares disobey him!"

The boy scoffed. "Big deal. When my dad visits, even the principal stands at attention!"

Isabella smirked. "My daddy owns a huge company with thousands of employees who all bow to him!"

The boy raised his voice. "That's nothing! I never wait in line at the hospital when I mention my dad!"

Isabella turned to her brother, pouting. "Alexander...he's being mean..."

Alexander massaged his temples. Though he found their argument childish, he wouldn't tolerate anyone bullying his sister.

"Fine," Alexander said smoothly, his princely smile sending chills down the boy's spine. "If your father's so important, Oliver, does he take the bus?"

"Of course! Duh!" Oliver lifted his chin arrogantly.

Alexander's grin widened. "Interesting...my father only drives his Bentley, Ferrari, or Rolls-Royce. He's never ridden a bus."

Oliver gaped, speechless.

Alexander took Isabella's hand. "Tell me, Oliver, have you ever seen an important person take the bus?"

Oliver's round face flushed crimson with rage.

'Damn it! He tricked me!'

Evelyn nearly laughed aloud at their ridiculous debate.

She knew she shouldn't encourage such behavior, but she couldn't help admiring Alexander's cunning. With one question, he'd left his opponent floundering.

"Alexander, Isabella, Mommy's here!" Evelyn called warmly.

The twins' faces lit up. Isabella flew into Evelyn's arms like an excited sparrow while Alexander approached with dignified grace.

After kissing Isabella's cheek, Evelyn noticed Oliver again.

Her heart softened at the sight of him. With his porcelain skin, thick lashes, and animated eyes, he was unbearably adorable—despite his bratty attitude.

Evelyn had zero resistance to cute children.

"What's your name, sweetheart? Are your parents coming?" she asked.

"Mommy, that's Oliver Kensington," Isabella huffed. "He's the class bully! He pulls my hair and fights with everyone. Even the teachers can't control him. Let's just go!"

Oliver hesitated, then shuffled toward Evelyn.

Though he constantly fought with Isabella, her mother seemed kind and gentle.

Oliver had never known his own mother.

Watching Evelyn kiss Isabella sparked an unfamiliar jealousy. He found himself drawn to her warmth.

"Where do you live? Should we give you a ride?" Evelyn patted his head just as Sebastian pulled up.

"No thank you," Oliver mumbled, blushing. "Uncle Clarence is coming."

Evelyn decided to wait with him. It wasn't safe for a child to be alone.

She mediated between the children until they made peace.

Soon, the Kensington family driver arrived, apologizing for the delay due to traffic.

Relieved to find Oliver safe, the driver thanked Evelyn before leaving.

As the car drove off, Oliver peered back at Evelyn through the window.

Something about his lonely expression tugged at her heartstrings.
###Chapter 262

The twins headed straight to the study to tackle their homework while Evelyn busied herself in the kitchen.

A basin of water sat in the sink, two fish swimming lazily inside. Dinner tonight would be fish—nutritious, perfect for growing children.

Even if Alexander and Isabella were picky eaters, Evelyn was determined to expand their palates.

Her hands moved mechanically as she prepped the ingredients, but her mind was elsewhere.

Seeing Dominic and Vivienne in the same car earlier had unsettled her.

She tried to push the thought away, but unease clung to her like a stubborn shadow.

Grabbing the first fish, she imagined it was Dominic.

Thwack! Thwack! The rolling pin came down hard. The fish went still.

Part of her wanted to call him, but pride held her back.

If this really was just business, her call would only be a distraction.

Yet Xavier's warning echoed in her mind, making her stomach twist.

She shoved the thought aside.

Soon, the table was set—roasted fish with a side of maple-glazed mashed potatoes.

Evelyn called the children to dinner.

"Mmm, it smells amazing! I'm starving..." Isabella rubbed her belly dramatically.

Evelyn tapped her daughter's nose playfully. "Then eat up tonight."

"Isn't Daddy joining us?" Alexander asked between bites.

Evelyn glanced at the clock. It was getting late.

She shook her head. "He's busy with work. Be good and finish your food."

Dinner was unusually quiet. The twins ate without complaint, their eyelids growing heavy.

Afterward, Evelyn bathed them, tucked them into bed, and smoothed their hair.

"Goodnight," she whispered.

They murmured sleepy replies, their identical faces peaceful in the dim light.

Evelyn traced their soft cheeks, smiling faintly. These two were proof of the love she once shared with the man of her dreams.

But as the hours ticked by with no sign of Dominic, her smile faded.

Soft classical music filled the upscale restaurant, a favorite spot for couples.

Dominic sat at the table, his tailored Armani suit and sharp features exuding an air of effortless power.

The angled lighting cast intriguing shadows across his face.

Vivienne picked at her foie gras, struggling to hide her infatuation. "Now that Alexander and Isabella are older, have you considered pursuing a relationship, Mr. Blackwood?"

Dominic leaned back, studying her. "I didn't realize my personal life interested you, Ms. Laurent."

She forced a light laugh. "Age changes priorities. Work used to be everything, but now I value relationships more. You're an exceptional man. What kind of woman would be your ideal match?"

In all her years working for him, Dominic had kept his private life fiercely guarded.

Public appearances were rare. Romantic entanglements? Nonexistent.

She'd once assumed he simply wasn't interested—until she learned about the twins.

The discovery had stunned and infuriated her. Worse, the mother remained a mystery.

But Dominic wasn't married. That left the door open.

And Vivienne intended to walk through it.

As Dominic considered her question, Evelyn's face flashed in his mind.

"About five-foot-five. Straight black hair. Big eyes. Fair skin. Quiet demeanor."

Vivienne's stomach dropped.

At five-eight with curly hair and an assertive personality, she was the opposite of everything he'd described.

Years ago, his answer had been different—he'd wanted a driven, ambitious partner.

She'd molded herself into that woman. Now, his preferences had shifted.

It enraged her.

She was beautiful, wealthy, capable. No one was better suited for him.

Yet as he spoke, his gaze softened in a way she'd never seen before.

It made her want to destroy something.

Five-foot-five. Straight black hair. Big eyes. Fair skin.

The description fit only one person: Evelyn.

Vivienne kept eating, her expression neutral. But her grip on the fork tightened, betraying her fury.

Evelyn...

I won't let anyone stand in my way.

Later, as Dominic's car passed a convenience store, Vivienne spoke up. "Could we stop? I need to pick something up."

Though eager to get home, Dominic signaled the driver to pull over.

Vivienne hurried inside, returning moments later with a small black bag.

The car resumed its journey, dropping her off before continuing to the estate.

Unnoticed beneath the seat: a crumpled pair of black lace panties, price tag torn off.
###Chapter 263

Dominic finally came home late that night.

As he pushed open the bedroom door, the peaceful sight of Evelyn sleeping with their twins greeted him.

Both children were snugly tucked beneath the covers.

Evelyn wore a silk nightgown, her ivory limbs peeking out from the blanket. Her cheeks looked irresistibly soft...

Dominic couldn't resist pinching those cheeks, waking her instantly.

Evelyn blinked sleepily, her eyes resembling a newborn deer's.

The sight of her innocent yet seductive appearance made Dominic's stomach tighten.

"You're back." Evelyn rubbed her eyes.

Dominic pulled her into an embrace, pressing a gentle kiss to her forehead. "I'll shower. Go back to sleep."

He tucked the blanket around her like a child. "You're grown but still kick off covers. What if you get sick?"

Evelyn opened her mouth to speak, but he silenced her with another kiss before disappearing into the bathroom.

She stared after him, conflicted.

In her palm lay a single brown hair she'd plucked from his shoulder during their hug.

Had he noticed?

The strand taunted her - straight and black her hair was, but this was curly and brown.

Clearly not hers.

'Vivienne Laurent's?'

Dominic emerged minutes later, efficient as always.

A towel hung low on his hips, nothing else.

Evelyn couldn't look away.

The man was perfection - wealthy, devastatingly handsome, with a sculpted physique that drove women wild.

Not an ounce of fat, just lean muscle that rippled with each movement.

Those powerful legs carried him across the room barefoot, water still glistening in his hair.

No wonder women threw themselves at him...

To Dominic, Evelyn was equally mesmerizing.

Makeup-free in her pajamas, she possessed a unique allure.

"Dry my hair for me." He could've done it himself but wanted her touch.

Dominic's hair felt soft between her fingers.

The twins had inherited his texture.

Though winter chilled outside, the heater dried his hair quickly.

Dominic noticed Evelyn's unusual behavior. "What's wrong?" he asked, frowning.

Even expression-challenged Dominic could read her mood.

Their eyes met, easing some tension.

Evelyn turned away, restless.

'Dinner with Vivienne took hours. No explanation?'

Perhaps innocent, but how would he explain the hair?

When she remained silent, Dominic scooped her up, turned off the light, and pulled her close.

Evelyn lay awake all night, doubts creeping in...

Next morning, Dominic had already left. The twins still slept.

His scent on the sheets proved he'd been there.

A note on the nightstand caught her eye:

"Business trip to Western Europe. Sorry to miss breakfast with you and the kids. Will return ASAP. Love you."

The words soothed her slightly.

She must keep faith.

At breakfast, Evelyn set the table with the children's favorites.

She stared at her untouched plate.

"Mommy, eat with us!" Isabella tugged her arm, concerned.

Evelyn mechanically spooned oatmeal into her mouth.

Alexander and Isabella exchanged worried glances.

After breakfast, Sebastian arrived to drive the twins to school.

Today he came in a Porsche. The children climbed in with their backpacks.

Evelyn, not ready for work, asked to ride along.

As she opened the car door, Isabella gasped. "Mommy! My English textbook - did I leave it in Daddy's Bentley? It's green. I need it today!"

Ever the forgetful child. Evelyn sighed and went to search.

Dominic owned multiple cars.

The Bentley referred to yesterday's ride with Vivienne.

Sebastian handed her the key.

No book in front. Between back seats, she found it.

As she turned to leave, something black beneath the seat caught her eye.

Curious, she reached...

Her heart stopped.

A pair of women's lace panties.

Evelyn trembled, face draining of color as she stared at the intimate garment.

If Vivienne's hair on his shoulder raised questions...

How would he explain this?

Panties didn't just appear in cars without reason.
###Chapter 264

Dominic dropped the twins at school before heading to T Corporation.

Evelyn sat silently in the backseat. The window was down, letting the icy wind whip against her face.

The biting air stung her porcelain skin. The pain helped clear her foggy mind.

Sebastian glanced at her through the rearview mirror. "It's freezing today, Ms. Sinclair. Mr. Blackwood will have my head if you get sick."

Evelyn shook her head without responding. She closed her eyes.

Sebastian studied her exhausted expression. Had she fought with the boss?

Unlikely.

After years as Dominic's right-hand man, he knew Evelyn's importance. Dominic cherished her above all else. Why would they argue?

Meanwhile, at the luxury mall.

Beatrice Lockwood strutted through the designer boutiques in a white mink coat, two shopping bags weighing down her arms. Her wealthy companions, Winifred Ashford and Marjorie Worthington, trailed behind.

The bags overflowed with designer purchases.

Shopping ranked second only to spa treatments in Beatrice's hobbies. After years of poverty, she relished spending lavishly.

She'd clawed her way into the Blackwood family using her beauty and cunning. First seducing Edmund Blackwood, then leveraging her son's position to become his legal wife.

Who cared if she'd been the mistress?

Susan Armstrong's existence meant nothing now.

She'd secured her place in the Blackwood dynasty. Her son controlled T Corporation. She'd won.

With Robert Sinclair dead, her final obstacle had vanished. Every ruthless choice had been worth it.

Then her credit card declined.

"Try again!" Beatrice slammed the card on the counter. "This is impossible!"

Luke had imposed spending limits. Ten million monthly - once gone, no more.

Beatrice always burned through it quickly. This month was no exception.

Winifred sneered at the clerk. "Do you know who you're dealing with? This is Mrs. Blackwood!"

Marjorie added, "A lowly salesgirl daring to embarrass Mrs. Blackwood? Do you want to lose your job?"

The clerk trembled. "Your total is $1,049,000. The system shows you've exceeded your limit."

Beatrice called Sebastian, demanding he contact finance.

"I'll need Mr. Blackwood's approval," he replied.

"Useless!" She hung up.

Dominic's phone was off.

Nearby, Lillian Prescott observed the scene through oversized sunglasses. She'd researched Dominic's family thoroughly.

Beatrice looked elegant in her fur coat, but Lillian recognized vulgarity beneath the polished surface.

Nothing like her refined adoptive mother Genevieve.

Normally, Lillian would scorn such women. But Beatrice was Dominic's mother - a potential pawn.

"Allow me," Lillian placed her platinum card on the counter. She turned with a dazzling smile. "Mrs. Blackwood? I'm Lillian Prescott. Dominic and I work together on his perfume line."

Winifred whispered, "Her father's Jonathan Prescott - the Provincial Secretary."

Beatrice's demeanor shifted instantly. "Darling, you're even lovelier in person! I'll have Dominic reimburse you."

"Please, it's nothing." Lillian waved it off. "Consider it a gift."

After token protests, Beatrice accepted.

"You're stunning, dear. Surely you're taken?" Beatrice probed.

Lillian feigned shyness. "I've been focused on my career."

"No boyfriend? You'd make the perfect daughter-in-law!" Beatrice joked.

Winifred chimed in, "They'd make a striking couple."

Marjorie added, "If only my son were older..."

The flattery flowed. Lillian basked in it, blushing at the mention of matching with Dominic.

Beatrice beamed. Marrying Dominic to the Provincial Secretary's daughter would elevate her status further.

Unlike that commoner Evelyn, Lillian had breeding. Maybe she could pry Dominic away from that gold-digger.

"You must visit me," Beatrice insisted. "I get so lonely."

"Of course," Lillian agreed sweetly.

As Beatrice left with her friends, Lillian's smile turned calculating.

Dominic's materialistic mother would be easy to manipulate. With Beatrice's support and her own charms, winning Dominic seemed inevitable.
###Chapter 265

Evelyn couldn't focus all day at work. Her mind kept wandering, leading to multiple mistakes that earned her a stern reprimand from the department head.

"Are you okay? Something's clearly bothering you," Olivia and Abigail had asked during lunch.

She shook her head silently. Some thoughts were too private to share, even with close friends.

She tried reasoning with herself to trust Dominic. But the doubts kept gnawing at her.

Finally giving in, she dialed his number repeatedly. Each time, the same automated response: "The number you have dialed is not in service."

Her stomach dropped like a stone.

Leaving work promptly, Evelyn returned to the penthouse. Even with the twins there, the absence of one person made the home feel incomplete.

Isabella and Alexander ate dinner quietly while Evelyn turned on the TV.

A breaking news segment caught her attention.

There he was - the man from her dreams, appearing on the financial news channel.

"Daddy's on TV!" Isabella squealed, pointing excitedly at the screen.

Alexander kept eating his risotto, though his eyes remained fixed on the television.

Evelyn stared in shock. Dominic looked impeccable in a tailored suit, his chiseled features radiating authority. But his icy demeanor created an intimidating aura that set him apart.

Reporters swarmed around him, firing sharp questions. Dominic maintained perfect composure despite the hostility radiating from his tight lips.

A foreign correspondent with a thick beard asked, "Mr. Blackwood, Regal Restaurants under T Corporation pride themselves on quality. Yet undercover footage shows multiple violations - improper sanitation, substituting dead seafood for live stock, even using recycled oil. How do you respond?"

Dominic's gaze turned glacial. His voice boomed with conviction. "T Corporation's success stems from integrity. I swear on my reputation - we never serve dead seafood. Every Regal location discards expired ingredients immediately. Our vegetable plantation provides only fresh produce. These allegations are baseless rumors!"

The press corps quieted momentarily before another journalist pushed forward. "Your statement contradicts evidence from Meat Locker in Oxford last month - a Regal franchise caught using filtered recycled oil."

Snickers spread through the crowd. The nationalist reporters relished this chance to undermine the foreign chain dominating their market.

All cameras focused on Dominic, waiting for his response. One wrong answer could destroy T Corporation's century-old reputation.

Evelyn's nails dug into her palms. The twins cheered for their father, oblivious to the tension, while she watched anxiously.

Dominic remained unshaken. He glanced at the reporter's badge and smirked. "New Metro Times? Weren't you sued for fake news recently? Your credibility is questionable at best."

The reporter flushed crimson.

Dominic continued smoothly, "Meat Locker ceased being our franchise in March 2016. The termination notice remains on our website. I invite all media to inspect our kitchens openly - no need for undercover theatrics. Our operations are transparent."

His masterful handling left the reporters speechless. Even Evelyn marveled at how effortlessly he controlled the situation.

The Dominic she knew was gentle and refined. This commanding version left her breathless with admiration.

Then her blood ran cold.

Standing beside Dominic was Vivienne Laurent.
###Chapter 266

The screen showed Vivienne Laurent impeccably dressed. Her signature curls cascaded down her back, accentuating her professional demeanor.

Beside Dominic Blackwood, they appeared as the perfect power couple.

Dominic's piercing gaze met the camera head-on. His composed responses cut through the reporters' aggressive questioning. "T Corporation's restaurants maintain impeccable standards, as evidenced by FDA records. The issues at Regal Chain appear orchestrated. We're investigating whether this stems from natural causes or deliberate sabotage. Once concluded, we'll hold a press conference with full transparency!"

Evelyn Sinclair's brow furrowed.

The food quality scandal plaguing T Corporation's European branches wasn't just about financial losses. It threatened the conglomerate's century-old reputation.

For multinational empires, public trust was everything.

Failure to resolve this could derail their continental expansion plans.

After Dominic, Vivienne fielded questions with razor-sharp precision. Her commanding presence dominated the room. Each rebuttal left journalists speechless.

Renowned for her versatility and tenacity, she mirrored Dominic's professional prowess. Not only did she dismantle accusations, but she masterfully turned scrutiny back on the media.

The press corps murmured in awe, dubbing her "Dominic's most formidable ally."

Evelyn stared blankly at the screen, an unfamiliar pang gripping her chest.

Had she stood beside Dominic now, she couldn't have matched Vivienne's brilliance.

Words weren't Evelyn's forte. Vivienne, however, was legendary - not just for her beauty, but her ruthless efficiency and diplomatic finesse.

For the first time, Evelyn felt inadequate in love.

Perhaps Dominic needed someone who could stride beside him as an equal.

Someone strong. Capable.

Not someone soft like her - who brought no professional advantage, only potential burdens...

"Mommy! Why'd you turn it off? I was watching Daddy!" Isabella's protest snapped Evelyn from her thoughts. She hadn't realized she'd switched off the television.

Scooping up her pouting daughter, she settled them both on the couch. "Daddy's handling business overseas. He'll be home soon. Did you finish dinner?"

Cuddling Isabella grounded her. At least she excelled at motherhood.

The little girl nodded. Though less observant than her twin, she'd noticed her mother's recent distraction.

'Mommy keeps zoning out. Is it because of Daddy?' "Rest tonight, Mommy. Alex and I will clean up," Isabella offered sweetly.

Evelyn ruffled Alexander's hair. "Help your sister play. You can assist me when you're older..."

Her children's thoughtfulness warmed her. But at five, they were too young for chores. Some children had no choice - hers did.

After kissing both twins, she turned their favorite cartoons back on, arranged their toys, then retreated to the kitchen, worries swirling...

Meanwhile, Olivia Kensington stumbled from a karaoke bar, slightly intoxicated. Waving off friends, she waited curbside for a taxi.

A couple's shameless public display caught her eye.

The man was unmistakable - Maxwell Lockwood, the notorious playboy.

His companion wore a Chanel-inspired ensemble with thigh-baring miniskirt despite the chill. What stunned Olivia most was her eerie resemblance to Evelyn.

Had she not known Evelyn would never dress so provocatively, the silhouette could've fooled her.

Oblivious to observers, Maxwell groped the woman while steering her toward a nearby hotel. "Patience, sweetheart. I'll ruin you properly soon..." His vulgar promises mingled with her half-hearted protests.

Original from N?velDrama.Org.

Olivia's lip curled in disgust.

After claiming undying love for Evelyn, here he was debasing her lookalike. Revolting.

She turned to leave when inspiration struck.

Smirking, she trailed the couple inside...
###Chapter 267

Midnight swallowed the city whole in its inky darkness.

The twins had been asleep for hours. Evelyn sat hunched over her laptop, forcing herself to work on designs.

She wasn't in the mood, but she had to keep busy.

The moment she stopped, unwanted thoughts would flood her mind.

Eleven o'clock chimed. Evelyn's eyes burned from staring at the screen too long.

Dominic hadn't called.

She showered mechanically, the hot water doing little to ease her tension. Wrapped in a silk robe, she tried his number again.

Her fingers trembled. That robotic "subscriber unavailable" message haunted her. The line rang endlessly.

Just as she was about to hang up, a woman's voice answered.

"Hello?" The feminine tone dripped with confidence.

Evelyn's throat tightened. She forced her voice steady. "I'm looking for Dominic Blackwood. Is he available?"

"Oh?" The woman laughed lightly. "Dominic's in the shower. Who should I tell him called?"

The phone slipped from Evelyn's numb fingers.

She powered it off like shutting a door on reality. The silk robe suddenly felt too thin despite the heating.

Moonlight painted silver streaks across the floor, mocking her loneliness.

Every promise Dominic had ever made echoed cruelly in her mind. "My phone is always on for you." Lies.

At the penthouse suite, Vivienne smirked at Evelyn's name on the call log. She deleted the record with surgical precision.

Not a single fingerprint out of place.

The bathroom door opened just as she set the phone down. Dominic emerged in a robe, his sculpted frame barely concealed.

His beauty was almost unnatural - sharp jawline, lips redder than sin, eyes like frozen mercury. The man who built an empire with ruthless precision.

Only someone like Vivienne deserved him.

His expression darkened seeing her. "It's midnight. What are you doing here?"

Vivienne tilted her head, letting the silk nightgown slip off one shoulder. "You haven't eaten all day." She gestured to the steaming meal. "Even if not for me, think of T Corporation."

"Not hungry." Dominic's tone cut like glass. "Leave."

He grabbed his phone. Vivienne's nails dug into her palms as he tried calling Evelyn repeatedly.

Each failed attempt made his jaw tighten. He reached for water, found the glass empty, and hurled it against the wall.

The explosion of crystal startled Vivienne. She'd never seen him lose control.

Over that plain little nobody? The jealousy burned like acid.

She poured fresh water with practiced grace. "Problems?"

"Get. Out." Each word was a bullet.

Vivienne's perfect mask cracked. The Laviere heiress wasn't accustomed to being dismissed like staff.

She forced a smile. "Don't stay up too angry." Gathering the shards, she made her exit before he could humiliate her further.

The door clicked shut. Dominic redialed again.

Still no answer. His knuckles turned white around the phone.
###Chapter 268

Olivia trailed behind Maxwell and the woman he carried into the luxury hotel. Her eyes narrowed as she watched them step into the elevator.

The five-star establishment prioritized guest privacy. To get video evidence of Maxwell's infidelity, she had to book the adjacent room at an exorbitant rate.

As Olivia swiped her keycard in the elevator, a drunk man staggered in beside her.

He was massive, wearing a black cap pulled low over his face. Reeking of alcohol, he collapsed against her. Olivia shoved him away violently.

"Ding!" The elevator arrived.

Olivia rushed out, but the drunk grabbed her shirt hem. "Hey sweetheart," he slurred, reaching for her chest.

Furious, Olivia twisted his arm and slammed him into the elevator wall. His cap flew off, revealing sharp, roguish features.

That face looked familiar.

Crouching, Olivia studied him closely. Handsome, but with a scoundrel's smirk.

Then she recognized him.

Preston Worthington Jr. Her childhood nightmare.

Notorious playboy since middle school, changing girlfriends weekly. He'd tormented her for years before moving abroad. She'd thought herself rid of him forever.

Yet here he was - unchanged.

Olivia kicked him several times. Drunk as he was, he'd never know it was her.

Satisfied, she crept toward Room 6617.

Miraculously, the door stood slightly ajar. The couple must have been in too much haste.

Olivia's pulse quickened. Her lawyer had explained - concrete evidence of adultery could force a divorce settlement in her favor.

She wouldn't waste this chance.

Pulling out her phone, she angled it through the door crack.

Maxwell lay sprawled across the king bed, eyes hooded with pleasure. His lips parted in ecstasy as the woman knelt before him, working diligently between his legs.

"Daddy, I want..." the woman cooed.

Maxwell gripped her chin. "Then work harder," he growled.

Just as he moved to pin her down - flash!

Olivia cursed. In her haste, she'd forgotten to disable the camera flash.

She turned to flee, but a vise-like grip seized her neck.

Gasping, she turned to meet Maxwell's predatory grin...

Evelyn tossed restlessly all night, waking at dawn.

Normally she'd sleep in on weekends, but a throbbing headache kept her awake. She kissed her sleeping twins and powered on her phone.

Dozens of missed calls from Dominic.

One text: [Evelyn, swamped yesterday. Sorry I couldn't call. Please don't turn off your phone when I'm away - I worry. Call me when you see this.]

She dropped the phone. Exhausted.

The past two days had left her mind reeling with unfounded suspicions.

Dressed simply in jeans and a tee, she brushed her teeth when her phone rang.

Olivia. The call ended before she could answer. Then a text:

[Evelyn? Room 6617, Yale Hotel. Urgent. Come now.]

Odd. Olivia always called directly unless...

Uneasy, Evelyn tried calling back.

At the hotel, Maxwell lounged on the bed, idly flipping through Olivia's phone. Cigarette smoke curled around his dangerous silhouette.

Seeing Evelyn's call, he declined without hesitation.

He knew her well enough. Meek as she seemed, Evelyn wouldn't ignore a friend in danger. Even suspicious, she'd come running.

The thought pleased him.

Stubbing out his cigarette, he headed to the bathroom.

En route, Evelyn called repeatedly with no answer. Worried, she proceeded to Yale Hotel.

Arriving at Room 6617, she found the door slightly ajar...
###Chapter 269

Evelyn's suspicions deepened with every step toward the room.

Her pulse raced despite her attempts to remain composed.

Two sharp knocks echoed through the door before a familiar male voice growled, "Enter."

The moment she pushed open the door, acrid cigarette smoke assaulted her senses, tightening the knot in her stomach.

Her eyes darted around the empty space. No sign of Olivia. Just as she turned to leave, an iron grip yanked her backward. The door slammed shut with finality.

Her heart stopped when she saw Maxwell.

"Did you send that text from Olivia's phone?" Evelyn demanded, fury lacing every word. "What game are you playing?"

Maxwell's laughter sent chills down her spine. He seized her chin, forcing their faces closer.

Evelyn reacted instantly - her palm flew toward his face, but he caught her wrist effortlessly.

His gaze raked over her body appreciatively. His thumb traced slow circles on her inner wrist, making her skin crawl.

When she raised her other arm, he tsked disapprovingly.

"Must you always be so violent?" His finger pressed against her lips. "Behave. Aren't you curious about your dear friend's whereabouts? Cooperate, and I might share... details."

Evelyn glared through her disgust. "Do you enjoy prison that much?"

His sneer didn't waver. Ignoring her threat, he leaned in again.

She twisted away. Maxwell's grip turned vicious, fingers digging into her jawbone.

Though physically overpowered, Evelyn refused to beg. Her eyes burned with hatred. "Leave Olivia out of this. She's innocent."

Maxwell's laughter turned dark. "Your choice - spread your legs or watch something unpleasant happen to your friend."

"You're sick!" Her entire body trembled.

He forced her chin up, their gazes locked in silent battle.

"Still playing the chaste widow?" he mocked. "How many times has Dominic had you? I'm your lawful husband - those rights belong to me."

His expression turned feral, fingers tightening dangerously.

Evelyn spat in his face.

In retaliation, his mouth crashed against hers - brutal, punishing. When she tried to bite, he pulled back abruptly.

She scrubbed her lips raw.

Without warning, he hurled her onto the massive bed. Before she could react, his weight pinned her down.

Her screams filled the room. "This is rape! I'll have you arrested!"

Maxwell inhaled her scent greedily. "Three years married. About time you acted like a wife."

"We're getting divorced! Dominic will destroy you!" The words slipped out before she could stop them.

His entire body tensed. "Dominic?" The name dripped venom. "That thief stole what was mine!"

Fabric tore as he ripped at her clothes. "Mention divorce again, and I'll snap your pretty neck."

Evelyn fought like a wildcat - scratching, kicking, biting. But his strength overwhelmed her.

As his fingers traced her collarbone, she went terrifyingly still.

Tears carved paths through her makeup. The hatred in her eyes extinguished his arousal.

Disgusted, he rolled away and lit a cigarette. The silence stretched as smoke curled between them.

Finally, he tossed his phone at her. "Your precious friend."

The screen showed Olivia gagged and terrified, surrounded by leering men. Her clothes hung in tatters.

Evelyn's scream lodged in her throat. The phone clattered to the floor.

"You're a monster." The words came out strangled.

Maxwell merely smirked and took another drag.
###Chapter 270

Evelyn's hands shook with barely contained fury. She clenched her fists until her nails dug into her palms, forcing herself to breathe through the rage.

"Leave innocent people out of this, Maxwell. Olivia has nothing to do with our problems. Let her go."

Her voice trembled despite her efforts to remain composed.

Maxwell crushed his cigarette in the ashtray, his cold gaze locking onto hers. "Simple solution, Evelyn. Withdraw the divorce petition."

"You're despicable!" The words tore from her throat.

Maxwell merely smirked. "You knew what kind of man I was when you married me. I always get what I want."

He leaned closer, his breath hot against her ear. "That man in the video? Preston Worthington Jr. of the Worthington empire. Vicious temper, especially when humiliated. Your dear friend kicked him while he was drunk. Imagine what he'll do when he sobers up."

Evelyn's blood ran cold.

"I happen to be close with Preston," Maxwell continued. "One word from me could determine whether your friend walks away with bruises... or in a body bag. Your choice."

Her throat constricted. "Anything but canceling the divorce. Name your price."

Maxwell's fingers traced her collarbone, making her skin crawl. "My price? You. Right here, right now."

Evelyn recoiled as if burned.

He grabbed her wrist, pulling her against him. "No need to rush the divorce. You'll remain my wife until I say otherwise. That's your destiny."

"This is madness!" Evelyn wrenched free. "A loveless marriage is like holding water in your hands - no matter how tight you grip, it slips away. Why chain us both to this misery?"

"Because I enjoy watching you struggle," Maxwell purred. "Your resistance makes the eventual surrender sweeter."

"You're sick! Life's too short to waste on someone who'll never love you!"

His grip tightened. "I'll make you love me."

"Never!" She spat the word like poison.

Maxwell's expression darkened. He seized her chin. "Then say goodbye to Olivia. Permanently."

Defeat crashed over Evelyn like a tidal wave. Her chest ached with suppressed sobs. Each breath felt like inhaling shards of glass.

She was drowning, dragged deeper into this nightmare with no lifeline in sight.

Her heart pounded - the only proof she still lived.

What could she possibly do?

Meanwhile, the twins had dressed themselves and curled up on the sofa watching cartoons. They'd found their mother's note about running errands and behaved like perfect little adults.

The doorbell chimed.

"Is that Mommy?" Isabella asked, her sleep-tousled hair sticking up in adorable tufts.

Alexander dragged a stool to the door and peered through the peephole. "It's Uncle Victor!"

He opened the door after confirming the visitor's identity - just as their mother had taught them.

Victor Langley stepped inside, immediately engulfed by a tiny tornado named Isabella. "Uncle Victor!"

"You're getting too heavy for me, little princess," Victor teased, hefting the giggling girl.

Isabella pouted. "Mommy's cooking is too yummy!"

Victor smiled. Evelyn had brought light back into these children's lives. Where they'd once been solemn beyond their years, now they glowed with childish joy.

"Did you bring presents?" Isabella blinked up at him with Dominic Blackwood's trademark calculating gaze.

Victor pretended to think. "Hmm... I might have forgotten..."

The pout returned full force - until he produced a glittering tiara from his pocket.

Isabella squealed and raced to admire her new treasure.

Victor turned to the quiet boy still seated like a miniature gentleman. "Brought you something from Canada," he said, handing Alexander an intricate puzzle. "Where's Miss Evelyn?"

Before Alexander could answer, the door swung open.

Evelyn stood there, her face ashen...
###Chapter 271

Evelyn froze in shock when she spotted Victor Langley lounging on her sofa.

The renowned attorney looked every inch the elite professional in his tailored navy suit, gold-rimmed glasses perched on his aristocratic nose. "Good morning, Ms. Sinclair," he greeted with a polished smile.

Isabella came skipping over, twirling to show off a new hairclip. "Look Mommy! Uncle Victor gave me this! Isn't it pretty?"

The child's joy did nothing to lift Evelyn's heavy heart.

She forced a smile as she scooped Isabella into her arms. "Absolutely stunning. My beautiful girl deserves all the prettiest things."

Giggles filled the room as Isabella planted a wet kiss on Evelyn's cheek. "Love you mostest, Mommy!"

Alexander remained sprawled on the couch, flipping channels with disinterest. He rolled his eyes at his sister's antics. "So dramatic," he muttered under his breath.

Victor observed the domestic scene with fascination. The children's easy affection toward Evelyn surprised him. These weren't ordinary kids - they'd seen through countless gold-diggers' ploys to win their father's favor through them.

Yet here they were, treating Evelyn like their birth mother. Remarkable.

Evelyn gave Victor a stiff nod, her smile vanishing. "Good morning, Mr. Langley."

She knew exactly who she was dealing with. Victor Langley had made headlines defending the impossible - taking on the wealthy rapists who'd murdered that poor girl in Loughton when no other lawyer dared.

"Ms. Sinclair, I'd like to speak privately," Victor adjusted his glasses when Evelyn's attention drifted.

"Darlings, Mommy needs to talk with Uncle Victor. Alexander, help your sister with that new puzzle. I've got a surprise for you both later." Evelyn ruffled their hair before sending them off.

She poured tea with trembling hands, knowing what was coming.

Victor produced documents from his briefcase. "The paperwork is ready. To file, you'll need your ID, marriage certificate, and any property division requests. The court will then serve Maxwell and schedule a hearing date. Everything's outlined here."

Evelyn stared blankly. "What are my chances?"

"One hundred percent." Victor's confidence wasn't arrogance - just fact. "I don't lose."

Her fingers shook as she touched the papers. After a long silence, she met his gaze. "Thank you, but... I won't be proceeding with the divorce."

Victor's glasses nearly slipped off. This made no sense - Evelyn had been desperate to end this marriage. And Dominic? The man would never tolerate his woman belonging to another.

"May I ask why? Does Dominic know about this?" Victor studied her carefully. Something was very wrong.

Evelyn's voice cracked despite her calm facade. "My decision. Nothing to do with Dominic. I just... need more time."

Victor gathered his files. "Very well. Contact me if you change your mind."

The moment the door closed, Evelyn's composure shattered. A storm of emotions she'd been suppressing came crashing down.

Then - BANG! BANG! BANG! - someone was kicking her door.

Evelyn opened it to find Beatrice Lockwood, Dominic's mother, dressed in head-to-toe designer wear.

"You? Why are you—" Evelyn gasped, immediately blocking the doorway, thinking of the children.
###Chapter 272

Evelyn glared at Beatrice with undisguised contempt as the older woman barged into the living room. The designer handbag landed carelessly on the couch like discarded trash.

Her sharp eyes scanned the room like a predator hunting for prey.

Dominic was nowhere in sight. Undeterred, she marched toward the bathroom to investigate.

"You have no right to be here," Evelyn blocked her path, voice icy. "Leave immediately."

Beatrice's gaze fell upon a pair of men's slippers beside two smaller ones near the shower. Her face twisted in fury.

She jabbed a manicured finger at Evelyn's face. "You shameless harlot! Married to Maxwell yet seducing my son? And now you've brainwashed my grandchildren too? No wonder Alexander and Isabella disappeared from our estate!"

Evelyn trembled at the venomous words.

The children were just in the bedroom - they might overhear this vile confrontation. "I won't engage with you today. If you came looking for trouble, you're not welcome here."

She knew Beatrice was her father's ex-wife, but felt no familial connection whatsoever.

Beatrice's rage escalated. "Robert's daughter indeed! Not only do you flaunt your affair, you dare dismiss your own mother? You know Dominic is your half-brother yet you cling to him like some cheap-"

Evelyn remained eerily calm, her dark eyes reflecting Beatrice's hysterics with detached amusement.

This only fueled Beatrice's anger further. She raised her hand, ready to strike.

Then Evelyn spoke, voice steady. "I'm tolerating this intrusion only out of respect for my father's past relationship with you. But make no mistake - you are not my mother."

Beatrice froze mid-swing. "What nonsense is this?"

"Look at us," Evelyn gestured between them. "Our features, our temperaments - completely dissimilar. Are you certain I'm your biological daughter?"

Beatrice's expression flickered with something unreadable. "Of course you are! Who else would-"

"Look me in the eyes and say that," Evelyn challenged, her piercing stare unwavering.

"You... you are my daughter," Beatrice insisted, but her gaze darted involuntarily to the right.

A sudden, relieved smile broke across Evelyn's face.

"What are you smiling at?" Beatrice demanded, unnerved.

"I took psychology electives in university," Evelyn explained calmly. "When people lie, their eyes shift right as the brain fabricates excuses. You just confirmed what I suspected - you're not my biological mother."

Beatrice gaped like a fish out of water.

"You're bluffing!" she finally spluttered. "We can do a DNA test if you don't believe me!"

Her nails dug into Evelyn's wrist. "Stay away from Dominic! Be content as Maxwell's wife instead of chasing after my son like some common-"

The bedroom door creaked open.

"Grandma!" Isabella's cheerful voice interrupted. "We heard you! Did you come to visit us?"

Alexander added, "Mommy takes very good care of us."

Beatrice's rage momentarily softened at the children's appearance - until she processed Alexander's words.

"Mommy?" she repeated, voice dangerously low. "How dare you let them call you that, you scheming-"

Her hand raised again, but the twins' presence stayed the blow. The battle lines were drawn, and the war had only just begun.
###Chapter 273

Evelyn Sinclair drew a sharp breath. She refused to lose her composure in front of her grandchildren. "Don't let this woman fool you, my darlings. She's wicked through and through, a heartless seductress. Be good children and come home with Grandma. Your Great-Grandfather misses you terribly..."

The words sliced through Evelyn's heart like shards of glass. Beatrice Lockwood had just vilified her in front of her own children.

Before she could respond, Isabella suddenly turned toward the older woman.

"You look lovelier than ever, Grandma. My teacher says anger makes people ugly, so please don't be cross. I want you to stay beautiful forever," Isabella cooed while diligently massaging Beatrice's legs.

Beatrice chuckled at the child's words, her demeanor softening visibly. "What a little charmer you are! Have you been sneaking sweets again?"

Isabella counted on her tiny fingers with exaggerated concentration. "One... two... three... Oh dear, I've lost count! But it was lots and lots."

"You impudent little thing," Beatrice murmured affectionately, planting a kiss on the girl's cheek.

Meanwhile, Alexander selected a Valencia orange from the fruit basket, peeled it with care, and offered it to his grandmother. "This is very sweet, Grandma. You'll like it."

"My thoughtful boy," Beatrice praised, accepting the fruit and ruffling his hair. She'd always favored the grandson who bore such striking resemblance to her son.

"Please don't be angry with Mother, Grandma," Alexander continued earnestly. "This was our idea. If anyone should be scolded, it's Isabella and me." He bowed his head in readiness for reprimand.

Evelyn's anger dissipated like mist before sunlight.

Her children were deliberately charming Beatrice to shield her from the older woman's wrath. The realization filled Evelyn with bittersweet emotion.

Beatrice found herself disarmed despite her lingering resentment toward Evelyn. She would never discipline her beloved grandchildren, though her dislike for their mother remained unchanged.

Setting aside the half-eaten orange, Beatrice grasped both children's hands. "This isn't your home. Come back to Blackwood Manor with me. Your Great-Grandfather hasn't slept properly since you've been away."

"I won't go!" Isabella declared with unexpected defiance, struggling against Beatrice's grip. "I want to stay with Mother!"

Beatrice's patience snapped. Favoring boys over girls, she'd always indulged Alexander but couldn't tolerate disobedience from her granddaughter.

Three sharp smacks landed on Isabella's backside. "How dare you disobey me! This isn't your home! Must you provoke me? We're leaving now—no arguments!"

The delicate child couldn't withstand such force. Never before struck by her grandmother, Isabella burst into heartbroken sobs. "I... I hate you, Grandma!"

When Beatrice raised her hand again, Evelyn intervened.

"This is my home, Madam Lockwood," Evelyn stated coldly, positioning herself between Beatrice and her weeping daughter. "You've no right to discipline my child here. Look how hard you've struck her! Get out—now!"

With that, Evelyn forcibly escorted Beatrice out and slammed the door shut, ignoring the woman's outraged protests until the furious footsteps finally retreated.

Inside, Isabella's cries echoed through the house. Evelyn examined the angry red marks on her daughter's tender skin, her hatred for Beatrice intensifying.

How could any grandmother be so cruel? The incident reinforced Evelyn's fears—if she couldn't secure her divorce from Maxwell and Dominic remarried, who would protect her children from a potentially wicked stepmother?

Meanwhile, at T Corporation's Western Europe headquarters...

The executive conference room, styled in medieval opulence with polished oak furnishings blending classical and modern elements, housed the region's nervous leadership team. All eyes were fixed apprehensively on the imposing figure in the CEO's chair.

Dominic Blackwood sat ramrod straight, his hawk-like gaze dissecting each attendee. The rhythmic tapping of his fingers on the tabletop seemed to synchronize with the pounding hearts of his subordinates.

Though young, Dominic's formidable intellect and ruthless business acumen had propelled Regal Restaurants to industry dominance. His 200 IQ served equally well in financial calculations and psychological assessments.

Beside him, the equally formidable Vivienne Laurent observed the proceedings with quiet intensity.

Dominic's voice cut through the tension. "Regal is an international powerhouse under constant media scrutiny. This colossal failure demands accountability. Mr. Caldwell, Mr. Harrison—as regional heads, what explanations do you offer?"

The two middle-aged executives exchanged uneasy glances before composing themselves.

Richard Caldwell, the regional manager, spoke first. "This was unforeseeable, Mr. Blackwood. Before our PR team could respond, the media had already run the story. Clearly this is sabotage by Clos Maggior—our fiercest competitor! Adrian Moreau has always resented Regal's dominance. This reeks of his underhanded tactics!"

Samuel Harrison, his deputy, offered a contrasting response. "The fault lies with us, Mr. Blackwood. I accept full responsibility for the company's losses and await your judgment."

Dominic took a slow drag from his cigarette, his icy gaze flickering between the two men as he assessed their vastly different reactions...
###Chapter 274

"P-Please give us another chance, Mr. Blackwood! We swear this will never happen again!" Samuel Harrison's forehead glistened with cold sweat as Dominic's piercing gaze locked onto him. He prayed for mercy.

But Richard Caldwell's expression twisted with arrogance.

A staunch nationalist, he refused to believe this foreigner could do anything to him.

Not only was he the general manager—he was also the head chef.

His culinary skills were unmatched. Viva Corporation would suffer without him!

Against all expectations, Dominic stated coolly, "Apologies, Mr. Caldwell, but Viva no longer requires your services. Pack your things and leave."

"What? After three years of loyal service, this is how you repay me? You dare fire me, you filthy outsider?" Richard's face darkened with rage. He slammed the table and hurled insults.

The other executives sat frozen, not daring to breathe.

Has Richard lost his mind? Insulting the CEO?

Does he have a death wish? Doesn’t he know Mr. Blackwood’s nickname is the Ice King?

Vivienne Laurent watched Richard like he was already a corpse.

Dominic’s gaze sharpened, sending a chill down Richard’s spine.

A mocking smile curled Dominic’s lips. "You’re no rookie, Richard. With your experience, no one would believe you couldn’t handle this minor PR crisis. I’d give you a chance—if this were just a PR issue. But you’re on Viva’s payroll while secretly working for La Belle Époque. Stealing trade secrets. Sabotaging our reputation. Why should Viva keep a traitor like you?"

Richard’s face flushed crimson. "Lies! This is slander, Dominic Blackwood!"

Dominic blew a smoke ring into Richard’s face, making his eyes water.

With a flick of his hand, the screen displayed damning footage—Richard accepting bribes from La Belle Époque’s owner, handing over confidential recipes.

The video was grainy, but Richard’s face and voice were unmistakable.

His blood drained away.

This foreigner had uncovered his years of espionage in mere days. Terrifying.

Richard dropped to his knees. "I’m sorry, Mr. Blackwood! I’ll never—"

Dominic cut him off with a cold laugh. "Mr. Caldwell, you’re accused of corporate espionage. The courts will decide your fate."

The doors swung open. Police officers marched in, handcuffs ready. "Richard Caldwell, you’re under arrest for industrial theft. Come quietly."

Richard thrashed but was swiftly subdued and dragged away.

Dominic turned to Samuel, whose face was still pale. "The GM position is vacant, Mr. Harrison. You’ll act as interim GM. Make it permanent—if you perform."

Samuel gaped.

He’d failed. Why wasn’t he being punished? Why a promotion?

Dominic stubbed out his cigarette. "Everyone makes mistakes. You get one chance to redeem yourself—if you don’t cross the line."

He knew foreigners faced hostility here. Firing both managers would breed rebellion.

Punishing one, sparing the other—fear and loyalty, perfectly balanced.

The executives exchanged glances, respect dawning.

Vivienne watched Dominic hungrily.

After the meeting, only Dominic remained, scrolling through his phone.

No calls. No texts from Evelyn.

His chest tightened with frustration.

She was angry.

Phone explanations wouldn’t cut it. He’d have to spoil her in person.

Vivienne approached, confidence oozing.

She’d conquer this man’s heart.

She imagined his proposal.

"The PR crisis is nearly resolved," she purred. "We’ll hold a press conference soon to clear Viva’s name. You’ve been working so hard, Mr. Blackwood. A friend owns a luxury spa nearby. Care to join me?"

Dominic didn’t even glance up.

Vivienne took his silence as assent. Thrilled, she stacked files clumsily—then tripped.

Her ankle twisted. She crashed into the table’s edge, barely feeling the pain.

Too giddy to care.

Then Dominic’s icy voice shattered her fantasy. "Ms. Laurent, book the earliest flight back to A City. Now."

She blinked. "But Mr. Blackwood, aren’t we—"

"I won’t repeat myself."

He stood by the window, brooding.

Vivienne’s smile died. "Yes, sir."

She rushed out, heart sinking as she arranged the flight.

Dominic clenched his phone.

No word from Evelyn.

She was definitely furious.

Phone apologies were useless.

He’d have to pamper her senseless.
###Chapter 275

Across the ocean, Lillian Prescott located Maxwell Lockwood in a dimly lit bar. He was slumped over the counter, surrounded by empty bottles. With a disgusted sigh, she yanked him away from the drunken crowd.

"Is this what you've been reduced to? The great Maxwell Lockwood, drowning his sorrows like some pathetic loser?" Lillian snatched the whiskey glass from his hand and smashed it against the wall.

Maxwell's bloodshot eyes burned with fury. "Get the hell out of here! My life is none of your damn business!"

Lillian's jaw tightened. As Jonathan Prescott's daughter, no one dared speak to her like that.

She clenched her fists, then forced herself to relax. "I'm not here to fight, Maxwell. You claim to love Evelyn, yet here you are wallowing in self-pity instead of fighting for her?"

Earlier, Beatrice Lockwood had called her for a shopping date.

Lillian had agreed, hoping to curry favor with Dominic's mother.

But Beatrice had revealed shocking news - Evelyn was manipulating Dominic, refusing to let him go.

"That shameless woman! Married to you yet clinging to my son!" Beatrice had spat.

The revelation ignited Lillian's hatred.

Dominic belonged to her. Any woman near him was her enemy.

That's why she sought out Maxwell.

Drunk and belligerent, Maxwell sneered, "What do you know? Evelyn will crawl back to me. I'm holding her precious Olivia hostage. She'll obey my every command!"

Lillian's eyes gleamed with sudden inspiration. Leaning close, she whispered something that made Maxwell's dull gaze sharpen with cruel anticipation.

He immediately dialed Evelyn's number. "Want to see Olivia alive again? Meet me in Room 6617 tonight. Satisfy me, and I'll grant your divorce. Refuse... and those brutes will have their way with her."

Evelyn's face drained of color. The phone slipped from her trembling fingers, clattering to the floor.

Maxwell's words felt like ice water down her spine.

Outside, storm clouds gathered. Rain lashed against the windows like angry fingers trying to claw their way in.

Evelyn sat frozen on her bed, staring at her silent phone. The luxurious silk sheets offered no comfort against the growing dread.

With shaking hands, she tried Dominic's number again. The automated voice mocked her: "The number you have dialed is not in service."

Her heart constricted with bitter despair.

Dominic was her only hope, but he remained unreachable.

Ding! Ding! Ding!

Messages flooded in from "Olivia's" account.

Evelyn's breath hitched as she opened them.

The high-resolution photos showed Olivia naked, her body positioned in degrading angles. The terror in her friend's eyes cut deeper than any blade.

Evelyn fumbled with her phone, nearly dropping it in her panic.

A deafening thunderclap shook the house.

Little Isabella woke screaming, her tiny body trembling as she clung to Evelyn. "Mommy! Mommy!"

Beside her, Alexander remained stiff, his forced calm betrayed by his white-knuckled grip on the sheets.

Evelyn soothed them with lullabies, her heart breaking as Isabella's tear-stained face finally relaxed into sleep. Even unconscious, the child clutched Evelyn's sleeve like a lifeline.

New messages arrived. Evelyn's stomach churned as she opened the videos.

Olivia, pinned beneath a hulking man with a cobra tattoo snaking across his back. His erection pressed against her as she screamed, "Help me, Evelyn! Please!"

The accompanying text read: [30 minutes, Evelyn. No police. Or this is Olivia's last night alive.]

Evelyn gasped for air, tears blurring her vision as she typed her reply: [I'm coming. Don't hurt her.]

Meanwhile, a Boeing WH787 cut through the stormy night sky.

Turbulence rocked the plane violently. Screams erupted from economy class as the aircraft plummeted.

In first class, Dominic remained impassive. His strong fingers traced Evelyn's smiling face in the photo tucked in his wallet.

He'd known about the storm. But nothing would stop him from returning to his angry woman tonight.
###Chapter 276

The clock struck midnight when Evelyn arrived at Room 6617 of the Grand Yale Hotel.

Dominic swung the door open to find Evelyn completely soaked. Her raven hair clung to her face like wet seaweed, her complexion ghostly pale. Despair radiated from her every pore.

"I'm here. Release Olivia now." Her voice trembled.

Dominic's eyes darkened. He yanked Evelyn into a crushing embrace, indifferent to her freezing skin. His thumb traced her quivering lips as he studied her face. "Just as I thought. My wife keeps her promises."

Tears of fury spilled down Evelyn's cheeks. "I came. Let her go!"

"Patience." Dominic gripped her chin, raking his gaze over her drenched form. "I can't have you catching cold. Be a good girl and warm up in the shower."

Like an empty shell, Evelyn shuffled to the bathroom and mechanically washed away the storm's remnants.

Emerging in nothing but a hotel robe, she repeated her demand. "Free Olivia."

Damp tendrils of hair snaked down her back. The hot water had brought no color to her deathly pale face. Her slender frame trembled like a sapling in a gale, her dark eyes devoid of their usual sparkle.

Dominic approached with two crystal glasses of burgundy liquid. "Drink. It'll warm you up."

Evelyn hesitated, suspecting foul play. When Dominic mentioned Olivia again, she gasped.

She snatched the glass. Staring at the blood-red wine swirling inside, she forced herself to swallow the contents in one gulp.

Crimson droplets trickled down the glass like fresh wounds, casting sinister reflections...

A sudden weakness overtook Evelyn. Fire spread through her veins, igniting every nerve ending.

Her knees buckled. Just as she collapsed, Dominic caught her with a triumphant grin.

Evelyn clenched her fists but found no strength. Her flailing arm knocked over a glass on the bedside table.

The drug's effects shocked her system.

Biting her purpling lip hard enough to draw blood, she spat, "Maxwell... you... monster!"

Dominic tossed her onto the bed, stripping down to his boxers.

He loomed over her drugged, hate-filled gaze. "Monster? The night's just beginning." His wicked smile widened.

From the cabinet, he produced a camera, positioning it to capture every angle of Evelyn on the bed.

Realization dawned. She stared at Dominic's vile expression in horror.

She tried to flee but her legs refused. The fire inside burned hotter, tormenting her.

Evelyn felt death approaching.

She writhed on the sheets, one hand clutching her robe while the other scratched at her burning skin.

Her delicate neck arched. The robe gaped, revealing tantalizing curves.

Dominic's control snapped at the sight.

Though experienced with women, he'd never encountered one as simultaneously innocent and alluring as Evelyn.

Pinning her beneath him, he whispered feverishly, "Just once, Evelyn. I'll be gentle. This is my only chance - I'll cherish you more than that bastard Adrian ever could..."

Though the drug ravaged her body, Evelyn bit her tongue until copper flooded her mouth.

Dominic couldn't restrain himself any longer. His lips crashed against hers as he ground against her.

"Adrian, help—" Evelyn's desperate cry was cut short by Dominic's palm.

Just as he prepared to take her, the door exploded inward. Both froze.

Dominic turned to see two silhouettes in the doorway.

The lead figure stood tall and broad-shouldered, his face twisted with hellish rage.

"Adrian..."

Seeing him, Evelyn's terror evaporated.

Adrian stormed forward, his form half-shrouded in amber light.

His fury radiated like an inferno - one wrong move and you'd be reduced to cinders.

His gaze held the savagery of a starved wolf, the vengeance of a hellspawn. The very air around him turned glacial, as if Death himself had arrived.

Even battle-hardened Dominic shrank back.

Sebastian, trailing Adrian, gaped at the scene of Evelyn with his employer's cousin.

Dominic tried to smirk under Adrian's murderous stare. "Cousin! Come to watch me claim my wife? How—"

Adrian moved like lightning. His fist connected with Dominic's jaw before he could finish.

The assault came fast and brutal as a hurricane.

Dominic might've dodged the first blow, but not the relentless barrage that followed.

Protecting Evelyn, he curled around her, taunting Adrian to strike harder.

Veins bulged at Adrian's temples. Every ounce of rage fueled his punishing blows.

How dare Dominic touch what was his?

His piercing gaze catalogued Evelyn's state - the robe barely preserving her modesty, the brutal marks marring her neck.
###Chapter 277

Purple bruises marred Evelyn's delicate arms. Dried blood caked the corner of her swollen lips.

The camera on the nightstand captured every horrifying detail of the bed's twisted scene...

Dominic's fury erupted like a volcano!

His foot connected with Maxwell's ribs, sending the man crashing to the floor before shattering the recording device to pieces.

Maxwell barely registered the pain before Dominic hauled him up like a ragdoll and slammed him against the wall. The sickening crunch of bones echoed through the room.

"Touch her again and I'll end you." Dominic's voice dripped with lethal promise, making even Sebastian and Evelyn flinch.

Evelyn curled into a trembling ball in the corner, fighting both tears and the drug's effects through sheer willpower.

Dominic noted her flushed skin and glassy eyes - clear signs of intoxication. Instead of comforting her, his gaze turned glacial.

Foolish woman, walking straight into the viper's nest. She needed to learn consequences, but not like this.

His expression darkened further seeing the marks on her skin.

"We were just having some marital fun when you attacked me. Ruining my wife's happiness now?" Maxwell spat blood but kept smirking.

Dominic's predatory stare pinned him down. "Blood relation stayed my hand before. Not today."

Each measured step forward made Maxwell's bravado crack. Everyone knew Dominic moved like royalty but fought like a street brawler.

The first kick had already broken ribs. Maxwell wheezed through the pain, unable to rise.

"Starting a family war over some girl?" Maxwell choked out.

Sebastian shook his head. Idiot. Everyone knew Evelyn was Dominic's weakness.

Dominic picked up the broken wine glass, sniffed the residue. "Joyvibe? Turning innocents into desperate whores? Classy."

Maxwell laughed despite his injuries. "Wanted her begging for it. Look at her - practically dripping already. Shame you interrupted before I could—"

A bloodcurdling scream cut him off.

Dominic had driven the glass shard clean through Maxwell's palm, embedding it in the floorboards.

"You bastard!" Maxwell's face contorted in agony.

Evelyn gasped, shock cutting through her haze. He'd impaled his own cousin without hesitation.

This wasn't the controlled businessman she knew. This was something darker.

"Kill me now or I'll kill you later!" Maxwell spat through the pain. "She was mine first!"

Dominic's hand shot out, crushing Maxwell's throat. "Listen well. Evelyn belongs to me. Next time you look at her, I'll bury you. Miss prison? I can arrange a permanent stay."

He discarded Maxwell like trash before scooping Evelyn up effortlessly.

"Sir, his injuries are severe. Should we—" Sebastian started.

Dominic didn't look back. "If he lives, he lives. If he dies? Good riddance."

As consciousness faded, Maxwell watched Dominic carry his prize away. Blood bubbled from his lips before darkness claimed him.
###Chapter 278

Dominic strode toward the parking lot with Evelyn cradled in his arms.

She lay limp against his chest, bundled in his coat with only her flushed face visible. Through the parted fabric, she glimpsed his chiseled features darkened by fury.

His expression was icier than the winter wind outside, making her shiver uncontrollably.

Evelyn's skin burned unnaturally red. She squirmed in his embrace, her movements desperate.

"Dominic..." Her voice cracked like shattered glass.

All pretense of strength had crumbled the moment she saw him.

Tears spilled without warning. She didn't understand why his presence unraveled her, only that she couldn't stop.

The fire inside her contrasted violently with the freezing night air.

Dominic's stormy expression twisted her stomach into knots of unease and hurt...

He marched forward without glancing down, his grip tightening with each step. She could feel his anger building like thunderclouds.

Sebastian opened the car door when they arrived. "Mr. Blackwood, hospital or Ms. Sinclair's residence?"

"I want to go home." Tears streaked Evelyn's cheeks when Dominic remained silent.

His jaw clenched. "Earlston."

The luxury hotel under T Corporation's umbrella.

At nearly 2 AM, Sebastian made record time through empty streets.

Evelyn drifted between consciousness, the drug's effects torturing her. She writhed against Dominic, her body seeking friction against his.

Though not herself, she remained devastatingly alluring. Her scorching skin reminded Dominic exactly what poison ran through her veins.

The memory of Maxwell's vile intentions made his vision swim with rage.

'This reckless woman.'

'She knew Maxwell was dangerous yet walked right into his trap.'

'If I'd been minutes later...'

The thought of Maxwell violating what was his made Dominic's blood boil.

The hotel manager rushed to greet them, eyes widening at the sight of Dominic carrying a woman. Wisely, she held her tongue.

When Dominic dismissed her with a sharp gesture, she retreated instantly.

"Let me go..." Evelyn's hoarse plea barely escaped her parched lips. The drug's torment threatened to consume her.

"Scared now? Too late." Dominic bit her earlobe hard enough to bruise.

His scent flooded her senses. She inhaled greedily, as if he could extinguish the fire within.

Noticing her unconscious reaction, Dominic's lips curled into a cruel smile. "Look at you. I should film this and play it back when you're sober..."

His mockery stung. Evelyn turned away, fresh tears mixing with sweat as agony overwhelmed her.

How could she explain she'd had no choice?

With Nina's life at stake and his phone switched off, what alternative remained?

Dominic mistook her avoidance for guilt. Emotions warred within him.

His smile turned glacial. "Am I not enough for you? A few days apart and you're desperate for another man's bed? I never took you for a whore."

Each word stabbed deeper than any blade. The unfair accusation made her tremble violently.

She met his gaze, disbelief warring with betrayal.

His forehead veins bulged with fury. "Is that what you think of me?" Her voice broke.

In twenty-four years, Dominic had been her only love.

He'd been the starlight piercing her darkness since childhood, planting confidence where insecurity festered.

Every glance, every word from him had become her addiction.

She knew he'd ruin her, yet loved him still.

Now the man she adored spat such venom. Pain crashed over her like a tidal wave.

Masking her anguish, she held his gaze. "Think what you will, but the truth isn't what you imagine."

Dominic's sinister smile widened. His dark eyes gleamed with cruel amusement at her distress.

Leaning close, his breath scorched her ear. "Oh? I saw you beneath Maxwell with my own eyes. Did you enjoy his attention?"

His words branded her soul.

If swords could kill, a loved one's cruel doubt struck deeper.

The drug's fever warped her mind. Humiliation burned hotter than the heat between her thighs as his accusations crushed her spirit.

She fought like a wild thing, fists pounding uselessly against his chest. "Release me! If you believe such lies, why bother? Whatever happens to me is none of your concern!"

Her scream held lifetimes of despair.

The joy of his timely rescue had drowned in this sea of misunderstanding.

Fire within and ice without assaulted her senses. Each struggle only pressed her burning skin tighter against him, driving her closer to madness.

Ding!

The elevator doors parted.

Dominic carried his sobbing, thrashing burden inside without hesitation.

He held her close despite her protests, his expression that of a conqueror claiming spoils...
###Chapter 279

Dominic exited the elevator, his polished shoes clicking against the marble floor as he approached the lavish suite. The retinal scanner beeped in recognition, and the custom-designed lock disengaged with a satisfying click.

"Release me, Dominic..." Evelyn's voice came out hoarse yet strangely alluring, the drugs in her system making every word sound like an invitation.

She fought desperately against the overwhelming urge to throw herself at him, nails digging into her palms as she clung to her last shreds of self-control.

Dominic's lips brushed against Evelyn's ear, his smirk widening when he felt her shiver. "That depends entirely on whether I choose to release you."

Scooping her writhing form into his arms, Dominic carried her into a cavernous chamber.

Instantly, thousands of tiny lights flickered to life, illuminating the space with a soft silver glow that stretched upward to the domed ceiling.

The most breathtaking feature was the ceiling itself - constructed entirely of reinforced glass that revealed the night sky in all its glory.

The full moon hung like a polished mirror amidst countless twinkling stars, each one winking down at them like celestial spectators to their private drama.

Evelyn gasped despite herself, momentarily forgetting her predicament in the face of such beauty. She didn't realize how breathtaking she appeared to the furious man watching her.

"Enjoying the view?" Dominic's deep voice snapped her back to reality.

Evelyn's dark eyes flashed with defiance even as her body betrayed her. She pushed weakly against his chest. "If this is just another way to humiliate me, save your—"

Dominic's expression darkened. With one sharp motion, he tore the flimsy bathrobe from her body and shoved her backward onto the bed.

"Since you're so desperate for a man tonight, perhaps I should oblige."

Evelyn braced for impact, but the plush mattress absorbed her fall completely. Still, she cried out in shock at being so exposed before him.

Despite their previous intimacies, she'd never grown accustomed to this vulnerability. What horrified her more was the wanton moan that escaped her lips instead of protest.

Her skin burned crimson, waves of heat pulsing through her lower abdomen.

'What the hell did Maxwell dose me with?' she thought desperately.

Sweat beaded on her forehead as she curled into herself, torn between hiding her body and begging him to take her. The war within only made her tremble more violently.

Dominic watched as Evelyn's hands moved against her will, caressing her own curves as the drugs obliterated her inhibitions.

Her glistening body arched against the sheets like a flower begging to bloom, every movement designed to torment him.

He could see the exact moment her pupils dilated further, the drugs taking complete control.

Dominic's jaw clenched. As much as the sight aroused him, he needed to relieve her suffering first. Gripping her chin, he forced her to meet his gaze.

"Look at you. No wonder Maxwell refuses to let you go."

"Dominic, you—"

Her retort dissolved into panting breaths, unable to form coherent words through the fire consuming her.

Every nerve ending screamed for relief, for his touch. The agony was unbearable.

Finally, Dominic lifted her again—only to dump her unceremoniously into a massive oval bathtub.

The warm water only intensified her feverish need. She thrashed, trying to escape the torturous heat.

Rose petals floated on the surface, their fragrance overwhelming her heightened senses. Just as she thought she'd go mad, a crisp, clean scent cut through the floral notes.

Dominic emptied an entire bottle of body wash into the water with ruthless efficiency.

"Wash. I won't tolerate another man's scent on you."

His words stabbed through Evelyn's haze. So he did care that another had touched her.

Tears welled in her eyes, mixing with the bathwater as humiliation warred with anger.

If he already thought her filthy, why bother defending herself?

"Since you've already decided I'm some cheap whore, Dominic, why pretend? Yes, I sold my body. Yes, I bore children for money. But you? You're just the rich bastard who paid for it. Don't pretend you're any better."

She met his furious gaze head-on, refusing to cower beneath his judgment.

Dominic stilled at her words. Kneeling beside the tub, he studied her water-reddened skin.

"Evelyn Sinclair, you became mine the moment I bought you. Any man who touches you won't live to regret it." The possessiveness in his tone sent shivers down her spine.

Evelyn swallowed her tears, closing her eyes. "So I've always been just purchased goods to you. Thank you for the clarification, Mr. Blackwood. I overestimated my worth."

Dominic's control snapped when she used his formal name.

No one could provoke him like this infuriating woman.

The sight of those damn kiss marks on her skin pushed him over the edge.

Shoving her under the water, he began scrubbing her skin roughly with his calloused hands, determined to erase every trace of another man's touch.
###Chapter 280

Evelyn gasped as Dominic's rough movements sent waves of pain through her body.

Her pale skin flushed pink under his touch.

Dominic's icy gaze burned into her. He needed to erase every trace of another man from her skin.

When he finally lifted her from the bathtub, she was still coughing up water, her body as red as a boiled lobster.

Without a word, he carried her toward the floor-to-ceiling window.

Their suite occupied the penthouse level. The city stretched below them, glittering like scattered jewels against the night sky.

An elegant recliner sat before the window, offering an unobstructed view of the dazzling metropolis.

Evelyn's foggy mind sharpened with realization. She shook her head weakly. "Dominic... please... not here..."

The thought of what he intended to do in front of that window terrified her.

Yet her body betrayed her, arching toward him, her fingers digging into his sculpted shoulders.

Dominic smirked, his grip tightening on her thighs as he lowered her onto the recliner.

She tried to resist, but her legs parted instinctively, wrapping around his waist.

His predatory gaze locked onto her writhing form.

She looked like a delicate white kitten playing with yarn—adorable yet unbearably tempting.

Evelyn's eyes flickered to the starry sky, then widened in horror as she realized her position.

Her legs were spread wide, baring her to the city below.

Panic surged through her. "Stop—"

Dominic leaned down, his lips curling into a dangerous smile. "You don’t get to decide, Evelyn. Your body is begging for me."

He didn’t tell her the truth—the glass was one-way.

She could see out, but no one could see in.

Evelyn moaned, her vision blurring with pleasure.

"Did I ever mention how much I love your sounds?" Dominic murmured, watching their reflection in the glass.

Her mind was blank, consumed by need. She pressed desperate kisses across his chest.

He teased her mercilessly, touching everywhere but where she needed him most.

The torment was unbearable.

If she didn’t find release soon, the drug would destroy her.

Tears spilled down her cheeks. She squeezed her eyes shut, refusing to look at him.

Dominic's anger faded at the sight of her tears. He kissed them away before finally thrusting inside her.

Between ragged breaths, she heard him whisper, "I'm sorry, Evelyn. I lost control when I saw you with him. You have no idea how much you mean to me..."

His love for her was obsessive. The mere thought of another man touching her drove him mad.

Finding her nearly violated by Xavier had felt like a knife to his heart.

Evelyn was the only light in his bleak youth.

His past was a frozen wasteland—until she appeared like a vine, weaving life and color into his barren world.

To others, she might seem ordinary. But to him, she was everything.

Their intimacy that night was raw, fueled by desperation rather than tenderness.

At the peak, Dominic held her so tightly she could barely breathe.

"Sorry," he repeated, his voice rough with emotion.

Evelyn bit down hard on his shoulder, drawing blood.

He didn’t flinch. Instead, his movements grew fiercer, as if trying to merge their very souls.

Dawn broke, sunlight replacing the stars.

Evelyn woke at eight, alone in the massive suite.

Her body ached as if she’d been trampled. Animal, she thought bitterly.

Then she remembered—the children.

Guilt crashed over her. She reached for her phone, but the doorbell rang.

Thinking it was Dominic, she wrapped herself in a robe and opened the door.

Margaret Whitmore stood there, her sharp eyes taking in the disheveled room.

Towels littered the floor.

The scent of sex hung heavy in the air.

Evelyn’s neck was covered in marks.

Margaret said nothing, simply laying fresh clothes on the bed. "Mr. Blackwood sent these."

"Thank you," Evelyn mumbled, avoiding her gaze.

"Mr. Blackwood took the children to Blackwood Manor last night." Margaret’s tone turned stern. "You shouldn’t leave them alone, Ms. Sinclair. Especially Isabella—she’s terrified of thunderstorms."

Evelyn flinched. She hadn’t realized it had stormed.

Margaret’s disapproval was clear. The children deserved better than a shabby apartment.

What if something had happened to them?
###Chapter 281

Evelyn's heart clenched with guilt when she thought of the twins. She exhaled sharply when Margaret confirmed their safety.

Thank God they were unharmed. She'd never forgive herself if anything had happened to them.

"I swear it won't happen again," Evelyn vowed to Margaret with fierce determination.

Margaret gave an approving nod before exiting the room.

All things considered, she was quite pleased with the young woman.

Evelyn possessed striking beauty, a gentle nature, and genuine kindness. Not only did she hold Dominic's affection, but she was also the biological mother of his children. They could build a perfect family where the twins would flourish.

Though as a mother, she still had much to learn.

After Margaret left, Evelyn opened the gift box to reveal a pristine white Chanel ensemble.

The contemporary design exuded elegance with flawless tailoring.

She recognized it from last month's fashion spread - the price tag equaled her entire annual salary.

Such luxury was beyond her means.

But with no other options for the office...

Nina remained captive under Maxwell's control, her fate uncertain. Evelyn needed to beg Dominic for help - her last hope.

Ms. Laurent had already reprimanded her for previous absences. Requesting more leave was impossible.

Reluctantly, Evelyn slipped into the designer outfit.

To her surprise, it fit like it was tailored for her.

T Corporation.

Evelyn's arrival in the design department turned heads.

One colleague's shrill exclamation echoed through the office. "My God, Evelyn! Is that the new Chanel collection? That must cost half my yearly salary! I'm green with envy!"

Her words dripped with thinly veiled jealousy.

'This is what sleeping with the boss gets you,' the woman thought bitterly.

Evelyn had arrived at the company dressed plainly. Now she wore clothes that sparked envy.

"Just a knockoff. The real thing's beyond my budget," Evelyn explained patiently.

Abigail, sketching a blueprint, glanced up and instantly recognized the authentic designer wear. She smirked but stayed silent.

The colleague visibly relaxed at the counterfeit claim. "That makes sense. Your salary's lower than mine. Unless some man's funding your wardrobe..."

Evelyn's expression darkened.

Always protective, Abigail rolled her eyes. "Evelyn could trade on her looks but chooses to earn her keep through design talent. Unlike some here with mediocre skills and personalities so unpleasant... well, even stripping wouldn't attract attention to that flat chest. No wonder she's compensating."

Snickers erupted around them.

Abigail had struck a nerve. The colleague flushed, glaring at Evelyn's curves.

Her A-cup insecurity was legendary - she famously wore padded bras. The public humiliation left her speechless.

She silently vowed to save for breast implants.

Evelyn remained unfazed. Years ago she might have argued, but hardship had strengthened her. Now she brushed off such pettiness.

Only one thought consumed her: convincing Dominic to save Nina.

After last night's rage...

He'd been terrifying - a force of nature. The image of him impaling Maxwell's hand with broken glass still haunted her.

A shudder ran down her spine.

The incident had erected walls between them.

Would he help for old times' sake?

Lost in thought, Evelyn didn't notice Abigail tugging her silk scarf.

Abigail gasped at the love bites revealed beneath. "How long since Dominic last had you? The man's a beast! Just looking at your neck makes me wince... so tell me, how is our CEO in bed?"

"Stop!" Evelyn's face burned crimson to her ears.

She yanked the scarf tight, eyeing Abigail warily.

"Fine, I'll behave. Take these documents to Mr. Blackwood's office." Abigail chuckled, handing over files that were technically her responsibility.

She had no desire to face the CEO's icy demeanor, handsome as he was. With Evelyn present, Dominic might actually show humanity.

Evelyn dreaded facing Dominic after last night's trauma. But Nina's plight forced her forward.

The CEO's office occupied the top floor. Waiting at the employee elevator, Evelyn spotted a striking figure.

The woman's curves were accentuated by oversized sunglasses obscuring most of her face, revealing only a pert nose and crimson lips.

She entered Dominic's private elevator without hesitation.

Ding!

The employee elevator arrived. Evelyn boarded dejectedly with other female colleagues.

"Who was that? She looked familiar - such presence! How bold to use the boss's private lift!" one whispered.

Her friend giggled. "That's Lillian Prescott, the actress. Rumor says Dominic personally chose her as the new perfume spokesperson over an international star... He never played favorites before. Think he's interested?"

Another joined in. "Dominic's avoided women for years - not even rumors. But he's only human. And Lillian's adoptive father is the Provincial Secretary - their statuses match..."

Evelyn heard no more.

The words echoed endlessly.

Dominic had personally endorsed the celebrity.

Their social standings aligned perfectly.

Her legs turned leaden approaching the CEO's office. Each step required monumental effort...

Lillian entered carrying a thermos of soup.

Dominic's office radiated understated luxury.

He stood by the window instead of working.

At six-foot-four, his physique dwarfed professional models. His commanding aura inspired awe even at a distance.

Lillian smiled.

This man controlled T Corporation and the city's economy. Countless wealthy women had pursued him in vain. His complete lack of romantic entanglements pleased her immensely.
###Chapter 282

Evelyn Sinclair placed the steaming bowl of chicken soup on Dominic Blackwood's desk with practiced grace. "Mr. Blackwood," she called softly, recalling Genevieve Prescott's advice that the quickest path to a man's heart was through his stomach.

Not that Evelyn knew how to cook - she could barely boil water. But her adoptive mother Genevieve was a culinary genius.

Dominic turned, his chiseled features momentarily stunning the rising actress. There was no denying his striking appearance - not just his sculpted jawline but the commanding aura of a seasoned corporate titan.

Though young, Dominic carried himself with the regal bearing of a king forged in boardroom battles.

"Mr. Blackwood, I wanted to discuss our collaboration," Evelyn said, gesturing to the soup. "I hope you'll enjoy this."

A slight frown creased Dominic's brow. "Thank you, Ms. Prescott. But I've already breakfasted. Sebastian Whitmore will handle the collaboration details." His tone remained glacial.

The dismissal stung like a fishbone lodged in Evelyn's throat. Her eyes flickered to the stacks of documents on his desk. "Have I disturbed your work?"

Despite being the adopted daughter of Governor Jonathan Prescott, Evelyn couldn't shake her orphanage origins. The specter of the real Prescott heir potentially returning haunted her.

She needed insurance - a wealthy husband to secure her future. Dominic checked every box, though his inscrutability frustrated her. Was this aloofness innate or cultivated?

Something in Evelyn's dejected expression seemed to remind Dominic of someone. His icy demeanor thawed slightly. "No."

Evelyn's heart leapt at his softened tone. "My father keeps mentioning you since dinner. Perhaps you'd visit us sometime?" she ventured.

"My schedule is packed currently," Dominic replied evenly. "I'll pay Governor Prescott a visit when time permits."

Beaming, Evelyn produced an embossed card. "Then it's settled. My personal number - call anytime." She maintained perfect poise as he accepted it without reaction.

"I won't take more of your time," she said, turning gracefully. Patience was key - she'd pique his interest gradually.

Her movements exuded aristocratic breeding, yet Dominic found them studied. He'd met countless such women - all equally tiresome. Only Jonathan Prescott's status prevented him from showing disdain.

The moment Evelyn exited, the gilded card found its way into the trash bin.

Outside, Evelyn's composure shattered. Her stilettos clicked excitedly as she nearly danced down the hallway, barely suppressing squeals of delight.

As the elevator doors closed, she glimpsed a white-clad figure with raven hair at the corridor's end. Probably just some employee, though the woman's striking silhouette unsettled her.

Perhaps as Mrs. Blackwood, she'd need to purge all attractive female staff...

Evelyn's sunglasses hid her expression, but the triumphant smirk was unmistakable. The sight made Evelyn Sinclair's stomach twist.

What had Dominic said to elicit such joy? Something intimate?

Shaking off the thought, Evelyn knocked.

"Enter." The deep voice resonated through the door.

Smoke assaulted Evelyn's senses as she entered. Dominic lounged in his leather chair, a pale green cigar between his fingers - its earthy aroma oddly suiting his refined brutality.

In that moment, Dominic Blackwood resembled nothing so much as a dangerous masterpiece.
###Chapter 283

Dominic's gaze burned into Evelyn. She stood before him in a sleek designer dress that hugged her curves perfectly.

Her toned legs peeked from beneath the hem, pale skin glowing under the office lights.

Chestnut waves cascaded down her back like liquid silk. The delicate features of her face were accentuated by subtle makeup - starlit eyes, rosy lips. Only the silk scarf around her neck betrayed her secret, hiding the bruises beneath.

She looked like a cherry blossom in full bloom.

Dominic's body reacted instantly at the memory of last night's passionate encounter.

But his expression darkened when he recalled her reckless actions.

Evelyn trembled under his stare, barely daring to breathe. One wrong move and he might refuse to help Olivia.

She cleared her throat and pushed documents across his desk. "The reports you requested, Mr. Blackwood."

The aroma of chicken soup from the kitchenette made her stomach twist.

Has Lillian Prescott gotten that close to him? Bringing him homemade meals now?

Dominic's voice cut through her thoughts. "You scream my name in bed, yet call me 'Mr. Blackwood' now?" His anger flared at her obvious avoidance.

Evelyn blinked at his harsh words. "We're at work," she reminded him. "You've always insisted on professionalism. I didn't think you'd want personal matters interfering."

His eyes narrowed dangerously. "Watch your tone, Evelyn Sinclair."

She knew that look. Knew the storm brewing beneath his controlled exterior.

Taking a steadying breath, she cut to the chase. "I'm not here to argue. We can settle our... personal issues later. Right now, I need to ask you for one thing."

The air grew thick with tension.

Dominic took a slow drag from his cigar. "And what would that be?" Ice laced his words.

Evelyn bit her lip hard enough to draw blood. "Please... save Olivia."

His cold laughter filled the room.

A stray lock of hair fell across his forehead, disrupting his usual polished appearance.

He tapped ash into the tray, voice dripping with sarcasm. "If I disgust you so much, why come begging for favors? Am I really that unbearable, Evelyn?"

Her distance unsettled him. He was accustomed to her warmth, her reliance on him.

The words left his mouth before he could stop them.

Evelyn clenched her fists until her nails bit into her palms. "If not for me, then do it because she's a T Corporation employee. Maxwell took her because of me! He threatened to have his men violate her unless I..." Her voice broke. "He sent me photos. Videos. I had no choice! She's my best friend and it's my fault she's in this mess!"

Tears spilled down her cheeks.

She pressed a hand to her mouth, struggling to maintain composure, but the tears kept coming.

"So that's why you surrendered to Maxwell's demands?" Dominic crushed his cigar and stood. His gaze turned predatory.

Evelyn lifted her chin. "Yes."

His fist slammed onto the desk, sending papers flying.

"Have you lost your damn mind?" he roared. "You thought facing that monster alone would solve anything? Should I applaud your bravery or mourn your stupidity? Why didn't you call me?"

A bitter laugh escaped her. "You think I didn't try? Your phone was off! I was losing my mind with worry! Olivia was in danger and time was running out! What was I supposed to do?"

"The police—"

"Maxwell said I'd get her back in a body bag if I involved them!" Evelyn hugged herself. "I couldn't risk it. I had to try..."

Dominic remembered the missed calls when he'd finally turned his phone on after the flight. He'd assumed she was being clingy.

Guilt twisted his gut.

He'd misjudged her. Misread the situation when he found her in Maxwell's bed.

"I'm sorry," he murmured, stepping closer. "I didn't know." Tentatively, he reached for her, pulling her slight frame against him.

She felt fragile in his arms.

His lips brushed her damp lashes as he whispered apologies.

Evelyn shoved him away.

The hurt from last night still burned fresh.

"Olivia's still with Preston Worthington," she said coldly. "I don't know what condition she's in. Save her quickly, Mr. Blackwood, and I'll be forever grateful."

She turned on her heel and strode out.

Dominic watched her go, guilt and longing warring in his chest. His fist connected with the desk again, splitting skin. He barely registered the pain.

Pressing the intercom, he summoned Sebastian.
###Chapter 284

Dominic Blackwood's office door swung open as Sebastian Whitmore entered.

The CEO of Blackwood Enterprises sat slumped in his leather chair, silk tie loosened at the throat. Sebastian blinked in surprise. Dominic looked utterly defeated, like a man who'd lost everything.

"Overworked again," Sebastian muttered under his breath.

After handling the Western Europe crisis, Dominic had flown straight back to A City without rest. Back-to-back board meetings followed, each demanding critical decisions. Three sleepless nights would exhaust anyone, even a notorious workaholic like Dominic. But this wasn't mere fatigue - Sebastian had never seen his boss look so broken.

"Mr. Blackwood..." Sebastian flipped open his tablet, ready to deliver the morning reports.

He froze mid-sentence. Dominic's eyes remained closed, his breathing shallow. The assistant studied his employer's face with quiet reverence.

Dominic Blackwood was the epitome of corporate power - razor-sharp intellect paired with ruthless leadership skills. At twenty-one, he'd inherited Blackwood Enterprises when it was drowning in debt. Within five years, Sebastian watched him transform it into a global empire with profits multiplying five hundredfold.

But that meteoric rise came at a cost. The bright-eyed young heir hardened into an ice-cold tycoon. Evelyn Sinclair had briefly thawed that icy exterior... until last night's disaster.

Sebastian's jaw tightened. How could Evelyn end up in Maxwell Lockwood's bed when Dominic adored her? Yes, she'd been drugged and framed, but her naivety still grated. A man like Dominic needed an equal - someone sharp enough to stand beside him at the summit. Evelyn simply wasn't that woman.

"Mr. Whitmore." Dominic's voice sliced through the silence like a blade.

Sebastian straightened instantly. "Yes, sir."

Dominic's eyes snapped open. "Email HR. Theresa Whitmore from Workplace Safety is fired immediately for negligence at the new Harmony Plaza construction site."

Sebastian typed without hesitation. "Understood."

"Tell R&D I want a full dossier on Teskell Energy's new power source within seven days. Prepare acquisition papers."

Sebastian nodded. Dominic only pursued two types of companies - highly profitable ones, or those whose CEOs had crossed him. The first ended in buyouts. The second in corporate annihilation.

"Cancel all appointments this week. Reschedule JK Corp. Contact Preston Worthington Sr. - I need to see him." Dominic's gaze turned glacial.

Sebastian nearly dropped his tablet. The air thickened with menace.

Dominic remembered Evelyn's terrified expression. He fixed Sebastian with a piercing stare. "Do I frighten you, Mr. Whitmore?"

He had to save Olivia Kensington today. Otherwise, Evelyn would never forgive him.

Last night's events haunted him. Evelyn had been the victim, yet he'd punished her. For all his business acumen, Dominic was powerless when it came to Evelyn Sinclair.

"Not at all, sir." Sebastian's collar felt suddenly tight. "I'll contact Mr. Worthington immediately."

At thirty-nine, Sebastian had nerves of steel. But Dominic's murderous expression moments ago had shaken him. That gaze could eviscerate a man - slowly and painfully.

Meanwhile, at St. Mary's Hospital...

Maxwell Lockwood lay motionless in the ICU. Bloodied bandages swathed his head. Bruises distorted his handsome features. Swollen eyelids sealed shut. Even his parents barely recognized him.

Internal injuries were worse - four broken ribs, a palm impaled by crystal shards. Doctors spent forty minutes extracting glass fragments with tweezers.

An IV drip fed into Maxwell's arm as he lay deathly still.

Frederick and Lorraine Lockwood kept vigil, aging visibly with each passing hour.

Lorraine dabbed her eyes with a monogrammed handkerchief. "What monster did this to my boy?" she sobbed.

Frederick's hands clenched. Maxwell had been trouble since toddlerhood - scandals, lawsuits, prison stints. He'd burned countless bridges protecting his heir. Seeing his son now, part of him wished he'd never been born.

"Stop your hysterics! This is your doing!" Frederick snapped. "I warned you about spoiling him! Fresh out of prison and already in another mess! Those worthless friends of his—"

Lorraine wailed louder.

Frederick longed to hurl something through the window. Too late for discipline now. The damage was done.
###Chapter 285

Lorraine's wails grew louder after her husband's sharp reprimand.

She finally lifted her tear-streaked face to glare at Frederick. "You blame me for spoiling our son? What about you? All you care about is making money. Half the nights you're not even home, always jetting off on business trips. Do you even know your own son's temperament? Do you think I can discipline him alone?"

"I have to provide for this family!" Frederick snapped back. "You don't work. How else do you expect us to survive?"

Years of sacrifice for his family, only to be accused of neglect. The injustice burned in his chest.

Their heated argument finally roused Maxwell from unconsciousness.

The throbbing in his skull intensified at the sight of his parents nearly coming to blows. "Enough!" he groaned. "Can't you let me rest in peace?"

Since childhood, his parents' explosive fights had been the soundtrack of his life - shattering vases, flying furniture, threats to demolish their home. Age hadn't mellowed them; if anything, their battles had grown more vicious.

No wonder Maxwell preferred the company of street thugs to his own home. What child wanted to witness such toxicity daily?

"Maxwell, my poor boy!" Lorraine dabbed at fresh tears. "Look at you - just out of prison and already battered. How many times must I tell you to stay out of trouble? Do you enjoy breaking your mother's heart?"

Frederick studied his injured son with grim resignation. For one dark moment, he wished the boy had died - one less scourge on society. He immediately shook off the horrific thought. Blood was blood, after all.

Maxwell rolled his eyes at his mother's theatrics. "Yeah, yeah, I'll be good. Stop crying already." His jaw clenched as he recalled Dominic's brutal beating. This humiliation wouldn't go unanswered.

In his entire life, no one had dared treat him this way - not in prison, not on the streets. He'd always been the predator, never the prey.

"Tell me who did this," Lorraine demanded with unusual steel in her voice. "I'll make sure they pay."

Maxwell had intended to keep quiet, but inspiration struck. "Who else? Your precious nephew, Dominic Blackwood. That bastard's been eyeing Evelyn like she's his property. My own wife! He barged in while we were intimate - a married couple's rightful privacy - beat me senseless, then kidnapped her. Since when do cousins behave like this?"

Frederick scoffed. "Dominic? Impossible. He's reserved but principled. There must be some mistake." He refused to believe his nephew would act so recklessly.

Maxwell's lips twisted in a sneer. "Tell me, Father - who's your real son? Me or Dominic? Look at my injuries! Do I look like I'm lying? Even you've noticed something between Evelyn and him. We're still married, and she's already cuckolding me! Shouldn't Aunt Beatrice control her son? Or do you want your future grandchild bearing the Blackwood name?"

Lorraine's tear-reddened eyes flashed with vindication. "See, Frederick? Like mother, like son. Your sister's a gold-digging harlot, and her precious boy's no better - stealing his cousin's wife when he could have any woman! All you Lockwoods are cut from the same rotten cloth. What cursed fate made me marry into this family!"

Despite her contempt for Beatrice, Lorraine secretly envied her sister-in-law's position - matriarch of the powerful Blackwoods, mother to an exceptional son, grandmother to perfect twins. Now she'd found Beatrice's Achilles' heel - her son's scandalous obsession with a married woman.

Frederick's face darkened at their poisonous words, especially the mention of promiscuous Evelyn. "That wanton woman isn't worth this trouble. Divorce her!"

Maxwell's eyes turned flinty. "She's mine. I don't care what she's done. Help me keep her, or you'll never hold a grandchild."

"You ungrateful wretch!" Frederick grabbed a pillow, poised to strike, but the sight of his son's injuries stayed his hand. "I'm calling Beatrice. She'll deal with her son."

Across town, Dominic stubbed out his cigarette as his office phone rang.

"Blackwood."

"Long time, Mr. Blackwood." The androgynous voice dripped with amusement. "I'm touched you remember old friends."

Dominic gazed through his floor-to-ceiling windows at the glittering city below. "I need a favor, Mallory. One of my woman's friends is tangled up with your brother. Dinner's on me next time."

A pause. "Your woman? Since when do you have one?"

Dominic's lips curved. "A feisty little kitten. I'll introduce her once she's properly trained."

Another pause, then laughter. "Consider it done. I'll call Preston."

As the line went dead, Dominic's smile faded. His rebellious kitten needed disciplining. The question was - how?
###Chapter 286

Regal Capital.

The night air was crisp as Evelyn Sinclair sat by the floor-to-ceiling window, freshly showered.

She rested her chin on her knees, gazing at the dim streetlights below. Only vague silhouettes moved in the darkness.

The heater remained off despite the chill.

Her thin cotton pajamas provided little warmth, but the cold helped numb her thoughts...

The apartment hadn't changed, yet it felt hollow without her twins' laughter. The very air tasted bitter with loneliness.

Olivia's unknown fate, her missing children, Dominic's sudden coldness - it all crashed down on her. She buried her face deeper into her knees.

Outside the complex, Dominic Blackwood cursed as his calls went unanswered again.

He'd checked all possible locations - Robert's old house where Gwendolyn stayed alone, Evelyn's grandfather's new rental, even her few work friends' places.

His gut told him she'd be here, in this neglected apartment she'd abandoned after that neighbor dispute. The lease hadn't expired yet.

The security gate mocked him with its card reader. Rarely visiting meant no access card.

Twenty freezing minutes passed. Cigarette butts piled in the trash bin. No residents entered Building 12.

His patience snapped.

The architectural designer in him assessed the aging structure. Rusted pipes. Narrow balconies. Child's play.

One final drag. He flicked the cigarette away.

Calloused hands gripped the weathered water pipe. Testing his weight, the metal groaned but held.

With feline grace, he scaled the wall using crumbling indentations as footholds. His black coat billowed like a villain's cape against the moonlight.

Second floor. Third. Fourth.

Unit 509 should be the fourth window east.

Perched outside what he believed was her window, he frowned. No anti-theft bars. The half-open window concerned him - any intruder could enter.

He pushed it fully open and slipped inside.

Chaos assaulted his senses.

This couldn't be Evelyn's place. The usually meticulous woman would never tolerate this filth - moldy takeout containers, unwashed dishes piled on dirty laundry, a stench that made his stomach churn.

Wrong apartment.

As he turned to leave, the bathroom door creaked open.

A mountainous woman emerged, flesh jiggling beneath damp pajamas. Her shriek could shatter glass. "INTRUDER! RAPIST!"

Dominic calculated the unit numbers. This had to be 506.

"Shut your mouth or I'll shut it for you," he growled, the threat dripping from his voice like venom.

The woman froze, then blinked at his sculpted features. Her anger melted into simpering admiration. "Oh my...you're like those underwear models!"

"Unit 509. Where is it?" he demanded.

"Three windows to the right, handsome. Maybe you'd like my number first—"

He was already climbing out.

"Wait! I'm untouched! Come back!" she wailed, leaning dangerously out the window.

Dominic nearly lost his grip. Spotting a potted cactus on 507's balcony, he snapped off a spine-covered segment and hurled it.

A satisfying thunk. Silence.

Finally reaching 509, he exhaled. First time breaking into a building, first time encountering such lunacy.

The locked window surprised him. Evelyn always left it open.

His knuckles rapped against the glass. "Evelyn. Open up."
###Chapter 287

Dominic's biceps flexed as he verified the address. This was definitely Evelyn's apartment. He rapped softly on the window. "Evelyn, it's me. Open up."

No response came after several attempts. His pulse quickened. Could she not hear him? Or was something wrong?

The thought sent ice through his veins. Moving swiftly along the balcony, he reached her bedroom window. The unlocked latch gave way easily under his fingers.

Instead of warmth, the room greeted him with winter's bite. His body shuddered involuntarily.

Darkness and silence enveloped the space like a tomb. His unease deepened as he flung open the bedroom door.

There she was - curled into herself on the sofa, clad only in thin sleepwear, lost in some private torment.

The sight of her isolation struck him like a physical blow. Before he could think, he was kneeling beside her, gathering her feverish form against his chest. The heat radiating from her forehead dissolved his planned reprimands into a single, tender utterance. "Evelyn..."

Her glassy eyes focused slowly. Shock flickered across her features before hardening into icy detachment.

"How did you get in?" Her voice rasped with illness and anger. "Leave."

Dominic exhaled sharply. "You're burning up in this freezing apartment. Where's your common sense?"

"Go to hell." She twisted weakly in his grasp, her movements sluggish from fever and resentment.

His palm cupped her scorching cheek. With a frustrated sigh, he retrieved a down jacket from her bedroom and wrestled her into it despite her protests. "Enough. You need a doctor."

"I don't need anything from you." Her congested voice broke. "We're nothing to each other. Just leave me alone."

On the stairwell, they nearly collided with Tabitha returning from her bridge game. The middle-aged woman's face twisted in disapproval at the sight of the striking man cradling her disreputable neighbor.

As they passed, Tabitha's lips curled. What could such an obviously wealthy man see in that tramp? Her own daughter - a promising journalist at a major newspaper - would be far more suitable. She'd noticed his luxury car parked outside before. The thought of introducing her daughter to him took root in her scheming mind.

Dominic remained oblivious to Tabitha's machinations, his attention wholly consumed by Evelyn's condition. He settled her into the passenger seat, buckling the resistant woman securely.

Evelyn curled inward, her usual vitality extinguished. When the engine rumbled to life, she suddenly lunged for the door handle.

Dominic's reflexes were faster. He seized her wrist and engaged the child locks in one fluid motion. Forcing her to meet his gaze, he demanded, "What's gotten into you?"

"Let me out," she spat, twisting away.

Her refusal to even look at him ignited his temper. His knuckles whitened on the steering wheel. "I've apologized for last night. Tell me what you want from me."

Evelyn kept her eyes shut, fingers scrabbling uselessly at the door mechanism. "Open this door, Dominic."

The chasm between them seemed insurmountable. If apologies could erase all wounds, the world would be overrun with unrepentant sinners.

When the door refused to yield, she whirled on him, fever-bright eyes blazing. "Let me out now!"

Dominic's expression darkened dangerously. He secured her seatbelt with deliberate movements. "Hospital first. We'll talk after."

Evelyn slumped in defeat, the fight draining from her. Arguing with this stubborn man was like shouting into a hurricane.

As the car accelerated, she turned her face to the window, shutting him out completely. Dominic's jaw clenched. He pressed the accelerator harder, the powerful vehicle responding instantly.

At the hospital parking lot, he scooped Evelyn into his arms and sprinted toward the emergency entrance...
###Chapter 288

Evelyn despised the sterile scent of hospitals. Feverish and delirious, childhood memories flooded back. She weakly tugged at Dominic's sleeve. "No doctors...please."

Dominic's patience was already frayed from worry. Seeing Evelyn's dangerously high temperature made his temper flare. Her childish behavior only fueled his anger.

He tightened his grip, voice sharp. "Stop this. You're burning up. Do you want to get worse?"

Evelyn gazed up at him with glassy eyes.

Mistaking her fear for stubbornness, Dominic brushed his lips against hers in a soothing gesture. His touch was gentle, contradicting his stormy expression.

The crowded outpatient clinic buzzed with activity. Patients glared when Dominic tried to bypass the line. One hotheaded man shouted obscenities.

A bespectacled doctor noticed the commotion. Adjusting his glasses, he ordered the nurse to maintain order.

The nurse's eyes widened when she saw Dominic. 'God, he's gorgeous,' she thought. But his thunderous expression made her retreat immediately.

She looked helplessly at the overworked doctor.

The doctor threw down his pen in frustration. "Can't you see the line? Go to the back!"

"Enough. She needs treatment now." Dominic deposited Evelyn onto a chair.

The doctor studied Dominic's designer suit and vaguely familiar face - perhaps from a business magazine cover. Experience told him not to provoke this man.

Dominic had never waited in public hospitals. Private healthcare always catered to his needs instantly.

The other patients fell silent under Dominic's menacing glare.

With a sigh, the doctor instructed, "Nurse Thornton, check her temperature."

As the nurse reached for Evelyn's collar, Dominic snatched the thermometer. "I'll do it."

He couldn't tolerate anyone touching Evelyn - not even medical staff.

Evelyn shivered despite her thick coat. Dominic draped his jacket over her shoulders.

The nurse watched enviously. 'Beautiful men make the best partners,' she mused, recalling an internet article about handsome celebrities being faithful husbands.

Yet this stunning man's girlfriend seemed ungrateful, recoiling from his touch. 'Why do gorgeous men always pick difficult women?' she wondered.

"103.8 degrees!" Dominic's sharp voice startled her. "This is critical. Administer an injection immediately."

The doctor hastily wrote a prescription. The nurse prepared the syringe, swabbing Evelyn's arm with alcohol.

At the sight of the needle, Evelyn began trembling violently.

"It won't hurt much," the nurse reassured.

Evelyn bolted upright as if electrocuted. She shoved the nurse away and stumbled toward the exit.

Her ankle twisted painfully. Strong arms caught her before she fell.

"Enough, Evelyn!" Dominic growled.

"No injections! Let me go!" She thrashed wildly, but his grip was unbreakable.

Tears streamed down her face. "Please, Dominic...no needles..."

Few understood Evelyn's terror. In her youth, her stepmother Victoria and stepsister Sophia had devised cruel punishments - using long needles to inflict invisible pain that left no marks.

Her father never believed her complaints. The trauma only ended when she moved to boarding school, but her fear remained.

Hospital staff exchanged confused glances, whispering behind their hands.

Evelyn's hair was wild, her breathing ragged. She clawed at Dominic's restraining arms. "I beg you..."

Dominic's patience snapped.

He hauled her back to the examination table, shoving her down roughly. The impact against the table's edge knocked the breath from her lungs.

"Stop acting like a child."

Dominic wasn't known for tolerance.

Evelyn's public meltdown was testing his limits...
###Chapter 289

Dominic turned abruptly. He needed fresh air to clear his mind, craving the bitter taste of nicotine to steady his nerves.

Just as he reached the exit, slender pale fingers caught the edge of his shirt sleeve.

He spun around to find Evelyn's tear-stained face staring up at him. "Please don't leave me here," she whispered, voice breaking.

Curled up like a frightened stray, her vulnerability pierced through Dominick's defenses instantly.

The clinical stench of antiseptic made Evelyn nauseous. The nurse's syringe glinted under fluorescent lights, triggering visceral panic.

Too many traumatic memories surfaced - dark corridors, sterile rooms, the metallic scent of fear. Even now, years later, the terror remained fresh.

Her trembling fingers clung to Dominick's hand like a lifeline. This hospital felt like a waking nightmare she couldn't escape.

When she collapsed against his chest, Dominick was startled by her fragility. He'd never seen the usually fiery Evelyn so broken.

Most children feared needles. But Evelyn was a grown woman. There had to be more to this phobia than met the eye.

'I'll get to the bottom of this later,' Dominick resolved silently.

Scooping her up, he noticed her wincing when her stomach brushed against him. Guilt twisted inside him - he shouldn't have been so rough earlier.

In Dominick's arms, Evelyn gradually relaxed. She buried her face in his neck, her grip tightening as if he alone could anchor her in this storm. His solid presence created a temporary refuge from her demons.

"Let's try another hospital," he suggested gently, enveloping her small hand in his.

Evelyn shook her head violently. "No hospitals. Just take me home," she pleaded, voice raw.

Hospitals represented everything she feared - needles, loss, the thin line between life and death. The place where she'd watched her father take his last breath.

Dominick's expression remained unreadable as he studied her pale face. "Alright. Home it is," he conceded.

Evelyn clutched his sleeve desperately, terrified he might change his mind. Only when cold night air hit her face did her grip loosen slightly.

Carrying her to the parking lot, Dominick noticed her arms slackening around his neck. Looking down, he found her asleep, exhaustion finally claiming her.

He pressed a featherlight kiss to her forehead before carefully settling her in the car.

The Range Rover merged into midnight traffic, leaving the hospital behind.

Dominick bypassed other medical facilities, heading straight for his estate. Upon arrival, he summoned the Blackwood family physician.

Dr. Julian Whitmore had just completed back-to-back surgeries on two Fortune 500 CEOs when Dominick's insistent calls started.

After thirty-six grueling hours in the OR, Julian had barely collapsed into bed when his phone erupted. The frantic calls made him fear Dominick was bleeding out.

He arrived at the mansion in record time, only to discover his emergency patient was a young woman with a fever. Julian nearly walked out then and there.

A Harvard-trained specialist treating a common cold? The indignity burned.

But one look at Dominick's thunderous expression kept his protests internal. The man could make life very difficult for those who displeased him.

"Just a viral infection," Julian announced after examination. "Oral medication will suffice since she's needle-phobic. The ankle sprain needs topical treatment - she'll recover in days."

Noticing the love bites on Evelyn's neck, Julian couldn't resist commenting, "Never took you for the possessive type, Blackwood. Careful you don't scare her off with that caveman behavior."

Dominick's tender gaze on Evelyn's sleeping form turned glacial when directed at Julian. "Keep your eyes to yourself unless you want them removed."

Julian demonstrated ankle massage techniques while Dominick watched like a hawk. "Apply this ointment twice daily," he instructed, producing a small jar.

Evelyn whimpered as Julian manipulated her swollen joint, instinctively curling away from the pain.

That sleepy moan sent heat straight to Dominick's groin. He roughly shoved Julian aside. "Enough. Hands off my woman."

Julian rolled his eyes. "Some gratitude. World-class physician reduced to love doctor. Remind me why we're friends?"

After leaving instructions and billing details, Julian departed, muttering about ungrateful billionaires.

Evelyn slept peacefully, her slight frame nearly disappearing under the duvet. Dominick's cool palm against her forehead confirmed her fever was breaking.

Shirt discarded, he slid into bed, pulling her flush against him. The contrast between her feverish skin and his cooler body was intoxicating. Nothing separated them - just the way he preferred.

Desire flared hot, but her fragile state stayed his hand. Instead, he pressed a chaste kiss to her cheek.

'If only you'd always be this pliant, Evelyn...'
###Chapter 290

Blackwood Estate.

Alexander and Isabella sat quietly on the plush living room sofa, their usual cheerful laughter absent.

Deep frowns marred their youthful faces.

The children's solemn expressions made them appear far older than their years, creating an almost comical contrast.

Isabella shot her brother a miserable look. "Big Bro, our mansion is way bigger than Miss Evelyn's apartment, but I don't like it here. I want to live with Miss Evelyn..."

Dominic and Evelyn shared a complicated relationship. Evelyn had given the twins permission to call her "Mommy" in private, but insisted they use "Miss Evelyn" in public.

The children didn't understand these rules, but being obedient, they followed their mother's instructions.

Alexander sighed dramatically, spreading his arms like a miniature adult. "I want to live with her too. But Daddy's being stupid. He still hasn't convinced Miss Evelyn to marry him. If he did, we could stay with her forever."

Isabella's eyes lit up. "Really? Should we help Daddy win her heart then?"

Alexander nodded thoughtfully. "We need a plan. Maybe Uncle Maxwell can help. He always has beautiful women around him. People say he's a playboy, so he must know about romance."

"What's a playboy, Big Bro?" Isabella tilted her head.

Alexander hesitated, searching for child-friendly words. "It's a man who likes charming pretty ladies. You've seen how Uncle Maxwell wears those flashy clothes, right? That's what playboys usually wear..."

Isabella nodded enthusiastically. "Oh! I get it now! I like pretty girls too, Big Bro! You should dress like Uncle Maxwell! Then lots of pretty girls will like you! You should be a playboy too!"

Alexander facepalmed.

He rubbed his temples, at a loss for words with his sister.

The housekeeper arranging toys nearby couldn't suppress a chuckle at their innocent exchange.

"Why are you laughing, Mrs. Florence? Did I say something wrong?" Isabella blinked her puppy-dog eyes.

Alexander fixed the housekeeper with a stern look identical to Dominic's, making Mrs. Florence straighten up immediately.

"Nothing at all. What fruits would you like after dinner tonight, Young Master Alexander and Young Miss Isabella?" The housekeeper quickly changed the subject.

"I don't want fruit. I only want Miss Evelyn." Isabella's voice quivered.

Tears welled up in her eyes. Alexander squeezed her hand, equally distressed. Truthfully, he missed their mother just as much.

The housekeeper hesitated, unsure how to respond.

Evelyn remained a controversial figure in the Blackwood family. Beatrice despised her, and even Reginald Blackwood, who initially accepted her, had turned against her. Margaret Lockwood watched from the shadows.

Only Dominic and the twins still welcomed Evelyn.

The sound of a cane tapping announced Reginald's arrival downstairs.

Seeing his great-grandchildren's gloomy faces, the patriarch frowned. "What's troubling you?"

Though advanced in years, Reginald commanded absolute authority in the household.

His lifetime among the city's elite had honed his commanding presence. Even Beatrice and Margaret dared not misbehave under his stern gaze.

Every Blackwood feared him—except Dominic.

But the old man adored his great-grandchildren.

The twins inherited Dominic's genes. Alexander resembled Dominic as a boy, while Isabella charmed everyone with her sweet nature and quick wit.

Their intelligence and maturity always delighted Reginald. Seeing them upset now, he demanded, "Did someone upset you? Tell your Great-Grandfather."

Alexander looked up with pleading eyes. "We miss Miss Evelyn, Great-Grandpa. Can she come live with us?"

Isabella hugged Reginald's leg. "Miss Evelyn cooks delicious food, Great-Grandpa! You'll love her cooking when she moves in!"

Reginald's expression darkened. "That Evelyn Sinclair? Stay away from her. She won't marry your father. You'll have a new mother soon. Understand?"

The traditional patriarch valued family reputation above all.

Evelyn's marriage to Maxwell Lockwood, closely connected to the Blackwoods, made her unacceptable. Even divorced, Reginald would never allow her to remarry into the family.

He refused to let Dominic, his proudest grandson, face public ridicule!

The fact that Maxwell and Evelyn's marriage had been public knowledge made it utterly impossible!

Hearing about a "new mother," Isabella burst into tears. "I don't want anyone else!" She wailed, scrambling off the couch and fleeing upstairs.

Alexander shot Reginald a resentful glare—the first time the boy had ever looked at his great-grandfather with such hostility—before chasing after his sister.

Reginald watched them go, his grip on the cane trembling slightly before he sighed deeply.

Meanwhile, across town...

Night fell with a light drizzle, chilling the air despite the city's vibrant nightlife.

In an exclusive VIP lounge...

Preston Worthington Jr. treated Olivia like his personal plaything, leaving her nearly exposed.

He ignored the hatred burning in Olivia's eyes.

Her tears had long dried up, but she guarded her body like a cornered animal. If she ever gained power over Preston, she vowed to repay this humiliation tenfold.
###Chapter 291

Preston Worthington Jr. chuckled at Olivia Kensington's furious expression. His usually composed features twisted with depravity. "Still adorable when you're mad. What's wrong? Didn't I satisfy you enough last time? Should I have been gentler?"

Olivia glared at him like he was the devil incarnate. She spat viciously, hurling curses not just at him but his entire family for producing such scum.

Her words ignited Preston's rage anew.

Earlier, when his friend Maxwell Lockwood called requesting he keep Olivia captive as leverage against Evelyn Sinclair, he'd agreed without hesitation.

Too bad for Olivia, Preston had nursed a grudge against her since their school days.

This bitch deserved everything coming to her after nearly castrating him with that kick years ago. Only sheer luck had saved him from permanent damage. Now that she was in his clutches, he'd make sure she suffered.

Preston tore Olivia's clothes off, taunting her with threats of letting his bodyguards have their way with her if she resisted.

He wanted to shatter her defiant facade, strip away her pride, and watch her beg for mercy.

But the stubborn woman shocked him. She'd rather endure his guards' assaults than let him touch her.

Pinning Olivia beneath him, Preston ignored her violent struggles.

He ripped away the last shreds of fabric covering her body. Just as he positioned himself to take her, his phone rang.

"Brother." Seeing Preston Worthington Sr.'s name, he couldn't ignore the call despite his raging arousal.

"I don't care about your usual playthings, but release the girl you're holding now." His elder brother's tone brooked no argument.

"You know I have multiple women. Which one? I was just about to—"

"Enough! Dominic Blackwood personally demanded Olivia's release. That should tell you how protected she is. Cross him and not even I can save you."

The line went dead.

Preston glared at Olivia, hesitating. Dominic's ruthless reputation gave him pause. But he wasn't about to let her go unscathed.

His lips curled into a cruel smile as he thrust violently into her.

A bloodcurdling scream filled the room. Despairing tears streamed down Olivia's face.

Meanwhile, Evelyn Sinclair awoke with a pounding headache, her body alternating between feverish heat and chills.

Each breath burned her throat—undeniable signs of a severe flu.

Blinding sunlight through undrawn curtains made her eyes water. Sparrows flitted past the window.

Attempting to rise, she found herself trapped by muscular arms.

Pressed against Dominic Blackwood's bare chest, Evelyn flushed remembering last night's intimacy. Weak from fever, she struggled futilely against his grip.

When she nearly broke free, Dominic yanked her back, their faces inches apart.

Gazing at his sculpted features, Evelyn's emotions churned.

This man always followed cruelty with honeyed words and gestures. But sugar caused cavities—the pain made her wary of accepting more.

Dominic's eyes fluttered open. He kissed her lips. "Morning, darling."

Evelyn ignored him, searching for something.

Propped on one elbow, Dominic dangled a lace camisole from his fingers, teasingly pressing the cups. "Looking for this?"

Her cheeks burned.

As she reached for it, he pulled away, leaving her gasping in frustration before falling silent.

Turning Evelyn to face him, Dominic noted her feverish flush and dry lips. All teasing vanished. "I'll get you water."

Dizziness overwhelmed her until she remembered Olivia. "Is she safe?"

Dominic handed her a glass. "Fine. You'll see her later."

Relieved, Evelyn sipped the soothing water before dressing. "What time is it? I need to work."

"Not in this state." He tucked her back in. "Rest today."

"My colleagues already resent my absences—"

"I'll fire anyone who complains." His smile didn't reach his eyes. "If I see you at the office, Olivia's fired immediately."

Evelyn seethed at his threat.

Since when did the CEO of Blackwood Enterprises resort to such thuggish tactics?
###Chapter 292

Dominic prepared an extravagant breakfast for Evelyn. His gaze lingered as she finished every bite before heading to the office.

The mansion felt hollow after his departure.

Restless, Evelyn powered up her laptop. A trending link caught her attention.

She clicked without hesitation.

It led to a forum post on Xeddit - the notorious international gossip hub where society's elite were dissected daily.

Dominic Blackwood's name had dominated discussions for years. The public's obsession with his private life was evident from the endless search results.

Evelyn scanned several threads speculating about his bachelor status. Theories ranged from him being secretly gay to having some disfiguring disease. His loyal fanbase fiercely defended him against such rumors.

She hadn't realized Dominic commanded such passionate online following.

Then a headline blazed across her screen: "SHOCKING SCANDAL! T CORPORATION CEO BRUTALIZES COUSIN AND SEDUCES HIS WIFE!"

Her stomach dropped before she even opened it.

The post had gone viral within three hours - millions of views, thousands of comments. The internet was ravenous for this juicy drama.

The username "CuckoldedHawk" made her pulse spike.

The post detailed how CuckoldedHawk had fallen madly in love with his wife, spoiled her rotten, even went to prison to fund her lavish lifestyle. Photos showed their wedding, his prison uniform, and their twin children - all faces blurred but clearly authentic.

The narrative continued: Upon release, he discovered his wife's affair with his wealthy cousin. Heartbroken, he begged her to stop. She confessed she couldn't resist her passion for his cousin.

CuckoldedHawk claimed he confronted his cousin - heir to T Corporation - only to be brutally beaten while the cousin openly flirted with his wife. Graphic injury photos showed him bandaged and intubated.

The post masterfully painted him as the tragic hero - loving husband, devoted father, now betrayed victim. His wealthy cousin emerged as the villain who stole his wife and nearly killed him.

At the post's end, a blurred photo showed a couple embracing. Though faces were obscured, Evelyn's blood ran cold.

That was her in Dominic's arms.

And those were unmistakably her children.

Fury ignited in her chest.

Whoever wrote this had dragged her babies into their sick fantasy.

The wedding photo matched one Maxwell Lockwood had tweeted. Realization struck - was this Maxwell's twisted revenge?

Her hands trembled scrolling through the comments:

"Disgusting!"
"Incestuous pigs!"
"They deserve to die!"

Then user "TruthSeeker" exposed the identities: CuckoldedHawk was Maxwell Lockwood of Lockwood Corp. The "cousin" was Dominic Blackwood. The adulterous wife? Evelyn Sinclair.

The internet exploded.
###Chapter 293

The bombshell revelation hit like a thunderbolt—Dominic Blackwood was the so-called "cousin"?

The internet erupted into chaos, dividing into three distinct factions.

Dominic's loyal fans formed the first camp, defending his impeccable reputation with fierce arguments. A man of his wealth, charm, and status could have any woman he desired. Why would he stoop to pursuing another man's wife?

The second camp consisted of his detractors. Their argument? Public personas meant nothing. Behind closed doors, even the most polished gentleman could hide monstrous secrets.

The elite world was rife with scandals—cousins, siblings, even parents and children entangled in illicit affairs. To them, the post was undeniably true.

Cynics always assumed the worst of everyone.

The third group played neutral, silently watching the drama unfold, waiting to see which side would prevail.

Within an hour, the post amassed thousands of comments, sparking heated debates that rivaled professional courtroom battles.

Evelyn Sinclair had seen the destructive power of public opinion before.

No matter what, everyone had their stance, and this storm wouldn’t die down anytime soon.

Her brows furrowed. What was CuckedTurtle’s endgame? She didn’t know, but she would never forgive them for dragging her children into this.

Innocent lives shouldn’t be collateral damage in adult wars.

She reached for her phone, but before she could dial, Dominic beat her to it.

"I saw the post," she said the moment she answered.

"Don’t worry. I’ve seen it too. I’ll handle it," Dominic assured her, his voice steady.

She didn’t know his plan, but his confidence soothed her frayed nerves.

She trusted him.

At the hospital, Maxwell Lockwood—the bandaged man from the photos—puffed on a cigarette, a sinister smirk playing on his lips as he scrolled through the raging online debate.

He turned to the scruffy young man beside his bed. "Brilliant work. I knew hiring you was the right move."

The man, in his mid-twenties, was a struggling writer who scraped by on forum romance stories. Desperate for cash, he’d taken Maxwell’s job without hesitation—especially after receiving a $20,000 advance.

Fabricating a scandal about the wealthy elite? Child’s play. Truth didn’t matter—only the paycheck did.

Maxwell handed him a card. "The remaining $180,000. There’s more where that came from, depending on how this plays out."

The writer pocketed it greedily. "Thank you, Mr. Lockwood. Let me know if you need another masterpiece."

Once alone, Maxwell crushed his cigarette, satisfaction curling through him.

You forced my hand, Dominic and Evelyn. Let’s see how you wriggle out of this one.

T Corporation’s top-floor office was a frozen tundra.

Dominic’s gaze remained locked on his laptop screen—not on business reports, but the viral Xeddit post.

Sebastian Whitmore stood nearby, nearly shivering under the oppressive chill radiating from his boss.

When Evelyn was involved, Dominic’s ruthlessness knew no bounds.

"Contact Xeddit. Have the account banned. Track down the writer and deliver him to the police. If he’s bold enough to spread lies, he’ll face the consequences." Dominic’s voice was glacial. "Summon the board. I want the Lockwood family’s assets seized immediately. If Maxwell wants to play dirty, we’ll bury him. Contact JK Media—I need to speak with Everett."

He closed his eyes briefly, masking the lethal glint in them.

When they reopened, his expression was unreadable.

Sebastian nodded swiftly and left to execute the orders.

Dominic’s gaze lingered on the blurred wedding photo in the post. A cold smirk twisted his lips.

Attack me all you want, Maxwell. But exposing my woman and my children? That was your fatal mistake.

You’re begging for destruction. And I’ll gladly oblige.

The predator had unsheathed its claws.

Lillian Prescott had just wrapped up a scene when her phone buzzed. Her closest friend—who knew all about her obsession with Dominic—sent her a cryptic link with a smirk.

Curious, Lillian clicked it.

Excitement surged through her as she read the scandalous post. Instinct told her the unnamed trio was Dominic, Evelyn, and Maxwell.

The comments confirmed it.

Truth didn’t matter. If this ruined Evelyn’s reputation, she’d take it.

Without a second thought, Lillian stripped off her costume, ignored her assistant’s protests, and stormed off set—not even bothering to inform the furious director.

Who does she think she is? the director fumed. Just because her father’s a high-ranking official doesn’t mean she can disrespect a production like this!

Lillian didn’t care. She hit the mall, splurged on designer bags and diamond jewelry, then sped to Blackwood Manor.

Beatrice Lockwood beamed at the lavish gifts. "Darling, what’s troubling you?" she asked, patting Lillian’s hand.

Lillian feigned hesitation. "Aunt Beatrice… there’s something about Dominic I don’t know if I should mention…"

Beatrice’s smile tightened. "Out with it."

With a calculated pause, Lillian handed over her phone, the damning post already pulled up.
###Chapter 294

For the first time in Dominic's career, he skipped work after the emergency shareholder's meeting.

He went to the kindergarten and picked up Alexander and Isabella, fulfilling the responsibilities of a father.

Sitting in the car, Alexander asked him curiously, "It's not the weekend today, Daddy. Why do you have time to rest?"

As far as the boy knew, his father was a workaholic who even worked on weekends sometimes.

Alexander thought it was unusual for his father to be out of his office during work hours.

"No more classes for the day, Big Bro! I'm so happy..." Isabella rested her cheeks on her hands and said excitedly.

She was at the age where she'd rather play outdoors than sit in a classroom.

Through the rearview mirror, Dominic looked at the two children sitting properly in the back seat and said, "I'll bring you two and Mommy to the theme park today. We'll go home and pick Mommy up."

The two children gasped in shock, as though they had heard something unbelievable.

Daddy is taking us to the theme park? Is the world ending? Daddy usually hates crowded places. Normally, Uncle Sebastian would be the one who takes us there.

Still, they were thrilled by Dominic's decision. They had seen other children at the theme park with both parents and had always felt a pang of sadness. Now, they would finally get to experience that too.

Is he out of his mind? That was Evelyn's first thought when she heard Dominic wanted to take them to the theme park.

But the hopeful looks in the children's eyes left her no choice but to agree.

Instead of his usual tailored suits and polished shoes, Dominic wore a white down jacket, dark jeans, and white sneakers. The casual outfit made him look years younger—like a recent college graduate.

Evelyn was reminded of the Dominic she had known in university—energetic, charming, and full of life. She remembered watching him play basketball, her heart fluttering like any girl with a crush.

Now, years later, they were together again, with two beautiful children. It felt surreal.

The theme park was less crowded on a weekday, but the lively atmosphere remained.

Though the children had been there before, today was different—their parents were with them.

Dominic bought the tickets. They passed through security and stepped inside.

The striking father held the elegant mother’s hand, their two adorable children by their sides. The perfect family of four drew admiring glances from other visitors.

They explored the attractions, and whenever they passed a food stall, the usually strict father indulged them with treats.

It was a day filled with laughter.

Hidden in the crowd, two men in baseball caps held high-definition cameras, capturing every intimate moment of the family.

Dominic was accustomed to boardrooms and high-end venues. Theme parks had never interested him—until now.

He was here for Evelyn and the children.

When they beckoned him to join their games, he hesitated. But under their expectant gazes, he reluctantly gave in.

The theme park’s indoor beach was a tropical paradise—colorful shells scattered across golden sand, artificial waves lapping at the shore under a glass dome.

Families lounged under palm trees while children splashed in the shallow water, collecting shells in little buckets.

Evelyn helped Alexander and Isabella remove their jackets and roll up their pants. She handed their things to Dominic, then led them barefoot toward the beach.

The twins instantly became the center of attention, making fast friends with other kids.

Evelyn crouched in the sand, watching them play with a soft smile. She kissed their cheeks occasionally, making them giggle. The tender scene warmed Dominic’s heart.

He pulled out his phone and discreetly recorded the moment.

Then—chaos.

A motorboat spun out of control, speeding straight toward the shore.

The young mother at the wheel screamed, "Move! I can't stop it!"

Panic erupted as people scrambled to safety.

A little boy, no older than three, stood frozen in the water, oblivious to the danger.

Evelyn didn’t hesitate.

She sprinted forward and shielded the child with her body, bracing for impact.
###Chapter 295

A strong arm suddenly yanked Evelyn and the child she was shielding away from danger.

Dominic's grip on Evelyn was iron-tight, his face drained of color. "Have you lost your mind?" His voice shook with barely contained fury. "That was reckless beyond belief!"

He'd watched in horror as the young mother fumbled with the controls, managing to halt the motorboat mere inches from Evelyn and the child. One second later would have meant catastrophe.

The sight had nearly stopped Dominic's heart.

His legs had moved before his brain registered the danger, muscles burning as he sprinted toward them. Now that the adrenaline was fading, raw terror twisted his features into something unrecognizable.

The little boy's father came barreling through the crowd, his face ashen. He'd only stepped away for a cigarette when disaster nearly struck. Seeing his only child almost crushed under the boat's hull had been his worst nightmare come to life.

Evelyn's quick thinking had saved his son.

But before he could voice his gratitude, Dominic's scolding cut through the air like a whip. The words died in the father's throat as he took in the intimidating man's thunderous expression.

Dominic's anger was a living thing, but when his gaze landed on Evelyn, it softened despite himself. "Think of Alexander and Isabella," he ground out. "Think of me. We can't lose you."

Evelyn trembled in his arms, the reality of her close call finally hitting her. "He was just a child," she whispered. "I couldn't let him..."

Isabella crashed into Evelyn's legs, her tiny frame wracked with sobs. Alexander clung to his mother's shirt, his usually composed face streaked with tears. "Don't scare us like that again," he hiccuped.

The rescued boy, taking cues from the other crying children, began wailing loudly. His father scooped him up while shooting nervous glances at Dominic.

The motorboat's driver - a frazzled young mother - kept apologizing profusely until Dominic silenced her with a glare sharp enough to cut glass. When her daughter started crying in response, Dominic's infamous impatience with children surfaced. "Enough!" he snapped.

The child's wails only intensified.

Park staff arrived to diffuse the situation. Dominic issued terse orders about safety inspections before whisking Evelyn and the twins away, his protective arm never leaving her waist.

Meanwhile at the hospital...

Serena Delacroix arched an eyebrow at the bandaged man lounging in his hospital bed. Maxwell Lockwood was currently tossing grapes into his mouth with alarming accuracy for someone supposedly at death's door.

"I came expecting a grievously injured patient," Serena drawled. "Not a man playing fruit basketball."

Maxwell caught another grape between his teeth. "Your concern touches me. But since you're here..." He leaned forward, all traces of humor vanishing. "I need your legal expertise. How do I stop Evelyn's divorce petition? And if it goes to court, what are my chances?"

Serena's lips curved. "Without Victor Langley representing her? I'd give you ninety-nine percent odds."
###Chapter 296

Serena wasn't boasting. Aside from losing to Victor a few times, she'd never lost a case against another attorney.

Maxwell smirked at her response. "My dear classmate, I recall you always topped our law school rankings while Victor trailed behind you. I assumed you'd surpass him professionally. Why hasn't that happened?"

During their university days, Serena's razor-sharp wit in mock trials had been legendary.

Victor had been brilliant too, but consistently ranked second to her.

A flicker of emotion crossed Serena's composed face at Maxwell's words before she regained control.

She knew now that Victor had let her win those academic competitions.

He'd understood how much she hated losing - how a second-place finish would darken her mood for days.

At first, she hadn't realized his deliberate concessions.

Only when she entered the real world and faced professional setbacks did she understand how he'd protected her.

Yet no amount of past kindness could erase the pain he'd caused her.

The memory of Victor with another woman made Serena's eyes flash with venom.

Victor Langley would forever remain Serena Delacroix's sworn enemy. If she suffered, she'd ensure he never knew peace again!

Shoving personal feelings aside, Serena resumed her professional demeanor. "Academic and professional success require different skills. Law school was theoretical - reality proved far more complex. Surely you understand that, Maxwell?"

He peeled an orange and offered her a segment.

When she declined, he ate it himself. "I don't care about your feud with Victor. Win this case for me by any means necessary - either defeat him in court or force his withdrawal."

Maxwell considered the second option unlikely.

As T Corporation's retained counsel, Victor obeyed Dominic's every command. If Dominic wanted Victor to destroy Maxwell and Evelyn's relationship, why would he refuse?

Serena's lips twisted into a chilling smile. "Don't worry. You'll get your victory, whatever it takes. Just wait for my good news."

Maxwell smiled at her confidence.

He couldn't wait for the showdown to begin.

Meanwhile, Vivienne was wrapping up the Regal PR crisis at the European branch. Taking a drag from her cigarette, she opened the "Major Scandal" link her department head had sent.

She studied the article carefully.

After hearing the report about Evelyn and the CEO's relationship troubles, she smiled with satisfaction.

Her little scheme had worked perfectly. Any woman would question her partner finding lingerie in his car.

Answering Evelyn's call meant for Dominic had been the cherry on top.

Evelyn must be drowning in suspicion...

The sudden scandalous news served Vivienne's purposes beautifully. Dominic might ignore public opinion to stay with Evelyn, but his family would never accept a divorced woman.

This thought comforted Vivienne.

She resolved to finish her work quickly and return to A City.

After waiting years for Dominic, she wouldn't wait any longer.

Dominic belonged to her - no one else would steal him away!

When Sebastian collected Olivia from The Glitz, her appearance shocked him.

Though he'd seen her mere days ago, the vibrant young woman had vanished. Her once-laughing eyes now stared hollowly. Bruises marred her neck - unmistakable signs of abuse.

Sebastian understood their meaning. Despite Dominic ordering Preston Sr. to release Olivia, Preston Jr. had still brutalized her.

He sighed at Olivia's frail, puppet-like form, as if she might collapse any moment.

Olivia's close friendship with Evelyn meant this incident would devastate Evelyn with guilt.

Sebastian draped his coat over Olivia's trembling shoulders.

"Let me take you shopping first, Ms. Kensington. Going home like this would be..." He trailed off, realizing words were useless.

Olivia shook her head. "Thank you, Mr. Whitmore, but just take me home."

As the car pulled away, Olivia glanced back at The Glitz - the place where she'd lost herself.

Preston Jr. had tormented her for twenty-four hours with unspeakable cruelty.

Closing her eyes, hatred burned within her.

Revenge would come.

When they reached Olivia's apartment, Sebastian stopped her. "One moment, Ms. Kensington."

"Yes?"

He hesitated before handing her a signed check for two million dollars.

Olivia stared at it. "What's this for?"

"From Mr. Blackwood. When he learned Preston Jr. had you, he immediately contacted Preston Sr. We didn't expect... Mr. Blackwood knows you're close with Ms. Sinclair. If she learned what happened because of her, she'd never forgive herself. This compensation comes with his request that you never mention the incident to her."

Olivia suddenly laughed until tears streamed down her face.

Sebastian watched helplessly as she snatched the check, exited without another word, and walked unsteadily toward her building.
###Chapter 297

Patricia Kensington was stirring a pot of soup when the front door creaked open. She wiped her hands on her apron and peeked around the kitchen doorway.

Her daughter Olivia stood in the foyer, wrapped in a man's oversized coat that drowned her petite frame. The angry purple bruises on her neck stood out against her pale skin.

The wooden spoon clattered to the floor as Patricia's face twisted in rage. Her precious Nathan was rotting in jail while her daughter was out whoring around!

"Mom." Olivia's voice was hollow with exhaustion. She barely glanced at her fuming mother before turning toward the hallway.

A sharp crack echoed through the house before Olivia registered the stinging pain across her cheek. She pressed a trembling hand to her face, staring at Patricia in disbelief.

Patricia dug her sharp fingernail into Olivia's forehead hard enough to draw blood. "Where have you been, you worthless girl? Tell me the truth - did you spread your legs for some man? I raised you to protect your purity! A woman's value lies in her virginity! Have you forgotten everything I taught you?"

Spittle flew from Patricia's lips as she screamed. To this traditional, uneducated woman, a daughter's virginity was her only bargaining chip.

Olivia had always been second to Nathan in Patricia's eyes. While her brother got an overseas education, Olivia worked three jobs to pay her local university tuition.

Daughters were financial burdens in Patricia's worldview. But with her golden boy imprisoned and legal fees piling up, she'd pinned her hopes on Olivia's untouched body.

Just last week, Patricia's friend boasted about her daughter becoming a rich man's mistress - luxury penthouse, designer handbags, endless cash. That trashy girl had worked in nightclubs! If she could land a sugar daddy, surely Olivia's virginity could fetch an even higher price.

Patricia had already enlisted her friend to scout potential buyers. The deal was supposed to be finalized this week.

Now this?

She wanted to strangle the life from her useless daughter.

The market value difference between a virgin and used goods was astronomical!

"I'm exhausted, Mom. I need to rest." Olivia's voice cracked. After everything she'd endured, her mother's first concern wasn't her wellbeing but her damaged merchandise.

Patricia grabbed a fistful of Olivia's hair and yanked hard enough to tear strands from her scalp. "Answer me! Are you still pure?"

The searing pain broke Olivia's last thread of control. "No! I was raped! Happy now?" she screamed, tears streaming down her bruised face.

Patricia froze for one stunned moment before grabbing the nearest object - a wooden rolling pin - and swinging it at her daughter's head.

"You stupid slut! Your brother's suffering in prison and you're out getting defiled? You deserved it! I was counting on you to bring in money, but you've ruined everything!"

Olivia barely dodged the blow, catching the rolling pin mid-swing. Through her tears, she stared at her mother with icy clarity. "Am I just a paycheck to you? Aren't I your child too? Why does Nathan get everything while I get nothing?"

"Don't you dare speak about your brother!" Patricia shrieked. "He's in jail because of that Evelyn Sinclair! Instead of earning money to help him, you waste time with that tramp! You want to kill me with stress!"

"Nathan committed a crime! He tried to drug Evelyn for his pervert friends! He's getting exactly what he deserves!" Olivia spat back.

Patricia's face purpled with rage. She lunged at Olivia, nails raking bloody lines down her daughter's face.

"Your brother needs money for his appeal! Now that you're spoiled goods, you're worthless! If you've already opened your legs, you might as well make money from it! Find a rich client - consider it repaying your debt for raising you!"

Olivia stared at her mother's greedy expression, the crumpled check burning in her palm. Her own mother wanted to pimp her out. The grotesque irony shattered what remained of her heart.

She threw the check at Patricia's face. "You want me to whore myself out? Here's your blood money!"

As she limped toward her bedroom, every step sent fresh pain radiating through her battered body.

Patricia barely noticed her daughter's agony. She snatched up the check, gasped at the amount, and immediately grabbed her purse to rush to the bank - abandoning her half-cooked dinner and traumatized daughter without a second thought.

Meanwhile, Evelyn paced her apartment after learning Sebastian had rescued Olivia. She needed to see her friend, needed to know she was safe.

Dominic stopped her at the door. "Olivia's been through hell. Give her a few days to recover before visiting. She won't want you seeing her like this."

Guilt gnawed at Evelyn. Olivia had suffered because of her. How could she rest without seeing her friend's condition with her own eyes?

After Dominic took the twins back to Blackwood Manor, Evelyn tried calling Olivia repeatedly. No answer - Xavier had confiscated her phone.

Unable to wait another minute, Evelyn hailed a cab to the Kensington residence.
###Chapter 298

The moment the bank teller processed the check, Evelyn felt like she was floating on air.

She'd fully expected the check to bounce, but to her shock, the bank staff treated her with utmost respect.

The funds transferred into her account without any issues.

Evelyn withdrew $100,000 in crisp bills and left the remainder in her account.

For the first time in her life, she hailed a cab instead of taking the bus.

Sitting in the backseat, Evelyn pinched her arm repeatedly to confirm she wasn't dreaming.

The cab driver kept glancing at the middle-aged woman clutching a suspiciously full snakeskin purse while pinching herself.

"Keep your eyes on the road!" Evelyn snapped, hugging her purse tighter. Her shrill voice revealed her true petty nature.

She didn't care where her daughter Olivia got this money - whether from selling her body or selling her soul. Money was money.

Evelyn planned to cook Olivia's favorite dishes tonight. If she played her cards right, maybe she could squeeze more money out of her daughter to bribe prison officials.

The driver merely shook his head, refusing to engage with the unpleasant woman. Unfortunately, the bumpy construction zone road made for a rough ride.

Evelyn was still cursing when they reached the apartment complex.

"Learn how to drive, you imbecile!" she shrieked.

Her vulgar tirade drew shocked stares from neighbors. People quickly crossed the street to avoid the screeching harpy.

Patricia Kensington happened to be arriving just as Evelyn's outburst reached its peak.

Her frown deepened when she recognized Olivia's mother. Though she wanted to ignore the woman, she forced herself to approach.

"Mrs. Kensington, is Olivia home?"

Evelyn whirled around, ready to unleash her fury on the interloper. When she saw Patricia, her face twisted with rage.

"You! First you destroy my son, now you come for my daughter?" she screamed, practically foaming at the mouth.

If she'd had a knife, she might have stabbed Patricia right then.

"My son wouldn't be in prison if not for you!"

"Your son belongs in prison," Patricia said coldly. "I'm here to see Olivia, not argue with you."

Before their breakup, Evelyn had eagerly believed neighborhood gossip that Patricia was cheating. She'd even condoned Nathan's affair with Sophia. Patricia had no respect left for this woman.

But out of respect for Olivia, she tried to walk away.

Evelyn blocked her path, swinging her heavy purse. "Get lost, you homewrecker! My son loved you, and you betrayed him! You should be the one in prison!"

The purse connected with Patricia's shoulder, leaving angry red marks on her neck.

Bystanders watched but didn't intervene. Everyone knew better than to get between Evelyn and her prey.

Patricia finally grabbed Evelyn's wrists. "Enough! I won't hold back anymore!"

"You slut!" Evelyn shrieked. "You cheated on my son with some rich man and framed him! How dare you show your face here?"

The crowd murmured, some looking at Patricia with new suspicion.

Patricia's expression darkened. "Aren't you ashamed of these lies? Your son drugged me and tried to pimp me out to his friends! He belongs in prison!"

The crowd's sympathy immediately shifted.

"So that's why the Kensington boy went to jail!"
"With a mother like that, no wonder he turned out rotten."
"We should petition to have them evicted!"

Evelyn's face purpled with rage.

Patricia turned to leave, knowing she wouldn't see Olivia today. Suddenly, Evelyn hurled her purse.

The overstuffed bag burst upon impact, raining cash everywhere.

Patricia stepped over the scattered bills without a backward glance.

The onlookers immediately began scooping up the money and fleeing.

Evelyn's screams of rage soon turned to wails of despair as she watched her fortune disappear.
###Chapter 299

Evelyn couldn't see Olivia. The realization brought no relief.

Yet she felt powerless against Patricia. The woman harbored deep resentment toward Evelyn, making rational conversation impossible. But as Olivia's mother, Evelyn couldn't retaliate.

Her thoughts turned to Abigail.

If Abigail visited Olivia, Patricia would have no grounds to turn her away, no matter how unreasonable she might be.

Evelyn called Abigail, carefully explaining that Olivia had fallen ill.

She mentioned Patricia's grudge against her, making her own visit inappropriate. That's why she asked Abigail to go in her place.

The truth about Olivia's abduction remained unspoken. No woman would want such trauma publicly known.

Abigail agreed immediately, promising to visit after work. She requested Olivia's address.

Exhausted physically and mentally, Evelyn finally reached her apartment.

Slippers on, she stepped into the shower. Hot water stung the scratches on her neck. She ignored the pain - trivial compared to Olivia's suffering.

Eyes closing, Evelyn's anger flared.

This was all Maxwell's doing!

His obsession had harmed both her and her best friend. Unforgivable. She'd kill him herself if necessary.

Meanwhile, storm clouds gathered over Blackwood Manor.

Dominic returned with the twins to find Reginald Blackwood seated grimly in the parlor, cane in hand.

Beatrice Lockwood, as always, flaunted new crystal bracelets while applying makeup, unintentionally provoking Margaret Lockwood.

Julian sat unusually solemn, far from his typical carefree demeanor.

He shot Dominic a warning glance: "Grandfather knows about the Xeddit scandal. Brace yourself."

Dominic ignored the silent warning, gently patting the children's heads.

The twins rushed to their great-grandfather, their cheerful greetings instantly softening Reginald's stern expression, nearly making him forget his intended interrogation.

Margaret snorted derisively. "Finally decided to show your face? The entire internet knows how Young Master Blackwood assaulted his cousin and seduced his cousin's wife! Like mother, like son indeed. Our family's reputation lies in ruins. Don't you have anything to say, Father?"

Beatrice's frown deepened. "How can you believe internet gossip, Margaret? Everyone knows my son's accomplishments. Why would he need to chase married women? That gold-digging Evelyn Sinclair is clearly the one pursuing him!"

She glanced proudly at Dominic. Many society daughters coveted him, even Lillian Prescott, daughter of the Provincial Committee Secretary. Her son needed no cheap temptations.

"Hypocrite! Have you forgotten your own humble origins?" Margaret sneered.

Beatrice's jaw tightened. "Are you deliberately provoking me, Margaret Armstrong?"

"Evelyn is my woman," Dominic's icy voice cut through. "You will show her respect."

Beatrice paled at being publicly chastised, especially before Margaret. "Don't be fooled, son. She's a selfish social climber unworthy of you."

Dominic's glacial stare silenced further protests.

Turning to Reginald and Beatrice, he declared firmly: "Whether you accept Evelyn or not, she's the only woman for me - the only mother my children will ever have."

Alexander discreetly gave his father an admiring thumbs-up.

Well done, Daddy! Standing up to Great-Grandfather and Grandmother's tantrums. You're fighting for our family.
###Chapter 300

Reginald Blackwood's face turned crimson with rage when Dominic declared he would marry no one but Evelyn Sinclair. His cane struck Dominic's shoulder with a sharp crack. "Ungrateful wretch! You'd disgrace our family with that scandalous woman? Have you considered how this will tarnish the Blackwood name? Do you want us to become A City's laughingstock?"

Dominic stood unwavering. His next words ignited his grandfather's fury further. "What reputation do we currently possess, Grandfather?"

His pointed glance toward Beatrice Lockwood and Margaret Lockwood on the sofa spoke volumes.

The air thickened with tension.

What modern man maintained two concurrent wives?

Reginald gasped for breath, clutching his chest. Julian Blackwood quickly patted his back. "Grandfather, your blood pressure—the doctor warned against agitation. Another episode will land you back in hospital... Ow!"

Reginald's cane connected with Julian's skull, eliciting a yelp. The younger man rubbed his head, shooting his grandfather a wounded look.

The patriarch's glare silenced him. "Quiet, you! Your brother infuriates me, but you're no saint either. Weekly tabloid scandals with starlets—do you think this doddering old man can't discipline you?" Julian swallowed his protest.

"Why am I catching strays when we're discussing Dominic?"

Margaret Lockwood bristled at her son's chastisement. "Father, be fair! Who barred Julian from corporate affairs? Dominic monopolizes Blackwood Enterprises while Julian's left with an empty 'Vice President' title. His frustration drives him to seek distractions. If Julian helmed the company—"

The injustice burned. Her son should've inherited everything, not that bastard child of Beatrice Lockwood's. Two decades hadn't dulled the sting.

Julian groaned. "Mother, spare me! I'd bankrupt us within a quarter. Never suggest this again or I'm moving out."

Beatrice's lips curled in triumph.

The legitimate wife bore a worthless heir.

Reginald's shoulders slumped. He'd failed Julian. The boy lacked Dominic's ruthless business acumen. Past attempts letting Julian manage subsidiaries ended in spectacular failure. Handing him Blackwood Enterprises would be corporate suicide.

"Enough. Starting tomorrow, you'll shadow Dominic. No more squandering your life!" Reginald commanded.

Julian blanched. "Work? At my age? Surely you jest—"

"Twenty-seven isn't a child! Must I beat responsibility into you?" The raised cane silenced further protests.

Dominic observed coldly. These theatrics were routine. Only with Evelyn did he experience true family. The thought softened his gaze.

"Grandfather, Mother—my decision stands. I'll marry Evelyn Sinclair or no one." With that, he ascended the staircase with the twins.

The suffocating tension below warranted no further engagement.

Reginald's outrage choked him as Dominic departed. His trembling hands gripped the cane.

Dominic paused. "Julian, summon Dr. Whitmore. Grandfather needs sedation."

Beatrice's expression darkened at Evelyn's name. That gutter rat would never be her daughter-in-law.

Meanwhile, at Café Lumière...

Victor Langley adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses. His tailored suit and polished Oxfords drew admiring glances from nearby patrons.

His fingers drummed the marble table. The composed facade belied his racing pulse.

Serena Delacroix's call had seemed a cruel joke—until she materialized before him, as icy and unattainable as two decades prior.

"Long overdue," Serena said, seating herself. Her controlled gaze masked seething hatred.

"You've been... well?" Victor's throat constricted.

The nation's top attorney stammered like a schoolboy.

Serena's mocking smile cut deep. "Spare the pleasantries. I'm here to demand you withdraw from Evelyn Sinclair's defense."

"That's impossible—" Victor's protest died as she produced a manila envelope.

"Read this first."

The document inside turned his blood to ice. His hands shook violently as comprehension dawned—along with unbearable agony.
###Chapter 301

Dominic Blackwood's office, T Corporation.

"Mr. Blackwood, I must decline representing Ms. Sinclair in her divorce case." Victor Langley stood stiffly before Dominic's desk, guilt twisting his expression.

He owed his current reputation to Dominic, yet here he was, refusing a direct request.

Victor stole a glance at his employer.

Dominic lounged in his chair, the floor-to-ceiling windows framing him in golden sunlight. Smoke curled from his cigarette, his furrowed brows the only sign of displeasure.

"Reason?" Dominic tapped his cigarette, voice flat.

"Serena Delacroix is back." Victor's fist clenched. "I owe her too much. She... lost her womb because of me. I never realized the damage I caused. She's never asked for anything—until now."

"Serena is representing Maxwell Lockwood?" Dominic cut straight to the point.

"Yes." Victor's jaw tightened.

Dominic knew their history.

Serena was brilliant but ruthless, a lawyer who thrived on loopholes. She took any case if the price was right, regardless of morality. Her reputation was as controversial as it was formidable.

Victor continued, "I've already contacted Alistair Thornton from Viva Law Firm. He specializes in international cases and has agreed to take over Ms. Sinclair's divorce. Here's his file."

He slid a folder across the desk.

Dominic didn't open it immediately. His silence stretched, heavy with contemplation.

"Fine. Thornton handles it."

Victor exhaled in relief—until Dominic spoke again.

"Close this chapter with Serena. You're indulging her now, but the world won't. She won't always find someone willing to bend for her."

Victor paused at the door, sighed, and left without another word.

Lillian Prescott was mid-dinner with her parents when the detective called.

She glanced nervously at Jonathan and Genevieve, engrossed in conversation, then slipped onto the balcony.

Genevieve handed Jonathan a chicken wing, watching her daughter with amusement. "Our girl has secrets now. Must be that crush of hers calling."

"Lillian's not a child anymore," Jonathan grumbled. "She should settle down, leave that frivolous industry. A woman's place is at home."

He was old-fashioned, blunt in his views. He'd pursued Genevieve without pretense, and their whirlwind romance had led to a swift marriage.

Genevieve, elegant and sharp, had once dreamed of stardom herself. But she didn't argue. "That young man—Dominic Blackwood. Handsome in magazines, but how is he in person?"

Jonathan brightened. "Just as striking as our Lillian. Only issue? He's got two five-year-olds."

"That's no obstacle. Lillian adores children. If she struggles, we'll take them. I'd love to."

Genevieve's voice softened. A traumatic birth had left her infertile—a wound that never fully healed.

Lillian returned, hurriedly grabbing her coat. "Work emergency. Don't wait up."

Jonathan frowned. "It's late. Who are you meeting?"

He was strict. Work was one thing, but nighttime outings? Unacceptable.

Lillian forced patience. "My agent. There's an issue with the script. I'll be back in an hour."

Jonathan's frown deepened. He despised the entertainment world, considering it beneath their status. But Genevieve had supported Lillian's career, leaving him outvoted.

Genevieve stopped her, wrapping a scarf around her neck. "Come home soon, darling."
###Chapter 302

Evelyn Sinclair was unrecognizable beneath layers of disguise. A chunky knit cap, oversized scarf, medical mask, and dark sunglasses concealed her delicate features. No one would suspect this frumpy figure was the glamorous actress from magazine covers.

She slipped into the private booth where a rugged man waited. His sharp cheekbones and thick beard gave him a dangerous air, but the warmth in his eyes betrayed his kind nature.

"Any news?" Evelyn demanded as she sat. Her fingers tapped anxiously against the table. The past week had been torture - what if her adoptive parents' biological daughter suddenly appeared to claim her rightful place?

The investigator slid a folder across the table. "We found hospital records from your mother's delivery. Also tracked down staff who worked that night." He paused dramatically. "Your parents' biological daughter...she's alive."

The words struck Evelyn like lightning. Her hands trembled violently as she gripped the documents. "Alive? Where is she?" Her voice cracked with barely contained hysteria.

The man recoiled slightly at the venom in her bloodshot eyes. Catching herself, Evelyn forced a serene smile. "My parents have grieved for so long. Finding their real daughter would bring them such joy." She dabbed at imaginary tears. "Please, find my sister quickly. I want to compensate for all her suffering..."

Though moved by her performance, the investigator remained professional. His shrewd eyes gleamed as he rubbed his fingers together. "Twenty-year-old records don't come cheap, Ms. Prescott. My team has invested considerable resources already. With additional funding..."

Evelyn understood perfectly. She transferred a substantial sum from her phone without hesitation. "There will be more when you deliver results."

"Your generosity honors you," the man smiled. "Any sister would be lucky to have you."

Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes. After decades missing, why would that woman reappear now? She couldn't allow anyone to steal her privileged position.

Meanwhile, Evelyn's children Alexander and Isabella cuddled with their mother on the sofa, giggling over theme park photos. The twins took turns mocking each other's expressions.

"Look how grumpy Brother is!" Isabella pointed. "All those girls chasing him and he's making such an ugly face!"

Evelyn chuckled at the image - her handsome son surrounded by adoring girls, his nose wrinkled in distaste as they tugged his clothes. She worried - if he was this popular at five, what chaos would his looks cause as an adult?

Alexander retaliated by finding embarrassing shots of his sister - crying on rides, making silly faces, pouting after losing a game. "Who's ugly now?" he teased.

Isabella stuck out her tongue. "If I'm ugly, you're uglier! We share the same face!"

Dominic watched this domestic scene with quiet contentment. Setting aside his financial reports, he noticed Evelyn's pensive expression. "Something troubling you?"

She showed him the photo album. "Our theme park memories."

Dominic's gaze softened as he flipped through pages of his laughing family. "Beautiful," he murmured. Her presence had brought light to their lives.

Evelyn hesitated before voicing her long-held doubts. "Dominic...those panties in your car. And when I called your business trip, a woman answered." Her fingers tightened around the album. "I need to know the truth."
###Chapter 303

Dominic was at a complete loss.

Since when had there been lacy underwear in his car?

He racked his brain but couldn't recall anything.

As a clean freak, no stray clothing should exist in his vehicle. The only women who'd ridden in his car recently were his mother Beatrice, Evelyn, and little Isabella.

Isabella was just a child - certainly not wearing lace panties.

Evelyn noticed his confusion. "I found them under the passenger seat when searching for Isabella's math workbook... black lace panties."

She stood abruptly and retrieved the evidence from their bedroom.

Those panties had been gnawing at Evelyn for days.

If she didn't confront him now, the suspicion would consume her.

Dominic frowned. "Aren't those yours? Maybe you left them there?"

"Do you think I'd be asking if they were mine?" Evelyn countered.

Dominic's mind raced.

Evelyn continued, "And when you were handling that crisis in Brussels, I called late one night. A woman answered saying you were showering and demanded to know who I was..."

His brow furrowed sharply.

Suddenly he remembered - Vivienne had asked to stop at a drugstore after their business dinner. Had she planted the underwear then?

The realization sent ice through his veins.

If true, Ms. Laurent had gravely miscalculated.

No one touched his phone without permission.

During that Brussels trip, only Vivienne had accessed his suite. Yet his call logs showed no answered calls.

Dominic saw the truth in Evelyn's eyes. She wouldn't fabricate this. One incident might be coincidence. Two? Deliberate sabotage.

To Dominic, Vivienne was all business. Despite numerous suitors, she'd always rebuffed advances.

He couldn't fathom her pursuing someone clearly devoted to another.

But if this was her doing... what was the endgame?

Should Vivienne be behind this, she'd find herself permanently reassigned overseas.

Seizing his moment, Dominic pulled Evelyn onto his lap.

She stiffened, unprepared for intimacy while unsettled. But his intense gaze trapped her.

"Dominic! The children..."

His lips found her earlobe, drawing an involuntary shiver.

She glanced at Alexander and Isabella, engrossed in their block tower. Still, heat flooded her cheeks.

"Not now..." Her protest emerged breathless.

Dominic tilted her chin up, his eyes burning into hers. "Do you trust me, Evelyn? I swear I'll uncover the truth. All I need is your faith. Understand?"

Evelyn drowned in those earnest depths.

The tenderness there melted her resolve.

Was this love?

With Dominic, she longed to cling forever. But losing herself in him would make her a burden.

She'd worked hard to stand independently beside him.

Drawing strength, she met his gaze. "I trust you. I've never regretted choosing you. But we must be equals - no betrayals. Some wounds never heal."

Dominic's lips pressed thin.

Her words struck deep. Behind her strength lay fragility.

Infidelity would shatter her completely.

Cradling her wrist, he stroked her hair. "Understood."

A vow to them both.

Evelyn couldn't know she'd been his only woman since his cynical youth.

His fingers guided her face upward. The kiss started gentle, then his teeth grazed her neck, drawing a gasp.

Dominic wanted more.

Lost in the moment, Evelyn suddenly noticed two wide-eyed spectators. She shoved him away, mortified.

Alexander bounded over. "Daddy, why were you eating Mommy's mouth? Did she have candy? Can we have some too?"

His little face scrunched in confusion.

Why was Daddy licking Mommy like that?

Was she hiding treats from them?

Daddy hated sweets - it must be something really special!
###Chapter 304

Alexander's eyes lit up with excitement at the sudden realization.

Though a boy, he shared his sister Isabella's sweet tooth. Mommy's lips looked deliciously tempting, especially with how Daddy seemed to savor them. He wondered if the candy hidden in Mommy's mouth tasted as good as it looked.

Bright as he was, Alexander was still too young to understand kissing. The only explanation his young mind could conjure was that Daddy must be stealing candy from Mommy's mouth.

"I want to taste the candy in your mouth too, Mommy! What flavor is it?" Isabella bounced over to Evelyn, staring intently at her lips.

"N-no, sweetheart, we weren't eating candy." Evelyn's cheeks burned. How did one explain this to curious five-year-olds?

She shot Dominic a helpless glance, but he merely shrugged, equally at a loss.

They really needed to check if the kids were around before getting carried away.

This wasn't the first time their intimate moments got interrupted. Dominic made a mental note - two children were more than enough. Any more of these perceptive little rascals would be downright troublesome.

Alexander and Isabella studied their parents with skeptical expressions, tiny brows furrowed in suspicion.

Evelyn knelt to their eye level. "Daddy was kissing Mommy, just like how I kiss your cheeks. It's how grown-ups show love. Understand?"

The twins were precocious. Alexander's large eyes darted thoughtfully before comprehension dawned.

Daddy's kiss was different from Mommy's, but it still meant love. That made him happy.

"So that's how you show love? When we grow up, can Brother and I kiss like that too?" Isabella asked innocently.

"Only mommies and daddies—" Evelyn began.

Dominic's expression darkened. He scooped Isabella up like a misbehaving kitten.

"Didn't you have unfinished homework? No dinner until it's done."

Isabella squirmed indignantly. "Mean Daddy! Always threatening me!"

Still, she obediently trudged off to her room. Nothing came between her and mealtime.

Alexander clung to Evelyn protectively, glaring at Dominic. When his father turned, the boy tightened his grip.

"What's this about, Alexander Blackwood?" Dominic raised an eyebrow.

Alexander's gaze turned accusatory. "No more kissing Mommy!"

"Why not?"

"Look!" The boy pointed angrily. "Mommy's lips are all swollen! It must hurt!"

Dominic studied Evelyn's slightly puffy lips, then smirked at his son. "Doesn't hurt. Mommy likes it."

Evelyn ignored his teasing, hugging Alexander tighter while vowing to keep the kids occupied during private moments.

"Liar!" Alexander stomped. "Shame on you for lying! Mommy's sad! She doesn't like rough treatment!"

Dominic rolled his eyes but turned a smoldering gaze on Evelyn. "Is Mommy sad? The rougher I am, the more she loves it."

Alexander found Daddy's look utterly detestable.

Taking a deep breath, the boy wrapped his arms around Evelyn's neck. "I'll protect you, Mommy. Bad Daddy won't hurt you again. Does it hurt when you eat? How do we make the swelling go down?"

Evelyn's heart melted. "It doesn't hurt, sweetheart. Daddy isn't hurting Mommy. He loves me just like you do."

These two caring, brilliant children were heaven's greatest gifts.

Alexander relaxed slightly but maintained his scowl. "Only forgiving you because Mommy said so, Daddy. Next time, I won't be nice."

Dominic gave an indifferent shrug before his expression softened into something tender when looking at Evelyn.

Satisfied, Alexander scampered off to join his sister.

Grown-up talk time.

Meanwhile, Frederick Lockwood sat in his corporate office, listening to grim reports.

Stress lined his face.

"Mr. Lockwood, T Corporation has outbid us on every contract. Our financial outlook is dire." Manager A wiped his brow.

"Customs is holding our major shipment hostage," Manager B added. "Our liquidity is frozen, and banks refuse loans."

Manager C sighed. "Stock prices have plummeted. Shareholders are panicking as T Corporation buys up shares. Mr. Blackwood is your nephew, sir. What misunderstanding could prompt such aggression?"

Frederick's expression darkened.

How should he know what that mad nephew of his was thinking?

Dominic had always ignored Lockwood Enterprises. Why this sudden ruthless campaign? Was he determined to destroy his own uncle?
###Chapter 305

The Grand Marquis Hotel.

Dominic Blackwood had learned from his aunt Beatrice that his cousin Maxwell was attending a business conference at the luxury hotel. Without hesitation, he headed straight there.

He waited patiently in the lobby until the meeting concluded. When the doors opened, Dominic immediately spotted Maxwell emerging with his entourage of executives.

Each person in the group was accomplished in their own right, yet Maxwell's commanding presence and unreadable expression made him stand out effortlessly.

"Maxwell," Frederick Lockwood called out.

Recognizing his uncle, Maxwell dismissed his associates with a wave. The lobby emptied quickly, leaving only the two men standing amidst the marble columns.

"Is there something you need, Uncle Frederick?" Maxwell asked, though he already knew the purpose of this visit.

"Tell me what I've done to offend you, Maxwell. Are you determined to destroy my life's work? What must I do to make you spare Lockwood Enterprises?" Frederick's voice carried the weight of desperation.

The past few days had aged Frederick visibly. Dark circles shadowed his eyes, and new wrinkles creased his forehead. His company teetered on the brink of collapse, and he found himself begging his nephew for mercy.

Dominic's lips curled into a cold smile. "You're asking the wrong person, Uncle. If you want answers, go ask that precious son of yours."

Had Maxwell simply signed the divorce papers and promised to leave Evelyn Sinclair alone, Dominic might have shown mercy. Family ties alone prevented him from completely annihilating Lockwood Enterprises.

But Maxwell had crossed a line this time. By targeting not just Evelyn but also involving Alexander and Isabella, Dominic had moved swiftly to cripple the company.

Frederick's face turned ashen. "Maxwell? What has that useless boy done now?" His hands trembled at his sides.

"Your son hired people to spread malicious lies online, damaging both my reputation and Evelyn's. Worse, he dragged my children into this. They're innocent in all this. Consider this your final warning - discipline him before I'm forced to."

The revelation hit Frederick like a physical blow. He staggered back, bracing himself against a nearby pillar. "You're doing all this... for Evelyn Sinclair?"

Dominic nodded once.

"How could you turn against your own family for some woman?" Frederick's voice cracked with disbelief. He'd always admired his nephew's business acumen.

Why would the normally rational Dominic become so unreasonable over a woman? And to attack his uncle's company because of her?

Frederick never imagined his decades of business experience could be undone so quickly by his nephew. Lockwood Enterprises had stood for nearly thirty years - how could it collapse in mere days?

"You have twenty-four hours, Uncle. The company might survive if Maxwell signs the divorce agreement. Otherwise, don't blame me for what comes next." With that, Dominic strode past his uncle without another glance.

Frederick's hands shook as he dialed Beatrice's number.

At Blackwood Manor, Beatrice Lockwood sat rigidly on an antique chaise lounge, her expression stormy. The only other occupants were her son and the household staff.

The matriarch's teacup sat untouched before her as she glared at Dominic across the coffee table.

"Mother." Dominic remained unfazed by her obvious displeasure.

"Don't call me that!" Beatrice snapped. "I have no son who would betray his own family! Frederick is your uncle - how could you attack his company?"

Dominic remained calm. "Lockwood Enterprises was already failing. Outdated management, poor decisions, stubborn leadership. Their financial records are a disaster. Even without my intervention, they wouldn't have lasted another two years."

"I don't care about any of that!" Beatrice slammed her palm on the table. "You will not lay another finger on your uncle's company!"

Her anger stemmed more from self-preservation than true familial concern. Coming from humble beginnings, Beatrice had clawed her way into high society through marriage. Without Lockwood Enterprises as her backing, she'd lose what little standing she had among the elite.

Just as Beatrice prepared another tirade, a melodic voice interrupted from the doorway.

"Aunt Beatrice? I came to visit you."

Dominic's expression darkened instantly at the sound.

Beatrice's face lit up. "Lillian! Come in, darling!" she called eagerly.

Lillian Prescott glided into the room, dressed in an elegant white fur coat with subtle makeup - precisely the demure look Beatrice favored.

The older woman's eyes gleamed with approval as she took in the perfect candidate for her daughter-in-law...
###Chapter 306

Lillian Prescott moved with effortless grace. Every gesture carried an air of sophistication. "It's been too long, Aunt Beatrice."

Her voice softened when she noticed Dominic's presence. "You're here as well, Mr. Blackwood..."

Dominic gave her a polite nod.

Beatrice rose to greet her warmly. "Make yourself comfortable, Lillian. This isn't the office—no need for formalities. Call him Dominic."

"Is that really appropriate?" Lillian's question was directed at Beatrice, but her shy gaze flickered toward Dominic.

Beatrice took Lillian's delicate hand, excitement bubbling in her voice. "It's just a name. He's not the type to fuss over something so trivial! I was just wondering why you hadn't visited in over a week, and here you are."

Dominic's brow furrowed slightly.

He hadn't realized his mother had grown so close to Lillian.

A faint blush colored Lillian's porcelain cheeks at Beatrice's words. "I brought you a gift, Aunt Beatrice. Remember that ruby tiara we saw at the jeweler last month? It was sold out, but when I visited again, they had a similar design. I thought of you immediately."

She produced an ornate wooden box and handed it over.

Beatrice opened it—there lay the exact tiara she'd coveted.

The piece was exquisite, crafted with floral motifs, adorned with pearls and sparkling gemstones. Each stone gleamed under the light, luxurious without being garish.

Beatrice was enchanted.

Though she lacked refined manners, she had an eye for fashion. When silent, she could easily pass for high society.

She traced the tiara with reverence. "You're too thoughtful, Lillian. If only my son showed half your consideration."

Lillian smiled sweetly. "I'm sure Dominic adores you, Aunt Beatrice. He's just preoccupied with work."

The reassurance soothed Beatrice.

She placed the tiara atop her perfectly styled curls and posed. "How do I look, Lillian?"

Dressed in a deep-blue couture gown, Beatrice radiated timeless elegance. Age hadn't dimmed her beauty—only refined it.

"Stunning," Lillian praised. "The tiara suits you perfectly, and the gown is divine."

Beatrice beamed. "Such flattery! I'd kill for a daughter like you. Dominic picked this gown for my birthday."

"His taste is impeccable," Lillian continued smoothly. "I could never have chosen something so fitting."

"If you like it, I'll have him get you one too," Beatrice offered.

Lillian lowered her lashes, silent.

Beatrice sighed dramatically. "I should've had a daughter. Look how sweet Lillian is—remembering my preferences. What do you ever do besides vex me?"

Dominic didn't respond. He reclined on the sofa, eyes fixed on the financial news.

As Lillian chatted with Beatrice, her gaze kept drifting toward Dominic. The longing in her eyes was unmistakable.

Beatrice noticed but said nothing. Their conversation stretched on.

When the hour grew late, Lillian rose to leave.

Rain pattered outside, the north wind biting. Stepping from warmth into the chill, Lillian shivered. Beatrice insisted she stay, but Lillian knew her father expected her home.

Seizing an opportunity, Beatrice turned to her son. "I won't sleep a wink knowing she's traveling in this weather. Escort her home."

Despite the cold, the city pulsed with life. Traffic flowed steadily on the expressway.

Blackwood Manor stood east of the city, nearly an hour from the Prescott residence.

Lillian's heart raced as she settled into the plush leather seat, warmth enveloping her.

She glanced at the striking man behind the wheel. "Thank you for this," she murmured.

"Don't mention it," Dominic replied flatly.

His expression darkened at the congested road ahead.

Why is everyone out tonight?

All he wanted was to be with Evelyn, free from pretense.

Silence stretched between them.

Lillian attempted conversation, but Dominic's disinterest was palpable. Eventually, she quieted, inhaling his crisp, masculine scent.

Lost in fantasies of how to bridge the distance between them, she was startled when the car halted.

"We're here." Dominic parked before the Prescott estate.

Lillian blinked at the gates, then at his chiseled profile. Impulsively, she leaned in—brushing her lips against his cheek—then fled, face burning.

Dominic froze. Disgust twisted his features. He snatched a handkerchief, scrubbing at his skin before tossing it into the trash.

The silver car roared to life, vanishing into the night like a shadow.
###Chapter 307

Midnight.

Maxwell dialed Preston's number. "You let Olivia go?" His voice was tight with barely contained fury.

"My brother called. Said to release her immediately." Preston's words slurred slightly from exhaustion. "Couldn't disobey him. Don't worry though - got her compromising photos. Just say the word if you need them."

"Whatever. We'll talk later." Maxwell ended the call abruptly, crushing the phone in his grip.

Olivia had been his crucial bargaining chip against Evelyn. Now that leverage was gone, his control over the situation slipping through his fingers.

Dominic's relentless attacks on their family business felt like a personal vendetta. The Blackwood Group was systematically dismantling Lockwood Corporation brick by brick. The pressure was unbearable.

Just as he tossed his phone aside, it rang again.

Frederick Lockwood's name flashed on the screen. Maxwell's jaw clenched. Nothing good ever came from his father's calls.

The ringing persisted.

With a resigned sigh, he answered. "Yes, Father?"

"You worthless brat! How much more trouble will you bring upon us?" Frederick's roar vibrated through the receiver. "Do you have any idea what you've done? Challenging Dominic Blackwood? The man shows no mercy in business!"

"Why do you always blame me?" Maxwell snapped. "He's the one at fault here!"

Frederick's breathing grew labored. "I only discovered why we're under attack today. Dominic made it crystal clear - this is about that Sinclair woman. Can't you think beyond your selfish desires? Must you wage war over some girl?"

"You've got it backwards, Father. I'm not starting this fight. He's stealing what's rightfully mine. My marriage to Evelyn is legally binding. Dominic's the homewrecker here. Tell me, who's really in the wrong?"

"Just stop this madness, son! You're outmatched. Listen to me - divorce Evelyn. You're young, you'll find someone better. If Dominic wants her, let him have her." Frederick's voice broke. "Must you watch everything I've built over thirty years crumble to dust?"

In the Lockwood mansion's cavernous living room, Frederick collapsed onto a sofa, suddenly looking a decade older. Lorraine sighed beside him.

The air hung heavy with despair.

Frederick's gaze drifted to the family portrait. His handsome son had always been willful, but obedient when it mattered. Now grown, the boy had become a stranger - reckless, uncontrollable.

This stubborn arrogance would be Maxwell's undoing.

"Don't worry about me, Father. I'll handle everything - the company included. I'm busy now. Goodbye." The line went dead before Frederick could respond.

Frederick nearly collapsed from rage.

He turned on Lorraine. "This is your doing! How you raised him! I've been cleaning up his messes since childhood. Now our company faces ruin because of him. Your coddling made him this way!"

Lorraine's eyes flashed with fury. She jabbed a finger at her husband. "How dare you, Frederick Lockwood! I spoiled him? And you're blameless? If not for your—"

Her tirade continued, accusations flying. The scene descended into chaos - Lorraine shrieking insults, hurling objects. Frederick finally stormed out, slamming the door behind him, leaving his wife sobbing on the floor.

A maid timidly helped Lorraine up.

Meanwhile, in a dimly lit apartment, a disheveled young man hunched over his keyboard. Gideon Whitmore's fingers flew across the keys as he navigated the dark web's periphery.

"Strange... where'd all my posts go?" he muttered.

Every attempt to locate his client's commissioned content failed. Search terms yielded nothing. Either his connection dropped, or legal block notifications appeared.

Gideon was no ordinary blogger. A self-taught hacker, he'd infiltrated police networks undetected. That technical prowess made him Maxwell's perfect digital mercenary.

But now, for the first time, sweat beaded on Gideon's forehead. His posts had vanished without a trace. His pulse raced with growing dread.

He wasn't superstitious, yet an ominous feeling settled in his gut.

Opening his notes, he prepared to repost on Reddit. But even his custom backdoor programs failed. The system rejected every attempt.

Gideon's hands trembled. "What the hell is happening?"

His phone rang. Maxwell's name appeared.

"What kind of amateur operation are you running?" Maxwell's voice crackled with fury. "You boasted about being some elite hacker-writer hybrid. Now all your work disappears in days? Pathetic, Gideon!"

Gideon paled. This was beyond his control.

"Relax, man. I'll figure it out—"

CRASH!

His door exploded inward, sending Gideon tumbling from his chair.

"Who— what— robbery?" he stammered, staring at the armed police swarming his apartment.

"Freeze! Police!"

Gideon's arms shot up. He nearly soiled himself.

A stone-faced officer flashed his badge. "You're under arrest for cybercrimes. Come quietly."

Beep... beep... beep...

The line went dead in Maxwell's hand. Only static remained.

His stomach dropped. Eyes narrowing dangerously, he crushed his cigarette against the ashtray, ignoring the burn on his fingers.
###Chapter 308

Evelyn walked into T Corporation on Monday morning to find her coworkers staring at her with mixed expressions. Some looked sympathetic, others pitied her, while a few barely concealed their smirks. Whispers followed her as she moved through the office.

Only Abigail showed genuine concern.

Unable to bear it any longer, Abigail pulled Evelyn aside near the copy room. "I saw that Xeddit post," she said in a hushed tone. "It's obviously fake. I know you'd never do those things. Just focus on your work and ignore the gossip."

Evelyn felt a lump form in her throat.

In this sea of judgment, having one person believe in her meant everything.

She assured Abigail she was fine, then asked about Olivia.

"Not good," Abigail admitted. "Her illness seems serious this time. She barely speaks." This was unusual for the normally vibrant Olivia.

Guilt twisted Evelyn's stomach. "This is all my fault..."

Abigail gave her shoulder a playful nudge. "Don't be ridiculous. People get sick. Her mother's taking care of her at home."

Before Evelyn could respond, Vivienne Laurent, the design department head, strode in wearing a deep V-neck sweater that accentuated her cleavage. "Have you finished the design, Evelyn?" she demanded.

Evelyn blinked. "What design?"

Abigail jumped in. "She just returned from leave yesterday. Can you give her—"

"You think this is your family business?" Vivienne cut her off sharply. "That you can come and go as you please? I emailed your assignments days ago. Did you even check your inbox?"

Evelyn's stomach dropped. She hadn't.

"I apologize, Ms. Laurent," she said evenly. "I'll complete it immediately."

"Apologies won't cut it. The client expects the designs tomorrow. Any delays will be on your head." Vivienne's smirk was barely concealed.

As the department head strutted away, Abigail peeked at Evelyn's screen. "She gave you the Sterling account? That's impossible! Six senior designers already tried—all rejected. What does she expect from a junior designer?"

Evelyn studied the brief silently. Difficult or not, she'd give it her best shot.

"Ladies!" A smooth male voice interrupted. Julian Blackwood, the company's charming vice president, leaned against the doorway. "Who'll make me coffee this fine morning?"

Vivienne immediately straightened, batting her lashes. "I'd be delighted, Mr. Blackwood."

But Julian's gaze slid past her, landing on Evelyn in her yellow coat. "You there," he said with feigned casualness. "My brother mentioned your excellent coffee skills."

Every female eye in the room turned to Evelyn with varying degrees of envy.

Vivienne's face darkened as Evelyn stood. The department head's nails dug into her palms. First the CEO's attention, now the VP's? This newcomer was becoming a serious problem.
###Chapter 309

Evelyn quickly prepared a cup of coffee and handed it to Julian. "Your coffee, Vice President Blackwood."

She returned to her workstation, immediately immersing herself in her designs.

Julian took a sip. The rich aroma and perfect temperature surprised him. This wasn't your average office brew.

"Impressive skills," Julian remarked, giving Evelyn an approving nod. "Were you professionally trained?"

His admiration was genuine. Not only was Evelyn stunningly beautiful, but her coffee-making skills were exceptional.

"Just some part-time experience," Evelyn answered without looking up from her screen.

Those memories surfaced - the difficult years abroad after giving birth, working at that tiny café while battling postpartum depression. Five years had passed in a blink.

Julian stroked his chin thoughtfully. "What about cooking? Are you any good in the kitchen?"

He was fishing for information to help his older brother.

Evelyn barely glanced up, wondering why the vice president was wasting her time with small talk when deadlines loomed.

As department head, Vivienne interrupted, "Modern girls like Evelyn don't bother with domestic skills, Vice President Blackwood. But I trained under my father, a Michelin-starred chef—"

Julian had already moved behind Evelyn, studying her design work with interest, completely ignoring Vivienne.

The other female designers stifled giggles at Vivienne's humiliation.

Scarlet-faced, Vivienne stormed back to her office in fury.

Julian observed Evelyn's focused profile - the soft features that hardened with concentration, making her even more captivating. Then his brow furrowed at what he saw on her screen.

"Good morning, Mr. Blackwood!" Abigail's loud greeting snapped everyone to attention.

Dominic strode into the design department, his tailored suit accentuating his powerful frame. The usual icy aura around him seemed even colder today, making employees shrink back.

After acknowledging the greetings with a curt nod, he commanded, "Evelyn, make me a coffee."

Noticing Julian hovering behind Evelyn, his expression darkened. He ordered his brother to meet him upstairs, then turned sharply toward the executive elevator.

Had the CEO really come down just for coffee? Or to fetch his brother? Both possibilities seemed absurd.

"Wait up, Brother! No wonder they call you the Ice King!" Julian called after him, earning shocked looks from the staff.

In the CEO's office, Julian lounged on the sofa. "Not bad taste in women, Brother. Skilled barista too. I'd pursue her myself if she wasn't already yours."

Dominic's expression remained glacial. "If you have time to flirt in Design, you clearly need more work. You'll leave for the East Africa negotiations the day after tomorrow."

Julian groaned dramatically. "You can't be serious! Business isn't my strength! What if I botch it?"

"Then stay there and learn from the regional team."

Julian slumped. "You're definitely not my real brother."

Meanwhile, Evelyn prepared Dominic's coffee with practiced efficiency.

Entering the CEO's office, she overheard Julian say, "Can I get her to make my coffee daily?"

"Make your own. Evelyn only brews for me," Dominic stated possessively.

Julian smirked. "Getting territorial over your fiancée?"

"Enough," Dominic cut him off.

"Your coffee, Mr. Blackwood." Evelyn set down the cup and turned to leave.

Dominic's voice softened unexpectedly. "Have you adjusted to the department?"

"I'm adapting. I'll work hard to meet expectations," Evelyn replied professionally.

A barely perceptible warmth entered Dominic's eyes as he dismissed her. Julian watched in astonishment.

"My robot brother actually showing human emotions? Evelyn must be special."

Then his expression turned serious. "Brother, the department head assigned Evelyn a senior-level project. It's clearly sabotage. A junior designer can't handle that workload."

Julian might play the playboy, but he read people well. Vivienne's blatant flirting had nearly made him nauseous.

"Evelyn needs to prove herself," Dominic stated. "She's talented but lacks confidence. This challenge will force her to grow. If she can't handle it, she won't survive in Design long-term anyway."

His gaze turned toward the window. He wanted to see Evelyn thrive...

At that same moment, an explosive article by Everett Kingsley, CEO of JK Media, was sending shockwaves through the city's elite circles.
###Chapter 310

"How Romantic! After A Decade-Long Love Story, Dominic Blackwood of T Corporation Finally Reunites With His Beloved Evelyn Sinclair And Their Adorable Twins!"

The headline from JK Media was impossible to ignore.

The article itself followed a classic love story formula, but Everett Kingsley had a way with words—especially when the subject was none other than Dominic Blackwood of T Corporation. The moment it hit newsstands and digital platforms, the story exploded.

Here’s how it went:

Ten years ago, Dominic Blackwood, due to health concerns, was sent to a small-town school. There, he met Evelyn Sinclair, and sparks flew instantly.

Young and in love, they shared countless sweet moments. But fate intervened when Dominic was called back to A City to take over the family empire. Before leaving, he made a promise—one day, he would marry her.

Years passed. Dominic grew into a powerful, striking man, and Evelyn blossomed into a stunning woman.

When they reunited, it was like something out of a fairy tale. Their love reignited, and they moved in together.

But Dominic’s family disapproved. Evelyn’s humble background made her an unsuitable match in their eyes. His mother, Beatrice Lockwood, was the most vocal opponent—she even arranged a marriage for him behind his back.

Under pressure, Evelyn fled A City.

As she left, she called Dominic, who had just landed at the airport. He rushed back—only to be caught in a horrific car accident. The impact erased his memories, including the woman he had sworn to protect.

Months later, they crossed paths again. Dominic didn’t recognize her. Heartbroken, Evelyn discovered she was pregnant. Despite public scorn, she gave birth to twins, determined to raise them alone.

But the Blackwood family, upon learning of the children, took them away and exiled Evelyn overseas, terrified Dominic might remember her if he saw them.

Everett painted Evelyn’s struggles abroad with the dramatic flair of a tragic romance novel.

Meanwhile, Dominic, though his memories were lost, still felt the ghost of a woman lingering in his mind. Everett suggested this was why Dominic had remained indifferent to other women all these years.

Five years later, destiny brought them together again.

But their reunion was bittersweet.

Everett spun their tale with all the twists and heartache of a bestselling drama.

The article wasn’t just published in JK Media’s magazines—it spread like wildfire across every major online platform.

Accompanying the piece was a "family photo" of Dominic, Evelyn, and their children at an amusement park, plus a heart-melting video of the twins calling out for their parents.

It was enough to bring tears to anyone’s eyes.

JK Media’s reputation for credibility lent weight to the story. Though it read like a sensational romance, people trusted it far more than some anonymous Reddit post.

Public opinion shifted instantly.

Readers were moved by Dominic and Evelyn’s unwavering devotion.

Now they understood—the mother of those beautiful twins was Evelyn!

No wonder Dominic had never been linked to another woman. He had loved the same woman for over a decade, even through amnesia. How could anyone not be touched?

No wonder the children had no mother—the Blackwoods had torn their family apart.

Now that they were reunited, it was finally time for their happy ending.

Every copy of JK Media’s publications sold out that day.

But Dominic gritted his teeth as he read the article.

Is this idiot seriously writing about me?

None of this matches the information I gave him. Did he just make up half of it? Does he have a death wish?

He called Everett immediately. "What the hell is this? This isn’t what I sent you."

Everett chuckled. "What do you think? I told you I’d write a masterpiece that would move the masses—and I delivered. Face it, Mr. Blackwood, your version read like a dry financial report. You could learn a thing or two from me."

Dominic exhaled sharply.

Still, he had to admit—JK Media’s credibility meant this story, clichéd as it was, would restore Evelyn’s reputation. For that, he could tolerate Everett’s nonsense.

"Fine. Thanks. What do you want?"

Everett didn’t hesitate. "The land west of the Southern A City resort."

Dominic’s jaw tightened. That plot was worth billions, with massive development potential. Properly handled, its value could skyrocket tenfold. He’d been planning to secure it himself.

"You’ve got good taste," Dominic said dryly.

Everett’s laugh was smug. "We’re both businessmen. Profit comes first."

"Done. Consider it yours."

Dominic agreed, though it stung. He’d promised Everett anything—and he wasn’t about to go back on his word.

"That’s why I love working with you. But tell me—Maxwell Lockwood still hasn’t divorced Evelyn. Aren’t you worried he’ll do something desperate when cornered?"

Dominic smirked. "I’ve already handled that."

He’d sent Sebastian Whitmore to take care of things. By now, Sebastian should be—

A knock at the door interrupted his thoughts.

Sebastian stepped inside.
###Chapter 311

Dominic Blackwood exuded his usual aura of sharp intelligence and effortless nobility. A single glance from him could shift the entire atmosphere of a room.

Sebastian Whitmore approached with deference, handing over a thick stack of files. "I've nearly completed all your requests, Mr. Blackwood. Among those involved in Evelyn's grandfather's abduction, one remains in A City—Donovan Blackwood. He thought hiding in plain sight would keep him safe. He purchased a fake identity, but his gambling habit led our men straight to him at a casino last week."

Sebastian continued, "With Donovan in custody, we can reopen the case and pin the blame on Maxwell Lockwood instead of Yvette Prescott. That should ensure he spends a long time behind bars. I've also uncovered substantial evidence of Maxwell's past crimes..."

Dominic gave Sebastian's shoulder a firm pat. His dark eyes gleamed with satisfaction.

Evelyn Sinclair received the call just as she left work.

She hadn't spoken to Maxwell since Dominic had beaten him to a pulp.

Seeing his name flash on her screen sent a chill down her spine, memories of his attempted assault flooding back.

She hesitated. But if she wanted this divorce finalized, she had to face him.

Taking a steadying breath, she answered.

"Speak."

"Let's meet to discuss the divorce. Alone," Maxwell demanded.

Suspicion coiled in her gut.

She knew better than to trust him. After everything, she wouldn’t walk into another trap.

"If you don't show, forget about the divorce. Clearwater Tea Room." His voice was ice before the line went dead.

Evelyn stared at her phone, fingers trembling.

No. She wouldn’t meet him alone.

Instead, she called Dominic.

Maxwell arrived first, securing a secluded private room.

He missed her.

The recent JK Media article had unsettled him—Dominic revealing Evelyn as Alexander and Isabella’s birth mother. And now, with Gideon Whitmore arrested and his posts scrubbed from Xeddit, Maxwell felt cornered.

Furious.

Evelyn treated him like trash, yet he couldn’t let her go.

An addiction.

That first meeting five years ago had sealed his obsession.

He wouldn’t release her, no matter the cost.

The tea room’s soothing melody did nothing to calm him.

Time crawled.

His ashtray overflowed with cigarette butts. Still, no Evelyn.

Just as he reached for his phone, the door swung open.

Dominic strode in, commanding the space effortlessly.

Maxwell’s jaw clenched as Dominic took the seat opposite him.

Two dominant forces, locked in silent battle.

"Why are you here?" Maxwell spat.

His ribs still ached from their last encounter.

Dominic slid an envelope across the table. "A gift."

Maxwell opened it—a CD and a thick dossier.

His eyes widened with each page. Fear slithered down his spine.

He slammed a palm down. "What’s this supposed to mean?"

Dominic poured himself tea, unfazed. "Simple. Divorce Evelyn."

Maxwell wanted to shred the evidence.

Instead, he leaned back, feigning calm. "You think this scares me? These are old crimes. No solid proof. You can’t touch me. And don’t think swaying public opinion with JK Media changes anything. My marriage to Evelyn is legal. Push me, and I’ll drag you down with me."

Brave words.

But his pulse raced.

Dominic had dug up everything—hit-and-runs, illegal firearms, money laundering. Crimes he thought buried forever.

How deep did Dominic’s reach go?

The man was a wolf in tailored suits, waiting to strike.
###Chapter 312

Dominic's words didn't even make Maxwell flinch.

His fingers tightened slightly around the porcelain teacup. "Feel free to test me. Let's see what you learned during those five years behind bars."

Maxwell's face twisted in fury.

The damning evidence in that folder could send him away for decades.

The fire in his eyes burned uncontrollably.

"You think you're clean, Dominic? T Corporation's skeletons must fill an entire graveyard. Don't pretend you haven't manipulated stocks or nearly crashed A City's economy for profit. You really believe you've fooled everyone? Want me to speculate how you'll end up when I expose T Corporation's crimes?"

Every major corporation had dirty secrets—especially a global empire like T Corporation.

The consequences for Dominic would be catastrophic if those dealings came to light.

Dominic's gaze turned glacial. "By all means, try."

If T Corporation were that easy to dismantle, it wouldn't dominate the international market.

Besides, the astronomical "donations" T Corporation made to certain government agencies each year ensured protection. Maxwell's threats were laughably naive—proof he'd wasted his prison time.

The air between them crackled with tension.

When the teahouse music cut off abruptly, the silence became suffocating.

Dominic rose smoothly, adjusted his coat with precision, and strode toward the exit.

Pausing at the door, his voice carried like steel. "Go ahead. Reveal Evelyn's marriage to you. But I'll release proof that you orchestrated her grandfather's kidnapping to force her into that union. Every charge in that file guarantees a life sentence. This time, you won't walk free. I'll bury you so deep, you'll never see daylight again."

A cold smile touched his lips. "So what if the world knows she was married? I'll still cherish her. Marry her. You know I keep my promises. This is your last warning."

The door slammed shut.

Maxwell exploded.

He shredded the documents violently, then overturned the oak table, stomping it into splinters.

His mind reeled.

Persist? Risk life imprisonment? Or surrender the marriage he'd schemed so hard to obtain?

Meanwhile, Lillian Prescott sipped Darjeeling at Sylvia Kingsley's upscale restaurant.

Sylvia had noticed Evelyn's uncanny resemblance to Genevieve Prescott—Queenie's long-lost daughter. She'd discreetly asked Lillian to investigate.

Sylvia hadn't approached Genevieve directly, unwilling to reopen old wounds.

If she were wrong, the emotional devastation would be catastrophic.

As Genevieve's closest friend, Sylvia understood the agony of that loss better than anyone.

Before adopting Lillian, Genevieve had been a ghost of herself—hollow-eyed, wasting away.

Only adopting Lillian had brought her back from the brink.

If Genevieve's biological child still lived, Sylvia would move heaven and earth to reunite them.

She refilled Lillian's cup.

Lillian murmured thanks, her smile strained.

Sylvia chuckled. "No need for formalities, dear. Your mother and I go back decades. Did you..."

She reminisced about their youth, then casually asked, "Did you mention your sister to Genevieve?"

Lillian's teacup froze mid-air.

A needle of resentment pierced her heart.

So Sylvia was serious about this absurd search.

Why couldn't outsiders stop meddling?

She dug her nails into her thigh, summoning tears. "Aunt Sylvia, Mother wept all night when I asked. She said my sister was stillborn—she never even held her. The guilt over her weak health still haunts her..."

Sylvia's chest ached. She'd made the right choice not to approach Genevieve.

Yet her instincts screamed the child lived.

"Don't mention it again, dear. But... I can't shake this feeling she's out there somewhere." Sylvia pressed her temples. "After all these years, the truth might be far darker than we know."
###Chapter 313

"Aunt Sylvia, Mother insists my sister was stillborn, and she must be right. Just consider—who would dare lie to Father and Mother?" Lillian Prescott said with a sorrowful expression.

Sylvia Kingsley pondered this and concluded it must be true.

Back then, Jonathan Prescott wasn't the political powerhouse he was now, but he was already a rising star in the political arena. No one would have the audacity to deceive him or steal his child.

Yet, Sylvia couldn't shake off a nagging unease.

"Don't worry, Aunt Sylvia. If my sister is alive, I'll find her one day. She's my adopted mother's biological daughter, which makes her my elder sister. I'll ask others to help search too," Lillian reassured, easing Sylvia's worries.

"You're such a good girl, Lillian. Your mother is fortunate to have you—so kind and understanding..." Sylvia's voice trembled with emotion. She had always admired Lillian's intelligence and maturity.

"You flatter me, Aunt Sylvia. Sharing Mother's burdens is my duty. I'd do anything to see her happy," Lillian replied with a practiced smile.

Her words were honeyed, and Sylvia beamed with approval.

Sylvia couldn't stop praising Lillian's thoughtfulness and Genevieve Prescott's luck in having such a daughter.

The restaurant's large LCD screen flashed with entertainment news.

"Breaking News! The identity of Dominic Blackwood's twins' mother has been revealed—a former unknown employee of T Corporation..."

"Reports claim Dominic Blackwood and Ms. Evelyn Sinclair, the twins' mother, have known each other for over a decade. Circumstances forced them apart, but they've since reunited. Sources say Dominic has been lavishing his beloved with extravagant gifts—luxury jewelry, a mansion, and rumors of the century's grandest wedding, though unconfirmed."

The news blurred Evelyn's face, showing only her long black hair and delicate oval features. The twins' faces were also obscured, but the sight of the happy family of four sent a sharp pain through Lillian's chest.

Her teacup slipped from her fingers and shattered on the floor.

She barely registered the broken porcelain, her gaze fixed on the screen in stunned disbelief.

Her mind reeled. Evelyn Sinclair is the twins' mother? How?

Lillian's dazed state didn't escape Sylvia's notice.

"What's wrong, dear?" Sylvia asked, concerned.

She called Lillian's name several times before the younger woman snapped back to reality. "I'm fine, Aunt Sylvia," Lillian muttered weakly. "Just exhausted. I apologize for breaking your teacup..."

Sylvia smiled and shook her head but remained silent.

Her eyes flicked back to the television. "Dominic rarely tolerates gossip. He usually shuts down media outlets that spread rumors about him. How did this slip through? Strange. Most reports are fabricated, but... is it true the twins' mother has been found? That woman looks familiar..."

"If you'll excuse me, Aunt Sylvia, I'm not feeling well. I'll visit another time." Lillian abruptly stood to leave.

Sylvia, aware of Lillian's busy schedule as a celebrity, didn't question her sudden departure.

Distraught, Lillian headed straight to Maxwell Lockwood's bar without bothering to disguise herself.

Fans recognized her the moment she stepped inside.

Lillian wasn't A-list famous. Her debut lead role in Orphan Girl had launched her career, but subsequent mediocre projects stalled her popularity. Still, her family connections kept her relevant, and she maintained a certain level of fame.

Fans swarmed her, eager for autographs. "It's Lillian Prescott! I didn't know she came here! Lillian, I love you—can I get your signature?"

Lillian, already in a foul mood, had no patience for them.

The bar patrons, thrilled by the celebrity sighting, jostled around her. A few bold men took advantage of the chaos to grope her.

Lillian, known for her sweet, innocent image, rarely appeared in public. The men seized the opportunity.

"I adore you, Lillian! Sign this for me!" "You're my dream woman!"

The situation spiraled out of control. Even security struggled to contain the crowd.

Disgusting hands groped her breasts and backside, making her stomach churn. She was on the verge of exploding.

She turned on her fans, shrieking hysterically, "Get away from me, you filthy peasants! Do you want to die? Back off!"

Life as Jonathan Prescott's adopted daughter had spoiled Lillian. Gone were the days of hunger in the orphanage—now she lived in luxury, attended elite schools, and had a chauffeur.

People flattered her for her father's status, inflating her ego. She saw those beneath her as insects, oblivious to societal norms.

Being manhandled by "peasants" enraged her.

The fans recoiled in shock. This wasn't the gentle, charming star they knew from the screen.

"Is this really Lillian Prescott? She sounds like a rabid shrew!" "Did she just call us peasants? A politician's daughter shouldn't act like this—she's embarrassing her father!"

The crowd turned on her. Phones captured every second.

Lillian despised them all. With security's help, she fought her way out...
###Chapter 314

Lillian Prescott finally escaped the chaotic crowd.

She found Maxwell Lockwood in his suite, completely wasted. The sight gave her an instant migraine.

"Why is Maxwell so pathetic? Can't even handle his marriage to Evelyn, and now he's drowning himself in alcohol?"

Lillian ripped off her sunglasses and kicked Maxwell, who was sprawled on the floor. "Get up!"

Maxwell lifted his head from a pile of empty liquor bottles. His bleary eyes sharpened slightly when he recognized her.

"Shouldn't you be busy being a superstar? What brings you here?" His voice dripped with irritation.

"Don't play dumb. You married Evelyn, so why is she suddenly the birth mother of Dominic's twins in the media?" Lillian snapped.

She had assumed the surrogate was just some disposable woman.

But now, the whole world knew Evelyn's identity. That photo of her with Dominic and the twins sent chills down Lillian's spine.

Maxwell smirked drunkenly. "I almost had her, but Dominic showed up. Funny coincidence, don't you think?"

Lillian's stomach twisted at the memory.

Their plan had been simple—drug Evelyn, film her with Maxwell, and use it as blackmail.

Foolproof.

No man could stomach seeing the woman he loved with another. It would have destroyed their relationship.

That's why Lillian sent Dominic an anonymous tip.

She knew he wouldn't believe outright accusations. But if she hinted at danger...

Her message claimed Evelyn was in trouble.

If Dominic truly cared, he'd rush to the hotel—just in time to witness the betrayal.

But Maxwell had been too slow.

The stage was set, yet he failed at the crucial moment. Useless!

Lillian avoided Maxwell's piercing stare. "This is your fault! She was right there, and you couldn't even—"

Maxwell suddenly lunged, gripping her throat. His predatory grin made her blood run cold.

"Who do you think you're talking to?" His laugh was icy. "I'm a Lockwood by blood. You? Just some orphan Jonathan Prescott pitied."

He tightened his grip as she gasped. "All those years pretending to be the perfect daughter... exhausting, isn't it? What if everyone knew the real you? The selfish, calculating girl from the orphanage?"

Lillian's eyes widened in terror.

How did he know about her past?

If her adoptive parents found out the truth...

Everything would crumble.

She forced a meek expression. "Brother Maxwell, I... I was wrong. Please forgive me."

Playing weak was her only option now.

Maxwell scoffed and released her.

Lillian coughed violently, seething inside. She'd make him pay for this.

And Evelyn? That threat needed eliminating too.

Her mother would know what to do.

"Look, Mommy! We're in the newspaper!" Alexander Blackwood waved the tabloid excitedly. "I didn't know you and Daddy had such a romantic story!"

Though young, the boy was exceptionally bright, already reading beyond his grade level.

His sister Isabella couldn't read as well but understood the gist.

Evelyn chuckled.

Everett Kingsley was a media genius. His articles always sparked nationwide discussions.

This particular piece was surprisingly cliché yet effective.

Evelyn turned to her computer, sketching a new design.

Her client was the notoriously picky Christopher Prescott—father of a prominent politician.

Previous designers had all failed to meet his exacting standards...
###Chapter 315

Old Mr. Prescott wanted to demolish the ancestral home and build a new residence in its place.

Evelyn had reviewed all the architectural proposals at T Corporation's design department.

Some blueprints showcased sleek modern villas, others featured traditional English estates, while a few incorporated oriental elements with tranquil rock gardens...

Every single design had been rejected by the stubborn old man.

Frustration mounting, Old Mr. Prescott began hurling insults at T Corporation's designers, furious that none of these so-called elite architects could interpret his vision.

The real challenge wasn't his pickiness - it was his utter inability to articulate what he actually wanted.

Architectural design wasn't just about technical skills.

True mastery required creativity, consistency, and an impeccable aesthetic sense.

Though Evelyn had studied architecture abroad, her mind remained blank. She couldn't decipher Old Mr. Prescott's elusive dream home...

Reviewing her afternoon sketches at the kitchen island, she frowned. Something crucial was missing.

The doorbell's chime interrupted her thoughts.

Assuming Dominic had returned, she rushed to open the door without checking the peephole - only to find Beatrice Lockwood's imperious face.

The aristocratic woman's features twisted in their usual haughty expression.

"What do you want?" Evelyn blocked the doorway, refusing entry.

Beatrice meant trouble. Always.

"It's freezing out here! After traveling all this way, won't you offer me tea? Where are your manners?" Beatrice's sharp eyes raked over Evelyn. "Think my son's protection makes you untouchable? My, how you've blossomed since our last meeting..."

Her manicured nails dug into Evelyn's cheek like talons.

This was the harlot who'd ensnared her son - the woman Dominic had publicly declared as the twins' biological mother.

Impossible!

Anyone but Evelyn Sinclair could be mother to those precious grandchildren.

When the news broke, Beatrice had refused to believe it.

She'd come demanding a DNA sample.

Her perfect son must be bewitched to fabricate such an outrageous lie just to force this marriage!

Pain flared across Evelyn's face. Instinct made her shove Beatrice back.

The older woman stumbled in her designer heels, crashing onto the marble steps.

Shock froze Beatrice's features.

Then she spotted Dominic's approaching headlights.

A plan formed instantly.

Fingers flew to muss her coiffed hair. She crumpled her Chanel suit deliberately.

"Help!" she wailed, flopping dramatically on the steps. "This vicious girl attacked me! Dominic, how could you love such a monster? She won't even let a mother see her own son!"

Each word stabbed Evelyn's heart.

Furious yet restrained, Evelyn grabbed Beatrice's elbow and hauled her outside, slamming the door.

Dominic heard the commotion from the driveway.

Tires screeched as he parked haphazardly.

He arrived just as Evelyn ejected his mother.

His expression darkened. Not again.

"Look what she did to me!" Beatrice pointed at imaginary injuries. "If you don't throw her out immediately, I'll—"

"Enough." Dominic's voice cut like ice. "What are you doing here?"

The socialite gaped at her son's unfamiliar coldness.

"Is this how you speak to your mother? That witch has poisoned your mind! Can't you see she's abusive?"

"Mother." Dominic hauled her up roughly. "Stop the theatrics. I know you're unharmed. Evelyn would never—"

"But she—"

"I trust her completely." His glare silenced her. "I'm taking you home."

Beatrice's act faltered. The air thickened between them.

Her body stiffened as if bound by invisible chains.

The scheme had failed. Her son's piercing gaze filled her with despair.

Bianca's spell was irreversible!

Undeterred, Beatrice renewed her wailing, clinging to the porch railing like a petulant child.

Inside, Evelyn pressed against the door, heart aching.

Why did Beatrice despise their love so violently?
###Chapter 316

"Enough of this disgraceful behavior! You're embarrassing me!"

Dominic had no choice but to wrap his arms around his mother, Beatrice, shove her into the car, lock the doors, and speed away.

Evelyn was still shaking long after Beatrice had been taken away.

Her fists were clenched so tightly her knuckles turned white, her fingers icy cold.

Through the window, she could see Beatrice pounding on the glass, desperate to get out. The woman had shed every ounce of her high-society grace, resorting to wild, savage behavior—all just to tear Evelyn and Dominic apart.

Evelyn didn’t understand.

How could she ever be at peace if Beatrice refused to accept her relationship with Dominic?

The silence stretched between them, thick and suffocating.

Even with the heater blasting, Evelyn couldn’t shake the chill that had settled deep in her bones.

Divorcing Maxwell was the least of her worries now. Even if she managed to break free from that marriage, countless obstacles still stood between her and Dominic.

She exhaled sharply, rubbing her temples to force the spiraling thoughts away.

Turning back to her computer, she threw herself into work, desperate for a distraction.

Strangely, the earlier confrontation had sparked something in her. A fresh wave of inspiration hit, and suddenly, she knew exactly how to refine her design.

Old Mr. Prescott had rejected every proposal from the senior designers.

Maybe it was because their designs were too rigid—just houses, nothing more.

What if she infused hers with something deeper?

Evelyn tapped her pen against her lips, deep in thought.

Old Mr. Prescott’s son was a man of influence, and the elder Prescott himself was a retired politician.

A man like that was used to structure, to control. Retirement must have left him adrift, his once-vast social circle shrinking overnight. That could explain his erratic behavior.

Evelyn envisioned a classic-style estate—something serene, a sanctuary where he could retreat from the world.

A sprawling garden, maybe. Space for him to tend to plants, to keep pets.

A hidden paradise in the heart of the city.

That was it.

She deleted her previous draft and started anew.

The ideas flowed effortlessly, her fingers flying across the keyboard.

Before she knew it, night had fallen.

It wasn’t until Dominic returned, wrapping his arms around her from behind, that she snapped out of her trance.

One o’clock in the morning.

Dominic’s eyes widened as he took in her design.

He knew Evelyn was talented, but this—this was something else.

Her vision didn’t just meet expectations. It surpassed them.

The blueprint resembled the Royal Botanic Gardens, but with a modern twist.

A lush lawn surrounded the main house, dotted with towering trees. A rock garden and artificial waterfall sat in one corner, while peach trees lined the perimeter.

The vibrant flowers contrasted beautifully with the evergreen pines.

But the most striking feature?

A vegetable patch, complete with lettuce leaves sheltering tiny yellow chicks. Nearby, geese glided across a tranquil pond.

Dominic pulled Evelyn onto his lap, pressing a kiss to her cheek. His gaze burned with pride.

Still, he didn’t hold back his critique.

"This is stunning," he admitted, "but there are flaws. You’ve created an oasis, but you’ve ignored practicality. Old Mr. Prescott’s budget isn’t limitless, and some of these features aren’t elderly-friendly."

Evelyn listened intently.

Dominic’s feedback was sharp, precise.

As CEO of Blackwood Corporation, he was a force in business—but he was also a world-renowned designer.

His eye for aesthetics was unmatched.

And Evelyn respected that.

She absorbed every word, adjusting her design accordingly.

By the time she finished, it was nearly two.

Exhaustion weighed heavily on her.

Before she could protest, Dominic scooped her up.

"Wait—I haven’t saved it yet!" she yelped.

He reached over, fingers flying across the keyboard. The file saved with a quiet click.

Then he carried her to the bedroom.

"It’s late," he murmured. "You need rest."

Evelyn squirmed, but his grip was firm.

The warmth radiating from him should have been comforting.

Instead, it only reminded her of the day’s tension.

Beatrice’s words echoed in her mind.

"My son deserves better than a married woman."

The ache in her chest flared.

She lashed out.

"Your mother made it clear she doesn’t want us together."

Dominic stiffened.

"Do you really think I’m that easily swayed?" His voice was low, rough with frustration. "You know where my loyalty lies."

He wanted to argue, but the sight of Evelyn curled against him softened his resolve.

This wasn’t her fault.

It was his mother’s.
###Chapter 317

Evelyn was like a succulent, perfectly ripened peach that fit Dominic's palate. No other woman could ever compare.

Dominic believed he had done everything possible to bring their relationship into the open. Yet frustration gnawed at him—Evelyn still hesitated to move forward with him.

His words twisted Evelyn's heart like a knife.

She knew she mattered to him, but the gnawing sense of inadequacy never left her. It festered in her chest, flaring up unpredictably, shattering any fragile sense of security she managed to build.

Evelyn understood the real culprit was Beatrice, Dominic's mother, who thrived on tearing them apart. The fault wasn't with the man who loved and shielded her.

Guilt pricked her as she met Dominic's patient, deep-set gaze. "I'm sorry. Your mother came here to provoke me, and I lost control..."

"You don't owe me an apology," Dominic said, voice rough. He pulled a cigarette from his pocket, then stopped himself when he remembered the heater was on.

Evelyn had noticed—he'd been smoking more lately.

Dominic strode to the floor-to-ceiling window, drawing the curtains shut. His back was rigid, his voice barely above a whisper. "I'm sorry, Evelyn. You've suffered because of me."

He couldn't face her.

This was the first time he'd spoken so rawly, his words heavy with pain and helplessness. But their tangled situation couldn't be undone with mere apologies.

Evelyn sat quietly against the headboard, stunned. To her, Dominic had always been untouchable—favored by fortune, accustomed to admiration. Yet here he was, apologizing.

"I spent years drowning in loneliness," he continued, as if speaking to the night outside. "You might think my life was glamorous, but I was drowning in shame—a bastard child who couldn't escape his past. When the scandal broke, I didn't even want to live anymore."

His fingers trembled slightly.

"You don't know how deep the depression ran. I needed heavy medication just to function... until I went to that small town and met you."

His voice softened. "You were dawn breaking over my darkness. But you were still in school—I couldn't tell you how I felt. So I buried it. Left town with that ache inside me."

A bitter laugh escaped him. "Years later, fate gave me another chance. I found out you needed money, that you'd agreed to be a surrogate. I made sure you were mine. And you gave me two perfect children."

His breath hitched. "I thought I'd lost you forever. That being connected through them would have to be enough. But then you came back into my life."

His voice turned rough. "After everything we've been through, I believed nothing could keep us apart. But every time I try to move forward, you pull away."

Silence stretched between them.

Evelyn rose, her bare feet silent on the floor. She wrapped her arms around his waist from behind, pressing her cheek to his back. "I'm sorry, Dominic. No more running."

His body tensed. Then he turned, pulling her into his arms. "Foolish girl."

Her smile, bright and unguarded, chased the shadows from his eyes.

In one swift motion, he lifted her and laid her on the bed. His gaze burned as it traced her face. "If you're apologizing, make it count. Show me you mean it tonight."

His hands claimed her waist, pinning her beneath him. The heat of his body seared her skin, his scent intoxicating.

Desire darkened his eyes, making her shiver.

She closed her eyes, surrendering as he stripped away every barrier between them. His warmth pressed against her, branding her.

Her fingers brushed against him—hard, unyielding—and she flinched.

Dominic chuckled, capturing her wrist. "No escaping."

Even after all their nights together, that predatory gleam in his gaze still unnerved her. She swallowed. "Be... gentle."

His laugh was rough. "Just relax."

Then he took her.

Evelyn gasped, nails digging into his shoulders. "Ah—Dominic!"

Sweat beaded on his brow as he fought for control. His teeth grazed her ear. "You've given me two children. You'd think by now you'd be used to me." His voice was pure sin.

Evelyn flushed.

Every thrust threatened to shatter her, only to piece her back together. By the time dawn approached, she was too spent to even whimper.
###Chapter 318

The following morning.

T Corporation headquarters.

"I've completed the design you requested, Madam. The digital version has been sent to your inbox," Evelyn said as she handed the printed blueprint to the department head.

Vivienne Laurent examined Evelyn with suspicion. Her eyes widened dramatically when she saw the exquisite design. "You created this alone, Evelyn?" Her voice dripped with disbelief.

Evelyn nodded serenely, her flawless face maintaining its calm expression.

Vivienne scrutinized the design repeatedly.

The blueprint in her hands was perfection. Not even Vivienne could have conceived something so brilliant. The usually arrogant department head suddenly viewed the junior design assistant in a new light.

Had Evelyn truly designed this herself?

"Evelyn, you understand the severe consequences if we discover this isn't your original work?" Vivienne's tone turned icy.

Evelyn met her gaze steadily. "I worked through the night on this, Madam. I can recite every detail from memory if you'd like me to demonstrate."

Abigail overheard the exchange and approached. She couldn't resist glancing at Evelyn's design.

The sight left her speechless.

"Incredible work, Evelyn! This is truly exceptional," Abigail praised, giving an approving thumbs-up. "It blends classical elegance with cutting-edge functionality. I never would have guessed this came from you."

"You flatter me, Abigail. I still have much to learn from you," Evelyn replied modestly.

Evelyn finally allowed herself to relax slightly.

Countless hours had gone into this design. She prayed Jonathan Prescott would approve.

Vivienne snatched the design away with a derisive sniff. "Don't celebrate prematurely. If the client rejects this... well..."

Her stiletto heels clicked sharply as she marched away.

Evelyn ignored the department head's barb. Returning to her workstation, she hesitantly asked Abigail, "How is Olivia... doing?"

Olivia hadn't returned since the incident.

Patricia Kensington's constant presence had prevented Evelyn from visiting.

Nearly a week had passed without news. Evelyn's concern grew daily.

"Olivia's fine. Said she needed time to recover from work stress while battling illness. She'll return when she's better," Abigail explained.

Evelyn felt momentary relief, but guilt lingered.

Olivia wouldn't have suffered if not for her. Would their friendship ever fully recover?

As Evelyn lost herself in thought, Vivienne reappeared in the design department.

She clapped sharply for attention. "Everyone, pause current projects immediately. All designers report to Conference Room A606 for an emergency meeting."

Designers immediately rose to follow orders.

Evelyn smiled awkwardly.

Despite her tenure at T Corporation, she remained an assistant. Assistants didn't attend high-level design meetings.

She stayed behind with other junior staff.

While reviewing project notes, Evelyn's desk phone rang.

Dominic's commanding voice came through the receiver. "Report to Conference Room A606 immediately."

"Yes, Mr. Blackwood!" Evelyn rose eagerly.

The conference room housed T Corporation's elite designers.

As a multinational conglomerate, T Corporation maintained specialized design departments for architecture, fashion jewelry, landscaping, environmental design, industrial design, interior design, and more.

Conference Room A606 occupied the 88th floor.

The lavish space featured vaulted ceilings.

Masterpiece artworks adorned the walls, creating an atmosphere of refined creativity.

Impeccably dressed professionals filled the room - men in tailored suits, women in sophisticated office attire. Their confident bearing marked them as industry leaders.

Evelyn felt conspicuously out of place walking past these luminaries.

She approached Dominic, keeping her gaze fixed forward. "You requested me, Mr. Blackwood?"

Dominic gestured to an empty chair without looking up. "Sit."

"That... might not be appropriate," Evelyn murmured.

She knew her place in the corporate hierarchy. Junior assistants didn't belong here.

Dominic's frown brooked no argument. "Sit down and be quiet."

Abigail witnessed the exchange and understood the CEO's intent.

She pulled out a nearby chair. "Sit with me, Evelyn."

Evelyn reluctantly complied. "Thank you, Abigail."

"Don't mention it. You've been here long enough, Evelyn, and your designs speak for themselves. You'll earn that designer title soon enough. Attending these meetings will only accelerate your growth," Abigail said warmly.

Evelyn nodded and prepared for the meeting's start.

Vivienne noticed Evelyn's presence.

Her gaze lingered on the bowed head before twisting into a mask of jealous fury.

Evelyn had no business attending this meeting. Yet not only was she present, she sat disturbingly close to the CEO. What gave her that right?

The only explanation? She'd slept her way into favor.

Vivienne's contempt burned hotter.

'Enjoy it while it lasts. Once he tires of you, you'll be discarded like yesterday's trash.'

Yet she couldn't ignore the brilliance of Evelyn's earlier submission.

If that design truly came from Evelyn's hand, her talent couldn't be dismissed.

Vivienne suddenly felt the weight of competition. Unless she acted, this junior might soon surpass her...

Fear took root.

She glared at Evelyn, silently vowing to publicly humiliate this upstart.
###Chapter 319

The design meeting commenced.

Dominic Blackwood occupied the head seat, his tailored Armani suit accentuating his commanding presence. His piercing gaze swept across the conference room as he delivered concise opening remarks before listening to departmental reports.

The agenda focused on "Enhancing Design Efficiency."

Designers from various divisions exchanged insights about emerging industry trends. Though specializing in different fields, they found common ground in discussing the prestigious Finishing Touch Atelier and Visionary Concepts Studio - two globally acclaimed design houses that had revolutionized aesthetics in recent years.

As a multinational powerhouse, T Corporation employed top-tier designers who not only anticipated trends but actively shaped them. The spirited discussion lasted ninety minutes.

Next came monthly performance reviews.

Department heads highlighted achievements while singling out both exemplary and underperforming staff. Those receiving praise beamed with pride - recognition from the CEO often meant promotions and bonuses.

Underperformers shifted uncomfortably in their seats. Losing a position at T Corporation meant forfeiting the industry's most generous compensation package.

When Vivienne Laurent, head of architectural design, took the floor, she cast a meaningful glance at Evelyn before beginning. "This month, two team members deserve special mention - Gregory Peterson for completing the most profitable projects, and Abigail Thornton for consistently exceeding client expectations."

Her tone darkened. "However, we must address certain... disappointing elements."

All eyes followed Vivienne's venomous stare to Evelyn Sinclair.

Evelyn's stomach dropped as the department head continued. "Ms. Sinclair, as a design assistant, you should be striving for promotion rather than slacking. Your absenteeism and lackluster output are unacceptable. T Corporation rewards excellence - we don't tolerate dead weight."

The room erupted in murmurs.

Every designer turned to scrutinize Evelyn, ignoring Dominic's thunderous expression.

Company policy clearly stated only senior designers could attend A606 meetings. Why was an assistant present? This couldn't be accidental - someone must have informed her.

Was the CEO showing favoritism?

The famously private Dominic Blackwood had never been linked to any woman except in that JK Media scandal. Could this plain assistant be the mystery woman?

Speculative whispers swirled as dozens of eyes raked over Evelyn's slender frame.

Though visibly uncomfortable under the scrutiny, Evelyn's delicate features and luminous eyes couldn't be hidden. She shrunk into her chair, wishing to disappear.

Vivienne smirked internally.

'Let's see if Mr. Blackwood defends his little mistress publicly.'

She'd deliberately shamed Evelyn, confident Dominic wouldn't intervene. The CEO valued fairness above all - he wouldn't risk his reputation for an illicit affair.

Dominic's fingers stilled around his Montblanc pen. His glacial gaze could freeze molten steel.

Vivienne hastily looked away, a chill running down her spine.

'Have I miscalculated?'

She reassured herself Dominic wouldn't openly protect Evelyn before the entire design team. The girl would have to face this humiliation alone.

How wrong she was.

Dominic's inscrutable expression concealed volcanic fury. His gaze lingered on Evelyn's bowed head.

The woman possessed remarkable talent but lacked workplace resilience. This public shaming would either break her - or forge her into something stronger.
###Chapter 320

The screen displayed a breathtaking skyscraper silhouetted against a starry night sky.

Its architecture was daring and intricate, resembling something straight out of a futuristic alien metropolis.

Mystical engravings adorned its exterior walls. Even more astonishing, each segment of the structure could detach and function independently.

The reflective glass panels mirrored the entire cityscape. It was nothing short of an architectural masterpiece.

The designers in the room erupted in excitement, their voices overlapping as they praised the groundbreaking concept.

Dominic Blackwood rapped his knuckles against the table, and the chatter gradually died down.

He aimed his laser pointer at the screen, his smooth voice filling the room.

"This is my personal vision of tomorrow's architecture. Who can analyze its strengths and weaknesses? Volunteers?"

The team's admiration for their CEO deepened.

As one of the world's top ten designers, Dominic rarely created new works these days, focusing instead on business operations.

Yet this skyscraper proved his genius remained undiminished.

An uneasy silence followed his question.

Everyone wanted to impress him, but no one dared speak first.

What if their analysis fell short? The embarrassment would be unbearable in front of these elite colleagues.

"Bernadette Worthing." Dominic's gaze landed on the architectural design department head. "Your thoughts?"

Bernadette stood on shaky legs, her mind blank.

Despite her senior position, the pressure of all eyes on her was paralyzing.

"M-Mr. Blackwood," she stammered, "your design is revolutionary. The fusion of Gothic and postmodern elements in the interior corridors creates an iconic landmark. It's... flawless."

Bernadette wasn't incompetent—her sharp eye for design had earned her promotion.

But put on the spot, she could only offer flattery.

Even if she noticed imperfections, criticizing the CEO publicly was unthinkable.

A sheen of sweat coated her forehead as she glanced at Dominic's impassive face, her anxiety mounting.

"Evelyn Sinclair." Dominic turned to the newest team member. "Your perspective?"

Evelyn rose hesitantly, more nervous than her supervisor.

Studying the design carefully, she began speaking slowly, then with growing confidence.

"The AI-generated structure exhibits superhuman precision. The glass facade acts as a city-scale mirror, transforming obstruction into spectacle."

"Unlike conventional towers, this one captures its surroundings rather than blocking them."

"The flexible materials provide earthquake resistance—an ingenious solution."

"But..." Her voice strengthened. "The height disrupts the city's skyline harmony."

"The view from ground level feels oppressive rather than inspiring."

"And the very perfection is its greatest flaw because..."

Evelyn transformed when discussing design—her voice clear, her insights razor-sharp.

Her analysis rivaled the firm's top designers, astonishing Dominic and silencing the room.

Applause broke out multiple times during her critique.

Bernadette seethed with jealousy.

'A rookie shouldn't have such insight,' she thought bitterly. 'Dominic must have coached her beforehand.'

The other designers regarded Evelyn with new respect, shocked such depth came from a junior hire.

No veteran had dared critique the CEO's work so boldly.

To everyone's astonishment, Dominic smiled.

The usually stern executive looked radiant, his smile sending ripples through the room like spring breeze across a pond.

Male employees gaped. Was this their intimidating boss?

Female staff members swooned, utterly captivated by his dazzling expression.
###Chapter 321

Dominic gave an approving nod. Evelyn had met his expectations perfectly.

He had intentionally embedded several flaws into the skyscraper's blueprint - subtle imperfections that only an expert eye could detect. The design appeared flawless at first glance, but contained deliberate structural weaknesses.

Evelyn was correct. The most glaring flaw was its impossible perfection.

By amplifying every realistic element beyond practical limits, the design had crossed into fantasy territory. Current construction technology couldn't possibly realize such a vision within this century.

Her other observations about the design's weaknesses were equally precise.

Dominic clapped his hands sharply. "Exactly. Ms. Sinclair has identified all the intentional flaws in my design. Everyone should learn from her example. Never hesitate to point out mistakes - even if they come from your CEO. Understood?"

Evelyn blinked in surprise before a pleased smile curved her lips.

As both CEO of T Corporation and a world-renowned architect, Dominic could have easily been arrogant. Most geniuses tolerated no criticism of their work.

Yet here he was, not only accepting her critique but encouraging others to do the same. This humility only deepened her admiration for him.

"I'm shocked you actually spotted those," Bernadette hissed in Evelyn's ear, green with envy. "Did the boss show you the designs beforehand? He never praises anyone publicly. What special favors did you do for him?"

Evelyn ignored the department head's barb.

Reacting would only encourage Bernadette's harassment. Silence was her best defense.

True to form, Bernadette fumed when her taunt failed to land. But with Dominic present, she couldn't make a scene. She shot Evelyn a venomous glare and clamped her mouth shut.

"Evelyn Sinclair," Dominic announced, his voice cool and measured. "Effective immediately, you're promoted to full designer status."

"Thank you, Mr. Blackwood. I won't let you down." Evelyn's confident reply couldn't mask her elation. Her hard work had finally borne fruit.

Dominic studied her intently before continuing. "We're launching a major collaboration with Vivi Group soon. You'll co-lead the project with Gregory Peterson and Abigail Thornton."

The announcement sent shockwaves through the room.

Vivi Group was a multinational powerhouse - one where T Corporation held a substantial 25% stake. Their relationship balanced precariously between partnership and competition. The upcoming project involved revitalizing a historic town for tourism.

Abigail and Gregory nodded at Evelyn in approval.

Most colleagues liked Evelyn for her humble, kind nature - except those consumed by jealousy.

Like Bernadette Worthing.

The department head nearly choked hearing Dominic assign the prestigious project to Evelyn alongside two senior designers.

While Abigail and Gregory's involvement made sense, what qualifications did this newcomer have? Was she, the department head, being sidelined?

Bernadette forced calm into her voice. "Mr. Blackwood, Evelyn lacks experience. Shouldn't someone more senior—"

Dominic's icy stare cut her off. "Are you questioning my judgment?"

Bernadette's knees nearly buckled.

She'd just challenged the CEO's authority - a fatal mistake.

Everyone knew Dominic's decisions were final. No one changed his mind once it was made. Bernadette swallowed her protest.

"Of course not, Mr. Blackwood," she backpedaled hastily. "Evelyn is... talented. Team collaboration is... beneficial."

The other designers regarded Evelyn with complex emotions.

They'd clawed their way up through years of grueling work and sacrificed brain cells.

Under T Corporation's rigid hierarchy, design assistants typically needed a full year to earn promotion.

Yet here was Evelyn - not only promoted within months but handed a major project alongside managers!

Incredible luck!

Evelyn sighed inwardly. While others saw fortune, she felt handed a ticking time bomb.

Why would Dominic entrust such responsibility to a newcomer?

Meanwhile, in a secluded suburban mansion...

A discreet luxury vehicle pulled up, discharging a distinguished middle-aged couple.

The square-jawed man carried himself with natural authority no casual attire could diminish.

His elegant companion moved with grace, her timeless beauty tinged with quiet sorrow.

Jonathan Prescott and Genevieve Prescott had come to visit Charles Prescott, Jonathan's retired father.

Charles had lived in this aging estate since retirement.

Jonathan had often suggested renovations, hoping to lift his father's spirits.

As they entered, hearty laughter greeted them - an unusual sound from the typically reserved former statesman.

"What's brought you such joy, Father?" Jonathan asked, guiding his wife inside.

An aristocratic woman hurried to greet them, face alight. "We've been waiting! Your father and I were just—"

Charles beamed at his son, thrusting forward architectural plans. "See? Finally found a designer who understands me! This one's got real talent!"
###Chapter 322

Jonathan's breath caught at the exquisite architectural renderings spread across the table.

His fingers traced the elegant signature in the corner - E. Sinclair. "I'm delighted you approve of the designs, Father. If this architect meets your standards, we'll commission them for the interior once construction completes."

The elder Prescott chuckled, eyes sparkling with rare enthusiasm. "Never encountered such talent before. This young man has remarkable vision!"

A knowing smile played on Jonathan's lips. "I believe Evelyn Sinclair is actually a woman."

Christopher Prescott scoffed. "Nonsense! That level of structural innovation can only come from a male mind."

Genevieve hid her amusement behind a delicate cough. "Why not wait until the architect visits the site? Then you'll settle this debate properly."

Something about the intricate floral motifs and sweeping curves convinced Genevieve this was a woman's work.

Evelyn Sinclair...

The name lodged in her mind like a splinter, sending an inexplicable pang through her chest.

"Where's Lillian today?" Elizabeth Prescott inquired, patting Genevieve's hand. The old woman had always doted on her vivacious granddaughter.

"Lillian's filming schedule has been relentless lately. We'll bring her for dinner once this production wraps," Genevieve explained.

Charles's face darkened instantly. "When will that girl quit this acting nonsense? A Prescott parading herself on screen? Disgraceful!"

The patriarch had never warmed to Lillian.

When Jonathan first brought the orphaned child home, Charles had seen through her carefully constructed innocence. But his son's determination left no room for refusal.

Living separately meant Charles rarely saw his adopted granddaughter. Only during holidays did the strained family gather, with Charles maintaining polite indifference.

Until Lillian entered the entertainment industry.

That den of vice and scandal! No one emerged from Hollywood untainted. Behind those glamorous smiles hid oceans of filth.

The Prescotts were political royalty. Family reputation meant everything. An actress granddaughter? Unforgivable.

Lillian's every attempt to charm her grandfather had failed spectacularly.

Genevieve kept her eyes downcast. Defending her daughter would only stoke Charles's temper.

She remembered her own youthful dreams of acting, crushed by her in-laws' disapproval. Building a business empire couldn't fill that void. When Lillian chose the stage, Genevieve gave the encouragement she'd never received.

"Father, I'm arranging Lillian's marriage soon. She'll retire afterward," Jonathan interjected.

"About time!" Charles huffed.

Elizabeth shot her husband a warning look. "Enough. Our son visits so rarely." Turning to Genevieve, she added, "Come help me check on lunch."

The kitchen's warmth couldn't melt the ice in Genevieve's stomach.

After the meal, while the men retreated to the study, Genevieve found herself staring at the sprawling photo collage in the parlor.

One faded image caught her eye - a younger Charles and Elizabeth seated formally, with Jonathan standing behind them. Genevieve, visibly pregnant, leaned against her husband, one hand resting on her rounded belly...

"Reliving memories, dear?"

Elizabeth's gentle voice startled her. The older woman followed Genevieve's gaze to the pregnancy photo, sighing as she took her daughter-in-law's trembling hand.

"Twenty-four years is long enough to mourn. Some paths aren't meant to be traveled. If not for Jonathan's... condition after the accident, you wouldn't have needed to... Lillian's grown now, and quite accomplished. There's still hope."

The lie burned Genevieve's tongue.

Jonathan had shouldered the blame for their childlessness, claiming his war injury left him sterile. His parents never questioned it - after all, Genevieve had carried to term once. The stillbirth proved her fertility.

Their misplaced gratitude shamed her. Elizabeth praised Genevieve for standing by her "sterile" husband when the truth was reversed.

Tears blurred the photo as Genevieve traced her pregnant silhouette.

What would her daughter look like at twenty-four? Would she have children of her own by now? The phantom life haunted her every waking moment.
###Chapter 323

Monday, 10 am, in front of the Civil Registry Office.

Evelyn Sinclair never imagined Maxwell Lockwood would actually call her.

His message was brief: meet him at the Civil Registry Office. He was ready to sign the divorce papers.

At first, she thought it was a cruel joke.

She had braced herself for a prolonged legal battle—months, maybe years of fighting to dissolve their marriage.

Yet here he was, surrendering without resistance.

Evelyn knew her erratic attendance at work was raising eyebrows. Another unplanned absence would fuel office gossip.

But freedom was worth the risk.

She requested emergency leave and rushed to the government building.

Standing at the intersection, she checked her phone for the tenth time. The clock was ticking.

Was Maxwell going to stand her up?

Just as she reached for her phone, she spotted him.

The man moved through the crowd like a predator, effortlessly commanding attention. Women turned their heads, lips curving into hopeful smiles as he passed.

Evelyn rolled her eyes.

They only saw the chiseled jawline and expensive suit. They didn’t see the monster beneath.

A chill ran down her spine as he approached.

Her muscles locked. Memories of that night flooded back—his hands around her throat, his breath hot against her ear.

Maxwell’s gaze swept over her, lingering.

She was still breathtaking. Frost clung to her long lashes, making them shimmer like winter crystals. The sight punched the air from his lungs.

He’d convinced himself he was over her.

One glance proved that a lie.

If she’d just shown him a fraction of the warmth she reserved for Dominic Blackwood, he would’ve burned the world for her.

Prison be damned.

Evelyn’s voice shattered the fantasy. "Since you’re here, let’s get this over with."

His fingers closed around her wrist. "You’re that eager to run to Dominic?"

"Let go!" She tried twisting free, but he yanked her against his chest.

His breath was ragged. "Tell me you never loved me. Say it, and I’ll walk away."

She shoved at him. "We’re done, Maxwell. You’ll find someone better suited to—"

His expression darkened.

He couldn’t stomach those words.

His thumb traced her cheekbone. Such beauty, yet her eyes held only contempt.

He’d defied his family for her. Given up everything.

And still, her heart remained frozen.

Evelyn drove her stiletto into his foot. "Sign the papers, or I’ll see you in court. Your choice."

The pain was nothing compared to the ache in his chest.

He released her. "Fine. Let’s end this."

Maxwell strode toward the building, shoulders rigid.

Evelyn hesitated, then followed.

Inside, the divorce queue outnumbered the marriage line.

A middle-aged couple argued at the counter. The husband—paunchy, balding—slammed his fist on the desk.

"I want a divorce! Do I need a damn reason? Look at her—no makeup, frumpy clothes. Embarrassing!"

The woman—wrinkled, graying—shook with rage. "I married you when you couldn’t afford meat! And now you bring your mistress into our home?"

He struck her.

She collapsed, wailing curses as onlookers gawked.

Evelyn’s nails bit into her palms.

This was why she’d never depend on a man.

Even if she married Dominic, her career would remain hers. No compromises. No surrender.
###Chapter 324

The next couple in line appeared young, probably in their early twenties.

The man had a decent face, but his neon-green hair was impossible to ignore. A thick gold chain hung around his neck, glinting under the harsh office lights. His skinny legs were stuffed into ripped jeans, the holes revealing patches of pale skin.

He slouched with his hands shoved into his pockets, looking every bit the troublemaker.

Beside him stood a woman with the exaggerated features of a social media influencer. Her oversized cosmetic contact lenses made her eyes look unnaturally large. The sharp point of her chin suggested plastic surgery, and her face was caked in heavy makeup. A cigarette dangled between her fingers, the smoke curling lazily upward—an odd contrast to her otherwise polished appearance.

"Reason for divorce?" The female clerk frowned, glaring at the woman. "No smoking in here. Take it outside if you want to light up."

The woman scoffed. "Mind your own business. Is my smoking bothering you? Just stamp the papers already." Her sweet facade cracked the moment she spoke, revealing a sharp, nasty edge.

The clerk's face flushed with anger.

She was about to snap when her male colleague tugged her sleeve, silently reminding her to stay professional. They dealt with all kinds here.

Taking a deep breath, the clerk forced herself to continue. "Do you have a specific reason for the divorce? Would you like mediation?"

The influencer rolled her eyes and shot her green-haired husband a withering look. "Mediation? For this loser? He’s been cheating on me for months—different girls every week! If I hadn’t snooped through his phone, I’d still be in the dark. Who knows what diseases he’s picked up? I’m done with him."

The green-haired man bristled. "Oh, like you’re innocent? Posting half-naked pics for attention, flirting with every guy in your DMs. And don’t think I didn’t see you sneaking into a hotel with some bald creep last week. I should’ve dragged you out right then. But whatever—I’m sick of you too. Let’s just get this over with."

Their argument escalated into a screaming match, then devolved into slapping and shoving like a pair of feral cats.

Evelyn had never seen two people so eager to tear each other apart.

The Civil Registry Office was truly a terrifying place.

Even Beatrice Lockwood, as unpleasant as she was, had never been this crude or violent.

Eventually, the couple got their divorce papers. The influencer snatched hers and stormed off without a backward glance.

As the green-haired man turned to leave, his gaze landed on Evelyn, waiting in line.

Ignoring Maxwell beside her, he smirked and let out a low whistle. "Damn, sweetheart. You’re way too fine to be stuck with that guy."

Maxwell had been simmering with anger all morning, forced into this divorce against his will. The stranger’s blatant disrespect was the final straw.

In one swift motion, Maxwell grabbed the man by his collar and yanked him close. His voice was dangerously quiet. "What did you just say?"

The green-haired man paled. "I—I didn’t mean—"

Maxwell’s grip tightened. "You think you can flirt with my wife right in front of me?"

The man’s feet dangled inches off the ground as Maxwell lifted him effortlessly.

"But—but you’re divorcing!" the man wheezed.

Maxwell’s expression darkened. "Doesn’t mean she’s yours to disrespect."

With a rough shove, he sent the man stumbling backward. "Get out of my sight."

Terrified, the green-haired man scrambled to his feet and bolted from the office.

Finally, it was Evelyn and Maxwell’s turn.

The clerks took in the striking pair before them—both attractive, well-dressed, seemingly perfect for each other.

Why would a couple like this want to split?

The female clerk hesitated. "Are you absolutely sure about this? Even the strongest relationships hit rough patches. Maybe you should reconsider?"

Evelyn’s voice was ice. "I feel nothing for him. Our marriage was a mistake from the start." She leaned in, lowering her voice to a whisper. "And don’t let his looks fool you. He’s abusive. And…" She paused meaningfully. "Let’s just say he’s not much of a man where it counts."

The clerk’s eyes widened. She shot Maxwell a horrified glance, her earlier sympathy vanishing.

So that’s why she’s leaving him. Violent AND impotent? No wonder.

Without another word, she stamped the divorce papers and pushed them across the desk.

Evelyn exhaled in relief, a bright smile breaking across her face.

Maxwell, meanwhile, looked like he wanted to set the entire building on fire.
###Chapter 325

Outside the Civil Registry Office.

Dominic's piercing gaze lingered on Evelyn's delicate features, as if trying to memorize every curve of her face.

Her raven-black hair was elegantly pinned up, the scarf around her neck folded with effortless grace. The only makeup she wore was a soft pink gloss on her lips.

She looked radiant.

Her eyes sparkled with unrestrained joy.

It tore at him.

He couldn’t let her go.

"Evelyn," he began, voice rough. "I know I forced our marriage before. But if I changed—if I tried to win you properly this time—would you give me a chance?"

"What?" Evelyn blinked, too absorbed in her newfound freedom to process his words.

Dominic stepped closer, his tall frame casting a shadow over her. "I said, can we start over?"

His heart pounded as he waited.

He already knew her answer.

But hope was a stubborn thing.

"Absolutely not," Evelyn said without hesitation.

His jaw tightened, emotions churning beneath the surface. "I mean it, Evelyn. No tricks, no manipulation. Just me, trying to deserve you."

"I said no!" She glared at him. "It's over, Dominic. Stop bothering me, or I won’t be polite about it."

She turned sharply, flagging down a taxi.

The car pulled away, leaving Dominic standing in the exhaust fumes.

A bitter laugh escaped him.

She hated him.

She hadn’t even looked back.

Evelyn went straight to the company after leaving the registry office.

She couldn’t wait to tell Maxwell the news—she was finally free.

As if fate agreed, her phone buzzed the moment she stepped into the elevator.

Maxwell.

He wanted to see her in his office.

When she arrived, he was engrossed in paperwork, unaware of her presence.

A mischievous smile curved her lips as she crept up behind him, covering his eyes with her hands.

"Guess who?"

"Hmm." His fingers traced her arms, sending shivers down her spine. "Such soft hands. Must be my favorite little troublemaker."

His touch wandered lower, teasing the curve of her waist before giving her backside a playful squeeze.

Evelyn gasped, cheeks burning as she jerked away.

This man!

Who knew the icy CEO was such a rogue?

Maxwell pulled her into his arms before she could protest, his lips claiming hers in a searing kiss.

Evelyn squirmed, her body torn between resistance and surrender.

Her gaze darted to the door.

This was his office. Anyone could walk in.

If someone saw them like this—

"Relax," he murmured against her lips. "No one enters without my permission."

His hands slid under her blouse, fingertips tracing patterns on her skin.

Evelyn shivered.

Maxwell chuckled, his voice husky with desire. "Still shy after everything we’ve done?"

She huffed.

Shy?

After last night?

His lips trailed down her neck, his touch growing bolder.

Desperate for a distraction, she blurted out, "I divorced Dominic today!"

Maxwell barely reacted.

A single, indifferent hum.

He had backed Dominic into a corner. The man had no choice but to comply.

Evelyn stared at him, stunned by his lack of surprise.

Before she could question it, his hands resumed their exploration.

"Maxwell—"

He silenced her with another kiss, his fingers toying with the hem of her skirt.

The office door was locked.

But that didn’t make this any less reckless.

Evelyn’s pulse raced.

She wasn’t this bold.

Not here.

Not like this.

Yet as his lips moved to her collarbone, her protests died in her throat.

Maybe…

Just this once.
###Chapter 326

"The outcome is exactly as planned. If Maxwell refuses to sign the divorce papers, not just his family's fortune will collapse - he'll be wearing prison stripes again." Dominic brushed his lips against Evelyn's nose, his gaze softening as he studied her face.

"Prison? How?" Evelyn's brows knitted in confusion.

She had no idea Dominic had compiled an entire dossier of Maxwell's illegal activities to force the divorce through.

Dominic preferred keeping her in the dark. Innocence suited her better.

He'd be her shield against life's ugliness.

The intensity in his dark eyes sent Evelyn's pulse racing uncontrollably. She instinctively raised her hands to cover her face.

This man was dangerous. A single look could make her heart stutter like a trapped bird.

Dominic peeled her hands away, leaning closer until his breath warmed her lips. "Still shy after everything, darling?"

That impossibly handsome face held a magnetic pull that left Evelyn's mouth dry.

Before she could respond, strong arms lifted her effortlessly, carrying her into the adjoining room.

Dominic's office suite included a full living space - bedroom, bath, study, and entertainment rooms for his marathon work sessions.

The contemporary design screamed luxury, a self-contained penthouse within the corporate tower.

Evelyn realized their destination when Dominic kicked the bedroom door shut behind them.

He moved like a starved predator, stripping away her clothes with practiced efficiency.

Dark eyes glowed with primal hunger.

Evelyn scrambled for the duvet, attempting to cover herself, but Dominic pinned her beneath him before she could retreat.

A devilish smirk played on his lips as he whispered, "Relax, sweetheart. I'll be gentle this time..."

Heat flooded Evelyn's face and neck.

Those were the same empty promises he'd made last night before reducing her to a trembling, sore mess.

She wasn't falling for that again.

Dominic nuzzled her throat, scattering feather-light kisses along her jawline. "I mean it this time," he rasped. "No pain. Just pleasure."

Against her better judgment, Evelyn found herself melting under his skilled attention.

To Dominic, every inch of Evelyn was a masterpiece. Even the dust motes dancing in the afternoon light seemed to hold their breath, bearing witness to their passion.

Later, as they dressed, Dominic pulled Evelyn close, nipping at her earlobe. "Come to the gala with me tonight."

If she was entering his world, their public debut couldn't wait.

Evelyn hesitated. "But I've never attended high-society events. What if I—"

Her insecurities still lingered.

Dominic's galas would be crawling with socialites. Her lack of experience terrified her.

"Relax. I'll be your anchor." He pressed a platinum card into her palm. "Take Abigail shopping after work. Buy something stunning."

"My black card still has plenty of credit. I'll use that." Evelyn tried returning the new card. Her salary covered essentials - taking his money felt wrong.

Dominic tsked, tapping her nose. "Stubborn girl. You're going to be my wife. Start acting like it."

Flushing, Evelyn straightened her blouse and fled back to the design department.

At her desk, memories of Dominic's tenderness made her lips curve unconsciously.

Abigail nudged her. "Earth to Evelyn. That's some daydream you're having."

Evelyn startled. "It's nothing."

Abigail waggled her eyebrows. "Liar."

"Focus on your sketches!" Evelyn tossed a pen at her friend, feigning annoyance.

After hours, as employees streamed out of T Corporation, Evelyn recruited Abigail for emergency dress shopping.

Decision-making wasn't her forte. Abigail's fashion sense would prove invaluable.

Luckily, Abigail had no evening plans and agreed immediately.

As Abigail parked at A City's premier mall, Evelyn spotted Maxwell's car nearby.

He leaned against the hood, a petite brunette draped over his arm.

The girl couldn't be older than twenty-two, dripping in designer labels and attitude. Diamond studs marched up her ears, a gem glittering in her nose.

Abigail squeezed Evelyn's shoulder. "I'll wait by the entrance."

Maxwell stiffened upon seeing Evelyn. He shoved the girl away. "This is my cousin Miranda, just back from Paris—"

"What a coincidence! Your cousin's lovely," Evelyn said sincerely.

Maxwell's stomach dropped.

No jealousy. No hurt. Just polite indifference. The realization cut deeper than any anger.

"Evelyn..." He grasped for words.

Miranda pushed forward, fingering Evelyn's scarf. "A real Hermès? These retail for six figures overseas! Where'd you get this knockoff?" Her laugh rang false.
###Chapter 327

"This isn't authentic. I got a knockoff." Evelyn took three quick steps back. She never liked being too close to strangers.

She hadn't realized her scarf was designer.

Dominic had given it to her when she was cold. The cashmere felt feather-light yet warm, impossibly soft against her skin. She'd accepted it without thinking.

Had she known its true value, she would have refused immediately.

Miranda Lockwood smirked. "Obviously. Look at the rest of your outfit - bargain bin specials. Hermès is fashion royalty. Even I can't get my hands on their pieces, and I shop luxury weekly."

"Enough, Miranda!" Maxwell's voice turned sharp.

The short-haired woman sulked but muttered under her breath, "Stupid cousin. Just wait till I tell Aunt Lorraine..."

Maxwell ignored her. His gaze remained fixed on Evelyn.

When Miranda had unwrapped the scarf earlier, the love bite on Evelyn's neck had been unmistakable.

His vision blurred red with barely controlled rage.

That mark was Dominic's claim. A brutal reminder that Evelyn was no longer his.

Yet letting go wasn't an option.

The pain was excruciating.

Evelyn frowned at Maxwell's devastated expression. She moved to walk past him toward the mall entrance.

Maxwell seized her wrist. "Five minutes. That's all I ask."

"There's nothing left to say, Maxwell. We're strangers now. Dominic has... possessive tendencies. His temper isn't something you want to provoke again."

"Has he promised to marry you? Set a date? Men's promises vanish like morning mist until proven by action. Don't be fooled."

Evelyn laughed lightly. "What if I want to be fooled?"

Even in her simple wool dress, her curves were undeniable.

Maxwell's shoulders slumped.

'She's gone mad. Willingly deceived.'

He had no right to advise her. But surrender wasn't in his nature.

"Anything else, Mr. Lockwood?" Evelyn asked coolly. "If not, I'll be going."

"I never meant to hurt you. Can you forgive me?"

His desperation had driven him to use underhanded methods. Now those very actions had pushed her away.

"that chapter's closed."

Evelyn still couldn't comprehend his obsession.

Some mysteries weren't worth solving. She'd been a fleeting moment in his life. The past held no weight now.

An awkward silence fell over the parking lot.

Evelyn exhaled. "I'm leaving."

Maxwell watched her slender figure retreat until Miranda stomped into view.

"Pathetic," she sneered, crossing her arms. "Your taste in women is atrocious. I expected some glamorous socialite, not that plain little mouse. Have you gone blind? She's clearly a gold-digging—"

"Get lost!" Maxwell shoved her aside and slammed his car door.

Miranda pounded on the window. "Aunt Lorraine said you're taking me shopping! You can't abandon me here! Open this—"

The engine roared to life. Tires screeched as Maxwell sped away.

Miranda kicked the pavement viciously.

After mentally cursing him, she dialed a number. "Yvette? It's Miranda. I'm back. Meet me at XX Mall immediately. I'll buy you two outfits. Hurry up!"

Meanwhile, Abigail played with children under a Christmas tree. She spotted Evelyn approaching, cheeks flushed from cold.

They grabbed vanilla chai lattes at a nearby café.

Evelyn cradled the warm cup gratefully. "Thanks, Abby."

"Maxwell didn't cause trouble, did he?"

To Abigail, Maxwell was nothing but a thug.

Knowing Evelyn was Dominic's woman, he'd still tried to steal her. His actions disgusted her.

"No. We're strangers now." Evelyn sipped her drink. "Perfect for winter. If I were a man, I'd marry you for this."

Abigail chuckled at the childish remark.

Evelyn was so different from the serious designer at work.

"Let's shop for clothes," Abigail urged, leading her into the mall. "You need more variety. I always see you recycling the same three outfits..."

"Just an evening gown today."

Abigail sighed. "This isn't the Dark Ages. Women should dress beautifully. Look at Vivienne - new designer pieces daily. You're gorgeous, but presentation matters. What if some vixen steals Dominic's eye?"

Evelyn smiled. If Dominic were that fickle, she'd never have chosen him.

They browsed until finding a luxury boutique with exquisite evening wear.

Evelyn's fingers brushed a stunning sapphire gown.

Another hand grabbed it simultaneously.

She looked up—and froze.

Lillian Prescott smirked back at her.
###Chapter 328

"Look! Isn't that Lillian Prescott? I never thought we'd run into her here!" Abigail whispered excitedly into Evelyn's ear.

As an avid drama fan who followed entertainment news religiously, Abigail immediately recognized the rising star.

Lillian wore minimal makeup with her hair pulled into a sleek ponytail. Her designer casual outfit hugged every curve, exuding effortless elegance.

Evelyn wasn't familiar with the actress beyond knowing she was a celebrity. The silver screen made Lillian appear more striking than in person. Though they'd crossed paths before, they'd never interacted. When Evelyn noticed Lillian eyeing the same gown, she politely stepped back.

"I'll browse other designs," Evelyn offered graciously.

To her, surrendering the dress meant nothing. The boutique overflowed with exquisite options.

But Evelyn never expected her courtesy to be mistaken for provocation.

Lillian's stilettos gave her a height advantage over Evelyn. She positioned herself arrogantly before Evelyn and sneered, "These are one-of-a-kind couture pieces, not rental costumes. If you can't afford them, you shouldn't be here. This store isn't for just anyone."

Evelyn blinked in surprise at the unexpected hostility.

They were complete strangers. Why this sudden attack?

Abigail had been discreetly reaching for her phone to snap photos, but Lillian's words instantly shattered her admiration. The actress always played sweet, gentle roles. Was this her true nature?

"Welcome back, Ms. Prescott! Our new collection just arrived. You'll adore it," a sales associate gushed, practically tripping over herself to assist the celebrity while ignoring Evelyn.

Lillian preened under the flattery, shooting Evelyn a contemptuous glance. "Why do you allow such poorly dressed riffraff in here?"

Evelyn frowned, bewildered by the actress's inexplicable animosity.

The clerk fawned over Lillian. "Just pretend they're not here, Ms. Prescott. Shall I show you our latest catalog?"

"Do you know her?" Abigail asked, sensing the palpable hostility from both the actress and clerk.

Evelyn shook her head. "Never met her before."

Abigail couldn't comprehend why Lillian would target a complete stranger.

Did she look down on "commoners"? How appalling!

Lillian strutted over, scrutinizing Evelyn from head to toe with a mocking smirk, as if evaluating merchandise.

The invasive inspection made Evelyn's skin crawl.

"Is this all you've got?" Lillian chuckled, uttering words that baffled Evelyn.

Evelyn had endured enough of this arrogance. "Do you realize how rude you're being, Ms. Prescott?" Her voice turned icy.

Lillian's gaze dripped with even more disdain.

'This is the woman Dominic loves? She can't even handle mild provocation.'

Lillian believed she surpassed Evelyn in every way. Why would Dominic choose her?

Abigail glared at Lillian before steering Evelyn away. "Ignore that lunatic. Her on-screen persona is clearly fake. What pretentious nonsense..."

Lillian's smirk faltered as reality crashed down. They were in a public space. Had anyone recorded this?

Her last public outburst at Maxwell's bar had gone viral, tarnishing her innocent image. Her agency barely contained the PR disaster, but some fans' perceptions were permanently altered.

Scanning the area, she noted only a few distant shoppers and exhaled in relief.

Spotting Evelyn examining a pristine white gown, Lillian sauntered over. "That's Gi's latest design. It would cost you years of salary. Can't afford it, can you? Pick something cheap—I'll pay." Her condescension was palpable.

Evelyn laughed incredulously. Before she could respond, Abigail sneered, "Oh, is the celebrity flashing her wealth? Don't mind if we do, Evelyn. Why stop at one? I'd like something too. Since you're so generous, Ms. Prescott, care to cover mine as well?"

"Help yourselves," Lillian said magnanimously. "Working-class girls like you could never afford anything here. Unless..." Her eyes gleamed maliciously. "Some women use their looks to seduce wealthy men into buying them things. Where's your man today? Did he abandon you?"

Though bewildered by Lillian's hostility, Evelyn sensed something sinister beneath the surface.

Meeting Lillian's gaze squarely, Evelyn decided to play along for the first time regarding her relationship.

"My man? He's terribly busy today—couldn't accompany me shopping. So thoughtful though—he sent Abigail to keep me company and promised to pick me up afterward." She sighed dramatically. "Honestly, I wish he'd give me some space sometimes!"

Abigail stifled a giggle at Evelyn's exaggerated performance.

Lillian's mocking smile froze as Evelyn's words struck home...
###Chapter 329

Evelyn wanted to snap back, but Abigail swiftly selected a violet evening gown and handed it to her.

"You came here for a dress, not to argue with irrational women, Evelyn. Let's try this on..."

Abigail nudged Evelyn toward the dressing room before settling onto a plush chair and flipping through a fashion magazine.

The luxury boutique offered impeccable service. The opulent decor was matched only by the complimentary gourmet beverages served to patrons. Abigail sipped her latte, savoring the moment—if only the snobbish salesgirl and haughty Lillian Prescott weren't ruining the atmosphere.

The dressing room door soon swung open.

Abigail gasped.

The transformation was staggering.

Evelyn had always been naturally beautiful, but her usual wardrobe of simple sweaters and minimal makeup made her blend into the background like a university student. Now, draped in that exquisite gown, she radiated elegance.

The violet silk clung to her curves, its plunging back showcasing her toned shoulders. The rich fabric contrasted stunningly against her porcelain skin, her delicate features now accentuated by the gown's regal design.

Even Evelyn seemed startled by her reflection.

Fine feathers indeed made fine birds.

The salesclerk's jaw nearly dropped. No other customer had ever done the gown such justice—it looked tailor-made for her.

Lillian froze, envy twisting her features.

Then a mocking voice cut through the silence. "Well, isn't this a revelation? A peasant cleans up nicely in designer wear. Too bad the dress can't mask her vulgarity."

Evelyn turned.

Maxwell Lockwood's cousin, Miranda, stood smirking in the doorway. Behind her loomed a broad-shouldered girl with thick eyebrows, arms laden with shopping bags like a pack mule.

Evelyn's lips thinned. She despised Maxwell's relatives.

"Miss, do you usually permit such uncouth behavior in your establishment?" Abigail asked pointedly.

Miranda's temper flared. That woman had cost her Maxwell's attention earlier—now she'd pay.

"Who are you calling uncouth?" she spat.

Lillian watched gleefully. Whoever this newcomer was, she seemed determined to humiliate Evelyn publicly.

Ignoring Miranda, Evelyn strode to the counter and produced a sleek black card. "I'll take this."

"Wait!" Miranda barked. "I want that dress!"

The clerk hesitated. "Ma'am, this gown is reserved. Perhaps another style—"

"I don't care!" Miranda's eyes burned with spite. She'd take everything from this woman—especially since Maxwell clearly still pined for her.

Lillian nearly rolled her eyes. Couldn't the idiot see the unlimited credit card in Evelyn's hand?

Abigail moved to intervene, but Evelyn beat her to it.

"Did your parents neglect your upbringing, child?" Evelyn's voice dripped ice. "Throwing tantrums and spewing filth—perhaps you belong back in kindergarten."

Towering over Miranda in her heels, Evelyn's disdain was palpable.

Miranda's face purpled with rage. She shot a glare at her thick-browed shadow...

Unfazed, Evelyn completed her purchase and changed back into her clothes.

She never noticed the slip of paper stealthily tucked into her coat pocket.
###Chapter 330

Abigail watched Evelyn finish purchasing her gown. "Now that we're done here, let's get going. This place reeks of something foul." She dramatically waved a hand in front of her nose.

Lillian and Miranda's expressions darkened instantly. Were they being insulted?

"Watch your tongue! Who exactly are you calling foul?" Miranda snapped, her face flushing with anger.

Evelyn tightened her grip on Abigail's hand and responded icily, "Whoever reacts."

Miranda viciously kicked her thick-browed companion's shin. "Teach these two a lesson!"

Yvette, ever the loyal attack dog, dropped her shopping bags and lunged at Evelyn and Abigail.

Before she could lay a finger on them, Abigail swiftly extended her leg, tripping the woman mid-charge. In one fluid motion, she grabbed Yvette's arm and executed a perfect shoulder throw. The bulky woman crashed onto the marble floor, groaning in pain.

"That's all you've got? Didn't anyone tell you I'm a black belt?" Abigail smirked, flipping her hair dismissively at Miranda.

"Let's go, Abby." Evelyn gently pulled her friend's sleeve.

As they turned to leave, Miranda shot Yvette a meaningful look. The fallen woman suddenly shrieked, "Miranda! The diamond necklace you just bought - it's gone! It was right here in the shopping bag earlier!"

Miranda feigned shock. "Impossible! That necklace cost 900,000 dollars!"

Yvette scrambled up, waving a receipt wildly. "It's really missing! The box too! Only this receipt remains..."

Nearby sales associates rushed over at the commotion. "Miss, perhaps you misplaced it? Maybe it's still at the jewelry store?" one suggested nervously. After all, they'd be responsible if such an expensive item disappeared in their store.

"No! I specifically remember putting it in this bag right after purchase!" Miranda emptied every shopping bag dramatically. "It was here when we entered, but after arguing with her," she pointed accusingly at Evelyn, "my necklace vanished! It was a birthday gift for my mother..."

The sales clerks examined the receipt - indeed purchased mere hours ago. As they helped search, their gazes kept drifting suspiciously toward Evelyn and Abigail.

Lillian, with her celebrity status, remained above suspicion. Why would someone of her wealth need to steal?

When the search proved fruitless, Miranda pointed an accusing finger. "It disappeared right after our confrontation. I demand you search them!"

Abigail's temper flared. "How dare you! That cheap trinket isn't worth my time!"

One clerk suggested nervously, "Since everyone present is a potential witness, perhaps we should check all bags?"

Lillian shrugged indifferently. "Search mine if you must. This doesn't concern me." She'd seen Yvette slip the necklace into Evelyn's coat pocket earlier but wouldn't interfere - watching Evelyn suffer amused her.

"Search us without consent? Have you lost your minds?" Evelyn's voice cut through the room like ice.

The clerk flinched but persisted. "A customer lost valuable property here. If you're innocent, why refuse?"

"No one touches my belongings. I regret ever stepping foot in this wretched place!" Abigail snapped.

The clerk pleaded, "Please cooperate. Otherwise we'll have to involve the police."

"You may search mine first," Lillian offered sweetly.

After verifying Lillian's bag contained nothing, the clerk turned expectantly. "See? Even Ms. Prescott cooperated. Won't you two do the same?"

"Lay one finger on my bag and I'll break it!" Abigail raised a threatening fist, making the clerk recoil - they'd all witnessed her martial arts skills moments ago.

"We never touched that necklace. What gives you the right?" Evelyn's glare could freeze lava.

"It's my property! I'll search them myself!" Miranda lunged for Evelyn's coat.

Evelyn, focused on protecting her handbag, didn't notice Miranda's hand darting toward her pocket.

Just as Miranda's fingers brushed the fabric, a powerful arm wrapped around Evelyn's waist, pulling her into a protective embrace. Miranda crashed face-first into a chest like steel.

Dazed, she looked up into the most breathtakingly handsome face she'd ever seen - more striking than even her cousin Maxwell.

Her jaw dropped.

Such perfection existed?

Lillian recognized the man instantly. She spun around too late to avoid detection.

The sales staff gasped collectively. They'd recognize that face anywhere - Dominic Blackwood, CEO of T Corporation, regularly graced financial magazine covers.

"G-good evening, Mr. Blackwood," they stammered.

Dominic ignored them, his gaze locked on Evelyn. "Why wouldn't I come when my woman's being harassed?"

Evelyn blinked in surprise. She'd lied earlier about Dominic picking her up just to annoy Lillian - never expecting him to actually appear.

Unbeknownst to her, Dominic had installed tracking software on her phone after the last incident. While he respected her privacy, her safety remained his priority.

He'd heard enough upon entering to understand the setup. Now, his smoldering gaze swept over the accusers, promising retribution.
###Chapter 331

"Fetch your manager." Dominic's voice cut through the air like a blade.

One of the sales associates scrambled toward the back office.

Moments later, the manager appeared, his face paling when he recognized Dominic. He bowed deeply, his tone dripping with sycophancy. "Mr. Blackwood! What an honor to have you in our humble store. How may I assist you? Shall I have anything wrapped for you?"

Dominic didn’t respond. Instead, he flipped open his wallet, revealing an array of gleaming platinum cards. He selected one and handed it over. "The entire store."

Evelyn's eyes widened. She wanted to protest.

God, he’s insane. And insanely hot.

Not just generous—territorial. That’ll shut those vipers up.

"Of course! Everything here is now yours. Do as you please," the manager gushed before scurrying off to process the payment.

The staff stood frozen, stunned into silence.

Lillian Prescott seethed. Why did Evelyn deserve a man like Dominic?

Her resolve hardened. Men like him—wealthy, devastatingly handsome—were rare. She would have him.

But Miranda Lockwood wasn’t backing down.

Sure, the man was attractive and loaded, but he’d sided with the woman she despised. That made him an enemy.

"Listen, rich boy," Miranda sneered, "stay out of this. That thief stole my necklace. A custom piece. Worth nearly a million. You really want to defend a criminal?"

Miranda had spent years abroad, surrounded by spoiled trust-fund brats. She didn’t recognize Dominic, nor did she care about business headlines. To her, he was just another pretty face with money.

She jabbed a finger at Evelyn. "If she’s innocent, why refuse a search?"

Evelyn arched a brow. "And if you don’t find it?"

"I’ll apologize publicly and compensate you." Miranda smirked.

"Fine." Evelyn spread her arms. "Search me."

Miranda lunged—only for Dominic to seize her wrist, his grip crushing. "Try it. I dare you."

The staff exchanged nervous glances.

Rich clients meant volatile tempers. They weren’t paid enough to intervene.

Dominic’s glare was lethal. Miranda trembled but forced a laugh. "Let go, or I’m calling the police."

She fumbled for her phone with her free hand.

Dominic snatched it and smashed it against the floor.

The device shattered. Miranda gaped at the wreckage.

He just—

"I’ll replace it," Dominic said coldly. "But touch my woman again, and you’ll regret it."

Miranda stumbled back, speechless.

Dominic took Evelyn’s hand and strode toward the exit. Pausing, he glanced at Abigail. "Handle the rest."

Abigail nodded eagerly. "Of course, Mr. Blackwood."

She couldn’t believe her luck. The boss had noticed her. Trusted her.

Evelyn was her golden ticket.

With Dominic’s hand wrapped around hers, Evelyn felt the warmth of his skin, the unyielding strength. Safe. Protected.

Yet she sighed. Why does drama stalk me like a shadow?

"Dominic," she murmured as they walked, "you didn’t have to buy out the store."

He didn’t respond, his pace steady.

She bit her lip. "I just think—"

Noticing her heels, Dominic slowed. His gaze softened. "Don’t worry about the money."

"Fine." She relented. Arguing with a Blackwood was futile.

That single purchase probably exceeded her lifetime earnings. To him? Pocket change.

"Tonight’s dinner," he said, tucking a strand of her hair behind her ear, "is Jonathan Prescott’s seventieth. VIPs galore, but stay close. You’ll be fine."

"The same critical Mr. Prescott?"

Dominic smirked. "He’s blunt, not cruel. He won’t touch you while I’m there."

Evelyn nodded, tightening her grip on his arm.

With him, she feared nothing.

Back inside, Miranda glared at her shattered phone. "Who is that arrogant bastard?"

Lillian ignored her, brushing past.

Miranda spat after her before plopping onto the floor. "My necklace went missing here. Fix this, or I’m not leaving!"

Losing a 900K piece? Her family would skin her alive.

Abigail smirked and signaled security.

Within minutes, guards hauled Miranda and her friend out, kicking and screaming.
###Chapter 332

The night sky glittered with countless stars, casting their ethereal glow upon the snow-covered city below.

Though winter's chill gripped the outdoors, the Millennia Hotel radiated warmth and opulence. The grand ballroom hosted the 70th birthday celebration of Christopher Prescott, retired political heavyweight.

Every influential figure from business, politics, and military circles had gathered for the occasion.

Crystal chandeliers sparkled overhead while an elaborate mural adorned the walls. The roaring fireplace added to the luxurious ambiance.

Christopher sat regally in his tailored suit, every movement exuding the authority of his political career.

Despite his age, his presence commanded respect. Guests lined up to offer their birthday wishes.

Each attendee represented the elite of society.

Though retired, Christopher's influence remained formidable. His son Jonathan Prescott's current position as provincial governor only added to the family's prestige.

Jonathan and his wife Genevieve greeted guests in the lobby. While Genevieve thrived in the social setting, Jonathan appeared less enthusiastic.

He'd only organized this lavish affair at his father's insistence.

"Happy birthday, Grandfather! May you enjoy everlasting health and prosperity!" Lillian Prescott's melodic voice cut through the chatter.

The rising starlet wore an ivory off-shoulder gown that complemented her delicate features. Her subtle makeup enhanced her natural beauty.

She appeared almost angelic amidst the crowd.

With so many important guests present, Christopher couldn't ignore his granddaughter completely. Yet his response remained tepid. "Thank you for making time in your busy schedule."

Lillian's smile faltered momentarily.

Was that a veiled criticism about her infrequent visits?

She knew her grandfather wouldn't welcome her even if she came. She wasn't one to invite rejection.

Quickly masking her irritation, Lillian produced an ornate gift box. "You're my only grandfather. No schedule could keep me from your birthday. Work can wait, but family comes first..."

Christopher remained unmoved by her sweet words, though his wife Elizabeth beamed with delight.

"How thoughtful, dear Lillian! I heard about your recent overseas filming. Have you recovered from the jet lag?" Elizabeth clasped Lillian's hands affectionately.

Lillian playfully stuck out her tongue. "I'm perfectly fine, Grandmother. I found this gift for Grandfather during my trip. I hope you'll like it."

Elizabeth unwrapped the package eagerly. Inside lay an antique jade tobacco pipe of considerable value.

"Remarkable! Just last week your grandfather mentioned wanting a new pipe. How did you know?" Elizabeth marveled.

Christopher studied Lillian with an unreadable expression but remained silent.

"As long as it pleases Grandfather," Lillian demurred.

She'd overheard her grandparents discussing his pipe collection during a previous visit - perfect inspiration for this gift.

"You spoil your grandfather too much! But I suppose it's his special day," Elizabeth teased, though her fond gaze never left Lillian.

Other guests murmured approvingly at the apparent closeness between grandmother and granddaughter.

Lillian embraced Elizabeth coyly. "Don't be jealous, Grandmother! I brought something for you too!"

At her signal, her agent Tabitha approached with another elegant box.

Elizabeth gasped upon opening it to reveal an exquisite embroidered shawl.

Murmurs of admiration rippled through the female guests.

"Stunning craftsmanship!" "The needlework is extraordinary!"

Tabitha interjected smoothly, "Madam, Lillian personally embroidered this over a month, even turning down film roles to complete it."

The revelation caused another wave of impressed exclamations.

"Lillian did this herself? Incredible!"
"Not just a talented actress but skilled with needlework too!"
"Elizabeth, you're blessed with such a granddaughter!"
"My nephew was recently promoted to general. Perhaps we could arrange an introduction..."

Lillian maintained perfect composure, lowering her eyes modestly at the praise. Her demure act captivated both society ladies and eligible bachelors unaware of her true nature.

Suddenly, a collective gasp echoed through the ballroom.

Lillian turned toward the commotion.

A striking couple had entered.

The man stood tall in his custom-tailored suit, his chiseled features and icy gaze commanding attention. Yet when he looked at the woman beside him, his expression softened noticeably.

Dominic Blackwood, CEO of Titan Corporation.

Genevieve Prescott studied the woman on Dominic's arm, experiencing an unsettling sense of recognition...
###Chapter 333

The woman standing beside Dominic was breathtaking.

Evelyn wore an amethyst evening gown that swayed like blooming wisteria with her every movement. Her crescent-shaped eyes sparkled like constellations when she smiled.

Genevieve had encountered countless remarkable women, but this young lady stirred an inexplicable sense of familiarity within her. What startled Genevieve most was how the girl's features bore striking resemblance to her own youthful appearance...

When Evelyn met Genevieve's gaze, she too felt an odd connection with the poised middle-aged woman.

Genevieve's gentle demeanor and carefully curated party attire concealed her true age. Guests unanimously perceived her as both aristocratic and approachable.

"Welcome to Mr. Prescott's seventieth birthday celebration." Genevieve greeted the couple warmly, though her smile faltered when noticing Dominic's companion.

Initially charmed by Evelyn's familiar aura, Genevieve's maternal instincts surged upon recognizing Dominic. The towering businessman possessed an aura more commanding in person than any magazine could capture. Lillian had excellent taste, but...

"Mrs. Prescott." Dominic inclined his head respectfully.

Genevieve studied him like a prospective son-in-law. 'Such an impressive young man,' she thought, 'but why bring another woman to this occasion? Surely he knows Lillian's feelings?'

Her initial warmth toward Evelyn chilled instantly. After losing her biological daughter decades ago, Lillian had been her saving grace. No one would come between her adopted child and happiness.

Evelyn's intuition prickled at Genevieve's sudden frostiness. Why would this elegant stranger regard her with such hostility?

Dominic remained oblivious. With a gift box in one hand and Evelyn's fingers entwined in his other, he exchanged pleasantries with Jonathan before approaching the guest of honor.

Christopher Prescott sipped tea amidst a mountain of presents - mostly health supplements and regional delicacies. The retired statesman's reputation for integrity was legendary. When a corrupt official once attempted bribery disguised as a gift, Christopher had personally ensured the man's imprisonment.

This unshakable moral compass earned Dominic's profound respect. He added his contribution to the pile. "Happy birthday, sir. I brought specialty cakes from Paris - your favorite."

Christopher's laughter boomed. "Dominic, you spoil me! Imported desserts for an old man?"

The elder statesman knew Dominic well as Reginald Blackwood's grandson. Though political differences had estranged their families, Christopher admired how Dominic had expanded T Corporation globally, revitalizing A City's economy.

His gaze shifted curiously to Evelyn. "And who's this lovely companion?"

Strangely, Christopher felt an immediate fondness for her - more than he'd ever felt toward his own granddaughter.

Across the room, Lillian's gaze burned into Dominic. Dressed formally, he looked devastatingly handsome. Her infatuation blinded her to all else...

Dominic squeezed Evelyn's nervous hand. "Sir, this is Evelyn Sinclair. My fiancée."

The declaration rang clear through the hall. Evelyn's heart hammered against her ribs as Dominic's adoring gaze set her pulse racing. He'd publicly claimed their relationship!

Lillian's entire body convulsed. Her lovesick expression twisted into something venomous. White-hot jealousy licked through her veins.

How dare this nobody - this orphan with a dead father and imprisoned relatives - steal her destined man?
###Chapter 334

Evelyn's fingers curled into tight fists. How could someone like her ever be worthy of the magnificent Dominic?

Christopher Prescott's eyes lit up at Dominic's introduction. "Evelyn Sinclair? The brilliant mind behind my new estate design?"
"Yes, Mr. Prescott. If you have any feedback, I'd be honored to hear it." Evelyn's voice was honey-smooth, instantly winning the older man's approval.

'Remarkable,' Christopher thought. 'Not only talented but humble too.' He could see why Dominic was smitten.

Meanwhile, Elizabeth Prescott noticed her granddaughter's stormy expression.
Lillian hadn't taken her eyes off Dominic all evening.
That possessive glare when Dominic called Evelyn his girlfriend...
Elizabeth's heart ached for her beloved granddaughter.

Unlike her husband, Elizabeth had no warmth for Evelyn.
This nobody had stolen the man Lillian wanted.
Her scrutinizing gaze raked over Evelyn. "Young lady, which prominent family do you belong to?"

Dominic's grip on Evelyn's hand tightened. "Her family isn't what matters. She's the one I've chosen."
Elizabeth's lips curled at the confirmation of Evelyn's common status.
The girl might have pretty features, but her timid demeanor reeked of inferiority.

Evelyn puzzled over the older woman's hostility.
She'd never met Elizabeth or Genevieve before tonight. Why did they look at her like she'd committed some crime?

Dominic smoothly changed the subject. "We won't disturb you further." He guided Evelyn away, sensing her discomfort.
Truthfully, he'd skip these tedious events entirely if not for Christopher.

From across the room, Lillian watched them leave, her eyes dark with unreadable emotions.

The luxury hotel offered every indulgence - themed bars, gourmet restaurants, serene cafes.
Dominic led Evelyn to the secluded observation deck.
Floor-to-ceiling windows framed the glittering cityscape below.
Plush wicker chairs surrounded an oval crystal table set with porcelain tea service.

"Wait here if the crowd overwhelms you." Dominic lifted her onto a chair.
He pressed a kiss to her cheek and slid a black card into her palm. "Buy whatever you like. Just be back by midnight." His tone was playful, as if addressing a child.

Evelyn scrambled up, cheeks flushing. "I'm perfectly capable of not getting lost."
With her promise to stay put, Dominic returned to his hosting duties.

Alone at last, Evelyn exhaled.
Social events weren't her forte, especially high-society galas.
At least Christopher seemed kind, unlike those two women's inexplicable glares.
She pushed the thought away. They'd likely never cross paths again.

Through the glass, she observed the glittering ballroom below.
Elegant guests mingled to soft jazz, crystal glasses catching the light.
Lillian moved through the crowd with practiced grace, receiving endless compliments.
A far cry from the sneering fashionista Evelyn had encountered.

"You must be Evelyn."
The sudden voice made her jump.
Genevieve Prescott stood behind her, smiling with calculated warmth.
Despite her elegant appearance, something about the woman set Evelyn's nerves on edge.

"Mrs. Prescott?"
"Join me for tea." Genevieve gestured to the vacant chair.
Evelyn reluctantly sat. "What can I do for you?"
"It's about my daughter. You've quite ruined her appetite tonight." Genevieve's smile didn't reach her eyes.
"I don't understand."
"Let's not pretend, dear. I'm here to ask you to leave Dominic Blackwood. Voluntarily."
She poured tea with deliberate slowness, sliding the cup toward Evelyn.
###Chapter 335

Evelyn's gaze locked onto Genevieve, who was delicately sipping her tea.

Every shred of goodwill she might have had for that woman evaporated instantly.

She knew many opposed her relationship with Dominic due to their differing social statuses. But never had she imagined a complete stranger would demand she leave him.

"Whatever your motives, Mrs. Prescott, I won't abandon him," Evelyn stated coldly, her respect nonexistent.

Genevieve toyed elegantly with her teacup, but her words cut like knives. "Evelyn, you're newly in love. Everything seems romantic now. But love and marriage are entirely different matters. It's not just about two people - it's about two families."

"Dominic is Beatrice Lockwood's son. As her closest friend, I know she'd never accept someone like you into their household. Without parental blessings, your marriage won't last."

"What exactly can you offer the Blackwood family? With your background, you'd only be a burden..."

Evelyn's chest rose sharply. "Mrs. Prescott, our relationship is none of your concern. All that matters is our love for each other. My family background might be humble, but that's no reason to separate."

Genevieve's smile remained gentle yet razor-sharp. "You're living in a fantasy! Do you think love alone sustains marriage? Matching status isn't just about family names - it's worldviews, ambitions, finances."

"Consider Lillian's pedigree. Our family fully supports this union. We can provide T Corporation with resources to flourish."

"Lillian attended elite schools since childhood, always top of her class."

"Though in entertainment now, her education rivals Dominic's. They're perfectly matched. I'm advising you for your own good. When Dominic's infatuation fades and he realizes your incompatibility, the heartbreak will devastate you..."

Evelyn shot to her feet.

Her slender frame trembled, yet she stood unwavering.

Defiant as a storm-battered pine.

"Have you ever asked Dominic if he wants Lillian?" Evelyn challenged. "Status matters, but a loveless marriage is like a fishless pond."

"I don't know what bound you to your husband. Perhaps Mr. Prescott spoils you, shielding you from marital despair. Take it from someone who knows - forcing two unloving people together is torture. Dominic doesn't love your daughter. Would you condemn her to that misery?"

Evelyn expected anger, a dramatic check-throwing scene like cheap romances.

Instead, Genevieve remained impassive. Her gentle gaze and patient expression nearly made Evelyn doubt herself.

The realization struck - this was a politician's wife. No wonder she maintained such composure.

Noticing Evelyn's wariness, Genevieve smiled. Setting down her cup, she said gently, "My apologies for being abrupt. Lillian has admired Dominic for years - as her mother, I must advocate for her. Please don't take offense."

Her sudden amiability left Evelyn speechless. Yet the observation deck's air grew stifling.

Genevieve rose, studying Evelyn with unexpected complexity. "I won't force you. But reconsider - for your own sake. You're intelligent enough to understand the truth in my words."

After Genevieve departed, Evelyn collapsed into the wicker chair, heart aching.

She gulped the tea. Though sweet, it turned bitter on her tongue.

So Lillian Prescott wanted Dominic Blackwood. No wonder the starlet glared at her.

Thankfully, she trusted Dominic's love completely. Otherwise, Genevieve's words might have seeded doubt.

What a formidable opponent.

Evelyn sighed. Her extraordinary man certainly attracted trouble.

Downstairs in the hall...

Sylvia swirled her wine, clinking glasses with the preoccupied Genevieve. Her gaze drifted meaningfully toward the observation deck.

A solitary figure stood there, radiating loneliness.

"Sylvia, I saw you speaking with that Evelyn girl earlier. Had I not known better, I'd swear you were mother and daughter. The resemblance is uncanny - faces, figures, even mannerisms. How could two strangers mirror each other so perfectly?"

As lifelong friends, Sylvia and her husband naturally attended Old Mr. Prescott's celebration.

While mingling, Sylvia had witnessed the striking similarity between the two women on the deck.

Their proximity made the resemblance undeniable...
###Chapter 336

"You're reading too much into it. Doppelgängers exist everywhere. Look at Lillian."

Genevieve Prescott swirled her wine glass absently. "She has two professional body doubles for filming scenes. It's perfectly normal. If every lookalike meant blood relations, the world would be drowning in reunited families."

Her gaze drifted toward the observation deck where Evelyn Sinclair stood.

That fragile-looking girl had fire in her eyes.

Genevieve's expression hardened.

Evelyn was an obstacle to her daughter's happiness.

And Genevieve would move heaven and earth for Lillian.

She owed her late biological daughter that much. Every ounce of love she couldn't give her firstborn now belonged to Lillian.

Across the ballroom, Lillian Prescott perched at the bar beside her closest friend, picking at a fruit platter.

Cassandra Prescott lived up to her name—alluring, cunning, and dressed like she'd stepped off a Paris runway.

When Lillian first arrived at the Prescott mansion—a shabby, wide-eyed girl—the elite circles mocked her. Cassandra, the Weish family's illegitimate daughter, became her unlikely mentor in fashion and manipulation.

Lillian had learned well.

Even as they chatted, her eyes kept straying toward Dominic Blackwood.

Cassandra nudged her. "Stop undressing Mr. Blackwood with your eyes, darling. If you want him, say something." A sly grin curled her lips.

Lillian flushed. "It's not that simple. He's already smitten with Evelyn."

The memory of Dominic doting on Evelyn made her nails dig into her palms.

Cassandra exhaled a smoke ring. "So? Marriage certificates burn nicely. You're a Prescott. Act like one."

She demonstrated by adjusting her shawl, letting it slip just enough to make nearby men choke on their drinks.

"See? Men are simple creatures. You're gorgeous, wealthy, and untouched. Use that."

She pressed a tiny vial into Lillian's hand. "Special order from Switzerland. Two sprays in his drink, and he'll see only you. Odorless. Untraceable."

Lillian hesitated.

Cassandra smirked. "Grandfather's birthday gala. Hundreds of witnesses. If Dominic gets caught in a compromising position with you..."

Lillian's fingers closed around the vial.

She'd been the perfect daughter. The chaste starlet.

But perfection hadn't gotten her Dominic.

Maybe it was time to play dirty.
###Chapter 337

Evelyn caught her reflection in the polished glass panel.

The ivory evening gown draped elegantly over one shoulder, its plunging neckline revealing just enough of her porcelain skin to be tantalizing. The open back design showcased the delicate curve of her spine, while the daring thigh-high slit teased glimpses of her toned legs with every step.

She looked every inch the seductive angel - innocent face contrasting with the provocative dress. A satisfied smile played on her lips.

Though she despised Cassandra's promiscuous ways, Evelyn had to admit her childhood friend had impeccable taste in fashion. Years of friendship had clearly rubbed off on her.

Whispers of admiration followed her through the crowd. Several men boldly asked for her number, stroking her ego beautifully.

Yet beneath the composed exterior, her heart raced faster than during her first film audition. Her gaze kept drifting to Dominic, deep in conversation across the room.

She needed to get him alone.

Just as she was strategizing, a small blur collided with her side.

Caught off guard, her stiletto twisted. She tumbled gracelessly, the tiny vial slipping from her fingers.

Evelyn watched in horror as the hallucinogenic drug rolled across the floor, coming to rest against polished military boots.

The man towering above was built like a tank - broad shoulders straining against his fatigues, dark stubble shadowing his jaw. His unbuttoned collar revealed bronzed muscle, but his piercing gaze held dangerous intensity.

Like death personified.

He picked up the vial, examining the Greek label: "ipppaKO yia to Kpwpa." A slow, knowing sniff confirmed his suspicions. His eyes narrowed at Evelyn like a predator sighting prey.

Her breath hitched. Cassandra had assured her the "cold medicine" label would fool anyone. This brute shouldn't be able to read Greek.

Before she could react, pudgy hands grabbed her waist.

"Are you alright, Ms. Prescott?" The balding man's grip lingered too long, his acne-scarred face leering. Clearly hoping to curry favor with Jonathan Prescott's daughter.

"Thank you. You may release me now," she said through gritted teeth, repulsed by his sweaty palms.

Evelyn turned toward her tiny assailant - a strikingly handsome boy of about six, dressed like a storybook prince. Before she could speak, the imp stuck out his tongue and bolted.

Little Oliver Kensington knew better than to stick around. Daddy's belt awaited misbehaving boys.

Suppressing her fury, Evelyn approached the bearded soldier. "Excuse me, sir. You seem to have found my cold medicine..."

Wesley Thornton's gaze raked over her like she was the last woman on earth. His eyes lingered shamelessly on every curve, making her skin crawl.

When his stare dropped to her backside, she spun away. "How dare you!"

Snatching the vial, she fled to Dominic's side. Watching his handsome profile soothed her nerves. She'd already devised the perfect seduction plan.

Yet Wesley's predatory gaze haunted her. Something told her this shark wouldn't be so easily shaken off.
###Chapter 338

The grand event hall buzzed with energy.

"Cheers!" Three strikingly handsome men clinked their glasses together. Their presence commanded attention from every woman in the vicinity.

These were the three most powerful men in A City.

Dominic Blackwood, CEO of T Corporation. Preston Worthington, head of Worthington Enterprises. James Kensington, chairman of Kensington Holdings. Few knew these men with vastly different personalities had been inseparable since university.

Their friendship had only grown stronger over the years.

Dominic's chiseled features exuded quiet authority. His piercing gaze held both danger and allure, making men nervous and women weak-kneed. Despite his global business empire, he maintained an impeccable reputation as A City's most eligible bachelor.

James Kensington possessed striking mixed-heritage features. His amber eyes sparkled with intelligence and charm. The Kensington fortune was legendary, and James was its cunning steward - a wolf in sheep's clothing who played social games with effortless grace.

His notorious playboy lifestyle filled gossip columns. Though he had a five-year-old son, the mother's identity remained his best-kept secret. This mystery only made women pursue him more fiercely.

Preston Worthington's beauty bordered on ethereal. His porcelain skin contrasted sharply with the sapphire ring on his thumb. The tailored trench coat accentuated his elegant frame. Publicly, he was a corporate titan. Privately, he ruled A City's underworld with ruthless efficiency.

Dominic conversed with his friends, but his gaze kept drifting toward the observation deck...

James playfully nudged Dominic's shoulder. "Never thought you'd be the first among us to settle down. And with such a stunning wife too."

Dominic flashed a knowing smile. "You're not doing too badly yourself. A five-year-old heir already. Who's the lucky mother?"

Preston raised his glass toward James. "I'm curious about that myself."

James smirked at his friends' probing. "Please. Preston, did Dominic ever tell you about his twins' mother before the truth came out? If he kept that secret for years, what makes you think I'll reveal mine? What if I told you my son's mother was a fairy from another realm?"

Preston rolled his eyes.

Dominic sipped his wine silently as the conversation turned to business matters.

Lillian Prescott approached the trio.

A seasoned actress, she moved with practiced grace, drawing every eye in the room.

"Dominic..."

She draped herself against Dominic's arm with familiar ease, then turned her dazzling smile to his companions. "Good evening, gentlemen. Friends of Dominic's?"

Preston and James exchanged amused glances.

'Doesn't she know Dominic hates being touched?'

Dominic's expression darkened. He discreetly extracted his arm. "Ms. Prescott, I prefer to keep physical contact to a minimum."

Lillian's smile faltered momentarily before she recovered. "Dominic..."

James watched the exchange with interest.

'Jonathan Prescott's adopted daughter has a crush on Dominic? Doesn't she know about the twins and their mother?'

He smoothly intervened, extending his hand. "James Kensington, at your service. I've admired your films, Ms. Prescott. You're even more radiant in person. How do you know our Dominic?"

Lillian recognized both men instantly. While both were eligible bachelors, one was a notorious playboy and the other had dangerous underworld connections. She preferred Dominic's clean reputation.

Still, the compliment pleased her. "You flatter me, Mr. Kensington. It's an honor to meet such distinguished gentlemen. I'm the spokesperson for one of T Corporation's perfume brands and needed to discuss something with Dominic."

She cast a coy glance at Dominic. Preston shot Dominic a look.

'Can't she see how uncomfortable he is? How dense.'

Dominic's tone turned icy. "As I've mentioned, Mr. Whitmore handles all brand collaborations. Please direct your inquiries to him."

Lillian stiffened. She hadn't expected public rejection.

"Daddy!" A child's cheerful voice interrupted.

Lillian turned to see the boy who'd bumped into her earlier, now holding Evelyn Sinclair's hand as they approached. Her eyes narrowed with barely concealed malice...
###Chapter 339

The first encounter between James Kensington and Preston Worthington with Evelyn Sinclair was nothing short of mesmerizing.

Evelyn radiated elegance like a rare gem, her maternal aura undeniable as she patiently soothed the mischievous Oliver Kensington.

Dominic Blackwood's gaze had locked onto Evelyn's serene face the moment she appeared, igniting a fiery jealousy in Lillian Prescott.

"Daddy!"

Oliver tugged Evelyn's hand and dashed to his father, wrapping his arms around the man's leg. "Daddy, I met this amazing lady at the observation deck. She's Alexander and Isabella's mommy, and she's so kind. Can you find me a mommy just like her?" He beamed up at James, eyes sparkling with excitement.

James pinched his son's ear playfully. "You little troublemaker. Every mommy I've found for you ran away because of your pranks. What makes you think I'll find another one?"

Oliver pouted dramatically, covering his eyes with his hands. "Daddy, those women were mean and smelled bad. Not like Miss Evelyn. And... and they were all wicked witches! They pretended to be nice when you were around, but the moment you left, they were horrible to me!" His voice cracked with fake sobs. "Boo hoo... my daddy doesn’t love me, and I don’t have a mommy. Nobody wants me..."

Evelyn's heart clenched at the sight of the adorable boy's "misery."

She scooped Oliver into her arms, gently patting his back. "There, there, sweetheart. Isabella is your age, and she doesn’t cry like this."

"I wish you were my mommy," Oliver sniffled, clinging to her neck, his eyes suspiciously dry despite his theatrics.

James sighed. His son was a master manipulator, all noise and no tears. Only someone as kind-hearted as Evelyn would fall for it.

"Miss Evelyn, I don’t want to stay with Daddy anymore. He’s mean! Hmph! I love you. Can I go with you?" Oliver blinked up at her with his best puppy-dog eyes.

Evelyn couldn’t resist his charm. "I’ll take him around the hotel, Dominic. Let me know before you leave?"

Dominic squeezed her hand. "Of course. Call me if you need anything." Then, without hesitation, he pressed a kiss to her lips right in front of everyone.

Evelyn flushed but didn’t protest. She had long given up trying to curb his public displays of affection, though warmth still bloomed in her chest.

"I’m a regular guest here, Ms. Sinclair. I’d be happy to show you around," Lillian offered sweetly, though her nails dug into her palms.

Evelyn hesitated, wary after Genevieve Prescott’s earlier warning about Lillian’s intentions.

Before she could decline, Oliver stuck his tongue out at Lillian. "We don’t want you! You’re an ugly old lady! Only Miss Evelyn can come with us!"

Lillian’s face twisted in fury. Ugly? Old lady?! She was young and beautiful!

Her composure cracked, but Evelyn swiftly intervened, flicking Oliver’s forehead lightly. "That’s very rude, young man. A gentleman should always be polite, especially to women. Understand?"

Oliver nodded, grinning sheepishly. "Yes, Miss Evelyn. I’ll be good."

James nearly choked. Since when did his little demon obey anyone?

Evelyn took Oliver to the hotel’s dazzling circus-themed park, filled with slides, jungle gyms, and a mesmerizing bubble gallery.

Oliver played with unbridled joy, his laughter ringing through the air as he and Evelyn created giant bubbles together.

Unseen, Lillian and Wesley Thornton watched from behind a log cabin.

Lillian forced a smile. "She’s beautiful, isn’t she? Pure and sweet. Want me to help you get her?"

Inside, her thoughts churned violently. She couldn’t stand Evelyn’s existence—not when Dominic looked at her like she was the sun.

Wesley’s gaze flickered to Evelyn, then back to Lillian. "She’s lovely, but right now, I’m more interested in you."

Lillian’s pulse spiked as Wesley stepped closer, his smirk predatory.

She stumbled back. "W-What are you—? If you dare touch me, Wesley, I’ll ruin you!"

His grin widened. "That’s exactly what I like about you. Scream all you want. Let everyone see the real you."

Lillian struggled, but Wesley was stronger.

Before she could react, he clamped a cloth over her nose and mouth.

Her vision blurred.

Then everything went black.
###Chapter 340

Wesley was a master of evasion. He pressed Lillian's face firmly against his chest.

The bustling hotel lobby saw nothing unusual—just another wealthy playboy with a woman in his arms. Such scenes were commonplace in five-star establishments.

Hidden cameras captured nothing identifiable as Wesley carried the semi-conscious Lillian outside.

He tossed her unceremoniously into the backseat of his black Bentley. His fingers tore at her already revealing gown with greedy urgency.

The fabric gave way easily, leaving her exposed beneath his predatory gaze. Lillian's drugged state made her pliant in his hands.

"Well, well... Not just a pretty face but a body made for sin," Wesley murmured appreciatively.

Desire burned through him like wildfire. He pounced without restraint.

"Oh God!"

"Perfect... Absolutely perfect!"

The more exquisite she felt beneath him, the rougher Wesley became.

Lillian stirred as violent movements roused her from chemical-induced stupor. In her haze, she mistook Wesley for Dominic.

Her heart swelled with delirious joy. "Dominic... love me... please... be gentle..." Each sharp bite sent paradoxical shivers of pleasure through her.

Wesley scowled at hearing another man's name. He'd make her regret that mistake.

"Does it hurt? You'll be screaming for more soon," he growled, increasing his brutal pace.

Lillian whimpered as pain and pleasure warred within her. Tears gathered in her lashes but only fueled Wesley's dark hunger.

"A virgin?" His laugh turned cruel. This discovery spurred greater violence.

The car rocked with their frenzied coupling.

"Too much... I can't..." Lillian gasped even as her nails scored Wesley's back, pulling him closer.

"Liar," Wesley taunted. "Your body begs differently."

Ecstasy overwhelmed her. "Ah! Dominic... more..."

Wesley grabbed his phone, capturing every compromising angle. "Let's memorialize your debauchery, darling."

Lillian remained oblivious, lost in drugged euphoria. In her mind, she'd finally captured Dominic Blackwood—the most coveted bachelor in the city.

If she bore his child, her status would be secured forever...

Meanwhile, Dominic and Evelyn exited the hotel into a winter wonderland.

Snow blanketed the city by midnight, transforming the streets into something magical.

"Dominic, look!" Evelyn wriggled free from his embrace, darting onto a pristine patch to stomp footprints. Having grown up in warmer climates, snow still thrilled her.

Despite the late hour, the college district buzzed with activity. Students laughed as one shook snow from tree branches.

"Come play!" Evelyn grabbed Dominic's hand, pulling him into a spontaneous snowball fight.

Dominic indulged her with an affectionate smile, adjusting her hood and scarf against the cold. Dark curls framed her face like a porcelain doll's.

For a moment, time folded. He saw again the small-town girl who'd unknowingly saved him years ago. Grandfather Reginald's exile had been a blessing in disguise.

"Dominic?" Evelyn tugged his sleeve, breaking his reverie.

With sudden boyish enthusiasm, he led her to a 24-hour convenience store for fireworks. They slipped through the gates of a nearby high school's athletic field under cover of darkness.

A distracted security guard chatted on his phone, back turned to the intruders. The lovers shared conspiratorial grins as they crept past...
###Chapter 341

The campus quad held a T-shaped stage at its center, likely set up for some school event earlier that day.

Midnight approached, leaving the snowy field deserted except for two figures.

A pristine white blanket covered everything in sight.

Dominic and Evelyn walked hand in hand toward the stage, their footprints marking the untouched snow behind them.

He lifted Evelyn onto the wooden platform before climbing up himself.

From his coat pocket, Dominic produced the sparklers they'd bought at a corner store earlier. Crouching down, he flicked his lighter to life.

Evelyn stood beside him, watching the tiny flame race along the fuse. Suddenly, the fireworks shot upward with a hiss.

Boom! A thousand golden tendrils exploded across the night sky.

Darkness transformed into a dazzling display of color.

Evelyn instinctively closed her eyes. Dominic grasped her hand and pulled her back a step.

The brilliant lights painted their faces in shifting hues, making them part of the spectacle.

Pure joy flooded Evelyn's heart.

Who would have thought cheap store-bought fireworks could create such magic?

"Thank you," she whispered. "I'll treasure this memory forever. This moment belongs only to us..."

Her nose pink from cold, Evelyn rose on tiptoes to wrap her arms around Dominic's neck.

She nuzzled against him like an affectionate kitten seeking warmth.

Though winter's chill surrounded them, Dominic's presence kept her warm.

"Your happiness is all that matters. I'd steal stars from heaven for you." His lips met hers in a tender kiss.

Snowflakes caught in Dominic's dark hair as he smiled, his eyes shining brighter than any firework.

The falling snow seemed to dance around him, settling on his lashes and lips.

In that moment, he looked like some ethereal winter spirit. Evelyn's pulse raced, her love for him overwhelming.

Just as their gazes locked, an angry shout shattered the moment.

A security guard in a heavy coat stormed across the field, flashlight beam cutting through the darkness.

"You students! What are you doing out so late? Fireworks are prohibited on campus! Which department are you from?" His voice carried across the quiet field.

"Oh no, we've been caught!" Evelyn panicked.

"Take my hand." Dominic's fingers tightened around hers. "Run!"

They dashed across the snow-covered quad, their laughter mixing with the fading sparks.

Soon they reached the road beyond campus gates, breathless from running.

When they'd put several blocks between themselves and the school, they ducked behind a towering pine tree.

"Don't worry," Dominic reassured her between breaths. "We'll say we were just taking a midnight jog. He can't prove otherwise."

"That was terrifying... and wonderful!" Evelyn's chest ached, but she wouldn't have traded the experience for anything.

Dominic's warm hand enveloped hers, a silent promise that he'd never let go.

Evelyn glanced back. The last sparks still drifted downward like falling stars against the night sky.

The frustrated guard eventually gave up his search, muttering as he returned to his post.

"Coast is clear." They emerged from their hiding spot.

Hand in hand, they watched the final embers fade to darkness before continuing their walk.

Near a brick wall, a slender figure stood motionless, nearly buried in snow.

At first Evelyn thought it was just someone leaning there.

As they approached, she realized it was actually two people locked in a tight embrace.

Young lovers, probably students. They seemed to be arguing - the girl wept quietly while weakly pounding the boy's chest with her fists.

The boy murmured soothing words, accepting her blows without complaint.

Young love looked so painfully pure. Even their fights seemed sweet.

Evelyn and Dominic exchanged knowing smiles, fingers intertwining more tightly.

They'd moved beyond that stage. After weathering life's storms together, they understood true love required trust. Only through that could they continue building their happily ever after.

"Evelyn," Dominic murmured, "being with you makes me feel young again."

He rested his forehead against hers, sharing warmth in the cold night.

"Nonsense. You'll always be my Prince Charming, father of my children." She giggled and gave his hand a playful squeeze. "My feet are getting tired..."

Without a word, Dominic crouched down, offering his back.

Evelyn climbed on, resting her chin on his shoulder as he walked. Snowflakes swirled around them.

The night stretched silent and dark, illuminated only by the soft glow of snow and occasional streetlamps.

The gently falling snow transformed the world into some dreamlike painting.

They could see each other clearly, but everything beyond remained blurred. Evelyn found she didn't mind - it made their little world feel more intimate.

"If only we could stay like this forever, Dominic..." A wistful sigh escaped as she leaned against his strong back.

She wondered if she should tell him about what Genevieve had said...
###Chapter 342

Evelyn hesitated.

She didn't want to upset Dominic by mentioning her encounter with Genevieve, but keeping it secret felt wrong.

Her current happiness was hard-won. The fear of losing it gnawed at her.

Compared to the other women vying for Dominic's attention, she felt painfully ordinary.

They came from powerful families with influence and prestige.

"Dominic," she whispered against his ear, her breath warm but tinged with melancholy. "I'll become a world-class designer. Then I'll deserve to stand beside you. The gossip won't matter then."

His steps never faltered as he carried her through the snow.

"I believe in you," he said, his voice steady. "Greatness takes time. My Evelyn will reach heights even I can't imagine."

His words settled deep in her heart, a promise she'd cherish forever.

Snowflakes danced around them like tiny spirits.

Plum blossoms defied the cold, their vibrant petals a stark contrast to the white landscape.

"Mrs. Prescott came to see me earlier."

Evelyn's white coat blended with the snow. "She told me to leave you. Said we're mismatched...that her daughter is better suited for you."

She'd decided honesty was best. Secrets had no place between them.

Dominic's smile vanished. His expression turned icy. "She said that to you?"

His tone was colder than the winter wind.

Evelyn, still on his back, missed his darkening gaze. "She said our families would never approve. Even my rivals' parents are confronting me now..."

Her light laugh couldn't mask the ache in her chest.

Dominic turned his head. His dark eyes burned with determination.

"Let me handle this."

Her cold fingers brushed through his hair. "Ignore them. Business and politics never mix well."

He adjusted his grip on her. "You're my priority. I'll protect you."

Tears pricked her eyes. "Dominic..."

"Yes, darling?"

"Dominic..."

"Always here."

She called his name repeatedly, each reply dissolving her fears.

She warmed his reddened ears with her hands. "Put me down. You must be exhausted."

Looking back, she saw only one set of footprints—deeper than usual from carrying her weight.

Those marks reminded her of their journey. No clear beginning or end, but every step together visible.

She believed their love could transform even the bleakest landscape.

At her insistence, Dominic set her down beneath a blooming plum tree.

Snow dusted their shoulders as petals rained around them.

He was breathtakingly handsome; she, ethereally beautiful.

Dominic studied Evelyn—silent yet radiant as moonlight on snow. He'd defy the world for her.

From his coat, he produced an exquisite jade pendant shaped like a petal, its edges softened with age.

He pressed it into her palm.

Her eyes widened at the priceless heirloom.

Before she could protest, his hand closed over hers.

"This was my grandmother's," he said. "She told me to give it to the woman I truly love."

He spoke of his grandmother for the first time—a kind soul trapped in a miserable marriage.

Evelyn listened as he recounted the woman who'd shown him rare childhood warmth before illness took her.

Her heart ached for the boy he'd been.

She embraced him. "You have me and our children now. Only happiness ahead."

His arms tightened around her.

With Evelyn and their family, he needed nothing more.
###Chapter 343

Dominic insisted on driving Evelyn back to Blackwood Manor that night.

She resisted at first. With all the negative press swirling around her, she was certain Reginald Blackwood and Beatrice would despise her presence.

But Dominic wouldn't take no for an answer. He wanted to declare to his entire family that Evelyn was his woman - soon to be Mrs. Blackwood.

Reluctantly, Evelyn followed him inside.

She trailed behind Dominic nervously, dreading any confrontation with Beatrice or the formidable family patriarch.

Fortunately, it was past midnight when they arrived. The manor lay silent, its occupants asleep. No one witnessed her entrance.

Evelyn first tiptoed to Alexander and Isabella's shared bedroom. The twins slept peacefully together - Isabella being too timid to sleep alone. Watching her angelic children's steady breathing, she pressed gentle kisses to their foreheads.

A steaming shower helped soothe her exhausted body.

Wrapped in a plush towel, she emerged to find Dominic already finished with his nightly routine. Without warning, he scooped her into his arms, carrying her toward his bedroom.

"You must have guest rooms here. I should stay in one of those, or maybe with the children..." Evelyn protested uneasily. Being in the Blackwood family home put her on edge.

"You're staying with me tonight." Dominic's grip tightened possessively around her waist. "I'm here. Nothing will happen to you."

"But—"

"Don't you trust me to handle my own family?" He brushed a kiss against her cheek. "You're the mother of my children, soon to be my wife. They need to accept that. Besides, we won't live here after we're married."

Evelyn exhaled in relief. The thought of daily confrontations with Beatrice as her mother-in-law made her stomach churn.

"Listen," Dominic continued, his tone lighter now. "The only real problem is my mother. Grandfather seems stern but he's reasonable. You can ignore Margaret completely. You've met Julian - he adores you as his sister-in-law. There's nothing to worry about."

Evelyn nodded resolutely. "I'll try my best with your family."

Dominic laid her on the bed, their bodies fitting together perfectly - her soft curves against his hard planes. As he stroked her hair, his voice turned serious. "The trial for Victoria and Sophia is the day after tomorrow..."

Evelyn stiffened. Between work and recent events, she'd nearly forgotten about the court date for the women who caused her father's suffering.

"I'll be there," she said through gritted teeth. Visions of her father's final moments flashed before her eyes - his labored breathing, his agonized twitches. The floodgates of hatred burst open anew.

That night, sleep eluded her. The impending trial and painful memories kept her tossing until dawn's first light.

When she finally awoke, Dominic's side of the bed was empty. Instead, two pairs of bright eyes stared at her from beside the bed.

Isabella poked Alexander excitedly. "See? Daddy didn't lie! Mommy really came to see us! Why is she still sleeping? Does Mommy like sleeping in too?"

Alexander pressed a finger to his lips. "Shh. Mommy works very hard. She needs extra rest. Let's not wake her."

Just then, Evelyn stirred and opened her eyes. The sight of her children's eager faces startled her momentarily before she remembered where she was.

"Alexander, Isabella, what time is it?" She glanced around for her phone.

Isabella scrambled onto the bed, her round eyes misty with curiosity. "It's nine o'clock, Mommy! It snowed earlier! Big Brother and I had a snowball fight while you were sleeping. Daddy says we're big kids now so we can't sleep in, but he lets you! That's not fair..."

Evelyn flushed. "I... I was very tired from work last night. Lost track of time." She cringed inwardly at being caught sleeping late.

"Your eyes look puffy, Mommy. Did Daddy make you cry?" Alexander asked protectively, always wary of his father's temper.

Evelyn checked her reflection. The sleepless night had left its mark. Luke's reminder about the trial had triggered endless replays of her father's suffering and the Montgomery women's cruelty - scenes too dark to share with innocent children.

She simply patted their heads reassuringly before reaching for her makeup. A dusting of powder and some concealer worked wonders, erasing the evidence of her restless night.

The twins watched in fascination as their mother transformed before their eyes, her beauty enhanced by the subtle enhancements.

Just as Evelyn finished, a knock sounded at the door. Alexander opened it to reveal a middle-aged housekeeper. "Good morning, Ms. Sinclair. Mr. Blackwood requests your presence downstairs for breakfast with the children."
###Chapter 344

The Blackwood family had strict traditions. Reginald Blackwood insisted on monthly family breakfasts.

Every 15th of the month, without exception, the entire household gathered at dawn. No excuses were tolerated.

Today's gathering held extra significance. Dominic planned to introduce Evelyn as his future wife.

It was his silent challenge to those who opposed their relationship.

The dining table gleamed with silver platters of breakfast delicacies. Each dish catered to different preferences.

Lightly seasoned meats, fresh pastries, and exotic fruits adorned the table like a festive banquet.

Reginald sat at the head, his stern expression commanding respect. Age hadn't diminished his authority.

Margaret Lockwood and her son Julian occupied his right side. Beatrice Lockwood and Dominic sat to his left.

Both women wore designer outfits dripping with jewelry, their rivalry evident even in morning attire.

Dominic remained silent but exuded power. His intense gaze remained fixed on the staircase.

Julian lounged casually, his similar Blackwood features contrasting with his playboy demeanor.

An uncomfortable silence settled over the table.

Beatrice finally snapped. "Where is that Evelyn? Making her elders wait! No manners at all from that common girl."

"Look who's talking," Margaret sneered. "Your taste in women explains your son's poor judgment."

"Enough!" Reginald's sharp command silenced them instantly.

The women had bickered for decades. Even after Edmund's death, their feud continued unabated.

Reginald knew their true motives. Margaret clung to her T Corporation shares through Julian.

Beatrice feared losing Dominic's financial support if she remarried. Her lavish lifestyle depended on it.

"Dominic," Reginald ordered, "fetch Evelyn."

Dominic rose. "Yes, Grandfather."

At that moment, Evelyn descended the grand staircase with the twins. Their presence bolstered her confidence.

Though nervous, she held her head high. Her grip tightened slightly on the children's hands.

She hadn't realized the entire family waited for her.

Only Julian offered a welcoming smile. The others' hostile stares thickened the air.

Dominic guided Evelyn to sit beside him. The children greeted their great-grandfather politely.

"Good morning, Mr. Blackwood," Evelyn said softly.

Reginald responded with a cold grunt, turning away.

Evelyn's heart sank. The man who once doted on her now rejected her openly.

She turned to Margaret. "Aunt Margaret?"

Margaret responded with a disdainful smirk.

Julian broke the tension with a chuckle. "No introductions needed, sis. Never thought my confirmed bachelor brother would settle down first!"

Evelyn smiled gratefully. At least one Blackwood accepted her.

Then she faced Beatrice. The woman's undisguised contempt made words stick in Evelyn's throat.

Memories of Beatrice's cruelty surfaced. Yet this woman was Dominic's mother - the man she loved.
###Chapter 345

Lillian Prescott woke with a start, her body aching as if she'd been trampled by wild horses.

The lavish hotel suite was eerily silent.

She winced as she tried to sit up, her lower body screaming in protest. The sheets were tangled beneath her, stained with evidence of last night's passion.

Memories flooded back - strong hands, heated whispers, Dominic Blackwood's face hovering above her in the darkness.

A flush crept up her neck.

Dominic had been... incredible. Far more intense than she'd imagined. He'd taken her roughly, ignoring her pleas when she'd grown overwhelmed. Yet the pleasure had been unlike anything she'd ever experienced.

Her phone buzzed violently on the nightstand. Her agent again. Lillian swiped it away with a huff.

Then Genevieve Prescott's name flashed on the screen.

"Mother," Lillian answered, forcing sweetness into her voice.

"Where are you?" Genevieve's tone was clipped. "Your father is furious. Leaving your grandfather's birthday without a word? Not coming home?"

Lillian's stomach twisted. Jonathan Prescott's anger was the last thing she needed.

"An emergency meeting with the film investors," she lied smoothly. "I'll make it up to Father. You know I adore you most, Mother. Please cover for me?"

Genevieve sighed. "Don't make this a habit, Lillian. You're my only daughter."

The call ended, leaving Lillian uneasy. But it was worth it. She'd finally gotten Dominic where she wanted him.

After ordering clothes from room service, she interrogated the front desk.

"The gentleman prefers anonymity," the clerk said firmly.

Lillian smirked. Of course Dominic would be discreet. Only someone of his status could book this exclusive suite.

She hurried to Blackwood Manor, her car crawling through snow-clogged streets. Every second stretched unbearably.

Meanwhile, breakfast at Blackwood Manor was tense.

Evelyn Sinclair kept her eyes down, painfully aware of Beatrice Lockwood's disapproving glare. Dominic's grip on her hand was the only thing keeping her from bolting.

Reginald Blackwood studied Evelyn's exhausted face as Dominic spoke:

"Grandfather, you've wanted more children in this house. Evelyn and I worked all night to make that happen. Surely she deserves extra rest?"

Evelyn nearly choked, digging her nails into Dominic's palm.

Reginald's expression softened slightly. He'd initially liked Evelyn, until her messy past with Maxwell Lockwood complicated things. But she was the mother of his great-grandchildren, and Dominic clearly adored her.

Beatrice turned away, seething.

Margaret Lockwood's mind raced. If Dominic married Evelyn, their future children would control the family fortune. She needed Julian married immediately - she couldn't let Beatrice gain more advantage.
###Chapter 346

Margaret Lockwood jabbed a finger at Julian Blackwood's face. "Look at your brother. He already has two children, so when is your turn to settle down? You're getting married tomorrow! I've arranged several matchmaking sessions for you."

Julian groaned. "No way, Mom! I'm still young—"

"Enough excuses," Margaret interrupted. "If you don't want marriage, then give me a grandchild like Dominic did."

Julian stroked his chin thoughtfully. "Now that's an idea worth considering."

One baby could buy him years of freedom from his mother's nagging.

Reginald Blackwood's cane came down hard on Julian's leg. "Over my dead body, you scoundrel!"

"That's not fair, Grandpa!" Julian protested. "Why can Dominic have kids out of wedlock but not me? The twins—"

Dominic's sharp glare silenced him immediately.

Julian suddenly noticed Alexander and Isabella staring at him with wide eyes. He'd nearly made a terrible mistake.

"My bad, bro," Julian muttered sheepishly.

"Enough chatter. Let's eat," Reginald declared, ending all discussion.

The meal passed in tense silence for most adults, though the twins devoured their food with gusto.

Evelyn Sinclair kept feeding the children, occasionally wiping their messy faces with a napkin.

Reginald observed her maternal care approvingly. His opinion of Evelyn rose slightly.

Beatrice Lockwood maintained her sour expression, silently cursing Evelyn's deceptive act.

Midway through breakfast, Margaret excused herself, claiming illness.

The doorbell rang moments later.

"Mr. Blackwood, Miss Prescott is here," announced the housekeeper through the intercom.

Evelyn's head snapped up. She shot Dominic a questioning look.

Why would Lillian Prescott visit so early?

Beatrice brightened immediately. "Father, please let Lillian in. It's the fifteenth—she must be here to see you. So thoughtful in this cold weather."

Reginald glanced at Evelyn's composed face before murmuring, "Very well."

He wasn't senile. He knew Lillian came for Dominic, not him.

While he tolerated Evelyn's presence, she needed occasional reminders. After all, she'd dragged his grandson through unnecessary scandals.

Lillian swept in wearing knee-high boots.

Her perfect smile faltered when she saw Evelyn seated beside Dominic, feeding the twins.

'That bastard! After last night with me, he brings Evelyn here? What game is he playing?'

But Lillian mastered her emotions instantly.

"Grandfather Blackwood, Aunt Beatrice..." she greeted sweetly, showcasing her designer winter dress that accentuated her curves.

Her graceful demeanor radiated aristocratic breeding—exactly what elders appreciated.

She shot Evelyn a contemptuous glance.

Evelyn's plain T-shirt looked pathetic compared to Lillian's glamour.

"You must join us for breakfast," Beatrice insisted, dragging Lillian to the table.

After token protests, Lillian sat down, stealing resentful glances at Dominic.

Evelyn's appetite vanished.

Dominic frowned at their uninvited guest.

'Why does Lillian keep looking at me like I've wronged her? Is she delusional?'

"Aunt Beatrice, when did Ms. Sinclair arrive?" Lillian asked casually.

Before Beatrice could answer, Alexander patted his full belly. "Mommy slept in Daddy's room last night! They were very nice to each other!"

The boy instantly disliked Lillian.

Lillian paled. "Dominic, you weren't home last night, right?" Impossible. He'd been with her.

Dominic ignored her. Noticing Evelyn's discomfort, he stood abruptly.

"Grandfather, we're finished." He took Evelyn and the twins' hands. "We'll be upstairs."

"Dominic, wait—" Lillian called uselessly as the family disappeared up the staircase.

Her fists clenched. That perfect family tableau burned her eyes.

"Don't mind him, dear," Beatrice soothed. "He'll regret this soon."

Lillian forced a smile, appetite gone.

"Was Dominic really home last night?" she pressed.

"Who knows? I didn't see the ungrateful boy when I went to bed at one. Then he brought Evelyn here this morning! Infuriating!"

Reginald cleared his throat. "Excuse me." He retired with the housekeeper's assistance.

Julian also fled the two women's company.

Alone with Beatrice, Lillian considered confessing last night's encounter but decided against it. The timing wasn't right.

Upstairs, Dominic and the twins worked to lift Evelyn's mood after Lillian's appearance.

Then Evelyn's phone rang.

It was Olivia Kensington.

Evelyn answered immediately.

"I'm... I'm pregnant," came Olivia's panicked whisper.
###Chapter 347

Evelyn rushed into the hospital, her breath coming in short gasps. There, in the obstetrics waiting area, sat Olivia - a solitary figure amidst couples holding hands.

The other women had partners whispering reassurances. Olivia sat alone, clutching medical reports with trembling fingers.

It had been weeks since Evelyn last saw her. The change was startling. Olivia's once round cheeks had hollowed out. Her choppy bangs nearly obscured her eyes, but the tight line of her lips spoke volumes.

"Olivia..." Evelyn whispered as she sat beside her.

At the sound of her name, Olivia collapsed into Evelyn's arms, tears soaking her shoulder. "I'm pregnant," she choked out. "The doctor says... if I terminate, I may never conceive again. What do I do?"

Evelyn's stomach twisted with guilt. "This is my fault. All of it."

Olivia's fingers dug into Evelyn's sleeves. "When I saw that positive test, my world shattered. I didn't want to burden you, but I'm drowning. This... thing inside me is a living reminder of that night. But if I get rid of it..." Her voice broke.

The ultrasound image shook in Olivia's hands. Evelyn scanned the results - low iron levels, concerning hormone readings, a uterus too fragile for standard procedures. Even carrying to term would be risky.

"Olivia," Evelyn said carefully, "who's the father?"

Olivia flinched as if struck. She turned her face away, fresh tears spilling. The unspoken answer hung between them - Maxwell Lockwood.

Evelyn pulled her close. "Keep the baby. I'll help you raise it. I'll be the best godmother this child could have."

A shudder ran through Olivia's thin frame. "I don't blame you, Evelyn. I should've taken emergency contraception sooner. If I blame anyone, it's him and this cruel twist of fate." She wiped her eyes roughly. "I'll be okay. Just need time."

They walked toward the exit, Olivia leaning heavily on Evelyn's arm. Then they saw it - a blood-red convertible idling at the curb.

Preston Worthington Jr. lounged in the backseat, a blonde draped over each shoulder. Despite the chill, both women wore barely-there outfits. Preston's mouth was currently occupied with one girl while his hand groped the other.

"T Corporation's new diamond collection," the blonde purred. "I want the emerald set."

"LV's latest bag for me," the other giggled.

Preston laughed, showering them with kisses. "Anything for my girls!"

Evelyn's lip curled in disgust. "Disgraceful."

But Olivia had gone rigid. Her nails bit into Evelyn's arm. That face - Preston's smug, laughing face - was the one from her nightmares.

"Olivia?" Evelyn whispered.

"I'm fine," Olivia lied through clenched teeth. "Let's go."

Inside the car, Preston's smirk faded as he caught a glimpse of a familiar silhouette. Olivia Kensington? At a hospital?

His expression darkened. With a sharp gesture, he sent his driver after them.
###Chapter 348

Regal Capital.

"You can stay here for now, Olivia. I've prepaid a full year's rent, and there's still over six months left on the lease. It's non-refundable anyway, and the place would just sit empty," Evelyn said, squeezing Olivia's hand gently.

"Thank you, Evelyn. I don't know what I'd do without you." Olivia glanced around the cozy one-bedroom apartment, her heart swelling with gratitude.

Her mother Patricia was completely preoccupied with helping her brother Nathan through his legal troubles, running between different prison facilities without a second thought for Olivia's situation.

Worse still, if her traditionalist mother discovered the pregnancy, she'd undoubtedly force Olivia to terminate it.

"I'm the one who should be apologizing to you." Evelyn's eyes clouded with guilt again.

"Stop saying that. What's done is done, and regret won't change anything. You're my best friend, and I can't bear seeing you torture yourself like this. We need to focus on the positive now. I believe we'll get through this, no matter how hard it seems. I'm at the perfect age for motherhood anyway."

Olivia gently stroked her stomach with a soft smile. "Maybe this baby is heaven's gift to me."

Ever the optimist, Olivia had always been able to find silver linings in difficult situations.

"I'm sure your baby will be the most adorable child ever. They'll look just like you!"

"I hope so too..." Olivia's smile widened as she imagined holding her own little one - a miniature version of herself, as cute as Alexander and Isabella.

She was actually looking forward to the birth now.

Evelyn settled Olivia on the couch before moving to tidy the bedroom. "I haven't stayed here in ages. The room's a mess. Rest while I clean up."

Olivia made to stand. "I'm pregnant, not an invalid. Must you treat me like glass? Let me help."

Evelyn firmly pushed her back down. "You saw your medical report. Your constitution is weaker than average, and the slightest strain could cause a miscarriage. You need all the rest you can get. When I was carrying Alexander and Isabella..."

Olivia listened with amused resignation as Evelyn launched into an exhaustive list of pregnancy precautions. She might pretend to find it annoying, but the care warmed her heart.

After cleaning, Evelyn went to the neighborhood market for groceries.

On her way back up the stairs, she encountered Tabitha returning from the wet market, casually carrying a live chicken under one arm.

They hadn't seen each other in months.

Tabitha couldn't help noticing how radiant Evelyn looked - her skin glowing, her features more refined. Meanwhile, her own daughter's complexion had grown rough from outdoor reporting assignments. Jealousy twisted in her chest.

"Well if it isn't Evelyn?" she sneered. "Thought you'd landed yourself some sugar daddy and moved into a mansion. Back so soon? Got dumped, did you? Ha! I knew you couldn't rely on rich men, but you never listen. Bet he found someone younger and prettier. Shouldn't have gotten above your station in the first place!"

Evelyn despised this woman - not just for her condescension, but for her vicious gossip. Only respect for elders kept her from slapping that smug face.

"Do you ever realize how utterly tiresome you are, Aunt Tabitha?" Evelyn said coldly, staring her down.

"What did you just say?" Tabitha's beady eyes bulged in disbelief.

Evelyn stood a full head taller, even in flats. She loomed over the older woman imposingly.

"Some elders earn respect through kindness and wisdom. But others - like you - are nothing but petty, ignorant busybodies. Tell me, Aunt Tabitha, what exactly do you gain from slandering me? Does it make you a better person? Advance your daughter's career?"

"You... How dare you speak to me like that, you little tramp? If the shoe fits! Stop pretending to be some virtuous lady - everyone knows you're just a kept woman!" Tabitha was shaking with rage, clutching her eggs like potential projectiles.

"Let me make this perfectly clear, Aunt Tabitha. I am not a mistress!"

Evelyn's fists clenched so tightly her nails nearly pierced the grocery bags. She fixed Tabitha with a glare that made the older woman recoil.

"I don't care if you believe this, but that man is my boyfriend, and I am the biological mother of those children. We were separated by misunderstandings for years before reuniting. This is your only warning - spread one more lie about me, and I'll see you in court!"

Her voice rang with steely authority, a far cry from her usual gentle tone.

The transformation was so startling that even the notoriously brazen Tabitha found herself cowed into silence.

With one last withering look, Evelyn stepped around her and continued upstairs.

Only when Evelyn turned the corner did Tabitha regain her voice. "Pah!" she spat. "Who do you think you're fooling, you shameless hussy? You'll get what's coming to you!"
###Chapter 349

Evelyn prepared an elaborate lunch for Olivia.

After the meal, Evelyn washed the dishes and scrubbed the kitchen spotless.

She then went to the grocery store to restock the refrigerator. The snowy roads were dangerous, and she didn't want Olivia going outside. With the fridge fully stocked with fresh produce and meat, Olivia could easily cook for herself.

Olivia was deeply touched by Evelyn's thoughtfulness.

"Since it's almost New Year's, you shouldn't go to work. I'll have Dominic approve your leave until after the holidays," Evelyn suggested before leaving.

Olivia shook her head. "I've already missed too much work. You know I can't just sit around at home. Tell Dominic I'll return when I'm ready. Staying idle makes me overthink things..."

Evelyn reluctantly agreed. "Rest at home first. We'll discuss work when you're ready. Call me anytime - my phone is always on for you."

After Evelyn left, Olivia sank into deep contemplation.

Now that she'd decided to keep her baby, she needed to plan for their future.

This new life would bring her companionship. She had to make preparations.

The next day.

Sunlight glittered on the snow-blanketed city.

A City Court sparkled under the winter sun.

Evelyn's somber mood contrasted sharply with the beautiful weather.

Today was Victoria and Sophia's trial.

Evelyn wore no makeup, her face expressionless.

Dominic sat beside her in the front row, wearing sunglasses. His icy demeanor matched hers.

Victoria and Sophia stood listlessly in prison uniforms at the defendant's stand.

Jail had aged Victoria noticeably - gray streaked her temples, her posture slumped.

Sophia's long hair had been cut short. She looked gaunt, with sunken eyes and unhealthy pallor.

Their suffering in prison was evident.

But Evelyn felt no pity.

They'd caused Robert's death. This was their deserved punishment.

When the women spotted Evelyn, hatred burned in their eyes. Only the bailiffs' restraint prevented them from attacking her.

Victor Langley's crisp voice echoed through the courtroom. "The defendants knew Robert Sinclair was terminally ill yet deliberately provoked him with cruel words. Their immoral actions directly caused his death when they refused to call for medical help. They must bear full legal responsibility! Your Honor, I request maximum sentencing!"

"Objection!"

Serena Delacroix stood sharply, her dark robe emphasizing her cold demeanor. "Robert Sinclair had advanced cancer. The defendants' words, while harsh, merely spoke truth he couldn't accept. This should be a civil matter at most!"

Victor studied Serena with sorrow. How had the proud woman he once knew fallen so low?

Her vendetta against him made her oppose him in every case, morality be damned.

She'd taken this case pro bono just to defeat him.

Victor had witnessed Serena's legal prowess in previous trials.

Her cunning exploitation of loopholes had nearly bested him several times.

Out of pity, he'd let her win before.

But this case involved Evelyn - Dominic's woman. He couldn't afford mercy now.

"Ms. Delacroix, security footage proves the defendants knowingly provoked a dying man with cruel taunts. Their deliberate actions constitute homicide!" Victor countered.

Their legal duel intensified, each refusing to yield.

Both top-tier lawyers, their arguments volleyed back and forth.

Evelyn's breath grew shallow with anxiety.

She hadn't expected any lawyer could rival Victor. What if he lost?

She couldn't bear the thought of Victoria and Sophia receiving leniency.

Dominic covered Evelyn's hand with his, sensing her distress. "Don't worry. Victor won't lose," he assured.

He trusted Victor's abilities completely.

Serena was skilled, but no match for Victor.

True to form, Victor delivered.

The judge's gavel fell. "Victoria Montgomery and Sophia Montgomery, your deliberate provocation directly caused Robert Sinclair's death. This court sentences you to ten years imprisonment and fines of $90,000. You may appeal within ten days..."

Sophia, silent until now, suddenly erupted. "Evelyn, you wicked witch! This is all your fault! If you hadn't been a surrogate, none of this would've happened! I'll appeal! I'll make you pay!"
###Chapter 350

Evelyn stepped out of the courthouse. The clouds had parted, revealing a brilliant blue sky.

Sunlight bathed her face, warming her skin as the weight of years lifted from her shoulders.

Victoria and Sophia had finally faced justice.

Dominic's arm encircled Evelyn's waist. He studied her furrowed brow with concern. "What's troubling you?" His voice was velvet against her ear.

"I keep wondering if they'll appeal," Evelyn murmured. "What if the verdict changes?"

Dominic's expression hardened. "It won't. An appeal would only lengthen their sentence."

He had connections in places where those women would beg for mercy.

Evelyn rested her head against his shoulder.

The steady rhythm of his heartbeat soothed her. "I couldn't have done this without you."

She knew the legal battle would have dragged on for years without Dominic's influence.

Dominic guided her into the passenger seat before sliding behind the wheel. Before she could speak, his fingers tilted her chin up.

His lips claimed hers with possessive hunger.

Evelyn's pulse skyrocketed.

Dominic gave her no quarter, his breath hot against her skin.

The kiss felt like punishment.

His tongue explored her mouth with deliberate intensity, leaving her trembling.

Evelyn melted into the seat, a soft moan escaping her throat.

The sound drove Dominic wild.

Only their public location kept him from taking things further.

"Still planning to thank me so formally next time?" Dominic finally pulled away, his own breathing uneven.

Evelyn gasped for air, understanding dawning. He hated her gratitude.

Her cheeks burned. "I won't... do that again."
"Good." His smile held dark promise. "Next offense won't end with just a kiss."

The heat in his gaze stripped her bare.

Evelyn squirmed. All his "punishments" left her weak in the knees.

The engine purred to life.

Evelyn studied Dominic's hands on the steering wheel. "Are we returning to the office?"

Dominic smirked. "Briefly. Then I'm stealing you for dinner."

T Corporation's private elevator mirrored the couple - his towering frame beside her delicate silhouette.

Evelyn bit her lip. Another missed workday for the trial.

In her few months at T Corp, she'd set records for absenteeism.

The department head would have an aneurysm.

Dominic watched her shifting expressions with amusement.

"Stop that." Evelyn tensed under his predatory stare.

The confined space suddenly felt dangerous.

But Dominic only brushed his lips against her forehead.

On the executive floor, Dominic strode ahead while Evelyn maintained professional distance.

The CEO's office held... memories. Particularly of the adjoining bedroom.

Julian nearly collided with them. "Sis? Thought you were off today!" His guilty grin faltered under Dominic's glare.

"Skipping again?" Dominic's voice turned arctic.

"Just... getting air?" Julian's cigarette dangled between nervous fingers.

Dominic saw through the lie instantly. "Your office has a smoking lounge. Perhaps you'd prefer our South African branch?"

Julian paled. "Mercy, brother! I'll work triple hours! Don't exile me!" He shot Evelyn a pleading look. "See how cruel he is?"

Evelyn stifled laughter. Julian's childish antics were oddly endearing.

She tugged Dominic's sleeve. "He's useful here."

Julian nodded frantically. "Exactly! I'm family! You need me!"

Evelyn's next words made him choke. "Actually... with year-end approaching, Julian could handle your workload." She smiled sweetly. "Then we could take the children to Maldives."

Julian's cigarette fell to the floor.
###Chapter 351

Julian Blackwood felt like crying. He had essentially dug his own grave.

He had assumed his future sister-in-law was a meek lamb, but she turned out to be a wolf in sheep's clothing.

"I thought I knew you well, Evelyn. How could you do this to me?" Julian grumbled bitterly.

Dominic Blackwood strode toward the CEO's office with an icy tone. "Seems you have too much free time on your hands. If you're not busy here, I can arrange for you to leave for South Africa immediately. Mr. Whitmore will book the earliest flight."

Julian dramatically clutched his chest. "Brother! Must you be so cruel? The world needs kind-hearted younger brothers like me! I idolize you—"

Evelyn Sinclair nearly facepalmed.

This was her first time witnessing such childish banter between the two brothers.

Julian shot Dominic a resentful glare before slinking back to his office.

He had mountains of tedious paperwork waiting—anything to avoid being shipped off to South Africa.

When Evelyn returned to the design department, whispers immediately followed her.

Colleagues exchanged knowing glances while murmuring behind her back. They kept their voices low, careful not to be overheard.

Though not officially married yet, her status as the boss's woman was undeniable.

While some resented Evelyn, they were seasoned professionals who knew better than to provoke her openly.

Bernadette Worthing, the department head, seethed with resentment.

During the recent design meeting, Evelyn's stellar performance had completely overshadowed Bernadette's embarrassing blunder. She'd nearly become the department laughingstock.

She couldn't stomach being outshone by a newcomer.

Even knowing Evelyn was the boss's woman, Bernadette was determined to retaliate.

In her eyes, only the beautiful, talented Vivienne Laurent deserved Dominic.

Vivienne had worked alongside Dominic for years. Their solid bond couldn't possibly be broken by some unremarkable newcomer.

Bernadette convinced herself Dominic's infatuation with Evelyn was temporary. Once the novelty wore off, he'd see reason.

She believed Dominic was too intelligent to be ruled by primal instincts like other men.

What did Evelyn have besides a pretty face?

Women like her were a dime a dozen. How could she compare to Vivienne's brilliance and creativity?

As Vivienne's loyal subordinate, Bernadette knew her career would skyrocket if Vivienne became Mrs. Blackwood.

The moment Evelyn sat down, Bernadette marched over and snapped, "Do you think T Corporation is your personal playground, Evelyn? I warned you about taking excessive leave, yet you've ignored me! Your attendance record this month is atrocious—absent half the time! Don't think you can flout rules just because you're sleeping with the boss!"

Gasps rippled through the office.

No one could tell if Bernadette was brave or suicidal.

Openly berating the boss's woman? Was she trying to get fired?

Evelyn remained unfazed by the gossip or Bernadette's outburst. She stood her ground.

Meeting Bernadette's glare head-on, she replied calmly, "Ms. Worthing, T Corporation's policies don't restrict employee leave duration. Despite my absences, I've completed every assignment you emailed me—all submissions are in your inbox."

Having chosen to be with Dominic, she anticipated workplace rumors. If she couldn't withstand this pressure, how could she stand beside him?

Bernadette was momentarily speechless.

Evelyn powered up her computer and began working, leaving Bernadette fuming with ineffective rage.

Abigail Thornton muffled a giggle behind her hand.

Bernadette shot her a venomous look before stomping back to her desk in defeat.

She immediately texted Vivienne, currently in Western Europe. If Vivienne didn't return soon, Evelyn might cement her position as Dominic's favorite.

Without Vivienne's backing, Bernadette feared Evelyn might retaliate.

Meanwhile, Evelyn, Abigail, and Gregory Peterson huddled together, reviewing the Vivi Group collaboration project.

Evelyn studied the documents intently.

She knew veteran designers resented her—a newcomer—leading such a major project when they hadn't gotten the chance.

She'd only joined months ago without any notable achievements. Of course they'd envy her sudden rise.

While no one dared challenge Dominic's decision, Evelyn refused to decline. Pressure might yield unexpected results!

She understood this perfectly. Hard work was her only path to changing perceptions.

The Vivi Group project could make or break her career.

From the documents and discussions with Abigail and Gregory, she grasped the project's magnitude.

T Corporation and Vivi Group had jointly purchased prime downtown real estate in A City. Their plan? Rapid development featuring commercial stores, hotels, a shopping mall, luxury serviced apartments, and an exclusive gated community.

Evelyn was stunned.

Only Dominic possessed the resources to acquire and transform such premium urban land.
###Chapter 352

Evelyn Sinclair was reviewing the project files when Abigail Thornton entered the office with several strangers.

"Team, meet our collaborators from Vivi Group - their lead designer and core creative team."

Evelyn studied the newcomers carefully.

The female design manager appeared to be in her mid-thirties, while her team members looked significantly younger.

"Pleasure to meet you all. I'm Abigail Thornton, design lead at Blackwood Enterprises. Looking forward to working together," Abigail said warmly, extending her hand.

"Yvonne Blackwell," the Vivi Group manager responded curtly, offering only a perfunctory handshake.

Gregory Peterson followed with his own introduction.

When Evelyn stepped forward, she extended her hand with a polite smile. "Evelyn Sinclair. Nice to meet you."

To everyone's surprise, Yvonne merely gave Evelyn an icy stare before turning away.

Bernadette Worthing smirked internally.

Earlier, she'd seized an opportunity to poison Yvonne's opinion of Evelyn, painting her as a talentless social climber who'd slept her way into the design department using her relationship with CEO Dominic Blackwood.

Bernadette knew Yvonne despised nepotism and incompetence.

Her plan had worked perfectly - now Evelyn would face constant humiliation from the Vivi team.

Unaware of the sabotage, Evelyn stiffened at the blatant snub, her smile faltering.

She shot Abigail a helpless look.

Abigail quickly intervened. "Ms. Blackwell, while Evelyn is new to our department, she's exceptionally talented. Recently, a particularly difficult client rejected all other designs but praised Evelyn's work extensively. She'll be a valuable asset to this project."

Yvonne remained silent, merely shooting Evelyn another disdainful glance before announcing, "Conference room. Now."

The combined teams filed upstairs in tense silence.

Throughout the walk, Yvonne pointedly ignored Evelyn.

Even the other Vivi designers maintained a chilly distance, leaving Evelyn no choice but to trail behind uncomfortably.

She could practically feel their judgmental stares burning into her back.

The Vivi team's assistant design manager, Geoffrey Winslow, appeared to be around thirty - stylishly dressed with polished manners.

Miranda Caldwell stood out with her striking beauty and hourglass figure - young, vibrant, and clearly aware of her charms.

Malcolm Whitmore, leader of Design Team Two, was handsome yet reserved, giving off an air of quiet sophistication.

Evelyn committed their names to memory, knowing she'd need to work closely with them.

Meanwhile, the Vivi team was equally curious about her.

They'd collaborated with Abigail and Gregory before and respected their skills. But Evelyn's inclusion puzzled them.

She looked barely out of college - could she really handle such a high-stakes project?

The rumors about her sleeping her way into the position only fueled their contempt.

The meeting dragged on for over an hour.

As it concluded, Yvonne shoved a thick stack of documents at Evelyn. "Project specifications. Memorize everything by our next meeting in two days. Any questions?"

"No," Evelyn replied quietly, frowning at the heavy bundle.

She recognized this as deliberate hazing.

But as the junior member, she had no grounds to protest.

Meanwhile, in the CEO's office...

Dominic Blackwood looked up from his dual monitors, pleased with T Corporation's quarterly profit surge.

A satisfied smile curved his lips as he reviewed Evelyn's latest designs.

Sebastian Whitmore voiced his concern. "Sir, assigning Evelyn to this high-profile project has made her a target. And Ms. Blackwell's notorious perfectionism... Is Ms. Sinclair prepared for that pressure?"

Everyone knew Yvonne Blackwell's design prowess surpassed even Vivienne Laurent's at T Corporation.

But her obsessive standards made her brutally critical and temperamental - a terrifying workaholic who regularly reduced designers to tears.

Could sensitive Evelyn withstand such treatment?

Dominic checked his watch - quitting time.

He gave Sebastian a knowing smile. "Evelyn's talented but lacks confidence. Ms. Blackwell's mentorship will toughen her up."

After the meeting, Evelyn gathered her documents when Dominic called.

"Dinner at Blue Honors tonight."

"Let's bring Alexander and Isabella. It's been too long since we all ate together," Evelyn insisted, believing family meals were important.

Dominic would rather have her to himself, but imagining her hopeful expression, he relented. "Fine. We'll collect them after work."

Hanging up, Evelyn noticed the time and quickly called home.

"Mommy?" Isabella's sweet voice answered.

"Sweetheart, have you and your brother eaten?"

"Not yet. Aunt Jemma's cooking. We're eating with Great-Grandpa and Grandma..."

"Wait for us. Daddy and I are taking you out."

"Yay! Alex, Mommy's taking us to dinner! Hurry home, Mommy!" Isabella chirped.

Evelyn hung up, a warm smile lingering.
###Chapter 353

Evelyn was lost in thoughts of her children's laughter when Abigail suddenly tapped her shoulder.

"Look at that dreamy smile. Were you chatting with Dominic earlier? The way your eyes softened—I'm positively green with envy!"

At nearly thirty, Abigail remained stubbornly single. Evelyn suspected some past heartbreak kept her from dating, though countless suitors had tried their luck.

What Evelyn didn't know was Abigail's initial ulterior motives in befriending her. But as they grew closer, Abigail discovered Evelyn's genuine charm and remarkable design talent, transforming their relationship into true friendship.

"It wasn't him. I was talking to Alexander and Isabella."

Evelyn had always admired Abigail's carefree spirit. Not only was she kind-hearted, but she'd also helped Evelyn during tough times at work.

She remembered her lonely early days at the company—ostracized by colleagues with only Olivia as her friend. Abigail's friendship had made the office bearable.

Their cheerful chatter continued as they walked down the hallway.

Turning the corner, they nearly collided with Geoffrey Winslow and Miranda Caldwell.

Geoffrey looked every inch the polished gentleman as usual.

Miranda, however, appeared disheveled—hair mussed, cheeks flushed, lips suspiciously swollen.

Miranda's eyes widened in panic at their sudden appearance.

Abigail flashed a tight smile, greeted them briefly, and quickly pulled Evelyn away.

Some things were better left unacknowledged.

Confused, Evelyn allowed herself to be steered toward the elevators.

Once out of earshot, Evelyn frowned. "Wasn't that rude? We barely greeted them."

Abigail rolled her eyes. "Trust me, you don't want to get involved. I caught Geoffrey pinning Miranda against the bathroom sink earlier—her underwear around her knees. And he's a married father of two!"

Evelyn gasped. "An affair? That's despicable."

Abigail nodded knowingly. "Welcome to corporate politics. Why do you think Miranda became department head so young? She's sleeping her way up. Stay clear of that mess."

"Understood. Thanks for looking out for me." Evelyn appreciated the warning.

Between work and family, she had no time for office drama anyway. Her focus remained on doing her job well—others' personal lives weren't her concern.

Later that evening, Dominic drove their family to Blue Honors—a Mallory Corporation property and A City's architectural crown jewel.

The lakeside luxury complex blended recreation, entertainment, and fine dining in one breathtaking package.

Dominic had personally designed its striking blue-stone exterior adorned with glass panels offering panoramic lake views.

Despite the winter chill, lush plants thrived indoors. The private dining rooms featured hand-carved hardwood furnishings—a perfect marriage of modern and classical aesthetics.

Holding the twins' hands, Evelyn admired the space. "I've studied Blue Honors in architecture school. Being here is incredible—and knowing you designed it makes me so proud."

As a design student, she'd only dreamed of visiting this exclusive venue reserved for society's elite.

The intricate details surpassed her expectations. Having the brilliant architect as her partner filled her with pride.

"Mommy, Daddy's always amazing! He's just too busy to eat with us usually," Alexander mumbled, squeezing Evelyn's hand.

Isabella pouted. "When we ask for family dinners, he says we're big kids now. Hmph! Only since Mommy came back does he make time..."

Kneeling to their level, Evelyn hugged them. "Daddy works hard to give us this comfortable life. Let's be understanding, okay?"

The twins nodded solemnly.

Dominic's expression softened watching Evelyn comfort their children.

Her gentle presence soothed him like no other—her warm smile, kind eyes, and quiet grace making her seem carved from precious jade.

This was why she'd remained in his heart all these years.

Their moment was interrupted by Miranda Lockwood approaching on Maxwell's arm, trailed by an entourage of young socialites.

Maxwell's eyes widened upon spotting Evelyn. Instinctively, he tried to shake Miranda off...
###Chapter 354

Evelyn immediately spotted Miranda.

She tightened her grip on Maxwell's arm and let out an audible huff. "That woman again? What rotten luck!"

Not only had her plan to frame Evelyn at the boutique backfired, but she'd also lost a diamond necklace worth nearly a million dollars. The scolding from her brother and reduced allowance still stung.

Miranda had been fuming about it for weeks.

Evelyn wasn't thrilled to see the spoiled heiress either. She was about to steer the children away when Alexander suddenly perked up.

His eyes sparkled with mischief as he tugged Evelyn's sleeve. "Mommy, I know that lady..."

Evelyn blinked in surprise. How could her son recognize Miranda?

"Where have you seen her, sweetheart?"

Miranda frowned, scanning her memory for any recollection of the adorable boy.

"Remember the storybook Daddy gave me for my birthday? She looks just like the wicked witch!" Alexander declared loudly before adding, "I'd ask for your autograph, but that character's the worst!"

The crowd erupted in laughter.

Such cutting words from such a cherubic face!

Evelyn realized her son was teasing Miranda. While the woman wasn't beautiful, she hardly resembled any storybook witch.

Did Alexander inherit Dominic's sharp tongue?

Evelyn shot Dominic a look. He met her gaze with an innocent shrug, as if to say their son's wit wasn't his doing.

Miranda's face flushed crimson. She pointed a shaking finger at Alexander. "You little brat! Who taught you to speak like that?"

In her rage, she lunged forward, forgetting Dominic's presence entirely. Maxwell yanked her back just in time.

One wrong move toward Dominic's heir, and Miranda's family would be bankrupt by morning. The Blackwoods' retaliation would be swift and merciless.

Dominic's gaze turned glacial. The club manager arrived just in time to witness the scene.

This foolish girl has a death wish.

"Unhand me, Maxwell! That thief stole my necklace!" Miranda shrieked, ignoring the tension.

The manager stepped forward. "Miss, I suggest you leave. You're insulting my guests and making baseless accusations."

"Stay out of this!" Miranda snapped, though the manager's imposing stature made her falter.

Maxwell dragged her aside. "Are you trying to get yourself killed?"

Miranda misinterpreted his concern as lingering feelings for Evelyn. Seeing Evelyn's pitying look and Maxwell's protective stance sent her into a frenzy.

"So this is why you betray your own family!" she spat. "That thief stole my necklace worth 900,000 dollars! Yancy saw it too!"

Yancy, Miranda's muscular friend, nodded confirmation. The crowd murmured, casting suspicious glances at Evelyn.

Before Evelyn could respond, a sharp slap echoed through the club.

"Enough!" Maxwell roared. "Evelyn would never steal!"

He knew her character better than that. Evelyn had too much pride for petty theft.

Miranda clutched her stinging cheek in disbelief. "You hit me... for that thief?"
###Chapter 355

The club manager glared at Miranda with icy disdain. His voice cut through the air like winter wind. "Miss, we don't tolerate such behavior here. This is an exclusive establishment. Guests who can't conduct themselves properly aren't welcome here."

The surrounding guests murmured in agreement.

Dominic Blackwood's wealth surpassed some nations' GDP. Any gift for his woman would be worth millions. Why would she steal a measly $900,000 necklace?

Miranda's accusations made no sense without evidence.

Publicly insulting Mr. Blackwood's woman? She must have lost her mind.

First humiliated by Maxwell, then by Dominic, Miranda resembled a cornered animal, forgetting she stood among A City's elite.

Her polished manners evaporated.

Her teeth ground audibly, as if imagining tearing Evelyn and her family apart.

Preston Worthington Sr. arrived with his entourage.

Dressed in a crisp white shirt, the man commanded attention effortlessly.

Two undone buttons revealed his porcelain collarbones.

His subordinates had briefed him. He adjusted his tie subtly.

Those who knew him recognized this as a warning sign.

The club manager rushed forward. "Mr. Worthington, there's no need for you to intervene. I'll handle this."

Preston remained silent.

A lit menthol cigarette dangled between his fingers.

Smoke curled around his striking features, enhancing his dangerous allure.

Beautiful yet terrifying.

The manager stammered under Preston's intimidating presence.

"Martin," Preston interrupted sharply. "How long have you worked at Blue Honors?"

Martin Blackwell lowered his head. "Six... six months."

Preston's sudden laughter sent chills through the room.

"Six months and you can't handle a minor disturbance? Perhaps retirement would suit you better." His mocking tone made Martin's knees buckle.

"Mr. Blackwood is my honored guest. You know the consequences of negligence."

Preston exchanged nods with Dominic before acknowledging Evelyn politely.

Turning to Miranda, he exhaled smoke coolly. "Who let this rabid dog in? Remove her immediately."

Miranda initially marveled at his beauty.

His cruel words doused her like ice water.

'How dare he call me a dog!'

Blinded by rage, she missed the crowd's fearful reactions.

She laughed hysterically. "Manners? You're the animal here! I'm a paying customer - I demand a full refund!"

The crowd gasped.

'Is she suicidal?'

In A City, Preston inspired more fear than the devil himself.

Crossing him meant not seeing tomorrow's sunrise.

Maxwell nearly fainted. His foolish cousin always brought trouble.

He vowed never to accompany her again.

A silver dagger flashed.

Miranda's right-side hair fell in clumps.

The blade left her scalp perfectly smooth - cleaner than any razor.

'Impressive technique,' Evelyn noted.

Lanie and Isabella watched Preston with starry eyes.

'Uncle Preston's amazing!'

Miranda stared dumbfounded at her hair on the floor.

Touching her bare scalp, she shrieked.

Her ugly sobbing filled the air. "My hair! What have you done?!"

Maxwell dragged his hysterical cousin away, her birthday entourage scrambling after them.

Preston addressed his staff coldly. "Blacklist her. I won't tolerate repeats."

"Yes, Mr. Worthington!" The staff trembled.

"My apologies for the disturbance, Evelyn. Everything's complimentary tonight. Enjoy your evening." Preston's demeanor softened remarkably.

Evelyn smiled politely. "Thank you for your help."

Dominic shot impatient glances around. He disliked social interruptions.

After brief pleasantries, he ushered Evelyn and the twins into their private dining room.

Evelyn sighed, watching Dominic's retreating back. Just a simple dinner had turned into such drama...
###Chapter 356

The plush private room was silent except for the soft purring coming from the snow-white fur carpet.

A purebred Persian cat lay curled up, its silky coat blending seamlessly with the luxurious carpet beneath.

Evelyn didn't spot the sleeping feline at first. Her stiletto nearly crushed the cat's tail, startling the creature awake.

With a sudden hiss, the cat arched its back and bared its claws at Evelyn, making her gasp in shock.

She stumbled backward, losing her footing. Dominic's strong arms caught her just before she hit the floor.

"Are you hurt?" Dominic growled, pulling Evelyn close while glaring at the offending animal.

The Persian cat remained unfazed by the intimidating billionaire's glare.

It shook its luxurious coat and stared at the family with piercing blue eyes, carrying itself like royalty.

Isabella immediately fell under the cat's spell.

"Mommy! Look how beautiful!" She dropped to her knees, gently stroking the soft fur. The cat responded with contented purrs.

"That's a Persian cat, just like in my picture books!" Alexander exclaimed, joining his sister to pet the creature.

The Blackwood estate had always forbidden pets under Reginald Blackwood's strict rules. The twins, naturally drawn to the adorable animal, began playing enthusiastically.

Evelyn watched the scene with amusement until a sharp pain shot through her left ankle.

"Stay still!" Dominic commanded when he heard her sharp intake of breath.

He guided her to a chair, carefully removing her shoe and stocking. His brows furrowed at the visible swelling. A gentle touch made Evelyn wince.

"Just a minor sprain," he reassured her.

"Dad, Mom, can we take this cat home?" Alexander asked with unusual seriousness for a six-year-old.

The boy's attachment surprised even his sister. Seeing no owner around, he'd already imagined the cat as his new pet.

"We can't do that," Evelyn said firmly before Dominic could respond. "This belongs to someone. Taking it would be stealing. But if you both want a cat, we'll get you one."

"But Great-Grandpa—"

"We'll keep it at the penthouse," Evelyn interrupted with a wink, ruffling his hair.

"Mommy's the best!" Alexander cheered, tugging his sister's arm. "We're getting our own cat!"

Isabella kissed the Persian's head. "I'm happy, but I really want this one..."

As if understanding, the cat suddenly leaped from her arms into those of a young waitress.

The woman couldn't have been older than twenty, her beauty evident despite the uniform. Long lashes framed expressive eyes that seemed familiar to Evelyn.

"Forgive the disturbance," the waitress stammered, avoiding Dominic's gaze. "My cat escaped its cage. Madam, I'll cover any medical expenses..."

Evelyn smiled warmly. "No need. I should apologize for startling your cat."

The waitress—Scarlett Fairchild—looked relieved at Evelyn's kindness. Her graceful demeanor shone through the uniform.

"May we play with your cat a little longer?" the twins pleaded.

After a brief hesitation, Scarlett relented. "Return it to the service office before you leave. Just ask for Scarlett Fairchild."

Evelyn nodded gratefully. "Thank you, Ms. Fairchild. We'll take good care of her."

Hidden among the trees, Lillian Prescott's hands trembled when she heard the name.

"Scarlett Fairchild?" she whispered in disbelief. "What's she doing here?"
###Chapter 357

Lillian Prescott had learned from Beatrice Lockwood that Dominic Blackwood was dining at Blue Honors tonight. She spent hours perfecting her appearance, determined to surprise him with her presence.

The last person she expected to see was Evelyn Sinclair sitting with him.

"What does Evelyn have that makes him adore her so much?" The thought burned through Lillian's mind like acid.

But what truly unsettled her was recognizing Scarlett Fairchild - the girl from the same orphanage - serving their table.

Lillian squeezed her eyes shut, willing the flood of unpleasant memories to stop.

The images came anyway, playing like a horror film behind her eyelids.

They'd arrived at the orphanage the same year. Six-year-old Lillian, gaunt and silent, looking like she'd crawled out of a warzone. Five-year-old Scarlett, dressed in frilly pink dresses with a sparkling tiara, resembling a storybook princess.

Scarlett could sing, dance, and weave magical tales. Every child in that wretched place adored her, forming a constant orbit around their radiant little star.

No one noticed the quiet, malnourished girl in the corner.

Lillian never understood why someone like Scarlett ended up in an orphanage. She belonged in some mansion, spoiled rotten by doting parents.

All Lillian knew was that she wanted - needed - that attention for herself.

So the six-year-old played Scarlett's best friend while systematically destroying her reputation. Stolen items, cruel pranks, bugs in beds - Lillian framed Scarlett for every misdeed.

Within months, Scarlett became the orphanage pariah while Lillian rose to favor.

Then came the day Jonathan and Genevieve Prescott visited to adopt a child.

Lillian saw her golden ticket. That orphanage was no charity - she'd overheard the matron discussing their real business. Pretty girls disappeared at eighteen, sold to the highest bidder. The matron had already promised Lillian to some perverted tycoon.

She wouldn't let that happen.

The night before the Prescotts arrived, Lillian slipped laxatives into Scarlett's dinner. By morning, the girl was too ill to leave her bed.

Without competition, Lillian charmed the Prescotts effortlessly. She became their beloved daughter overnight, leaving that hellhole behind.

Years later, she heard the orphanage got raided. The matron arrested. All children relocated.

Lillian kept tabs on Scarlett - her greatest rival. The girl had struggled through school and menial jobs, never matching Lillian's privileged life.

Then at seventeen, Scarlett vanished. Rumors said some man got her pregnant.

Lillian had reveled in that news.

So why was Scarlett here now? Wearing a waitress uniform? Talking to Evelyn Sinclair of all people?

The past she'd buried was clawing its way back.
###Chapter 358

Evelyn Sinclair's fingers dug into her handbag, her knuckles turning white as she took in the scene before her.

A hurricane raged inside her chest, yet her face remained an impenetrable mask of calm.

"Scarlett Fairchild, room number three!" A sharply dressed hostess called out urgently.

"Coming!" Scarlett flashed an apologetic smile at Margaret. "Please excuse me, I'm needed elsewhere."

Margaret nodded graciously, waving her off.

Dominic swept Margaret off her feet in a bridal carry, disappearing into their private dining room.

The sight of Dominic's tenderness toward Margaret sent daggers through Lillian Prescott's heart.

'Margaret Sinclair?!'

'That washed-up nobody?!'

'How dare Dominic treat her like some precious treasure when he's never shown me such affection!'

Lillian's nails bit into her palms as she recalled every sacrifice she'd made for Dominic, every ounce of devotion she'd poured into their relationship. The injustice burned like acid in her throat.

The picture-perfect family of four twisted the knife deeper. While Margaret basked in Dominic's public affection, Lillian remained invisible in the shadows. Unacceptable!

Jealousy curdled into something darker, more dangerous.

She was Dominic's woman now. One way or another, she would claim what was rightfully hers. If she couldn't have his heart, she'd settle for his body.

Lillian's face contorted as she watched the happy family retreat. She wasn't done fighting.

Her gaze landed on the regal Persian cat cradled in Isabella's arms. A cruel smile twisted her lips...

Lillian adjusted her oversized sunglasses and wound a silk scarf tightly around her face.

She slipped into the restroom.

After ensuring she was alone, she made a discreet phone call before exiting.

Blue Honors' private rooms bore poetic names like Gilded Chrysanthemum, Azure Pavilion, Moonlit Courtyard, and Oceanview Terrace.

Each space was a masterpiece of design.

The Sinclair-Blackwoods had been seated in Crystal Brook - the establishment's crown jewel. The duplex VIP room transported guests to an enchanted forest with its towering century-old pistacia tree whose branches stretched across the ceiling.

A babbling brook wound between smooth stones beneath the flowering canopy. The whisper of pine needles mimicked ocean waves.

Antique coral displays and silver artifacts completed the breathtaking tableau.

Evelyn marveled at the ingenuity. No wonder the prices were astronomical. This was no ordinary dining experience.

"The ambiance is extraordinary," Evelyn remarked, running her fingers along the glass floor that revealed colorful koi swimming beneath their feet.

"If you enjoy it, we'll make this our regular spot," Dominic murmured, pressing a kiss to her temple.

Having frequented such establishments countless times - not to mention his investments in their design - Dominic remained unfazed. But Evelyn's wonder was infectious.

Their children sat with impeccable posture, table manners honed by Dominic's exacting standards.

The Persian cat lounged in Isabella's lap like royalty, purring as the girl stroked its lustrous coat.

A waiter in crisp blue livery served their meal with silent efficiency - Alba truffles, golden caviar, Royale pizza, seafood curry - each dish rarer than the last before bowing out.

"My darlings, you need proper nutrition to grow strong," Evelyn began, reaching for the serving utensils.

Dominic was already plating her meal. "Try this first. The flavors are exceptional."

Evelyn glanced at Alexander and Isabella's expectant faces, flushing. "The children should—"

"They have functioning limbs," Dominic stated matter-of-factly. "I serve my wife first."

"..." The twins exchanged exasperated looks.

They might as well have shouted, 'Must you flaunt your favoritism so blatantly, Father?'

But years of witnessing Dominic's devotion had inured them to such displays. They simply picked up their utensils with resigned sighs.

The rich aromas roused the dozing Persian cat. Its golden eyes snapped open, pink tongue darting out as its tail twitched with excitement.

The feline's comical yearning drew laughter from the table.

Alexander and Isabella prepared a plate for their furry companion, who ate with dainty relish, eliciting more amusement.

The Blackwood family's laughter echoed through Crystal Brook as they enjoyed their meal with their pampered pet.

Meanwhile, in a shadowed alley, Lillian exchanged a thick envelope with a masked figure.

The raspy-voiced man handed her a tin of cat food and a syringe filled with emerald liquid.

"You're certain this works?" Lillian eyed the concoction skeptically.

"After all our years working together, you question me now?" The man's chuckle was dry as parchment. "One injection will drive any cat to madness. But be warned - an enraged cat is formidable. Its claws will shred flesh from bone."

Lillian's lips curled. "Precisely what I require."

She intended to leave Evelyn's pretty face in ruins.
###Chapter 359

Evelyn Sinclair tucked the mysterious item into her jacket pocket with careful precision.

She strode purposefully toward Blue Honors Club.

At the intersection, a grimy hand suddenly clutched at her coat hem. "Miss...could you spare some change?"

Lillian Prescott removed her sunglasses in irritation.

Her nose wrinkled at the sight of the disheveled homeless man clinging to her designer coat.

The man reeked of alcohol, his tattered jacket barely covering layers of filth. Dirt caked his face so thoroughly his natural skin tone was indistinguishable. He looked like he hadn't bathed in weeks.

Lillian's lip curled in disgust.

"Get lost!" She kicked out sharply with her stiletto boot.

Noticing the smudge on her coat where he'd touched, her frown deepened.

This brand-new Dior would have to be discarded now!

She turned to leave, but the drunkard lunged forward, wrapping surprisingly strong arms around her legs.

The stench of cheap liquor made her gag.

"No money, no freedom!" he slurred, tightening his grip.

Enraged, Lillian kicked and stomped violently. Though intoxicated, the man's strength forced her to exert considerable effort to break free. In the struggle, her cashmere scarf slipped loose without her noticing...

"Su...Suzy?" The homeless man froze, suddenly sobered as if struck by lightning. He gaped at her exposed face.

Lillian's hands flew to her loosened scarf.

Panicked like a thief caught mid-crime, she hastily rewrapped it while scanning the area for cameras or reporters. The last tabloid scandal had been damaging enough.

If headlines screamed "Sweetheart Starlet Lillian Prescott Attacks Homeless Man," the backlash would ruin her carefully cultivated image - both publicly and with her adoptive parents.

This couldn't happen.

Fortunately, the bitter winter kept most pedestrians indoors. Only a few distant figures hurried past, oblivious.

Who cared about some drunk vagrant in freezing weather?

Muttering curses, Lillian gave the man wide berth as if avoiding contagion and hurried back toward the club.

Unnoticed, the homeless man began trailing her at a distance.

When he saw the doorman bowing Lillian into the luxurious clubhouse, a spark of recognition lit his bloodshot eyes. 'Suzy...that woman resembles you so much. Could she be...our daughter?'

Meanwhile at dinner...

The Persian cat suddenly perked up, twitching its nose at an irresistible scent. In a flash, it leapt from the table and dashed away.

"Mommy! Kitty's running!" Isabella's eyes welled up as she scrambled after the fleeing cat.

"Isabella!" Evelyn scooped up her distraught daughter. "The kitty's going back to its owner. We'll get you your own kitten soon, okay?"

"But Great-grandpa doesn't allow pets..." The little girl pouted, nibbling her finger.

Dominic dabbed his lips elegantly. "We're moving out soon. You and Alexander can each have a pet then - if you promise to care for them properly."

Isabella's face lit up. "Really, Daddy?"

"Father never breaks his word," Alexander declared with absolute faith, already imagining his future pet.

"That kitty was so pretty. What if someone takes it?" Isabella worried aloud.

Evelyn considered this. The exquisite Persian cat might tempt even wealthy patrons. To reassure her daughter, she suggested checking on it.

Dominic agreed - Preston Worthington's establishment had impeccable security.

In the restroom...

Lillian held open the specially formulated cat food, its aroma ten times more potent than standard fare. Even a pampered Persian couldn't resist.

Right on cue, the snow-white cat appeared, meowing hungrily at the tantalizing scent.

"Here, precious..." Lillian cooed, extending the treat while her other hand concealed a syringe.

The cat approached cautiously...then froze.

Its keen eyes spotted the glint of metal in Lillian's hidden hand.

With a terrified yowl, it vaulted onto a nearby planter, hissing furiously.

The treacherous woman had tried to stab it!

"Don't you want this delicious food?" Lillian forced sweetness into her voice, waving the can.

The Persian flicked its tail contemptuously, gazing down its nose at her with undisguised disdain.

Lillian's grip tightened on the syringe. That insufferable creature would make excellent stew!
###Chapter 360

Evelyn Sinclair pressed her back against the bathroom wall, her temper flaring at the white Persian cat's defiance.

No matter how much she waved the gourmet cat food can, the stubborn creature refused to budge from its perch on the flower stand. That cunning little beast!

She absolutely had to administer the liquid medication to the cat. Her entire plan depended on it.

Kicking off her designer heels, Evelyn climbed barefoot onto the marble sink counter. She reached for the feline, but it anticipated her move.

The cat leaped down just as Evelyn stretched out her arms, its razor-sharp claws raking across her bare forearm. Crimson lines bloomed on her porcelain skin.

She barely managed to shield her face in time. One second slower and those claws would have shredded her perfect features.

The Persian cat landed gracefully, then turned to give Evelyn a triumphant meow before darting away. Her perfectly manicured nails dug into her palms as she swore vengeance on the furry demon.

After an exhausting chase that left her sweating through her silk blouse, Evelyn finally cornered the cat. The green liquid disappeared into its system with a quick syringe plunge.

Victory came at a price - deep scratches crisscrossed the back of her hand, still oozing blood.

Meanwhile, Dominic Blackwood's children tugged at their mother's sleeves. "Mommy, where did Tabitha go?" little Isabella asked, her big eyes wide with concern.

Several waiters pointed them toward the ladies' room. Evelyn led her twins down the corridor, their small hands warm in hers.

They rounded the corner and collided with Lillian Prescott and her frumpy assistant. The contrast couldn't have been starker - Lillian in head-to-toe designer couture versus her mousy companion in ill-fitting separates.

Celebrities always hired unattractive assistants, Evelyn noted. Probably afraid of competition for the spotlight.

Seeing Lillian made Evelyn's skin prickle with dislike. Even though Dominic had made his disinterest clear, the woman's persistent advances irritated her.

Evelyn tried to steer the children past, but Lillian blocked their path. "Ms. Sinclair! What an unexpected pleasure," she purred.

"Hardly unexpected at a restaurant this popular," Evelyn countered with a tight smile. "Unless you're following us, Ms. Prescott?"

Lillian's eyes darted around. "Where's Dominic? I thought he'd be with his family." The question dripped with fake concern.

Evelyn squeezed her children's hands. "He's parking the car. Said he's been neglecting us lately with all his business trips." She let her voice soften. "He insisted on family time today - said no amount of money compares to being with us."

Lillian's smile froze as Evelyn's words struck like poisoned darts. The scratches on her hand throbbed painfully.

"May your happiness last," Lillian spat through clenched teeth. She brushed past Evelyn with a meaningful shoulder bump, her assistant scurrying after her.

Isabella frowned up at her mother. "I don't like that lady. She's mean!"

Alexander nodded vigorously. "She likes Daddy, doesn't she? Just like all those other aunties who used to chase him."

Evelyn sighed. Her perceptive children had inherited their father's sharp instincts. "Yes, sweetheart. Many women want your father's attention."

"Uncle Julian says they swarm like bees to honey," Alexander added with childish solemnity. "Some even tried giving us presents. Daddy always sent them away."

Evelyn's lips twitched at the image. Dominic's magnetic charm came with complications. But she'd happily fend off every gold-digger and social climber who dared approach her family.

"Mommy? Did I make you sad?" Alexander asked anxiously when Evelyn grew quiet.

"Not at all, darling. Let's find Tabitha." She led them toward the restroom.

They'd barely stepped through the doorway when a shrieking woman barreled into them. The stranger's face bore deep, bleeding claw marks.

"Don't go in there!" the woman gasped. "A white cat's gone berserk! It attacked me for no reason!"

As she spoke, a white blur shot from the bathroom straight toward little Isabella, claws extended!
###Chapter 361

The entire scene unfolded in a heartbeat, leaving everyone stunned.

Little Isabella's eyes widened in terror as the once docile Persian cat suddenly lunged at her with wild fury.

The child's breath hitched, frozen in place.

"Isabella!"

Evelyn's maternal instincts kicked in instantly. She swept both Alexander and Isabella into her protective embrace, shielding their small faces against her chest while turning her back toward the rabid animal.

The white feline had transformed completely - its pristine fur now bristled like needles, sapphire eyes glowing crimson. Razor-sharp claws tore through Evelyn's cashmere sweater.

"Get off!" Evelyn shoved violently at the creature.

She couldn't comprehend how this gentle pet that had been purring contentedly moments ago turned into this savage beast.

What kind of drug could alter an animal's temperament so drastically within minutes?

The chemically-enhanced cat resisted Evelyn's attempts to dislodge it, only growing more enraged. Its claws raked across her delicate neck.

White-hot pain exploded. Warm blood trickled down her collarbone.

Evelyn's palms turned clammy. She remained statue-still, terrified any movement might endanger her children.

She prayed security would arrive before this crazed animal attacked more innocent guests.

Nearby, another victim clutched her bleeding face, screaming as she fled toward the dining area.

"Help! There's a rabid cat in the restroom!" The woman gasped between sobs to passing waitstaff. "It attacked me! A mother and two children are still trapped there!"

The staff paled, immediately dropping their trays to summon security through their earpieces before sprinting toward the crisis.

At that precise moment, the VIP suite doors swung open. Dominic Blackwood emerged, his towering frame radiating lethal energy.

The injured woman froze upon seeing him, momentarily forgetting her wounds.

Dominic didn't spare her a glance. His obsidian eyes darkened dangerously as he stormed toward the restroom.

Inside, chaos reigned.

Evelyn huddled in a corner, clutching her sobbing children. Blood seeped from her neck wound as she stared at the twitching feline on the floor.

Both children trembled violently, traumatized by witnessing their beloved pet turn vicious. They'd never forget how this creature nearly mauled their mother.

Outside, security personnel gathered with riot gear, prepared to euthanize the animal if it revived.

One glance at the cat's condition told them survival was unlikely. James Kensington's brutal kick had shattered its skull.

Evelyn murmured soothing words to her children before addressing their unexpected savior. "Thank you, Mr. Kensington."

Had James not arrived when he did, the outcome could've been catastrophic.

The Holston Group CEO stood impeccably dressed, diamond cufflinks glinting as he idly held a cigarette between his fingers.

He glanced disdainfully at the dying animal. "Unacceptable security lapse for an establishment of this caliber. Preston's team grows more incompetent by the day."

"Ma'am, are you alright?" Scarlett Fairchild arrived breathlessly in her uniform, forehead glistening with sweat.

Her face drained of color upon seeing Evelyn's injuries. "I'm so sorry! My cat's never behaved this way before!"

Tears streamed down the waitress's cheeks as she spotted her barely breathing pet. Though heartbroken, she knew she'd face consequences.

Evelyn couldn't bring herself to blame the distraught girl. "Just don't bring pets to work anymore, Ms. Fairchild."

Scarlett's trembling shoulders and quiet sobs stirred something primal in James. That vulnerable sound...

It reminded him of that drunken night years ago when he'd taken a woman violently. Her pleading whimpers still haunted him, though her face remained blurred in memory.

As Scarlett lifted her tear-streaked face, an overwhelming presence approached.

Simultaneously, Evelyn found herself swept into powerful arms - Dominic Blackwood had arrived.
###Chapter 362

Dominic's familiar, scorching breath washed over Evelyn.

His masculine scent enveloped her, that distinctive blend of sandalwood and mint that always calmed her nerves. As his strong arms tightened around her neck, Evelyn felt her initial panic subsiding.

The fear that had gripped her moments ago melted away under his touch.

She hadn't realized how shaken she was until seeing Dominic. Now the floodgates opened, emotions pouring out uncontrollably.

"Dominic..." Evelyn whispered hoarsely.

Without hesitation, Dominic swept her into his arms and carried her to a nearby bench. His stormy gaze immediately zeroed in on the angry scratches marring her delicate neck.

Pain flashed across his handsome features, quickly replaced by barely contained fury.

Evelyn instinctively raised a hand to cover the wounds, self-conscious about their ugliness.

Dominic gently brushed aside a stray lock of hair clinging to her damp cheek. His fingers tilted her chin upward. "One minute out of my sight and you're injured?" His voice held that dangerous edge she knew too well. "How am I supposed to let you out alone if you can't even protect yourself? You're worse than the twins."

Evelyn surrendered to his possessive embrace.

Pressed against his chest, she could hear his usually steady heartbeat racing wildly.

Dominic Blackwood never lost composure.

Yet now his heart pounded like a drum, betraying his distress.

"That Persian cat just... snapped. It went straight for Isabella. I didn't have time to think." Evelyn frowned. "That's what's strange - it was perfectly calm during dinner. Why would it suddenly attack?"

Dominic stroked her hair soothingly. "Leave it to me. I'll get to the bottom of this." His icy glare fell upon the lifeless feline. 'No animal turns violent without cause. Someone must have drugged it.'

Nearby, James Kensington expertly comforted the still-sobbing twins.

The seasoned father had far more experience handling children than Dominic.

After years dealing with his own mischievous son Oliver, James had mastered the art of distraction. With Alexander and Isabella being naturally well-behaved, it took mere minutes before their tears turned to giggles.

Scarlett Fairchild watched guiltily, torn between the children and her dying pet.

Finally, compassion won.

She knelt beside the stiffening Persian cat, cradling its bloodied form. Tears fell freely onto its matted white fur.

When her blurred vision accidentally met James's intense stare, Scarlett froze.

The man was breathtakingly handsome - tall and lean with model-perfect proportions. His crisp dress shirt hugged his frame impeccably, cufflinks glinting under the lights.

But when their eyes locked, Scarlett's stomach dropped.

She realized with discomfort that he was studying her intently.

Something calculating lurked in James's gaze...

The blue-uniformed waitress had her chestnut hair pinned up, revealing an exquisite oval face. Her porcelain skin and mesmerizing eyes - shaped like almond leaves, shimmering like spring pools - gave her an ethereal beauty.

James's scrutiny made Scarlett's skin prickle.

She couldn't decipher his expression, but instinct screamed this man was dangerous.

Shifting awkwardly, she focused on her cat. It needed immediate veterinary care, but protocol demanded she stay until the guests resolved the incident.

Preston Worthington arrived hastily, a half-smoked cigarette between his fingers.

Trailing behind were a white-coated physician and two nervous club managers. Elite establishments like Blue Honors prided themselves on impeccable service, including on-site medical care for emergencies.

Preston stubbed out his cigarette, approaching Dominic and Evelyn with an apologetic smile. His androgynous beauty looked genuinely contrite. "My deepest apologies, Evelyn. This should never have happened here. Dr. Lawrence will examine your injuries immediately."

"It's alright, really. Just an accident. The children and I are fine." Evelyn offered him a gentle smile, the kind that made her lips bloom like roses, radiating warmth.

Preston suddenly understood Dominic's obsession.

In their world of calculated glamour and cold extravagance, Evelyn's genuine warmth stood out like sunshine. Had she been unattached, even he might have fallen for such sincerity.

Dr. Lawrence inspected Evelyn's wounds with growing concern. "These lacerations require immediate treatment. Without proper injections, you risk cat scratch disease - swollen lymph nodes, blistering..."

"Then stop wasting time and treat her!" Dominic's voice could have frozen hell.

The doctor flinched at his glacial tone.

The contrast between Dominic's tender care for Evelyn and his murderous glare was jarring.
###Chapter 363

The middle-aged doctor had worked extensively with Preston Worthington Jr. from the Worthington family. His nerves were steeled by now.

Otherwise, the sheer intensity radiating from Dominic Blackwood would have shattered him.

Dominic carefully rolled up Evelyn Sinclair’s sleeve, revealing skin so flawless it rivaled fresh snow.

The doctor’s breath hitched.

In his career, he’d treated countless noblewomen with impeccable complexions. But the woman before him eclipsed them all.

Her skin was so delicate it could rival an infant’s. Translucent, luminous—enough to blind someone unprepared.

"Are you trying to lose your eyes?" Dominic’s icy voice snapped the doctor back to reality.

Meeting those murderous eyes, the doctor immediately lowered his gaze.

Men of power were possessive. It was a universal truth, especially among the elite. The doctor understood that all too well.

His hands trembled slightly as he prepared the syringe.

"Shake one more time, and I’ll ensure you never practice medicine again." Dominic’s threat was a blade against the doctor’s throat.

The doctor swallowed hard, steadying himself with a deep breath.

"Must you be so harsh?"

Evelyn’s lashes fluttered as she tugged Dominic’s sleeve, silently pleading for mercy.

Dominic’s glare softened marginally.

The doctor exhaled in relief.

With precision, he administered the injection.

Next came the disinfectant and gauze. "Miss Sinclair, your neck wounds need immediate treatment. Delaying risks scarring."

Evelyn nodded obediently.

The sting of antiseptic burned. It was agony—sharp, relentless.

She clenched her teeth, refusing to whimper. The doctor was already under enough pressure.

But pain betrayed her. A tiny gasp escaped.

Dominic’s expression darkened like a gathering storm.

"Be gentler," he growled through gritted teeth.

The doctor wanted to protest—he was being as gentle as humanly possible. But facing Dominic’s wrath was like standing before a raging inferno.

Preston Worthington Sr. rolled his eyes. "Dominic, disinfectant stings. That’s basic science. Unless you want scars marring her neck?"

His usually sharp-witted brother had devolved into an overprotective fool.

"This happened on your property. You owe me answers, Preston." Dominic’s glare was lethal.

Preston raised his hands. "I’ll get to the bottom of this. My apologies, Evelyn."

His instincts screamed foul play. No cat turned rabid without cause.

Someone had orchestrated this.

And Preston would make them regret it.

"Test that cat immediately," he ordered, nodding at the limp Persian cradled by Scarlett Fairchild.

Tears streamed down Scarlett’s face. "Mr. Worthington, I take full responsibility. Punish me, fine me—but please, save her. She’s… she’s everything to me."

James Kensington unexpectedly intervened. "Preston, it’s just a cat. Must you torment the girl? Save it if you can."

Preston arched a brow.

James defending a woman? Unprecedented.

His gaze flicked to Scarlett.

Ah. Now it made sense.

With a smirk, Preston relented. "Fine. For James’ sake, I’ll try."

Scarlett’s gratitude shone through her tears.

Elsewhere…

Lillian Prescott handed her assistant a thick envelope.

"100,000 dollars. A bonus for your loyalty."

The assistant’s eyes gleamed. "Thank you, Ms. Prescott!"

Back in the VIP lounge…

As the doctor finished bandaging Evelyn’s neck, Alexander and Isabella Blackwood approached hesitantly.

"Mommy…"

Their identical faces were streaked with tears.

Alexander, ever the little man, fought back sobs. His brown eyes shimmered with unshed tears.

Isabella burst into loud wails. "Mommy, I’m sorry! If I hadn’t chased the kitty, you wouldn’t be hurt! I’ll never play with cats again!"

Evelyn’s heart shattered.

She pulled Isabella close, wiping her tears. "Sweetheart, it wasn’t your fault. The kitty was sick. Don’t hate all cats because of this, okay?"

Isabella sniffled. "But what if another kitty hurts you?"

Evelyn kissed her cheek. "It won’t happen. This was just an accident."

The doctor returned with test results. "Mr. Worthington, the cat was injected with a madness-inducing pathogen. Within ten minutes, it amplifies aggression tenfold."
###Chapter 364

Dominic's expression turned glacial as he listened to the doctor's report.

He knew this was no accident. Someone had orchestrated it.

The question was—who? And were they targeting Evelyn, or someone else?

The mere thought of the second possibility made his dark eyes flash with lethal intensity.

Just then, the senior manager in charge of Blue Honors' surveillance entered with damning evidence.

A screenshot from the security footage showed a woman wrapped in a thick gray scarf, obscuring her face. She wore a brown trench coat and carried a can of cat food, luring the white Persian into the restroom.

Evelyn's breath hitched.

She recognized that figure.

Earlier, she had crossed paths with Lillian Prescott and her assistant in the lobby.

That scarf, that coat—it matched exactly what Lillian's assistant had been wearing.

Why would the assistant target her? They had no history.

Unless… Lillian was behind it.

The manager pointed at the image. "Mr. Worthington, we've confirmed it was Ms. Prescott's assistant who led the cat into the restroom. Unfortunately, there are no cameras inside, so we can't see what happened next. But given the circumstances, she's undoubtedly involved."

Preston Worthington lounged elegantly on the sofa, legs crossed. His voice was deceptively calm. "Bring Ms. Prescott and her assistant here."

Despite her flawless plan, Lillian's pulse quickened.

She craved a cigarette to steady her nerves but resisted—her public image as the perfect goddess couldn't be tarnished.

"Ms. Prescott, I'm so much bigger than you. Your clothes might not fit me…" Her assistant fidgeted in the borrowed designer outfit, feeling like a stuffed mannequin.

Still, she was thrilled.

Lillian had summoned her from the hospital, where she'd been caring for her sick brother, with promises of luxury.

The scarf, coat, and boots she now wore cost a fortune.

"You look stunning." Lillian adjusted the collar, her praise honeyed.

"Ms. Prescott, you're too generous. You pay us well, give us gifts, and never lose your temper. I'm so lucky to work for you!" The assistant's voice trembled with gratitude.

Lillian smiled. "Of course. We're a team. By the way… I heard your brother needs a kidney transplant. The surgery costs a fortune, doesn't it?"

The assistant froze.

"How much do you still need? I'll cover it." Lillian's tone was gentle, her eyes filled with faux concern. "You've been working so hard. You shouldn't have hidden this from me."

Tears welled in the assistant's eyes. "Y-You'd really do that?"

"Of course. Haven't I always kept my word?" Lillian's smile deepened. "My father knows Dr. Lionel Grant, a specialist in your brother's condition. I'll arrange everything."

Overwhelmed, the assistant sobbed. "Ms. Prescott, if you ever need anything—anything at all—I'll do it!"

Lillian hugged her, hiding the triumph in her eyes. "I'll hold you to that."

A knock interrupted them. Two security guards stood at the door. "Ms. Prescott, Mr. Worthington requests your presence."

Lillian's smile never wavered. "Of course. Just give me a moment."

"Dominic, do you think Lillian's involved?" Evelyn bit her lip. "It doesn't make sense. Why go through all this trouble?"

She couldn't reconcile the sweet on-screen persona with the scheming woman this evidence suggested.

Dominic's hand rested on her head, his voice firm. "Don't worry. The truth will come out."

His eyes darkened.

And when it did, someone would pay.
###Chapter 365

Evelyn stepped into the VIP lounge just as Dominic's gaze lingered on the bandage at the nape of her neck.

The chiseled contours of his face became even more striking under the soft lighting. His tanned skin radiated a magnetic, almost dangerous allure.

What burned through Lillian's veins was how Dominic's entire attention remained fixed on that plain-looking woman. He hadn't even glanced her way when passing by earlier.

The jealousy pricked at her like shards of glass.

His eyes refused to leave Evelyn's face.

When Lillian noticed Evelyn's complexion remained flawless despite the white gauze around her neck, bitter disappointment twisted inside her.

That useless cat. Even drugged, it failed to ruin Evelyn's perfect features.

She'd wanted scars, not mere scratches!

Evelyn suddenly looked up, as if sensing the venomous stare. Their eyes met before Lillian could mask her hatred.

With practiced ease, Lillian's lips curved into a gracious smile.

At the head table, Preston Worthington crossed his long legs. Cigarette smoke wreathed his striking features like a sinister halo.

His hazel eyes held a hypnotic quality - smiling superficially while remaining utterly cold beneath. Those who met his gaze felt an instinctive chill.

Behind him stood rows of stern-faced executives and towering security personnel.

The intimidating display would unsettle most people.

Lillian remained composed, but her assistant trembled visibly.

Meanwhile, James Kensington played maze games with the twins and a blue-uniformed waitress - none other than Scarlett Fairchild!

Lillian's breath hitched seeing those familiar delicate features.

Years had transformed her from that scrawny orphanage girl into a swan through sheer will and subtle enhancements. She was certain Scarlett wouldn't recognize her now.

As Preston approached, he tapped cigarette ash away. "My apologies for interrupting your meal, Ms. Prescott. An unfortunate incident occurred today - a drugged cat attacked our guests, including my brother's woman. Surveillance shows your assistant led the cat to the restroom."

Lillian sat gracefully, smiling. "How absurd, Mr. Worthington. My assistant was with me the entire time."

The security footage played, showing a figure identical to the assistant - same build, same outfit.

Lillian's fingers turned icy. She'd disguised herself expertly, layering clothes and mimicking the assistant's mannerisms.

The assistant gaped in shock. "That's not me!"

Evelyn watched the charade unfold, amused by Lillian's performance. The actress' concern was almost believable.

"How dreadful if your face had been ruined," Lillian murmured sweetly.

Preston's gaze turned razor-sharp. "We'd appreciate your cooperation in this investigation, Ms. Prescott."

Lillian's smile tightened imperceptibly. The trap was closing in.
###Chapter 366

Lillian Prescott's face darkened with barely contained fury.

She rose abruptly and confronted her assistant. Her usually melodic voice carried an icy edge. "Explain yourself. Did you have any involvement in this incident? What exactly did you do to that cat to make it attack people?"

The assistant trembled visibly, tears welling in her eyes. "Ms. Prescott, I swear it wasn't me. You know I came straight to Blue Honors after your call. I've been by your side the whole evening... And when I used the restroom earlier, there wasn't any white cat there. Someone's setting me up..."

Lillian's expression turned disappointed. "We've worked together for years. You've always been diligent, but this one flaw of yours - your tendency to lie - is unacceptable. The surveillance footage clearly shows it was you. The woman in the video matches your build perfectly, wearing the exact same outfit you have on now. How can you still deny it?"

At the mention of clothing, the assistant's eyes widened in realization. She suddenly remembered how Lillian had unexpectedly gifted her this expensive ensemble earlier that evening.

Her hands shook as she whispered, "But Ms. Prescott, these clothes were-"

Lillian cut her off sharply. "If you confess and apologize to the injured Ms. Sinclair, I'm certain she'll forgive you. She's known for her kindness. And I'm sure Mr. Blackwood will show mercy too. Don't worry about your brother - I'll ensure his surgery proceeds smoothly. You can trust me."

Positioning herself so only her assistant could see her face, Lillian's expression shifted dramatically. The angelic image she projected to others vanished, replaced by a complex mix of pleading and veiled threats.

The assistant wasn't stupid - she'd managed Lillian's complex schedule and affairs for years. As she stared into Lillian's eyes, understanding dawned.

The light in her eyes dimmed, replaced by dull resignation.

Evelyn Sinclair observed this exchange quietly, noting the assistant's intense reaction and subsequent change in demeanor.

Suddenly, the assistant confessed. "It was me. I did it. I'm sorry for lying earlier. Ms. Sinclair, I apologize for your injuries. I'll accept whatever punishment you deem appropriate."

Evelyn frowned. "Why would you do this? And what exactly did you inject into that cat?"

"I've hated cats since childhood. When I arrived at Blue Honors tonight, that white cat nearly scratched my face. I wanted revenge, so I lured it to the bathroom and injected it with a substance that induces aggression. I thought if it attacked someone important, the cat would be disposed of. That's what happened tonight. I'm truly sorry..."

Tears streamed down the assistant's face as she delivered this plausible explanation, though Evelyn sensed something amiss.

Lillian addressed the crowd with practiced grace. "Mr. Blackwood, Ms. Sinclair, while her actions were unacceptable, she's been my loyal assistant for years. This was an isolated incident fueled by her irrational fear of cats. As her employer, I accept partial responsibility. I'll cover all damages to Blue Honors. Could you possibly show leniency? Her brother is critically ill and depends on her care..."

Her performance was flawless - the picture of a compassionate employer taking responsibility for her staff's mistakes.

Dominic Blackwood's gaze turned glacial. His voice held an unusual edge. "Since she's admitted guilt, we'll handle this legally. An adult who commits such reckless acts must face consequences. Evelyn didn't just suffer physical injuries tonight - she endured psychological trauma. I won't be merciful to whoever caused her distress."

His penetrating stare seemed to bore into Lillian, making her subtly uncomfortable. Though his words targeted the assistant, Lillian felt them as personal barbs.

"What exactly are you suggesting, Mr. Blackwood?" Lillian's fingers twitched at her sides.

Dominic didn't mince words. "Actions have consequences. She'll serve time to reflect on her poor judgment."

The assistant paled, casting desperate looks at Lillian. Jail would ruin her life and leave her brother without care.

Lillian hadn't anticipated Dominic's ruthlessness. Sending someone to prison over a cat scratch seemed excessive, even cruel.

Turning to Evelyn with pleading eyes, Lillian played her final card. "Ms. Sinclair, I know she was wrong, but her brother's life depends on her. Could we perhaps reconsider?"

Evelyn observed the assistant's pitiful state and relented, gently tugging Dominic's sleeve. "She's suffered enough. Let's just have her compensate Blue Honors' losses. This lesson will stay with her forever."

Dominic sighed inwardly at Evelyn's kindness. She failed to see this was never about punishing the assistant, but sending a message to the true mastermind.

Though he knew Lillian's involvement, her political connections prevented direct confrontation. "Preston," he addressed Preston Worthington, "handle this. Evelyn and I are leaving with the children."

Passing the matter to the notoriously ruthless Preston guaranteed Lillian would pay dearly.

As they departed with sleeping Alexander and Isabella, Reginald Blackwood extinguished his cigarette, his enigmatic gaze lingering on the "gentle goddess" Lillian.
###Chapter 367

The city lights painted the night in vibrant hues. Soft amber glow from street lamps seeped through the Bentley's windows, warming the interior.

In the backseat, the twins slept peacefully beneath a lightweight blanket.

Dominic gripped the steering wheel while Evelyn sat beside him, lost in thought. Her chin rested on her palm as she absently watched illuminated billboards flash by.

"Does it still hurt?" Dominic's right hand left the wheel to trace the bandage on Evelyn's neck. His fingers lingered before intertwining with hers, transferring silent strength.

Evelyn met his concerned gaze. "I was just thinking how strange everything was today." She shook her head slightly. "Even if Lillian's assistant disliked cats, why infect one with bacteria? That girl seemed so timid—not the type for such cruelty. And Lillian herself...there's something off about her."

Dominic's dark eyes reflected Evelyn's pensive expression. He knew Lillian was likely behind it all but chose not to voice his suspicions. No need to burden Evelyn further.

His hand moved to tousle her hair. "Stay away from that woman. If you must interact, keep your guard up. Don't fall for her schemes."

Evelyn hummed in agreement. Though she'd only met Lillian a handful of times, her instincts screamed warning. That woman wanted Dominic—of course she'd be dangerous.

The next morning found Evelyn at work with her bandaged neck.

Abigail pounced immediately. "What happened? Did our beast of a boss get too enthusiastic last night?" She wiggled her eyebrows suggestively. "Had to cover the evidence?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes at Abigail's wild imagination. "A cat scratched me. That's all."

"Oh please," Abigail scoffed. "As if Mr. Blackwood would ever let you get hurt. The man worships the ground you walk on!" She leaned in conspiratorially. "Though how does an adult get scratched by a cat? You're usually so careful."

"It went berserk unexpectedly." Evelyn powered up her computer. "Could you send me the VIVI Group collaboration updates?"

"On it!"

Despite Vivienne Laurent's continued coldness, Evelyn had adapted to Yvonne Blackwell's demanding leadership. While Yvonne kept her at arm's length, Malcolm Whitmore from Design Team Two proved an excellent mentor.

She'd learned to avoid Geoffrey Winslow and Miranda Caldwell entirely—Abigail's warnings had been clear.

As Evelyn worked, Bernadette Worthing strutted in, hips swaying. Her plunging neckline and micro-miniskirt left little to imagination. A cloud of perfume preceded her.

Bernadette's eyes gleamed maliciously at Evelyn's bandage. "My, my. Who'd you anger this time? Such dedication—injured yet still working!" Her voice dripped false admiration.

Evelyn ignored her completely, fingers flying across the keyboard.

Bernadette's smile turned icy. Just wait until Ms. Laurent returns, you little nobody. You'll be crying then!

Her stomach twisted. Two months of daily updates to Vivienne with no recall from Western Europe. What if Vivienne didn't care about Dominic marrying Evelyn? The thought terrified her.

Meanwhile at Regal Capital...

Olivia Kensington shuffled outside in pajamas, sleepily carrying trash to the dumpster.

A white luxury car caught her eye. Two black-clad bodyguards emerged, opening the door for Preston Worthington Jr.

Her blood ran cold.

When Preston blocked her path, hatred surged like wildfire. She longed to carve him to pieces.

"Pregnant." Preston's icy gaze dropped to her still-flat stomach.

Olivia instinctively shielded her abdomen. "I'm not!"

He tossed hospital documents at her. "That clinic belongs to my family. Did you really think I wouldn't find out?" His jaw clenched. "You're terminating it."

Olivia's face paled. "This baby is mine! You have no—"

"I won't have my heir living in squalor." Preston's voice turned deadly. "Take her."

Olivia fought like a wildcat, hurling curses as the bodyguards forced her into the car.

From her window, Tabitha watched the scene unfold with glee. She didn't lift a finger to help. Birds of a feather indeed. Serves her right!
###Chapter 368

At the hospital.

"I refuse to terminate this pregnancy. No one touches my baby. I'll fight anyone who tries!" Olivia shielded her stomach protectively.

She backed away like a cornered animal, putting distance between herself and the approaching white-coated doctors.

"My apologies, Ms. Kensington. We must follow Preston Worthington Jr.'s orders," the lead physician said coldly.

This wasn't his first forced abortion. He'd performed many for the reckless Worthington heir. Olivia wouldn't be the last.

"Show yourself, Preston Worthington! You coward!" Olivia screamed hysterically.

Strong hands pinned her limbs to the bed.

The door swung open. Preston entered with a haughty beauty clinging to his arm.

The woman's narrowed eyes regarded Olivia like something unpleasant stuck to her shoe.

Olivia's stomach churned. Her child's life hung in the balance while its father paraded his mistress.

"I've never begged anyone before," Olivia choked out. "Please let me keep this baby. He'll never know you're his father. I'll disappear forever—just let me—"

The woman cut her off with a cruel laugh. "Know your place! Preston's marrying me next month. Did you really think I'd allow some bastard to threaten my future?"

She flung a crimson wedding invitation at Olivia's face.

The gilded names burned Olivia's vision: Preston Worthington Jr. & Cecilia Worthington.

Tears fell freely now. "Ms. Worthington, I swear I won't interfere. This child is all I'll ever have—"

"Spare me your sob story!" Cecilia sneered. "You're just another gold-digger trying to trap him with a baby. Did you enjoy spreading your legs for my fiancé? Well, you won't be keeping the souvenir!"

Olivia turned desperate eyes to Preston. "This is your child too! Have you no heart?"

She collapsed to her knees, forehead striking the cold floor until blood bloomed. "Please...just let me—"

Preston watched her grovel with disgust. "That mistake shouldn't exist. Only my wife bears my heirs."

"You forced yourself on me!" Olivia shrieked. "Now you'd murder your own blood?"

"Remove it," Preston ordered the doctors.

As they dragged her toward surgery, Olivia's screams turned feral. "If you kill my baby, I'll take my life right here! Their blood will be on your hands!"

"Die then," Preston shrugged, turning away.

Olivia's laughter turned manic. She snatched a scalpel. "Remember this moment, Preston Worthington! When you kneel before me someday, I'll return this pain a thousandfold!"

The blade flashed downward.

Crimson petals bloomed across her abdomen.

For one fleeting second, Preston paled. Then he walked away without looking back.

He couldn't know that soon, her curse would come to pass.

At T Corporation, Evelyn headed to lunch with Abigail when Olivia's call came.

Evelyn barely said hello before Olivia's broken sobs filled her ear.

Her blood ran cold. "Olivia? What's wrong? Where are you?"

"I'm dying, Evelyn..." Olivia wept incoherently.

Evelyn sprinted from the building. "Is it the baby? Tell me where you are!"

Between sobs, Olivia gasped out a location.

Evelyn kept the line open as she hailed a cab. Her knuckles whitened around the phone. Whatever had happened, she knew one thing—Preston Worthington would pay.
###Chapter 369

The taxi screeched to a halt outside the Worthington Medical Center.

Evelyn tossed the driver a crumpled twenty-dollar bill, not waiting for change as she bolted from the cab.

The sterile hospital air stung her nostrils.

There, curled into a fragile ball on the stark white sheets, lay Olivia.

Evelyn's breath caught. Her throat tightened like a vice.

"Olivia..." The name barely escaped her lips.

Tear-filled eyes met hers.

Evelyn reached to embrace her friend but recoiled when Olivia gasped in pain.

Lifting the hospital gown revealed layers of bloodstained bandages wrapping Olivia's abdomen.

Evelyn's vision blurred with rage. "Who did this?" Her hands shook violently. "Give me a name. I'll have them arrested!"

Olivia clung to her, sobs wracking her thin frame. "No police... please..."

Though Evelyn didn't fully grasp the Worthington family's reach, Olivia knew their power all too well.

Evelyn's jaw clenched. "Tell me. Now."

The unspoken truth hung between them - the baby was gone.

"Preston Worthington Jr." Olivia whispered the name like a curse. "Don't confront him, Evelyn. They'll destroy you."

Ice flooded Evelyn's veins.

Preston Worthington Jr.? The younger brother of Dominic's business associate?

Dominic's elegant sophistication seemed worlds apart from this monster.

Evelyn forced herself to stay calm until Olivia drifted into fitful sleep.

Then she stormed into Maxwell Lockwood's corporate headquarters.

When the receptionist announced Evelyn's unexpected arrival, Maxwell canceled an important board meeting without hesitation.

The polished businessman before her bore no resemblance to the predator she knew.

Images of Olivia's broken body flashed behind Evelyn's eyes.

Her palm connected with Maxwell's cheek with a resounding crack.

The entire lobby froze.

Maxwell merely touched his reddening cheek, lips curling. "Did that hurt your hand? Feel free to try again."

Evelyn seized his collar. "You ruined an innocent life! Olivia had nothing to do with us!"

White-hot fury burned through her.

Olivia's quiet suffering. The child ripped away. All because of this man's selfishness.

Maxwell's smirk faltered under her glare. For the first time, he saw the consequences of his actions reflected in Evelyn's eyes.
###Chapter 370

Maxwell's gaze locked onto Evelyn's furious expression, and an unexpected smirk curved his lips.

Yet his eyes remained completely devoid of remorse.

Instead, his voice carried a bitter edge. "Evelyn, I've noticed you never smile at me when we're together. Either you face me with complete indifference, or you look at me like you want me dead. It's all about Olivia, isn't it? I didn't lay a finger on her. Is she really worth all this effort?"

The moment the words left his mouth, searing pain exploded across his other cheek.

Evelyn had struck him again in a fit of rage!

Her hands trembled violently. No matter how many times she hit him, it would never be enough.

Her eyes burned crimson with fury. "How dare you claim you did nothing to Olivia? Do you even have a conscience, Maxwell Lockwood? If you hadn't arranged her abduction, would she have been violated and forced into pregnancy? Would she have had to endure that monster forcing an abortion on her? This is all your doing! How can you shrug it off so easily?"

People continued moving through the bustling lobby.

Evelyn's raised voice carried clearly to every corner, including the reception desk.

The two receptionists nearest them exchanged horrified glances.

They wished they could cover their ears.

What scandalous accusations was this young woman making? That their general manager orchestrated an abduction leading to assault and forced termination?

Good heavens!

This was explosive information. Could they pretend they'd heard nothing?

Maxwell tasted blood and ran his tongue along his split lip. Tsk. Bleeding.

That woman never held back with him.

It seemed Evelyn showed kindness to everyone except him. She'd even smile at a homeless beggar on the street.

But for him? Not a single gracious expression. Every interaction came laced with venomous hatred.

Her contempt knew no bounds.

He'd never encountered such intense loathing from a woman before.

"I admit partial responsibility for what happened to Olivia."

Maxwell ignored the judgmental stares as if they meant nothing. "So what do you want from me? Compensation? Or are you planning to sue?"

He'd known exactly what would happen to Olivia when he handed her to that lecher Preston. And he'd done it anyway.

The woman had brought it on herself, trying to gather evidence against him.

Given the chance, he'd make the same choice again.

Evelyn trembled with rage at his indifference. "I want you to take responsibility for what you did to Olivia!" Her voice dripped ice.

Maxwell crossed his arms. "Oh? And how should I do that? Marry her?"

Evelyn's retort died in her throat.

What an absolute scoundrel!

Maxwell stood too close. His masculine scent invaded her space, making her skin crawl.

Aside from Dominic, she recoiled from any man's proximity.

She tried to step back, but Maxwell seized her arm and dragged her toward the elevator.

Pressing the button, he murmured, "This isn't the place. My office."

"No need. We'll talk right here." Evelyn wrenched free as if touching poison.

She'd never trusted Maxwell. Being alone with him terrified her.

Ding! The doors slid open. With a faint smile, Maxwell pulled her inside.

"Let go! Don't touch me! Stop—" Evelyn shrieked, thrashing wildly.

Memories of that night when Maxwell nearly violated her came flooding back. She kicked and punched like a madwoman, forcing him back several steps.

"Evelyn! I swear I won't touch you without consent! Calm down!" Maxwell's heart twisted at her terror.

He gripped her shoulders firmly, trying to steady her.

Evelyn froze at the helpless sorrow in Maxwell's gaze.

In his eyes, she saw her own shattered reflection.

Gasping, she leaned against the elevator wall, biting her lip. How foolish she'd been.

Yes, Maxwell bore some blame for Olivia's suffering. But what had she hoped to accomplish confronting him?

She had no proof of his involvement. Any evidence would have been destroyed long ago. At most, she might secure some trauma compensation.

Could she have confronted Preston Worthington, the actual perpetrator? She couldn't even handle Maxwell!

Worst case, she might sacrifice herself seeking justice for Olivia.

But what was her suffering compared to what Olivia endured for her?

Without wealth or influence, someone like Preston remained untouchable.

To society's elite, laws were decorations and morality meaningless.

Evelyn understood life's harsh realities. Knew how cruelly fate treated those at society's bottom.

The only path to justice required Dominic's help.

But would her lover intervene for Olivia's sake? Would he wage war against the Worthingtons over a personal vendetta?

The Blackwood and Worthington families stood as equals in power and wealth.

A conflict between them would shake A City's economy, harming countless innocents.

Moreover, Dominic and Preston Sr. were close friends.

She hated troubling him, but lacked the power to challenge Preston alone.

Evelyn's face paled. Her arms fell limp. Tears threatened.

She stabbed the door button.

As the doors parted, tear-filled eyes met Maxwell's.

Then she stumbled out, all strength drained...

Alone in the elevator, Maxwell inhaled her fading fragrance from his palm.

His expression hardened as he watched her leave. He dialed a number.

A rough, breathless male voice answered, mid-passionate encounter.

Maxwell cut to the chase. "What did you do to Olivia?"

"Olivia? The usual. Made out with her. Oh right—got her pregnant, but had that taken care of. You know my old man would kill me if I knocked someone up. Annoying how she fought it—stabbed herself with a scalpel rather than abort. Such a hassle," Preston answered casually.

A naked, beautiful woman—his fiancée Cecilia Worthington—nuzzled his chest.

Maxwell ended the call abruptly.

The answer matched expectations, yet still unsettled him...
###Chapter 371

Olivia lay curled on the hospital bed, trapped in restless sleep. Visions of darkness chased her, denying her any peace.

The shrill ringtone jolted her awake.

She gasped, grabbing the phone with trembling fingers. Patricia Kensington's name flashed on the screen.

"Hello, Mother..." Her voice came out hoarse.

"Finally answering your phone!" Patricia's razor-sharp tone sliced through the receiver. "Do I even have a daughter anymore? Vanishing for six weeks without a word! Where have you been whoring around this time? Get your worthless self home immediately! That pitiful sum you gave me last time is gone. I need another million by tomorrow!"

Despite the thick hospital blankets, Olivia couldn't stop shaking.

This was her mother's first contact after her disappearance. No concern. No relief. Just demands and insults.

When others spoke of maternal love, Olivia only knew this hollow ache.

"I'm... in the hospital." Olivia's fingers dug into the sheets. "Not feeling well. We'll talk later—"

She ended the call before collapsing back onto the pillows.

Silent tears carved paths down her gaunt cheeks.

"Ms. Kensington," the young nurse murmured while changing the IV bag, "post-surgery emotions can affect recovery. Please try to stay calm."

The abdominal wound burned, but it was nothing compared to the gaping hole in her chest.

Olivia gave a weak nod, swallowing the bitterness rising in her throat.

Even strangers showed more compassion than her own flesh and blood.

"Hello? HELLO?" Patricia stared at her silent phone, fury twisting her features. "How dare that ungrateful brat hang up on me!"

Something about Olivia's weak voice nagged at her. Her daughter had always been robust—rarely even catching colds. Why suddenly hospitalized?

Patricia grabbed her purse. She'd get answers face-to-face.

And that million dollars.

Her friend's daughter Fiona had connections—a wealthy benefactor who could spring Nathan from prison for three million. They'd even offered a money-back guarantee if the deal fell through.

Patricia had already handed over her life savings plus Olivia's last payment. Just nine hundred twenty thousand short.

Olivia had produced two million last time. Surely she could scrape together more.

Meanwhile, Evelyn Sinclair hurried back to the hospital.

She'd stopped at an ATM to empty her account—six months' salary from T Corporation's generous pay scale. Money she'd saved for a car, now destined for more urgent purposes.

As she turned down the corridor, shrill shouting reached her.

"Do you think raising you was easy? I single-handedly fed and clothed you brats after your useless father left! Now your brother's in trouble and you won't lift a finger? What kind of daughter are you?"

Evelyn's blood ran cold. Patricia Kensington.

She broke into a run.

"Enough!" Olivia's broken voice carried through the open door. "I'm in a hospital bed, Mother! I've given you every cent I had. Where am I supposed to get a million dollars? You see me like this and don't even ask what's wrong!"

Evelyn burst in to find Olivia trembling beneath white sheets, her face as pale as the pillowcase. Patricia stood over her, jabbing a finger at her daughter's forehead.

"Stop the theatrics! Since when do you need hospitalization? Pop some aspirin and get back to work! We need that money!"

"Ma'am, your daughter just underwent—" a nurse tried to intervene.

"Stay out of family business!" Patricia snapped.

Olivia slumped against the headboard, her vacant stare fixed on some distant point. Silent tears fell.

The sight ignited a fire in Evelyn's chest.
###Chapter 372

Olivia lay motionless in the hospital bed, her body still weak from surgery. The door creaked open to reveal her mother Patricia, who barged in without concern for her daughter's condition.

The sight made Evelyn's blood boil. What kind of mother prioritized money over her own child's health?

All heads turned when the door swung open. Olivia's pain-filled eyes met Evelyn's gaze.

The young nurse exhaled in visible relief.

Patricia's face twisted with growing rage.

"Eve..." Olivia's voice cracked, dry lips barely forming the word. She sounded like a wounded creature, helpless against life's cruelty.

Evelyn's chest tightened at the sight. She strode forward and dropped her purse beside Olivia's pillow.

Gently wiping away tears, Evelyn murmured, "Don't upset yourself. You need rest, not stress. It'll slow your recovery."

Before Olivia could respond, Patricia lumbered forward, jabbing a finger at Evelyn. "You cursed wretch! First my son, now my daughter? Olivia, I warned you about this troublemaker!"

"This is a hospital," Evelyn snapped, turning sharply. "Keep your voice down."

She continued, "Your hatred for me can wait. Your daughter just had surgery. Look at her - drenched in sweat, barely conscious. Is this how a mother behaves, Mrs. Kensington?"

Patricia froze momentarily at the news of surgery, then her fury redoubled.

No one spoke to Patricia Kensington that way - least of all Evelyn Sinclair!

Her voice rose to a shriek. "Who do you think you are? You ruined my son's life and now my daughter's! I told everyone you're bad luck!"

When words failed, Patricia resorted to violence, grabbing Evelyn's hair.

Olivia suddenly sat upright, her hollow eyes locking onto her mother. "What do you want, Mom? If you chase Eve away, will you stay to care for me?" Her raw scream echoed through the ward.

Patricia blinked at her tear-swollen daughter, suddenly remembering her original purpose.

Meeting Evelyn had distracted her from the money mission.

She released Evelyn's hair with false contrition. "Sweetheart, you must get the money. Your brother could die in prison! As his sister, you must save him..."

Patricia theatrically wiped nonexistent tears, playing the devoted mother.

Olivia turned away, clutching her painful abdomen, unwilling to indulge the charade. "Mom, Nathan deserves his punishment. Prison might reform him. I have no money left - you took all my cards and know the PINs. Check the accounts yourself."

Seeing tears ineffective, Patricia threw open the door and collapsed dramatically on the floor.

"Even dogs show gratitude!" she wailed. "I should've smothered you at birth! After all I've suffered raising you, this is my reward? Everyone, look at this ungrateful child! I might as well jump from this window!"

Though in a private ward, the commotion drew curious onlookers from neighboring rooms.

Olivia's tears fell anew, her breathing ragged from crying.

Evelyn's heart ached for her friend. Snatching her purse, she slammed it beside Patricia. "Take the money and leave!"

Patricia's tirade died when she glimpsed the cash inside. Her eyes gleamed with greed.

Clutching the purse like a prized possession, she scrambled up. "Rest well, dear. I'll return in a few days. This isn't enough - earn more after discharge. It's urgent!"

Without another glance at her recovering daughter, Patricia waddled away, arms wrapped tightly around her prize.

Olivia stared blankly at the empty doorway, fresh tears streaking her face. Numbness settled over her heart.

"I've never seen such cruelty from a mother," the nurse whispered, horrified.

Evelyn shut the door against prying eyes and gathered Olivia into a gentle embrace. "It's over now. Don't cry."

Olivia trembled in her arms. "I'm sorry you saw this... I'll repay you..."

Evelyn helped her lie back, tucking the blankets snugly. "No repayment needed. Just rest. I'll stay tonight."

Exhausted in body and spirit, Olivia soon drifted asleep to Evelyn's soothing voice.

Evelyn chafed Olivia's cold hands before tucking them under the covers. Pulling out her phone, she texted Dominic: [Taking the night off.]

His reply came instantly: [Understood. Return early. I have something for you.]

Her fingers flew across the screen: [A hint? Is it a surprise?]

Three minutes later, his response appeared: [My lips are sealed. But I promise you'll like it.]
###Chapter 373

Evelyn wanted to stay overnight with Olivia, but Olivia insisted she leave.

"The hospital staff will take care of me. You shouldn't spend your whole day here," Olivia said firmly.

"Alexander and Isabella are still young. They need their mother," she continued. "What if they miss you while you're gone?"

Dominic had been calling Evelyn nonstop. Reluctantly, Evelyn left the hospital and returned to the Blackwood mansion.

As she stepped inside, an odd feeling crept over her.

Something felt different, but she couldn't pinpoint what.

When she opened the front door, her breath caught in her throat.

The entire foyer had transformed into a floral wonderland.

A vibrant balloon arch dominated the central wall.

Sheer pink drapes cascaded from the ceiling, casting a romantic glow over the rustic decor.

An elaborate three-tier cake stood proudly on the dining table.

The inscription made her heart skip: "Happy Birthday Mommy! We love you!"

Before Evelyn could process the scene, two small figures emerged from behind the balloon wall.

Each child struggled to carry a plush toy nearly their own size.

"Happy birthday, Mommy!" they chorused, wobbling toward her with their oversized gifts.

Evelyn's hands flew to her mouth.

She carefully took the stuffed animals, knelt down, and kissed both children's foreheads.

"Thank you...this is the best surprise..." Her voice trembled with emotion.

No one had celebrated her birthday in years. Not since her grandfather's passing.

Those childhood memories of simple cakes with her grandfather contrasted sharply with this lavish display.

Turning twenty-four surrounded by love felt like a dream.

Alexander had chosen a chubby brown bear, while Isabella presented a delicate fawn.

Evelyn placed the cherished gifts on her bed, overwhelmed by this first experience of receiving presents from her children.

The twins clung to her, reluctant to let go.

She hesitated, acutely aware of hospital germs.

"Sweethearts, Mommy needs to shower first. I visited Aunt Olivia at the hospital today."

The children nodded obediently, releasing her.

As the bathroom door closed, Alexander adjusted his miniature suit.

"How do I look, Isabella? Handsome?" he whispered.

"You're the handsomest! Even more than Daddy!" Isabella declared proudly.

Alexander flushed at the compliment. "You look like a fairy tale princess."

Isabella twirled before the full-length mirror, admiring her party dress.

"Big Brother, we look perfect! Aunt Olivia says we got Mommy and Daddy's best genes." She suddenly frowned. "When I grow up, I must find a handsome husband. What if I marry someone ugly and have ugly babies?"

Alexander sat beside his pensive sister.

"Don't worry," he said solemnly. "I'll help choose your husband. He must be handsomer than me and pass my tests. No dating without my approval. Deal?"

Isabella extended her pinky. "Pinky promise forever!"

Neither realized this childhood pact would later become the bane of Isabella's romantic life, creating countless obstacles for her future suitors.

Evelyn showered quickly and applied light makeup. The elaborate decorations and her children's formal attire demanded her best appearance.

Where was Dominic?

She hadn't seen him since arriving. But she knew he hadn't forgotten.

He must have orchestrated everything before attending to urgent business.

Emerging from the bathroom, the children rushed into her arms like excited puppies.

Cradling them both, Evelyn marveled at their perfect faces in the soft light.

"Where's Daddy?" she asked.

Isabella nuzzled against her neck. "Daddy said he'd be back soon. He told us not to call him."

Evelyn tightened her embrace. "Then we'll wait."

The front door swung open.

Dominic entered, his coat dusted with snow, bearing an enormous bouquet of imported roses.

His striking features - those piercing eyes, aristocratic nose, and sculpted lips - looked even more pronounced in the winter chill.

Though windblown from his journey, his commanding presence filled the room. Even disheveled, he radiated an undeniable magnetism...
###Chapter 374

Evelyn gazed at Dominic with adoration.

The man she loved was sculpted by the gods themselves. Those piercing eyes, that aristocratic nose, those perfectly shaped lips - every inch of him was flawless.

Though known for his icy demeanor, his rare smiles could melt glaciers.

Dominic presented her with a winter bouquet. "Happy birthday, my love."

The roses defied season, their vibrant hues accented by goldenrod sprigs. A masterpiece of floral artistry.

Each colored bloom carried meaning: a kaleidoscope declaration of eternal devotion.

No woman could resist such romantic alchemy.

Evelyn's fingers trembled as she accepted them. "You remembered," she breathed.

Nathan had sent flowers before - calculated gestures to manipulate her affections. This felt entirely different.

Dominic wasn't the type for grand romantic gestures. His practicality made this surprise all the sweeter.

"Sweetheart..." Dominic's knuckles brushed her cheek, his dark eyes drinking her in. "You're breathtaking tonight."

The candlelight played across Evelyn's delicate features, enhancing her natural elegance. She needed no embellishment.

"Daddy! Look at us!" Isabella twirled in her snow-white dress, dragging Alexander along. The siblings became living snowflakes under the chandelier.

Dominic's lips quirked. "Beautiful, both of you. Your mother's genes prevailed."

Evelyn's cheeks pinked at the indirect compliment.

Isabella beamed while Alexander studied his shoes, secretly pleased by his father's rare praise.

The three-tiered cake dominated the table - cherry base crowned by a fondant castle, topped with a singing Barbie doll in pink satin.

Dominic lit the candles with ceremonial care. "Make a wish, darling."

Evelyn closed her eyes, lashes fluttering against porcelain skin. Dominic memorized the moment - he'd never tire of her quiet radiance.

The children helped blow out the flames in a giggling huff.

"What'd you wish for, Mommy?" Isabella demanded.

Alexander rolled his eyes. "Wishes don't work if you tell!"

Evelyn smoothed her daughter's hair. "For our family's happiness and health."

Dominic's chest tightened. This was why he loved her - no grand ambitions, just simple devotion.

"Now, cake!" Evelyn served the children first, their eyes darting to Dominic for permission.

Normally strict about sweets, he granted a rare indulgence tonight. The twins cheered, devouring their slices with unbridled joy.

"Evelyn..." Dominic caught her wrist. "Was this... adequate? I've never planned such an event before."

Her answering smile lit the room. She fed him a strawberry-laced bite. "It's perfect. I've never been happier."

Dominic savored the sweetness - not from the cake, but her fingers brushing his lips. "Delicious."

Then he kissed her, cream transferring to her mouth.

The children tactfully retreated, accustomed to their parents' displays of affection. They'd learned long ago not to interrupt these moments.
###Chapter 375

Dominic pulled Evelyn into his embrace.

His muscular arms encircled her slender waist as he rained tender kisses across her face.

The sweet scent of vanilla, cherries, and strawberries lingered on his lips, making each kiss more intoxicating than the last.

Evelyn melted into his affection.

His warmth enveloped her completely. The soft lighting made Dominic's long lashes appear almost translucent, and his unusually gentle expression made her heart flutter.

Their passionate exchange continued until Dominic's hands began wandering beneath her blouse.

"Dominic," Evelyn gasped, breaking the kiss. "Shouldn't we... eat the cake first?"

The handsome man tightened his possessive hold. "The only thing I want to taste right now is you," he growled.

His words sent her pulse racing.

Noticing the children's absence, Evelyn pushed against his chest. "Wait... where are Alexander and Isabella?"

That predatory look in Dominic's eyes always unnerved her.

His gaze burned with primal hunger, promising she'd be powerless to resist if he chose to take her.

The flower-filled living room provided a romantic backdrop under the warm lighting.

Evelyn's flushed cheeks were clearly visible as she glanced around nervously.

She tried to step away, but Dominic caught her wrist. "They went to bed because they know what's about to happen. Don't worry - they know their way around. Stay with me tonight, Evelyn."

"I stay with you every night!" Her voice trembled with a mixture of panic and anticipation.

"Not like this." Dominic traced her lips with his fingertips before claiming them in another searing kiss.

Then he reached into his pocket and produced an elegant velvet box.

The diamond ring inside sparkled brilliantly under the lights.

"Evelyn Sinclair," Dominic knelt gracefully on one knee, "will you marry me?"

Evelyn stared at the stunning ring - a large central diamond surrounded by eighteen smaller stones.

Tears welled in her eyes as she pressed a hand to her mouth.

'Is Dominic really proposing?'

She stood frozen, wondering if this was a dream, until Dominic rose to his full height.

Towering over her petite frame, he slid the ring onto her finger before she could respond.

"Since you're not answering," Dominic murmured, his short hair brushing her cheek, "I'll take that as a yes. From this moment, you're Dominic Blackwood's wife. Till death do us part. No escaping me now, understand?"

"Dominic..." Evelyn remained dazed.

She studied the glittering ring through misty eyes, emotions swirling within her.

She never expected this proposal now.

It wasn't that she didn't want to marry him, but the obstacles between them seemed insurmountable. She'd resigned herself to a long wait.

Simply living together with Dominic and the twins had been enough - she didn't need titles.

"I've been busy with company matters," Dominic continued, pressing his forehead to hers, "but I'll give you the grandest wedding. I want the world to know you're mine. Evelyn Sinclair, will you marry me?"

His crystal-clear gaze held hers.

The simple question carried his characteristic dominance.

Evelyn's long lashes fluttered as tears spilled over.

Intertwining their fingers, she whispered solemnly, "Yes. As long as we love each other, nothing else matters. I want to be your wife, Dominic Blackwood. To care for you and our children forever."

Though simple, her words moved Dominic deeply. He responded with a passionate kiss.

Sweeping her into his arms, he carried her to their bedroom, pinning her beneath his powerful frame.

Evelyn suddenly remembered. "Alexander and Isabella are still—"

"Not children anymore," Dominic cut her off with another kiss. "They'll go to bed when tired."

'They're five!' Evelyn wanted to argue, but Dominic left no room for protest.

She longed to check on the twins, but Dominic consumed all her attention, showing his love in the most primal way.

Meanwhile downstairs...

"Achoo!" The twins sneezed simultaneously.

Isabella popped the last bite of cake into her mouth, her stomach pleasantly full.

Yawning, she rubbed her eyes. "So yummy, Alex. Wonder if Mommy liked it? I want her bedtime story."

Alexander carefully wiped cream from his sister's face with a wet wipe.

"Daddy and Mommy are making babies now. Probably designing one on the computer. We shouldn't disturb them. Maybe we'll get a sibling soon."

He'd once seen his father pinning his mother down, her face flushed with what looked like pain. When he'd accused Dominic of hurting Evelyn, his father had laughed it off.

His godmother Olivia had awkwardly explained, "That's how your daddy shows love. They're making babies - just like how you and Isabella were made."

"Really, Alex? A new brother or sister?" Isabella asked innocently.

"Mm-hmm. Let's sleep. Maybe they'll be done by morning." Alexander led his sister upstairs.

Passing their parents' locked bedroom door, the precocious boy cast a hopeful glance.

'I hope they make a smart brother, not another airhead like Isabella.'
###Chapter 376

The following day dawned bright and Saturday. After Evelyn and the twins finished breakfast, she prepared to take them to visit their maternal grandfather.

Dominic had intended to join them, but an urgent call from Blackwood Enterprises demanded his immediate attention at headquarters. He promised to meet them for lunch later.

Though Dominic apologized profusely, Evelyn waved it off. Running a multinational corporation came with immense responsibilities that she understood completely.

Sometimes she pitied Dominic. While she enjoyed regular weekends as a salaried employee, he often worked around the clock during busy periods without proper rest.

Dominic arranged for Lawrence, his personal driver, to chauffeur Evelyn and the children to their destination.

Reginald Sinclair resided in an idyllic lakeside community in Nordlong district. Nestled between mountain ranges and the shimmering lake, the neighborhood offered fresh air and breathtaking views. Though removed from city bustle, it boasted comprehensive amenities including a medical center, rehabilitation facility, park, and upscale supermarket.

Dominic had chosen this location specifically - not only for its therapeutic environment ideal for elderly residents, but also for its convenience.

As Evelyn and the twins stepped from the luxury vehicle, they spotted a group of seniors practicing line dancing near the community entrance.

Her grandfather stood among them.

Reginald appeared in excellent spirits, chatting animatedly with his daughter Gwendolyn who walked beside him.

Gwendolyn's gaze caught Evelyn's approach from the corner of her eye.

Evelyn carried several gift bags while guiding two adorable children. Dressed casually with her hair in a simple ponytail and no makeup, her natural beauty still made her stand out in the crowd.

"Grandfather, Aunt Gwendolyn..."

Evelyn greeted them softly, observing her grandfather's vitality contrasting with her aunt's paler complexion.

Gwendolyn gently tugged Reginald's sleeve. "Father, Evelyn and the children have come to visit."

"My granddaughter's here? It's been too long! Let me see if you've lost weight..." Reginald beamed, waving enthusiastically at Evelyn, his eyes brimming with affection.

As Evelyn and the twins approached, her vision blurred seeing her grandfather's full head of silver hair. "Forgive me, Grandfather. Work has kept me away. I'll visit weekly from now on."

"Nonsense, child. I know you're busy making your own way in the world. A phone call would suffice when you can't visit."

His understanding only deepened Evelyn's guilt. She silently vowed to visit more frequently so he wouldn't feel lonely.

"Alexander, Isabella, come meet your Great-Grandfather and Great-Aunt Gwendolyn. Mind your manners."

The twins chorused perfectly: "Good morning, Great-Grandfather and Great-Aunt Gwendolyn. I'm Alexander/Isabella." They completed their greeting with adorable flying kisses.

"Marvelous children!" Reginald's face lit up instantly. Gwendolyn had briefed him about Evelyn's circumstances.

He'd been deeply moved learning how his granddaughter had become a surrogate mother to save her father, while simultaneously feeling tremendous guilt.

Now seeing these bright, beautiful children, Reginald couldn't stop smiling. Seating himself on a bench, he gently cupped their faces with weathered hands. "Such lovely features - just like my Evelyn at their age!"

"Did Mommy look like Isabella when she was little, Great-Grandfather?" Alexander inquired.

"Indeed! Your mother was just as precious - twin braids bouncing, turning heads wherever she went. While other children cried, Evelyn helped with chores. And now her babies are already so grown..."

Reginald's expression softened with nostalgia as he studied the children's resemblance to their mother.

"Shall we go inside, Grandfather?" Evelyn flushed at the praise.

Gwendolyn chuckled at her niece's embarrassment as they assisted Reginald toward the residence.

Fellow exercisers called out greetings: "Reginald! Is this your granddaughter's visit?"

"Yes, this is Evelyn, and these are my great-grandchildren!"

"My, your granddaughter's beautiful! And those children look like little angels! You're blessed, Reginald!"

Wrinkles deepened around Reginald's smiling eyes.

"That handsome gentleman who drove them - your grandson-in-law? Tall, drove that luxury car. Why didn't he come greet you?" inquired one curious elderly friend.

The line-dancing group had witnessed Evelyn and twins emerging from the impressive vehicle, noting the well-dressed man who'd opened their doors before departing.

Though financially comfortable themselves, the neighbors were impressed by the display.

"That was our driver, ma'am. My husband is handling business but will join us for lunch," Evelyn explained.

"Even your driver's so distinguished! Your husband must be extraordinary! Really, Reginald, your fortune shines..."

The family proceeded homeward beneath envious gazes.

The two-story house contained four bedrooms - one for Reginald, another for his caretaker, plus two guest rooms.

Though well-appointed, the home felt slightly desolate with so few occupants.

A framed photograph dominated the living room table - a younger Evelyn with Reginald from years past.

Evelyn's heart clenched.

Her grandfather needed family nearby in his golden years, yet lived here alone.

She'd repeatedly invited him to live with them, but he always declined, insisting he'd disrupt their lives and be a burden.
###Chapter 377

Gwendolyn poured a steaming cup of jasmine tea for Evelyn.

She arranged an assortment of organic snacks for the adorable twins, Alexander and Isabella.

Gwendolyn adored these children with all her heart.

Due to her fragile health, she could never conceive, which remained her deepest regret.

That's why she poured all her maternal affection onto the twins.

Within minutes, the children were giggling and climbing onto their great-aunt's lap.

"Are you settling in well here, Grandfather?" Evelyn settled onto the plush sofa beside Reginald Sinclair.

"This place is paradise compared to our old town. Took some adjusting at first, but now I can't imagine living anywhere else. The gardens are magnificent, the caretakers anticipate my every need, and I've made friends with all the retired gentlemen in the neighborhood. Never thought I'd live to see such luxury. The neighbors keep telling me how fortunate I am to have you, Evelyn." Reginald's voice trembled with emotion.

After decades of hardship, he finally tasted the sweetness of life.

His son Robert had found stable employment as an adult, but his stubborn honesty kept them in poverty.

Robert married twice - each wife worse than the last.

His first wife Beatrice Lockwood was a materialistic social climber who abandoned him when she realized he'd never be rich.

Though selfish, she'd left behind one precious gift - Evelyn.

Victoria Montgomery, the second wife, was even more insufferable. She forbade Robert from visiting his father and banned Reginald and Evelyn from their A City home.

Robert, spineless under his wife's thumb, neglected both his father and daughter for years.

That's how Reginald ended up raising Evelyn alone in that provincial town.

Those years were lean, but Reginald cherished every moment.

He never imagined his granddaughter would blossom into such a remarkable woman - not only securing an enviable position in the city but winning the heart of a man like Dominic Blackwood.

Truly, Reginald wanted for nothing more.

"Don't say such things, Grandfather. Taking care of you is my privilege."

Evelyn retrieved a thick envelope from her designer handbag and pressed it into Reginald's wrinkled hands. "My quarterly bonus just cleared. Take this for your expenses. Let me know if you need more."

Since Reginald only used cash, Evelyn made these regular deliveries.

His bushy eyebrows shot up. "What do I need money for? You've already provided this luxurious retirement. I don't shop, and keeping cash here is just inviting thieves!"

Evelyn chuckled but insisted. "The security here is impenetrable. Besides, you should have spending money when you go out with your friends. Unless you want them thinking I'm a miser who doesn't provide for her own grandfather? Take it or I'll be very cross!"

"Accept your granddaughter's kindness, Father," Gwendolyn called from the floor where she played with the twins.

It was rare to see Evelyn pout like this. Reginald sighed dramatically before tucking the envelope into his breast pocket.

"Fine, but I'm saving this for your future," he grumbled.

Noon approached swiftly.

With the regular caretaker on leave, Evelyn and Gwendolyn took charge of lunch preparations.

Their grocery run had yielded two overflowing bags of premium ingredients.

Evelyn selected organic chicken and heritage-breed pork ribs to prepare a nourishing double-boiled soup for Reginald and Dominic.

As they prepped vegetables in the sunlit kitchen, Gwendolyn offered unsolicited advice. "Evelyn, darling, those twins are precious, but you must formalize things with Dominic. Take it from someone who's been through the wringer - men worship you when they're in love, but become strangers when they fall out of it."

She expertly julienned carrots while continuing. "This world overflows with temptation. Men's affections are fickle - you need legal protections. At least with marriage, you'll walk away with something if things go south."

Gwendolyn gestured at Evelyn's outfit with her knife. "And for heaven's sake, update your wardrobe! You're turning twenty-five next year but dress like a coed. Men are like butterflies - they're drawn to the most vibrant blooms. If you don't cultivate your beauty, you'll wither before you realize it. By then, your butterfly will have fluttered to fresher flowers..."

Gwendolyn maintained immaculate appearances - Evelyn had never seen her without flawless makeup.

Even after her divorce, Gwendolyn carried herself with grace, her complexion always radiant, her style eternally chic.

Evelyn agreed with some points but bristled at others.

Dominic was no common butterfly, and she refused to believe he'd stray.

Still, she understood Gwendolyn's concern - with only Reginald and Evelyn as family, her aunt's protective instincts ran deep.

Evelyn stirred the aromatic soup, inhaling the fragrant steam.

"Don't fret over me, Aunt Gwendolyn. Everything will work out. Speaking of which, how's your health? Have you kept up with your medical appointments?"

Concern laced Evelyn's voice.

Gwendolyn battled cancer, managing it with oral medication since returning from abroad.

Sometimes life felt cruelly unfair - first her father succumbing to cancer, now her aunt fighting the same battle.

"Much improved, actually. I've started naturopathic treatments. The progress is gradual but gentler on my system. But enough about me - we're discussing your future, Evelyn. Clothes can be replaced, wrinkled bills smoothed, but youth and beauty are fleeting."

She wiped her hands on a linen towel. "You're in your prime now, but it'll be too late if you wait until my age to start maintaining yourself. Listen to me - secure that marriage certificate immediately. The wedding festivities can follow later."

Before Evelyn could respond, a rich baritone interrupted from the doorway.

"Our wedding is already in the works, Aunt Gwendolyn. No need for concern - we'll be honored by your presence and blessings when the day arrives."

Evelyn spun around, wooden spoon frozen mid-air.

Dominic stood framed in the kitchen entrance, sunlight from the bay window gilding his porcelain neck a delicate pink beneath his tailored suit.
###Chapter 378

The lunch spread was entirely homemade, yet lavish with various meats, fresh vegetables, and Reginald Sinclair's prized sake.

Dominic had discovered the old man's preferred brand through Evelyn. He'd made a special detour just to procure it.

After placing the rib stew on the table, Evelyn settled beside Dominic.

She ladled some stew into her grandfather's bowl. "Grandfather, I've been teaching myself from cookbooks. Taste it - I hope it meets your standards."

Most dishes were Reginald's favorites, with the remainder being Dominic's preferred selections.

Reginald clapped Dominic's shoulder while praising his granddaughter. "Isn't my Evelyn remarkable? Look at this feast - visually stunning and aromatic enough to make mouths water. You're fortunate to marry her. She's been this capable since childhood, though too kind-hearted for her own good. If anyone wrongs her, she won't retaliate. You'd better treat her right, Dominic!"

Having met Dominic several times, Reginald knew him as the CEO of a multinational corporation. Wealthy yet humble, the young man's respectful demeanor had won the elder's approval.

Yet concerns lingered.

His granddaughter came from modest means while Dominic hailed from privilege. Reginald feared becoming a burden and worried Evelyn might face condescension.

Dominic sat gracefully at the table, his athletic frame relaxed. While discreetly caressing Evelyn's delicate hand, he joked, "Don't worry, Grandfather. Evelyn outranks me in our household."

"She's the one who bullies me daily. Would I dare mistreat her? If anything, I worry I don't spoil her enough!"

"Good lad! Let's drink..."

Reginald's spirits soared. After several rounds, his cheeks flushed crimson with intoxication.

Evelyn swiftly confiscated his cup. "Grandfather, you know alcohol disagrees with you."

Reginald scowled. "I'm celebrating today! I know my limits - a few drinks won't fell me. I want to share more with my grandson-in-law."

Gwendolyn, who'd been serving the twins, frowned. "Father, remember your recent checkup? The doctor insisted you quit drinking. If you collapse, Evelyn will have to nurse you."

The old man slammed his cup down, expression darkening. "Fine! No more drinking! My grandson visits and I can't even share a proper toast?"

Evelyn sighed. Her grandfather's love for liquor remained his stubborn vice.

The twins gaped at their great-grandfather, food forgotten mid-chew.

His tantrum mirrored Reginald Blackwood's exactly!

The elder Blackwood's hypertension restricted his diet, particularly his beloved meats. When Dominic enforced these limits, similar outbursts ensued - much to the children's amusement.

Dominic had mastered handling temperamental elders after managing Reginald Blackwood. The Sinclair patriarch merely resembled an oversized child.

Setting his cup aside elegantly, Dominic smiled. "I drank with a client earlier. This sake's potency overwhelms me. Perhaps another time? Incidentally, my grandfather keeps exquisite red wines in his cellar - flavorful and health-conscious. You could finish an entire bottle without consequence. Unfortunately, I rushed here today and forgot to bring some. Next visit, we'll share a bottle properly. Agreed?"

Reginald's mood improved instantly.

At the promise of future libations, his eyes sparkled. "Next time then - we'll drink properly!"

The meal continued merrily.

Dominic balanced conversing with Reginald while fielding Gwendolyn's probing questions with ease.

Though typically reserved with strangers, Dominic found Reginald's gentle warmth irresistible. This familial atmosphere, so unlike Blackwood Manor's formality, made him crave belonging.

He piled Evelyn's plate high with selections.

"You're too slender, darling. Eat more..." His gaze overflowed with adoration.

The gesture flowed naturally, as if performed countless times.

Both Reginald and Gwendolyn observed closely.

The elder Sinclair recognized genuine devotion in Dominic's treatment of his granddaughter.

Gwendolyn had worried the wealthy man might be temporarily infatuated. Yet Dominic's table behavior confirmed sincere affection.

Still, she remained cautious. Men's love proved fickle - her own husband had once adored her extravagantly before abandoning her completely despite desperate pleas...

She prayed her gentle niece wouldn't suffer similarly.

Post-lunch, Evelyn and Gwendolyn cleaned while Dominic played chess with Reginald.

They stayed for dinner and overnight.

Despite their generational gap, Dominic charmed the elder completely. Even skeptical Gwendolyn eventually conceded he was Evelyn's perfect match.

Morning brought obligations - Dominic to his office, Evelyn to Olivia's hospital care.

Reginald hated seeing them leave but understood their responsibilities. He bid them farewell at the door.

Before departure, Reginald pressed a red envelope into Dominic's hand. "Our family tradition - a grandfather's blessing for his grandson-in-law. You must accept this..."

Dominic froze.

In his corporate career, he'd interacted exclusively with society's elite - greedy, flattering, manipulative individuals all seeking his wealth. He'd given fortunes to such people.

This marked the first time someone offered him money...
###Chapter 379

Dominic Blackwood had never received extra money from his family, not even as a child.

His grandfather Reginald had been strict with him. Margaret Lockwood treated him with open hostility.

Meanwhile, his mother Beatrice was the one constantly asking him for financial support instead.

The envelope in Dominic's hand made his emotions surge unexpectedly.

Though physically light, it carried such emotional weight that his fingers trembled slightly.

Dominic hesitated to accept money from an elderly man, but the gesture held profound meaning. He couldn't refuse.

"Dominic, Grandpa won't let you leave without taking it. It's our family tradition," Evelyn Sinclair murmured, gently squeezing his arm.

She knew her grandfather's stubborn nature all too well.

If Dominic refused the envelope, Old Master Sinclair wouldn't allow their departure.

"Thank you, Grandpa." Dominic's throat felt dry, yet warmth flooded his heart.

"We got envelopes too, Daddy! Great-Grandpa and Great Aunt Gwendolyn gave them to us."

The twins rummaged through their backpacks excitedly.

Moments later, Alexander and Isabella proudly displayed two envelopes each.

Their elders had given them the gifts before bedtime, which they'd forgotten to mention earlier.

Seeing their father receive an envelope triggered their memory.

Dominic fixed his children with a stern look. "Hiding money from me now, are we?"

The twins immediately ducked behind their mother.

Alexander hung his head guiltily while Isabella protested, "We weren't hiding it! We were just tired yesterday and forgot to tell you this morning. Sorry..."

Old Master Sinclair's heart ached seeing the children's fearful reaction.

He comforted them with gentle head pats. "Don't scold them. I insisted they take the envelopes."

The old man adored his great-grandchildren.

"Grandpa, you shouldn't spoil them," Evelyn sighed. "We should get going now. We'll visit whenever possible. Take care of your health. Goodbye, Aunt Gwendolyn..."

After farewells, the family departed.

Old Master Sinclair remained motionless by the doorway, leaning on his cane long after their car disappeared.

Gwendolyn gently tugged his arm. "It's chilly outside. Let's go in."

Supported by his daughter, the old man shuffled inside. "Gwendolyn, do you think Dominic minds the small amount? He's so wealthy," he fretted.

"How much did you give him, Father?" Gwendolyn asked curiously.

"Eight hundred dollars. An auspicious number."

"That's more than enough, Father. It's generous by our hometown standards. The thought matters most, and your grandson-in-law certainly isn't lacking funds."

Dominic could drop eight hundred dollars without blinking - he'd earn a hundred times that amount in the time it took to pick it up.

Yet this envelope symbolized the old man's blessing, making it priceless to him.

"Our Evelyn is fortunate. I've no complaints about Dominic, but his family... Just like you - I warned you against marrying that Japanese man, but you wouldn't listen. Now look..."

Mentioning his daughter's failed marriage deepened the wrinkles on Old Master Sinclair's face.

A flicker of pain crossed Gwendolyn's expression before she composed herself. "Father, Evelyn and I are different. My unhappy marriage doesn't mean hers will be. Dominic is a good man who'll treat her well. Don't worry - she'll be happy with him."

"I pray you're right..." The old man sighed, his stooped shoulders seeming to sag further.

Monday arrived swiftly.

Evelyn plunged into work. The T Corporation-Vivi Group collaboration would break ground after New Year's, requiring her team to brave the cold for site inspections.

Returning to the office around two p.m., Evelyn immediately began preparing her presentation.

Midway through, Bernadette Worthing entered.

She rapped sharply on Evelyn's desk. "Advertising needs extra hands. Come assist immediately."

Evelyn bristled at the interruption but kept her tone polite. "I have pressing deadlines, Madam. Besides, Advertising has more staff than our department. Why the shortage?"

Bernadette looked down her nose at Evelyn's conservative attire.

"When I give an order, you obey. As your superior, I decide your assignments. Celebrity Lillian Prescott is shooting a commercial today - half the company wants to help. She specifically requested you. Cross her, and not even I can protect you!" Bernadette snapped before strutting out.

Evelyn's expression darkened at Lillian's name.

Abigail Thornton threw down her pen. "What's her problem? Plenty of others could help! That Lillian's insufferable - why demand you specifically? Don't go! She can't touch you here."

Evelyn considered briefly. "I'll see what she wants."

Though lacking proof, Evelyn suspected Lillian's involvement in the Blue Honors Persian cat incident.

This confrontation might reveal answers.
###Chapter 380

The T Corporation advertising department buzzed with activity.

The set was meticulously designed for the shoot of their upcoming "Queen" perfume collection commercial. The luxurious fragrance line, set to launch after New Year's, promised intensity and timeless elegance with its signature notes of femininity and seduction.

This campaign's theme? "Obsession."

Evelyn Sinclair stepped onto the chaotic set where everyone moved with purpose.

Lillian Prescott stood center stage in a sheer ensemble, her eyes smoldering with heavy makeup. The crew swarmed around the actress like worker bees tending to their queen.

A brief intermission allowed the makeup artist to retouch Lillian's face before she returned to position.

Joseph Richter, the Oscar-winning director behind "A Beautiful Soul" and "Magic Arrow," adjusted his high-speed camera while barking orders through his headset. "Increase the backlight by twenty percent!"

After the lighting adjustment, he repositioned cameras one and two before announcing, "This take needs to be perfect. I want full cooperation from everyone!"

The crew responded in unison, "Copy that!"

"Action!" Joseph's command snapped the set to attention.

Three cameras simultaneously tracked Lillian's movements as she posed with the perfume bottle. She attempted various seductive positions - reclining on the floor, presenting her back to the camera, partially obscuring her face with her arm - each more awkward than the last.

Evelyn couldn't suppress an eye roll.

Lillian had built her career on an innocent girl-next-door image. This sudden shift to sultry temptress clearly didn't suit her. Every pose came across stiff and unnatural.

"Cut!" Joseph called barely five minutes in.

He fixed Lillian with a disappointed glare. "Ms. Prescott, you're completely missing the mark. Take ten to find your character. This is 'Obsession' - I need regal dominance, not wide-eyed innocence. Figure it out."

Lillian's shoulders slumped under the director's criticism.

She'd given everything to this shoot! Starving herself, practicing poses for hours, enduring this grueling day-long session. Normally her commercials wrapped in one take.

What more did this temperamental director want?

Biting back her frustration, she forced a smile. "Thank you for your guidance, Mr. Richter. I'll do better."

As Lillian retreated, Joseph muttered to his assistant, "She's beautiful but utterly soulless. That performance was wooden. Dominic usually has impeccable taste - why would he choose her as spokesperson?"

The crew flocked to comfort Lillian. An assistant offered water which she accepted with false cheer, silently cursing the director.

No one dared criticize Lillian's acting to her face - her political family connections ensured constant praise despite her mediocre skills. Joseph's blunt assessment stung her pride.

"Ms. Prescott." Evelyn approached calmly. "My department head said you specifically requested my assistance, yet the set appears fully staffed."

Lillian set down her water bottle. "My apologies for interrupting your work, Ms. Sinclair. My primary assistant had an accident at Blue Honors and returned home to recover. The other is on leave. Since we're acquainted, I thought having you nearby might ease my nerves in this unfamiliar environment. Surely you don't mind?"

The flimsy excuse came wrapped in humble sincerity, earning approving nods from nearby crew members. Lillian's political family background contrasted with her seemingly down-to-earth demeanor, making her popular among the staff.

Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes. "It's my privilege to assist you, Ms. Prescott. While this falls outside my design responsibilities, as a T Corporation employee, I follow orders."

Her words carried subtle barbs - this wasn't her job, and Lillian had overstepped by pulling strings to summon her.

Lillian caught the implication.

Her mind flashed to Blue Honors, where her scheme had nearly backfired. Preston Worthington had extorted a fortune from her - money she wouldn't have lost if not for Evelyn.

She'd planned to make Evelyn suffer during this shoot, but the designer's sharp tongue surprised her.

Beneath her polished smile, Lillian seethed. 'This nobody doesn't know her place. I'll break her.'
###Chapter 381

Evelyn Sinclair found herself reduced to Lillian Prescott's personal errand girl.

Fetching water.

Running lines.

Even making coffee runs to the nearby café.

Lillian kept her in constant motion, never allowing a moment's respite.

The actress delivered every request with saccharine politeness—always a soft "please" and feigned helplessness. It was a masterclass in manipulation, ensuring no one could accuse her of diva behavior.

The advertising team exchanged impressed glances. Such humility from a rising star! They assumed Evelyn should feel honored to assist a celebrity.

How many ordinary people got this opportunity?

Evelyn saw through the charade but swallowed her anger.

Crossing Lillian wasn't an option. Not when the actress could complain to her powerful adoptive father, Jonathan Prescott. The last thing Evelyn needed was more trouble for Dominic.

Returning with Lillian's latte, Evelyn positioned herself near the director, observing the next take.

"Cut!" Joseph Richter's frustration mounted with each failed attempt. Evelyn stifled a laugh.

Not out of malice.

Lillian's performance was painfully stiff.

She overplayed her femininity, completely overshadowing the perfume they were meant to showcase.

The worse Joseph's mood grew, the more Lillian floundered—a vicious cycle unfolding.

Her Scandinavian co-model maintained professionalism despite the mounting delays, though irritation flickered across his chiseled features.

In Joseph's decades directing films and commercials, he'd never encountered such a lifeless performer. Lillian was all polished exterior with zero substance.

What should've wrapped by lunch dragged into evening. Joseph's schedule was precious—this waste of time infuriated him.

When quiet laughter reached his ears, he whirled toward the sound, ready to unleash his temper.

Then he saw her.

Joseph's breath caught.

The young woman wore modest office attire that contrasted starkly with her arresting gaze and delicate features.

Youthful innocence blended with undeniable allure—the perfect embodiment of indulgent fantasy.

Squinting at her nametag, Joseph turned to the ad manager. "Wer ist das Mädchen? Is she one of your models?" His German was rapid-fire. "She's perfect for this campaign. Let's replace the current lead."

The manager checked Evelyn's tag. "Ms. Sinclair is from design. Ms. Prescott requested her as a temporary assistant. Replacing our contracted model would be... problematic."

Evelyn's university German served her well. She stepped forward smoothly. "Guten Tag, Herr Richter. Evelyn Sinclair from design. Just assisting Ms. Prescott today."

Her accent was flawless—near-native.

Joseph's blue eyes lit up. Repeating her name like a mantra, he smiled. "Ms. Sinclair, you embody the Queen perfume line. Would you consider a screen test?"

The ad manager gaped. Joseph was notoriously selective. Lillian had years of experience—how could this novice possibly meet his standards?

Evelyn hesitated only a heartbeat before declining. "I'm a designer, Herr Richter. No acting experience."

Joseph waved this off. "Nonsense! You're perfect. Just a quick test—if it doesn't work, no harm done." He snapped his fingers. "Susanna! Prep her immediately."

The makeup artist whisked Evelyn away before she could protest further.

Lillian stood frozen, nails digging into her palms.

This was supposed to be her moment.

She'd summoned Evelyn to humiliate her.

Now the nobody designer was stealing her spotlight? Impossible!

When Evelyn reemerged, the set fell silent.

Her dark waves now cascaded in voluptuous curls. The girl-next-door had transformed into a siren.

Yet the transition felt natural—inevitable.

Evelyn stood poised like royalty, every inch the perfume's namesake queen.
###Chapter 382

Evelyn Sinclair wasn't particularly tall, but her slender frame carried an effortless grace. The pristine white tube dress clung to her curves, exuding both power and sophistication.

Four-inch crystal heels elevated her stature dramatically.

"Magnificent!" Joseph Richter exclaimed, giving Evelyn an enthusiastic thumbs-up.

He noticed her nervous fidgeting. Placing a reassuring hand on her shoulder, he advised, "Acting can be simple or complex, Ms. Sinclair. It's not just about appearance—it's about embodying the character. Pour your soul into it. Think of this as a relaxing getaway, not a commercial shoot."

Evelyn found some comfort in Joseph's words.

This was her first time facing professional cameras.

Completely inexperienced, she felt practically coerced into this situation...

Evelyn wanted Dominic Blackwood's commercial to succeed spectacularly—its impact on product sales would be significant.

Unlike Lillian Prescott, who might deliver mediocre performances but remained a recognizable celebrity... Evelyn was an unknown.

Every fiber of her being resisted stepping onto that set.

The crew quickly resumed positions.

Joseph and his assistant directors simultaneously trained their cameras on Evelyn, her features coming into sharp focus.

"Mr. Richter, I... I can't do this..." Evelyn perched awkwardly on the floral-covered prop, radiating discomfort.

"Just follow my directions and watch for my cues," Joseph instructed firmly.

With no alternative, she leaned against the flower-adorned set piece.

Under the studio lights, the camera captured Evelyn's porcelain complexion in exquisite detail.

Every hesitant smile, each uncertain tilt of her head—while initially awkward—couldn't disguise the vibrant spirit shining through her eyes...

Joseph's eyes widened with excitement. "Yes! Exactly like that! More allure, more enjoyment..."

Initially bewildered under the intense lighting, Evelyn gradually grasped the director's vision.

Her transformation was mesmerizing—a sultry smile directed at the camera electrified the entire crew...

Lillian watched from the sidelines, anticipating Evelyn's humiliation.

As filming progressed, Lillian's expression darkened, her fists clenching until her knuckles whitened.

'That plain Jane Evelyn transforms into this vixen with different clothes?' She seethed internally. 'How does an amateur deliver such a flawless performance?'

On set, Evelyn's toned legs gleamed under the lights.

She reclined effortlessly, spritzing Queen perfume with practiced elegance before inhaling deeply with closed eyes.

Multiple cameras captured her flawless angles.

Delivering her lines with feline grace, Evelyn embodied the perfume's essence—her curves hypnotic, her gaze intoxicating.

Meanwhile, Dominic had entered the studio unnoticed.

The absorbed crew remained unaware of his presence.

When several staff members spotted him and moved to greet him, Dominic silenced them with a finger to his lips.

Lillian's face lit up upon seeing him. "Mr. Blackwood—"

Dominic acknowledged her with a curt nod before dismissing her.

His aristocratic gaze fixed on Evelyn, filled with tender admiration.

More beautiful women existed, but only Evelyn held his fascination.

This rare glimpse of her sensual confidence was like original sin—once experienced, utterly addictive.

Standing awkwardly beside him, Lillian watched Dominic's captivated expression.

Her features twisted with growing hatred...

"God almighty, that girl's natural talent surpasses seasoned actresses," Joseph murmured to his assistant, thoroughly impressed.

Evelyn possessed the rare quality that couldn't be taught—an authentic, soul-deep beauty that John Keats himself would have praised.

"Cut! That's a wrap!" Joseph announced excitedly.

He couldn't believe Evelyn lacked formal training—such raw talent belonged on screen!

Where Lillian performed like a mechanical puppet, Evelyn was organic artistry—intuitively understanding her role with minimal direction.

Only after wrapping did Evelyn notice Dominic's presence.

Approaching him with a self-conscious smile, she asked, "How did I do? This was my first time, but Mr. Richter insisted... I was terrified."

Dominic stroked her styled hair publicly. "Flawless."

"I never expected to discover such phenomenal talent at your company, Mr. Blackwood!" Joseph interjected enthusiastically. "An architect with acting chops like this? Remarkable!"

Turning to Evelyn with professional intensity, Joseph pressed, "Have you considered acting professionally, Ms. Sinclair? With your gifts, I could open doors for you. It'd be criminal to waste such natural ability!"
###Chapter 383

Dominic's brows furrowed at the thought of Evelyn appearing on screen for other men to ogle. The mere idea made his blood boil. "That won't be necessary, Mr. Richter. She's not cut out for show business."

But Joseph Richter persisted. "The young lady has star quality! I could make her an international sensation with just one film!"

Dominic knew the director's reputation was solid. No one in Hollywood had launched more careers than Joseph Richter.

Yet the thought of Evelyn navigating that cutthroat world made his stomach churn. "Ms. Sinclair's passion lies in architecture. She dreams of becoming a renowned designer, not a celebrity."

"Design and acting aren't mutually exclusive," Joseph countered. "She could prioritize films while dabbling in design projects. Many artists successfully balance multiple careers."

When Dominic remained unmoved, Joseph turned directly to Evelyn. "What do you think, Ms. Sinclair? Would you consider a career in entertainment?"

Evelyn offered a polite but firm smile. "I appreciate the generous offer, Mr. Richter, but my heart belongs to design."

Joseph sighed in disappointment, shaking his head. The advertising manager gaped at Evelyn's casual rejection. Most would kill for this opportunity!

Before leaving, Joseph pressed his card into Evelyn's hand. "If you ever change your mind, my door is always open."

"Thank you." Evelyn accepted the card graciously.

Dominic's stony expression made his stance clear - he'd never allow his woman to enter that den of vipers. Evelyn belonged to him alone. No other man deserved to admire her beauty.

"I should finish my presentation," Evelyn suddenly remembered. "May I return to my office?"

Dominic gently tapped her nose. "Don't overwork yourself. We're going home together tonight."

That simple word - "home" - sent warmth flooding through Evelyn's chest. When had she become so integral to Dominic's life? Sharing these mundane routines with him felt unexpectedly precious.

After Evelyn left, Dominic's gaze landed on Lillian Prescott. The actress's usually vibrant face looked pale, her smile strained with barely concealed envy.

She'd expected to star in the Queen perfume commercial - a golden opportunity to network with Joseph Richter while getting closer to Dominic. Instead, Evelyn had stolen both men's attention.

Lillian had never felt so thoroughly defeated.

"Ms. Prescott, I apologize for today's incident," Dominic said smoothly, lighting a cigarette. The flame flickered between his elegant fingers. "Our company will pay triple the termination fee. The fault lies entirely with us - Mr. Richter was simply doing his job exceptionally well. Does this arrangement suit you?"

Lillian studied his handsome features. Though seething inside, she maintained a gracious smile. "Of course, Mr. Blackwood. I wasn't at my best today anyway. I'll reflect on my shortcomings and hope for another collaboration."

Joseph offered some encouragement. "You have striking beauty, Ms. Prescott, but your expressions currently limit you to innocent roles. With more training, I'm sure you'll blossom into a versatile actress."

Lillian's smile turned brittle. If not for this meddling director, she'd still be the perfume model! But she swallowed her resentment. "Thank you for the advice, Mr. Richter. I'll work diligently to improve."

After exchanging pleasantries with Dominic, Joseph departed.

Lillian seized her chance. "Mr. Blackwood!"

Dominic paused, exhaling smoke. "Yes?"

"My birthday is next week. Would you attend my party?" Her voice held desperate hope.

"I avoid social gatherings," Dominic replied coolly. "Crowds and loud celebrations aren't to my taste. But I'll ensure you receive a gift."

Lillian stood frozen as he walked away. Despite the heated room, icy dread crawled up her spine.

"Mr. Blackwood, I..." Her voice cracked.

Dominic turned, one eyebrow raised.

Lillian drank in his aristocratic features - that perfect blend of elegance, power, and untouchable aloofness. He stood mere feet away, yet felt galaxies apart.

No matter how hard she tried, this man remained perpetually out of reach.

But Lillian Prescott didn't earn her reputation by giving up easily. This wasn't over. Not by a long shot.
###Chapter 384

Dominic Blackwood possessed a magnetism that could captivate any woman's soul, yet he maintained a careful distance from Lillian Prescott.

Lillian couldn't comprehend it. She'd given him everything, yet he treated her with such icy detachment.

"Mr. Blackwood..." Lillian bit her lip, her voice dripping with false sweetness.

Her mind flashed back to that night when their bodies had tangled between silk sheets.

Clenching her fists, she asked softly, "That evening at my grandfather's gala... surely you haven't forgotten what happened between us?"

Dominic turned, his cold gaze sweeping over her flushed cheeks. "What exactly are you implying? I spent the entire evening with Evelyn Sinclair. Whatever delusions you're entertaining, let me make this clear - Evelyn is the only woman I've ever loved. That hasn't changed."

He straightened his tie. "While you're at it, inform your mother to cease meddling in my personal affairs. Any further harassment toward Evelyn will have consequences. Now if you'll excuse me, Ms. Prescott, I have actual work to attend to."

Lillian watched Dominic's broad-shouldered silhouette disappear, letting out a bitter laugh.

She wasn't alone. She forced composure.

Dominic claimed he'd been with Evelyn all night at the gala...

Why would he lie? Did that mean the man in her bed hadn't been Dominic after all?

A cold dread gripped her.

Unless... the drug-induced haze had erased his memory of their encounter?

Possible. But something felt terribly wrong.

The situation was spiraling beyond her control.

No. She needed answers.

As Lillian stormed out, the advertising department erupted in whispers.

"Wasn't Lillian Prescott supposedly dating our CEO? Even engagement rumors were floating around. Doesn't look that way now," one employee snickered.

"Clearly Mr. Blackwood only has eyes for Evelyn Sinclair from design. Maybe Lillian's been deluding herself this whole time," another chimed in.

"Remember when she brought him homemade soup? Acting like his girlfriend when he treats her like a stranger..."

"Do you think he'll actually marry that designer? She's pretty, but what else does she have to offer?"

A sharp cough silenced them. The department manager glared. "Unless you'd like to explain to HR why you're gossiping about the CEO instead of working?"

The group scattered instantly.

Back at her agency, Lillian received a call that turned her blood to ice.

"Ms. Prescott? I've uncovered something... explosive. When can we meet?" The private investigator's voice crackled with excitement.

Lillian's phone volume betrayed her. Several actors turned at the mention of classified information.

Heart pounding, she ducked into an empty hallway. "The new bistro near the agency. Thirty minutes."

The bearded investigator slid a thick dossier across the table. Lillian's hands shook as she scanned the contents.

"This... can't be real. You're certain?"

"Ms. Prescott, my reputation depends on accuracy. Why would I risk my career with fabricated documents?"

Page after page confirmed her worst nightmare.

Evelyn Sinclair.

The woman she despised most in the world was actually Jonathan and Genevieve Prescott's biological daughter.

The documents proved Evelyn was the true Prescott heiress.

Everything Lillian possessed - her status, her privilege - had been stolen from Evelyn.

The revelation made her physically ill.

Twenty-five years ago, Jonathan Prescott's political integrity made him enemies. Framed in a smuggling scandal, he'd been taken into federal custody.

That same day, Genevieve suffered complications during premature labor.

With both families under surveillance, only Beatrice Lockwood could assist.

Genevieve lost consciousness from blood loss during delivery. The attending physician saved her life and delivered a healthy girl.

But Beatrice had switched the infant with a stillborn, telling Genevieve her daughter had died.

That stolen child grew up to become Evelyn Sinclair...

Lillian's expression remained calm, but fury twisted inside her like a knife.

She met the investigator's gaze with deadly calm. "I have one more job for you."
###Chapter 385

The private investigator had barely left when Evelyn Sinclair found herself still seated, her gaze fixed on the now-cold cup of coffee before her.

She pinched her arm sharply. The pain was real. Her eyes darted back to the stack of documents on the table. There was no denying it anymore - this nightmare was actually happening.

For years, she'd lived as Genevieve Prescott's beloved daughter. The sole heiress to the Prescott fortune. Never once had she imagined the real Prescott daughter might still be alive... and possibly returning to claim what was rightfully hers.

Dominic Blackwood's face flashed through her mind. She squeezed her eyes shut against the wave of anguish.

Her love for that man ran deeper than the ocean. If only he'd shown her even a fraction of the affection she craved.

Olivia Kensington.

A twisted smile curled Evelyn's lips.

Dominic was utterly obsessed with that nobody from nowhere. If Olivia turned out to be Jonathan and Genevieve's biological daughter... if the truth ever came out... Genevieve would shower all her love and attention on Olivia instead.

She'd be discarded like yesterday's trash.

The thought made Evelyn's blood run cold. "Over my dead body," she whispered viciously.

Prescott Manor.

Evelyn arrived home to find her mother absent from her usual spots. Remembering Genevieve's yoga schedule, she headed straight for the sunlit studio.

There she was - Genevieve Prescott in her element.

Nearly fifty but with the complexion of a woman half her age. Time seemed to have frozen for her flawless beauty.

Dressed in pristine white yoga wear that hugged her toned figure, Genevieve moved through advanced poses with effortless grace.

Evelyn couldn't help but marvel. Without knowing her true age, anyone would assume this elegant noblewoman was barely thirty.

"Mother," Evelyn cooed, her voice dripping with honey. "You're defying time itself. Other women age, but you? You're becoming more radiant by the day."

Genevieve's serene expression softened at the sound of her daughter's voice. "Always knowing just what to say, darling. Rough day at work?"

"Not at all, Mother." Evelyn tucked a stray lock behind her ear. "Actually, I've just been cast as the lead in that medieval fantasy film you loved..."

"My brilliant girl." Genevieve sighed wistfully. "I always dreamed of acting, you know. Seeing you live that dream for me... it's everything."

Evelyn unrolled a mat beside her mother, mirroring her poses. She caught the hopeful glint in Genevieve's eye and pressed her lips together. A shadow crossed her delicate features. "Though... my recent projects haven't been well received. I've disappointed you."

Genevieve pinched her daughter's cheek affectionately. "Nonsense, darling. I have no expectations about your career. Act as long as it brings you joy. When you're ready, you can join the family business. Or simply stay home and let me spoil you rotten."

"You're too good to me, Mother." Evelyn's voice trembled with emotion. "Promise you'll always love me this much?"

"Of course, my precious girl." Genevieve's smile was beatific. "You're my only daughter. Who else would I lavish with love?"

Evelyn nearly blurted out the question burning in her throat: Would you still love me if your real daughter returned?

She swallowed the words like bitter poison.

Rising gracefully, Evelyn produced a silk handkerchief and dabbed at Genevieve's glistening forehead. "You must be parched after your session, Mother. Let me fetch your favorite floral tea."

As Genevieve closed her eyes in relaxation, Evelyn's fingers deftly plucked two loose strands of silver-blonde hair from the yoga mat. She concealed them in her handkerchief with practiced ease.

Her expression darkened as she pocketed the precious strands.

Now she just needed Olivia's DNA sample.

If the test confirmed Olivia was Genevieve's biological daughter...

Then God help you, Olivia Kensington, Evelyn thought with venomous intensity.

T Corporation.

Evelyn had just emailed her presentation to Yvonne Blackwell when she heard retching sounds from the next cubicle.

Abigail Thornton looked positively green. "Are you ill?" Evelyn asked with genuine concern.

"Just... urgh... morning sickness. I'm fine... URK!"

Abigail barely made it to the restroom in time.

Evelyn followed, hovering anxiously outside the stall.

When Abigail emerged, her usually impeccable curls were disheveled, her complexion ashen. Evelyn handed her a tissue. "You should see a doctor."

"Probably just food poisoning," Abigail rasped.

Evelyn frowned. "This looks more serious than indigestion."

Then it hit her - the symptoms were painfully familiar. She'd experienced them herself while pregnant with Alexander and Isabella.

"Abigail..." Evelyn hesitated. "Could you be... pregnant?"

Abigail's bloodshot eyes widened comically. "That's impossible!" Her voice cracked with panic.
###Chapter 386

"I'm not judging you, Abigail, but your symptoms look strikingly similar to what I experienced during my pregnancy." Evelyn lowered her voice. "A woman should always be in control of her health. I strongly suggest you get checked at the hospital."

Evelyn understood the turmoil of an unplanned pregnancy all too well. When she'd carried the twins, she hadn't known Dominic was their father. The memory of those agonizing months still haunted her.

Abigail's fingers trembled as she pressed them to her temples. Fragments of that drunken night at the bar flashed through her mind - the stranger's hands, the hotel room, the morning-after regret. Her stomach churned.

'One night. Just one reckless night. This can't be happening.'

"Evelyn," she whispered urgently, "could you get me a pregnancy test from the pharmacy? And please... nobody can know about this."

"Of course." Evelyn squeezed her hand. "Your secret's safe with me. I'll be back in fifteen minutes."

The evening rush had begun at T Corporation. Employees flooded the lobby, crowding around the regular elevators. In her haste, Evelyn instinctively stepped into the CEO's private lift - the one Dominic always shared with her.

Only when she exited did she notice the stares. The whispers. The envious glances from colleagues.

She didn't have time for office politics now.

The pharmacy shelves stretched before her. Evelyn grabbed two different tests - one strip, one digital. Double confirmation for peace of mind.

On her return, she collided with someone hard. The tests clattered to the floor. Heat rushed to her cheeks as dozens of eyes turned her way.

Strong hands gripped her shoulders. Dominic.

"Mr. Blackwood," she stammered, using their professional address.

His gaze dropped to the pregnancy tests. A slow smile curved his lips. "Evelyn... are we expecting?"

Her pulse skyrocketed. She couldn't betray Abigail's trust, but company policy barred pregnant employees from promotions. This could ruin Abigail's career.

"N-no," she lied, fingers twisting together. "My cycle's been irregular. Just... precautionary."

Dominic's smile turned knowing. "Your last period started on the 8th, darling. It's barely been two weeks. The tests wouldn't be accurate yet."

Evelyn's face burned. He remembered her cycle dates. Of course he did.

"I'm... stocking up for later," she mumbled.

Dominic studied her - the pink flush creeping up her neck, the way she worried her lower lip between her teeth. Evelyn always bit her lip when lying. Just like Isabella.

"Alright," he relented. "But I'll walk you back."

As they moved through the lobby, Evelyn felt like a specimen under microscope. The whispers grew louder.

"Design department's Evelyn Sinclair gets special treatment again..."
"Riding the CEO's private elevator? Must be sleeping her way up..."
"Doesn't even dress well. What does he see in her?"

Dominic's arm tightened around her waist. His expression turned glacial as he scanned the crowd. Immediately, heads ducked, conversations died.

The moment they turned the corner, Evelyn blurted out the truth. "They're for a colleague. I promised confidentiality."

Dominic's demeanor softened. He brushed a strand of hair from her face. "Meet me in the parking garage when you're done."

She nodded and hurried away, the pregnancy tests burning a hole in her pocket.

Behind her, Dominic's gaze turned arctic again. The employees scattered like leaves in winter wind.

'That switch from gentle to terrifying... is this really the same man?' someone whispered.

Nobody dared answer.
###Chapter 387

Evelyn handed the pregnancy tests to Abigail. She waited anxiously outside the restroom instead of leaving.

Abigail's pale complexion worried Evelyn. She couldn't bear to leave her friend alone in this state.

Minutes later, the restroom door creaked open.

Abigail's trembling hand held the pregnancy stick. Her face had turned ghostly white.

Evelyn immediately spotted the two bold red lines.

Her breath caught. "Abby..."

During her time at the company, Evelyn had never heard Abigail mention having a boyfriend.

Abigail proudly called herself a career woman, often declaring she'd never marry or have children.

How could she be pregnant now?

Abigail looked shell-shocked, her usual confidence shattered.

'One drunken mistake. One stupid night. And now this?' Her thoughts spiraled. "I'm really pregnant... My life's over..." Her bitter laugh sounded foreign coming from her normally cheerful lips.

"Who's the father?" Evelyn asked carefully.

Abigail's eyes clouded with confusion. "That night... I was wasted. Didn't even see his face when I bolted in the morning. I... I don't know..."

Evelyn had never seen her strong-willed friend so broken.

She pulled Abigail into a tight embrace. "What's done is done. Now we focus on deciding what comes next."

Abigail steadied herself against Evelyn's shoulder. "I need time to think."

This pregnancy couldn't have come at a worse time.

No father. No relationship. And right when her career was taking off.

T Corporation's policy was clear - no promotions for pregnant employees or new mothers.

Her department head had hinted her name was on the promotion shortlist.

Now this unexpected development threatened everything.

"I'll support whatever you decide," Evelyn said gently. "If you choose termination, I'll go with you. But consider carefully - that baby's innocent, and the procedure carries risks..."

Evelyn's own maternal instincts made her hesitant about abortion.

"I'll think it through," Abigail murmured, pressing a hand to her still-flat stomach.

Regret consumed her - for that reckless night, for not even looking at the man's face.

'What if he's some criminal? Would my child inherit those traits?'

Meanwhile, Dominic left the office building with Sebastian for a business dinner.

Evelyn stayed behind to comfort Abigail.

At eight o'clock, Dominic called.

She headed downstairs to the parking garage.

The day's events weighed on her - the site visit, perfume commercial shoot, Abigail and Olivia's dramas. Exhaustion set in.

In the parking lot, Dominic stood smoking with Sebastian, his expression stern.

The moment he spotted Evelyn approaching, his gaze softened.

She wasn't conventionally stunning, but something about her captivated him - like a ripe peach begging to be tasted.

Sebastian noticed Evelyn's arrival. Her presence seemed to melt Dominic's icy demeanor.

"Ms. Sinclair," Sebastian said, "Mr. Blackwood had too much to drink tonight. I've got urgent business - could you drive? Or shall I call Lawrence?"

Dominic handed her the keys. "Evelyn will drive."

She stared at the gleaming Bugatti Chiron reflecting her wide-eyed expression. 'This costs more than my lifetime earnings!'

Though licensed for years, she rarely drove. Could she handle this beast?

Dominic took a final drag before flicking his cigarette away. "Let's go home."

The alcohol on his breath made her grip the keys tighter. "I'm not... experienced with driving..."

His lips curved. "Consider it practice. I'll buy you a car soon."

"But if I damage this..." Her voice trembled.

"You won't drive it off a cliff, will you?" he teased.

Evelyn shook her head. "But scratches... I couldn't possibly repay—"

Suddenly, Dominic pulled her into his arms.

Her heart skipped.

He toyed with her hair, whispering, "Then you'll just have to repay me with yourself."

Her pulse raced as he lifted her into the driver's seat before settling beside her.

"Relax," he murmured. "It's just metal. Our safety matters more. Drive it like a toy car - I won't blame you for dents."

Evelyn gaped. 'Only a billionaire could say that with a straight face!'
###Chapter 388

The roads were packed during peak hour traffic.

With Dominic's reassuring presence beside her, Evelyn turned the ignition key.

Her hands gripped the steering wheel tightly. Every movement was calculated, terrified of scraping another vehicle—or worse, having someone hit their luxury car.

She failed to notice how every other driver instinctively gave her a wide berth.

A car like this wasn't just expensive—it was a liability. One tiny scratch could bankrupt most people. No one dared risk it.

Despite the congestion, Evelyn managed to keep a steady pace.

Dominic wasn't even watching her. His eyes were closed, his posture relaxed.

The man was perfection—wealthy, powerful, effortlessly handsome. Every woman in the city would kill to be in her position.

She was lucky.

Too lucky.

The thought of Olivia soured her mood. Swallowing her hesitation, she finally spoke. "Dominic... I need to ask you for a favor. I know I shouldn't burden you, but I don't know who else to turn to..."

His sharp gaze shifted to her. "You could never burden me."

Evelyn bit her lip.

Dominic was refined, commanding, used to getting whatever he wanted. Their worlds couldn't be more different.

Yet with her, he was gentle. Patient. She still didn't understand why.

"Olivia's pregnant," she blurted out. "Because of me, Preston targeted her. The doctors said if she loses the baby, she might never conceive again. She wants to keep it, but Preston forced her to..." Her voice cracked. "He's a monster. He hurt her, then took away her child. I want him to pay for what he did!"

The traffic light ahead turned red.

Evelyn slammed the brakes, turning to gauge his reaction.

Dominic's expression was unreadable. He pinched the bridge of his nose, silent. The air in the car grew heavy.

She instantly regretted bringing it up.

"I know it's a lot to ask," she whispered. "Preston is Preston Sr.'s brother, and you two are close. But Olivia's suffering because of me. I can't just—"

Dominic still didn't respond.

Her heart sank. She'd put him in an impossible position.

Then the light turned green.

A horn blared behind them.

Evelyn startled, her foot slipping off the brake. The car lurched forward violently.

Panic seized her. She fumbled for the brakes but lost control—the car veered sharply toward a white BMW.

She screamed.

Everything happened too fast. One second she was bracing for impact, the next Dominic's arm was around her, yanking the wheel hard.

The car swerved, skidding against the guardrail before jerking to a stop.

"Dominic—" Her voice was raw with fear.

His jaw was tight, but they were unharmed—thanks to their seatbelts. Evelyn, however, was ghostly pale, trembling like a leaf.

He cupped her face. "Are you hurt?"

She shook her head, still shell-shocked.

"Scared?" His thumb brushed her cheek. "You're shaking like a rabbit."

She exhaled shakily, pressing a hand to her racing heart. "I—I panicked. If you hadn't reacted so fast..."

Dominic smirked. "The idiot behind us shouldn't have honked. Not your fault."

Evelyn rolled down the window. The bumper was dented, the paint scraped. Her stomach twisted. Repairing this would cost a fortune.

Just then, the BMW driver pulled up beside them.

A slick-haired man leaned out, scowling. "Learn how to drive, morons! You almost totaled my car! You gonna pay for—"

His tirade died the second Dominic's icy glare landed on him.

The man paled. His eyes darted to their license plate—then the custom vanity tag. His bravado evaporated.

Without another word, he sped off.
###Chapter 389

Evelyn felt a pang of guilt for nearly causing that car accident earlier. Her hands still trembled slightly on the steering wheel. She didn’t dare drive another mile—not when their lives were at stake.

But Dominic had been drinking. There was no way he could take the wheel now.

Pulling out her phone, she quickly opened a ride-hailing app to summon a driver.

Dominic watched her with curious amusement.

His brow furrowed slightly when he saw her typing in her contact details. “Will that really get us a driver?”

In his world, either he drove or his chauffeur did. Taxis were foreign to him. Ride-hailing apps? Completely unheard of.

“Of course it will. It’s incredibly convenient. Here, let me show you how it works.” Evelyn flashed him a grin, patiently guiding him through the steps.

Dominic listened quietly, his gaze softening as her voice wrapped around him like warm honey.

Ten minutes later, a driver in his mid-thirties, glasses perched on his nose, pulled up.

The man was efficient. Within thirty-five minutes, they arrived safely at the Blackwood estate.

As soon as they stepped inside, Evelyn headed straight for the shower.

Dominic watched the bathroom door click shut. His jaw tightened.

He shrugged off his coat, pressing a hand to his left arm as he strode toward the study.

A sharp sting shot through him at the pressure.

Rolling up his sleeve, he examined the wound. Blood seeped through the fabric.

He grabbed the first-aid kit from the cabinet, disinfecting the injury with practiced ease.

Next came the topical anesthetic, followed by a clean bandage.

His movements were precise, automatic—as if he’d done this a hundred times before.

Once finished, he stashed the kit away and ducked into the guest bathroom for a quick shower. Changed into pajamas, he returned to the bedroom and sank into the plush mattress.

With Lanie and Isabella visiting Reginald Blackwood, the mansion felt cavernously empty.

Only the two of them remained.

Dominic leaned back against the headboard, flipping open the financial newspaper from the nightstand.

Twenty minutes later, Evelyn emerged, her damp hair cascading over her shoulders.

She tiptoed toward the bed, then launched herself into his arms.

Her elbow grazed his wound. A low groan escaped him before he could stop it.

Evelyn froze.

In a flash, she yanked up his sleeve.

Her breath hitched at the sight of the bloodstained bandage. “You’re hurt? Why didn’t you tell me?”

Dominic tugged his sleeve back down. “It’s nothing. Just a scratch. Already taken care of.”

Her mind flashed back to the crash—how he’d shielded her without hesitation. That wound was because of her.

“Don’t do that again,” she whispered, guilt lacing her voice. “I can handle myself. It kills me seeing you hurt because of me.”

Dominic caught her chin, pressing a kiss to her misty eyes. “You’re mine. Protecting you isn’t optional.”

Before she could protest, he crushed his mouth to hers.

Evelyn tensed, afraid of jostling his injury, but his grip was unrelenting.

Trapped against his chest, she melted into the kiss, his heartbeat steady beneath her palm.

At some point, her clothes vanished. His powerful frame pinned her to the mattress.

They knew each other’s bodies too well. There were no preliminaries.

Evelyn tried to pull away. “Your arm—”

Dominic nipped her earlobe, his voice rough. “Rx, I’m fine.”

Any protest died on her lips.

As she arched beneath him, he murmured against her skin, “Don’t worry about Olivia. It’s complicated, but I’ll handle it.”

Evelyn’s surprise melted into something hotter, fiercer.

The air thickened. The room burned.

It was a night of tangled sheets and whispered promises.

Meanwhile, at the Lockwood residence...

“Miranda, it’s late. Stay the night,” Lorraine urged, squeezing the younger woman’s hand.

She was more than pleased with her distant niece.

Miranda came from a prestigious family, freshly returned with a business degree from abroad. Spoiled? Yes. But Lorraine believed a little willfulness suited a woman.

She’d always dreamed of uniting the Lockwood and Lerche families through marriage.

When the Lerches moved overseas, she’d given up hope.

But now Miranda was back—and Lorraine’s ambitions reignited.

The Lerches were wealthy. An alliance would only benefit the Lockwoods.

More importantly, Miranda might be the one to tame her unruly son.

Ever since Maxwell met Evelyn, his life had spiraled.

Then Dominic Blackwood severed ties, demanding Maxwell divorce Evelyn immediately. The fallout nearly bankrupted Lockwood Corporation.

Even after the divorce, the damage was done. The company was a shell of its former self.

Lorraine had a plan.

She saw the way Miranda looked at Maxwell. If she could orchestrate their marriage, it might just save Lockwood Corporation.

Miranda hid a smirk. “Thank you, Aunt Lorraine. I’d love to stay. I’ve missed you terribly.”

Her tone was sweet, but her mind raced with possibilities.

This was exactly where she wanted to be.
###Chapter 390

Miranda's eyes darted around the room, searching for any sign of Maxwell.

"Aunt Lorraine, why hasn't Cousin Maxwell come home yet?" Miranda asked, her voice laced with impatience.

Lorraine let out an exaggerated sigh. "Lockwood Enterprises is drowning in debt. Your cousin leaves at dawn and returns at midnight just to keep the company afloat. There's no other choice..."

"Don't worry, Aunt Lorraine. When I go home, I'll convince my father and brother to provide financial support. That should solve Lockwood's problems." Miranda said, eager to win her favor.

Though Miranda had majored in business administration, her degree had been bought with her family's money. She knew nothing of corporate deception or ruthless negotiations.

Her father and brother had spoiled her rotten, making her believe a simple request would be enough to secure millions for Lockwood.

"What a sweet girl. Any man would be lucky to marry you."

As they spoke, Maxwell stormed in, reeking of alcohol and radiating hostility.

His sculpted frame and sharp features looked even more striking under the chandelier's glow.

"You're back!" Miranda sprang up the moment she heard the door, rushing to greet him.

Maxwell's face darkened at the sight of her. "Why is she here, Mother?"

He despised his vain, shallow cousin. His dislike had only grown after the incident at Blue Honors, where she'd humiliated him in front of Evelyn.

Ignoring Miranda's adoring gaze, he grabbed a glass from the table and gulped down water.

"Is that any way to speak to your cousin? She came all this way to visit, and this is how you treat her?"

Lorraine scowled at her son's indifference. "Drinking again? How many times must I tell you to spend time with Miranda? She just returned from abroad! Are you trying to upset me?"

Her nagging ignited Maxwell's temper. In a rage, he kicked the coffee table.

The teapot shattered on the floor, scattering shards across the room.

Lorraine's brows furrowed. "Have you lost your mind? Do you even care about your mother?"

"All I want is peace! Stop suffocating me!" Maxwell gripped his hair, collapsing onto the sofa in despair.

His voice carried a dangerous edge of suppressed fury.

Though divorced from Evelyn, her ghost haunted him relentlessly. Work and alcohol brought no relief—only a gnawing, hopeless craving.

The more unattainable she became, the more he wanted her.

Lorraine sighed as the maid cleaned the mess. "You've always been this way—throwing tantrums like a child. If your father were here, you'd be at each other's throats again... Talk to me, or confide in Miranda. She's your age—"

Miranda knelt before him. "Maxwell, is it work? Your mother mentioned Lockwood's financial troubles, but I can—"

"Enough."

Maxwell stood abruptly, shrugging his coat back on. His voice was rough with exhaustion. "I'm going out. Don't wait up."

"Where? You just got home! Are you meeting those useless friends again?" Lorraine shouted.

Miranda blocked his path. "You're staying! I'm sleeping here tonight, and you're keeping me company!"

Maxwell shoved her aside with a look of disgust.

She landed on the plush couch, unharmed but dizzy from the force.

Before she could react, the front door slammed. Tires screeched outside.

Miranda scrambled up, only to see taillights vanishing down the driveway. She burst into tears in Lorraine's arms.

The next morning, Evelyn noted Abigail's improved complexion with relief.

But the project loomed over her like a storm cloud.

Not only was it high-pressure, but also technically demanding. She doubted Abigail could handle it while pregnant.

If word got out about the pregnancy during her promotion review, the backlash would be brutal.

Abigail sensed her concern. "I'm keeping the baby, so I'll let fate decide. Evelyn, I've requested a transfer due to my condition. Another colleague will take my place. Make sure the team excels—don't let Vivi Group look down on us."

"I won't let you down." Evelyn nodded.

Abigail handed her a gray flash drive. "This contains everything—construction engineering, surveying, modern renovation case studies. It's all here."

Evelyn accepted it gratefully. "Thank you. I don't know how to repay you."

Office politics bred cutthroat competition. Colleagues rarely shared resources so selflessly.

Abigail's generosity overwhelmed her.

"You're the best colleague I've ever had." Abigail smiled. "The drive is password-protected. I'll text it to you later."
###Chapter 391

Abigail Thornton had spent years navigating office politics, but Evelyn Sinclair was a rare find—a colleague who stayed clear of workplace drama. That alone earned Evelyn Abigail's respect.

Their conversation was interrupted when Vivienne Laurent, the design department head, approached.

Vivienne's eyes locked onto Evelyn's with unreadable amusement. "Abigail, given your...condition, it's best you remain in the office. Evelyn, you'll be taking Abigail's place on the Vivi Group collaboration. Let's work well together," she declared, satisfaction dripping from every word.

After Abigail voluntarily stepped back from the project, Vivienne had seized the opportunity to insert herself.

Evelyn forced a polite smile. "It's an honor to collaborate with the department head."

The truth? She'd rather work with a nest of vipers. But some battles weren't hers to fight.

Vivienne sniffed. "Where's the proposal and budget report? I expect them in my inbox by end of day."

Evelyn's brow furrowed. "The report covers executive summaries, blueprints, equipment lists, capital estimates, material costs, and construction timelines. Rushing it risks errors—and potential accidents. Are you prepared to shoulder that responsibility?"

Vivienne's glare could have melted steel. "Just get it done. Unless you enjoy being the office mascot?"

Once Vivienne stalked off, Abigail wheeled her chair closer. "This is your moment, Evelyn. Nail this project, and you're looking at a promotion. That woman's drunk on power—time to cut her down to size." She lowered her voice. "Rumor has it the project bonus pool hits seven figures. Top performer bags half a million."

"Half a million?" Evelyn barely stifled her gasp.

"Finance department gossip. Keep it quiet." Abigail winked. "Consider it motivation."

The number lit a fire in Evelyn's veins.

Dominic Blackwood was wealthy, but she refused to be dependent. She wasn't some clinging vine—she'd stand tall as his equal, roots entwined but branches reaching equally for the sun.

The thought sent determination coursing through her.

Abigail excused herself to the restroom, where she collided with a solid chest outside the men's room.

Strong hands steadied her as she stumbled back, instinctively cradling her stomach.

Sebastian Whitmore's gold-rimmed glasses glinted as he smirked. "Running from ghosts, Ms. Thornton?"

Something about her tugged at his memory—the scent of her perfume, maybe. It reminded him of that hazy night with a woman whose face he'd never seen, only to wake to stained sheets and an empty bed.

His search had turned up nothing. Until now.

"Release me, Mr. Whitmore." Abigail's voice was ice.

Sebastian blinked at her hostility but let go. She shoved past him, shoulder-checking him for good measure.

Infuriating woman, he thought. All that fire wrapped in silk.

——

After work, Evelyn collected Alexander and Isabella from kindergarten.

Isabella launched into her arms like a jubilant firework. "Mommy! Guess what? I made the city art finals!"

Evelyn kissed her forehead. "My brilliant girl! But remember—stay humble."

Isabella pouted. "Alexander's in three finals! Art, speech, and piano. Oliver Kensington made it too. Ugh—he's the worst."

She omitted that Oliver and Alexander had tied in every preliminary. In her eyes, the braid-pulling menace couldn't hold a candle to her brother.

Evelyn smoothed her daughter's flyaway curls. "Oliver's talented too. Play fair, sweetheart."

Alexander stood straighter under his mother's gaze, the sunset gilding his proud silhouette. Parents whispered as they passed—this boy was destined for greatness.

Evelyn kissed his cheek. "You're both my pride. Whatever place you take, trying your best is what matters."

Alexander's jaw set. "First prize is cash. I'll buy gifts for you and Dad. The rest can help so you don't work so hard."

Her heart clenched. At six, he shouldn't bear such burdens.

"Let's both work hard—you on your competitions, me on my project. Deal?"

Isabella pumped her fist. "I'll crush Oliver! Or Alexander will!"

——

Weeks passed in a blur of deadlines and competition prep.

Olivia Kensington returned to work, gaunt but determined. Abigail battled morning sickness while colleagues whispered about her mysterious pregnancy.

Evelyn's rapport with Dominic deepened.

Then catastrophe struck T Corporation—shattering Evelyn's hard-won peace.
###Chapter 392

The tragedy unfolded like this.

Two years prior, a subsidiary under Blackwood Enterprises had developed a luxury residential complex named Emerald Heights. A devastating fire broke out in the penthouse unit owned by businessman Gregory Sinclair, claiming the lives of his wife and their six-year-old son.

The arsonist was swiftly apprehended - the family's live-in nanny, Josephine Blackwood.

Josephine had grown increasingly greedy, unable to resist the temptation of valuables in the Sinclair household. Initially, she stole Margaret Sinclair's jewelry undetected. But during her latest theft, she was caught red-handed.

Margaret, known for her fiery temper, threatened to report her to authorities.

Terrified of imprisonment, Josephine set the penthouse ablaze, attempting to destroy all evidence of her crimes...

The horrific incident immediately became media fodder.

Every major news network and publication condemned Josephine's actions while public outrage turned toward Blackwood Enterprises. Unverified reports claimed fire trucks faced multiple obstacles - illegal green belts blocking access roads, the building's excessive height, and critically deficient fire safety systems compounded by negligent property management. These factors allegedly delayed firefighters from reaching the mother and child in time.

With Blackwood's influence, the scandal could have been contained if handled immediately.

But the subsidiary's manager, fearing repercussions, attempted damage control independently. They issued their own press release while delaying reports to corporate headquarters. Their efforts proved futile as media outlets nationwide picked up the story.

Public interest skyrocketed. The incident trended across social platforms, spiraling beyond containment.

Outraged netizens rallied behind Gregory Sinclair, vilifying Blackwood Enterprises.

Emerald Heights residents panicked about safety standards. News channels showed refund demands and homeowner protests becoming frequent occurrences.

Blackwood's stock prices plummeted dramatically...

At midnight, Evelyn emerged from her shower to find Dominic's study light still on.

He remained buried in work.

Her heart ached for him.

While her design projects gave her headaches, Dominic managed a multinational corporation - exhausting enough without this arson scandal.

She understood his turmoil.

The man had fought for everything. Born as the Crawford family's illegitimate child, his childhood was marked by abandonment and depression. Even after being reclaimed by the Crawfords, he faced endless family scandals. Through sheer determination, he resurrected a failing company into an empire within years. No one knew the sacrifices behind his success.

Before meeting him, Evelyn recalled reading about Dominic in a financial magazine featuring remarkable corporate turnarounds. Blackwood Enterprises topped the list.

Back then, not yet thirty, he'd already become one of the continent's wealthiest individuals.

With a heavy heart, Evelyn poured Dominic a glass of milk and headed toward the study.

Ring ring...

The landline's shrill tone interrupted her.

An unknown number flashed. Hesitant, she answered.

"Dominic?" Beatrice Lockwood's voice crackled through.

"Aunt..." Evelyn forced the greeting.

Hearing Evelyn's voice, Beatrice suppressed her irritation. "Put my son on the phone!"

Evelyn doubted maternal concern motivated this late call. She refused to distract Dominic from work.

"He's showering. The company crisis has exhausted him. Could you call tomorrow?"

"Who do you think you are?" Beatrice exploded. "How dare you block me from speaking to my own son? Evelyn, don't think Dominic's protection gives you license to disrespect elders! Connect me now!"

"If it's not urgent, I'm hanging up. Call tomorrow." Evelyn disconnected, ignoring the insults.

She'd long accepted Beatrice's disdain wouldn't change. No point hoping otherwise.

Shaking off the unpleasantness, she carried the milk toward the study.

The door stood slightly ajar.

Inside, Dominic worked intently. His phone lit up - Lillian Prescott calling.

Evelyn answered silently.

"Mr. Blackwood?" Lillian's saccharine yet anxious voice floated through. "Are you busy?"

Hearing only breathing, Lillian continued softly, "I've analyzed the incident reports thoroughly. The nanny's solely at fault. Public shouldn't blame Blackwood Enterprises. Do you... need assistance? My father could intervene. With his influence, matters would resolve much smoother..."

Evelyn's grip on the phone tightened.

As the Provincial Committee Secretary's daughter, Lillian possessed formidable connections. Her family could easily contain such scandals.

But selfishly, Evelyn wanted no contact between them.

Any woman would feel threatened by such a powerful rival coveting her man.

Moreover, Jonathan Prescott's involvement would complicate matters. Dominic would owe an unquantifiable debt - financial obligations were simple, but favors from politicians? Entirely different.

Evelyn remained eerily calm.

She caught Dominic's attention, handed him the phone. "Lillian's calling."

Dominic took it coldly. "What is it, Ms. Prescott? I'm exhausted. Unless urgent, I'm retiring with my wife."

Lillian's disappointment was palpable as the line went dead...
###Chapter 393

Evelyn's fingers trembled as she slammed the phone down.

The moment the call ended, Beatrice immediately dialed Dominic's number.

Dominic answered with visible exhaustion. "What now, Mother? Why are you calling at this hour?"

Beatrice's voice turned urgent. "Did Lillian contact you? Listen, with the Prescott family's influence, handling the Greenview Regalia fire investigation would be—"

"I don't need Lillian's help," Dominic interrupted sharply. "And I've made my position clear. There will never be anything between us. If that's all, I'm hanging up. My fiancée wouldn't appreciate this conversation."

The line went dead before Beatrice could respond.

Beatrice clutched her phone, humiliation burning her cheeks. She'd deliberately called knowing Evelyn was present, never expecting her son to publicly reject her matchmaking attempts.

Meanwhile, Evelyn stood frozen, stunned by Dominic's blunt dismissal of his mother's interference.

A small warmth bloomed in her chest despite the tension. At least Beatrice couldn't manipulate Dominic like she'd hoped.

Evelyn handed Dominic a steaming mug. "You've been working nonstop. Drink this." She hesitated before adding, "Though... having Lillian's connections might actually—"

Dominic's hand froze mid-reach. The temperature in the room seemed to drop instantly.

His stormy gaze locked onto hers. "Excuse me?"

Evelyn's pulse quickened under his dangerous stare. Those obsidian eyes held her captive, dark and fathomless as midnight.

She hastily set the mug down.

In one fluid motion, Dominic pinned her against the wall, his arms caging her in. "Do you doubt me?" His breath fanned across her lips.

The air between them crackled with tension.

"Never." Evelyn met his gaze unflinchingly. "I believe in you completely."

Dominic's expression softened slightly. "Good." His thumb traced her jawline. "Don't ever suggest I need another woman's help again."

"Okay."

"Now apologize properly."

Evelyn blinked up at him. "How?"

His lips curved. "Kiss me."

Standing on tiptoes, she barely reached his mouth, pressing a chaste kiss against his lips.

Dominic frowned. "That's not nearly enough." His voice dropped to a husky whisper. "Show me what I taught you."

Flushing, Evelyn wound her arms around his neck. This time, she parted his lips with hers, her tongue sliding tentatively against his.

Dominic's control shattered.

For that stolen moment, the world outside ceased to exist.

At dawn, Evelyn awoke to cold sheets. Dominic had already left for the office.

By eight, she descended the stairs—only to freeze at the sight of Beatrice waiting in the parlor.

Beatrice's lip curled. "Finally decided to wake up? My son's been working since sunrise while you laze about. Pathetic."

Evelyn forced a neutral expression. "I'm heading to work now."

"Tell Dominic his grandfather demands his presence tonight." Beatrice's eyes raked over Evelyn with disdain. "Though I suppose as a mere employee, you wouldn't understand family obligations."

The barb struck deep. Evelyn turned to leave.

Beatrice wasn't finished. "Lillian's touring internationally next month. She offered to introduce Dominic to European investors." A cruel smile twisted her lips. "Real partners, not gold-digging secretaries."

Evelyn whirled around. "Funny—Dominic seems quite content with this gold-digger. We're trying for another baby next year."

Beatrice's face purpled with rage. "You shameless—"

"Takes one to know one." Evelyn grabbed her purse. "I believe you only married into the Blackwoods after getting pregnant?"

Beatrice lunged, hand raised.

Evelyn sidestepped gracefully. "Office hours await. Do see yourself out."

The door clicked shut behind her, leaving Beatrice trembling with impotent fury.
###Chapter 394

Evelyn Sinclair had just stepped into T Corporation's lobby when panicked shouts erupted. "Oh God! Someone's about to jump from Building C's rooftop! It's Gregory Sinclair, that businessman! Somebody do something!"

Her face drained of color instantly. She moved to follow the crowd, but then spotted Dominic.

"Mr. Blackwood, that businessman Gregory Sinclair is threatening to jump from Building C right now..." The words tumbled out before she could think.

Dominic seized Evelyn's wrist with iron determination. "I know everything. Stay here. I'll handle this."

He couldn't risk Gregory harming anyone in his distraught state - especially not Evelyn.

"I won't interfere. But we need to go now before it's too late," she insisted.

Seeing no time to argue, Dominic reluctantly pulled her along.

T Corporation's four buildings stood in a quad formation. While Dominic's office occupied Building A, the crisis unfolded at Building C - thankfully just a short distance away.

The scene below Building C resembled a media circus. Reporters with telephoto lenses jostled for position beside police barricades, while firefighters inflated a safety airbag.

Dominic whisked Evelyn into the private executive elevator, ascending straight to the rooftop.

Gregory Sinclair looked every bit the broken man. The once-distinguished businessman now sat slumped on the ledge, his unkempt beard and hollow eyes telling the story of a man who'd lost everything - his wife and child perished in the Greenview Regalia fire.

"Bring me Dominic Blackwood!" Gregory's voice cracked with raw anguish. "Where is he? I want to see him now!"

Seeing Gregory sway dangerously, Evelyn instinctively moved forward. Dominic yanked her back. "Remember your promise. This is my responsibility."

Tiny beads of sweat dotted Evelyn's forehead. "We can't reason with him like this! One wrong move and he'll fall! Let me talk him down first—"

"I'll go." Dominic's tone brooked no argument.

Evelyn reluctantly stepped back as Dominic approached the ledge. T Corporation employees visibly relaxed at his arrival.

"Mr. Sinclair! Mr. Blackwood is here now! Whatever you need to say, you can tell him directly!" they called out. "Please come down from there!"

At Dominic's appearance, Gregory grew more agitated, scooting perilously closer to the edge. A collective gasp rose from the crowd.

"You heartless monster!" Gregory's voice broke with sobs. "I paid millions for your 'luxury' Greenview apartments! Faulty fire systems... incompetent management... They're all dead because of you! Since you destroyed my family, I'll destroy your reputation!"

Dominic's response came ice-cold. "Jump if you want. The media will feast on your corpse for a day. I'll weather the storm. But you? You'll just be another suicide statistic. Your family's killers will walk free while you rot in the ground."

Evelyn's hands flew to her mouth. Was Dominic actually encouraging him?

Gregory teetered on the edge, literally and emotionally. Evelyn couldn't stay silent.

"Mr. Sinclair, please!" she called gently. "Your wife and child would want you to live! Come down so we can find who really caused the fire together!"

Dominic cut in sharply. "Ms. Sinclair, this isn't your decision to make."

The tension between them crackled like live wires. T Corporation staff exchanged confused glances - why were their CEO and this woman arguing when a man's life hung in the balance?

In the distraction, security moved to grab Gregory. The sudden movement startled him. With a terrified scream, he lost his balance—

Evelyn reacted without thinking. She lunged forward, grasping Gregory's flailing arm at the last possible second. But his dead weight dragged her over the ledge with him—
###Chapter 395

"Evelyn!" Dominic's voice was raw with terror.

His pupils contracted in sheer panic.

At the last possible second, by some miracle, Dominic lunged forward and seized Evelyn's ankle.

She dangled upside down in the open air, her dark hair whipping wildly in the wind.

The strands obscured her delicate face, now ghostly pale from shock.

One glance downward sent her stomach lurching. The ground yawned a thousand feet below. Heights had always paralyzed her, and now, vertigo threatened to swallow her whole.

Trembling violently, Evelyn still clung to Gregory's arm with desperate strength.

"Hold on, Evelyn! I've got you!" Dominic's hands shook as badly as hers.

The moment he'd seen her dragged toward the edge, his heart had stopped. His lungs had seized.

Thank God he'd caught her in time.

T Corporation employees rushed forward. Sebastian and Gregory Peterson grabbed her other leg while several male colleagues seized her coat, hauling her back from the brink.

"Dominic Blackwood, you bloodsucking tycoon! You destroyed my family!" Gregory's voice was a broken snarl. "If I'm dying today, I'm taking someone with me!"

His eyes burned with pure hatred as they locked onto Dominic.

Dominic, usually the picture of icy control, was unraveling. This reckless fool had pushed him past his limits.

"How dare you, Gregory!" he roared. "I was willing to compensate you fairly for your loss! But this? This is insanity!"

Gregory's breathing turned ragged at Dominic's words. His resolve wavered.

He'd never intended to drag an innocent into his demise.

But what choice did he have? A businessman like him stood no chance against Dominic's empire. Despair had left him only one exit.

The memory of his wife and child twisted like a knife. "If there's any justice, a profiteer like you will rot in hell!" he spat. "I'll die today just to ruin you!"

With that, he began prying Evelyn's fingers from his wrist. She fought to keep her grip, but his arm slipped inexorably from her grasp.

Realization dawned on Evelyn's face, draining what little color remained.

"Mr. Sinclair, listen to me!" she pleaded. "Life has lows, but it has highs too! Dying solves nothing! Your wife and child deserve justice—don't you want to see their killer punished?"

Her voice turned urgent. "Do you think death ends the pain? What about your parents? They've already buried their daughter-in-law and grandchild. Must they bury you too? Stay alive, Mr. Sinclair. Only then can you honor them!"

Dominic saw Gregory hesitate, swayed by Evelyn's words.

His tone turned razor-sharp. "Mr. Sinclair, while I despise your methods, T Corporation will take responsibility. Name your terms—within reason."

Gregory's wild eyes flickered with doubt. "You swear it, Blackwood? Even if I demand that nanny's execution?"

"Done," Dominic said without hesitation. "As long as you live, I guarantee you'll watch her hang."

The promise defused Gregory's frenzy. Seizing the moment, Dominic and the others hauled both Evelyn and Gregory to safety.

The second Evelyn's feet touched solid ground, Dominic dragged her away from the crowd.

His expression was thunderous. Evelyn shot Sebastian and Abigail a helpless look, but they could only offer pitying shrugs.

Trapped, she let Dominic pull her into the nearest top-floor room.

The door slammed shut behind them.

Evelyn knew why he was furious—she'd nearly died. She moved to embrace him.

He shoved her away.

His arm rose, hand poised to strike.

Evelyn flinched, eyes squeezing shut.

Would he hit her for risking herself?

But the blow never landed. Instead, a deafening crack echoed as Dominic's fist smashed into the wall beside her head.

When she dared to look, his knuckles were split and bleeding. His entire body trembled, his eyes bloodshot with fury and fear.

The sight gutted her.

Dominic should've been relieved she'd survived.

But he couldn't control the terror choking him.

His woman had almost died.

If he'd been a second slower, she'd have been a broken corpse on the pavement below. For the first time in his life, he'd tasted powerlessness.

Evelyn wrapped her arms around his waist, holding him tight.
###Chapter 396

Evelyn pressed her cheek against Dominic's solid chest, murmuring apologies into his shirt. "Dominic, I'm so sorry... I just wanted to save Mr. Gregory. I never imagined things would turn so dangerous. I promise I'll never act so recklessly again, please don't be angry."

"Who do you think you are?" Dominic's voice was dangerously low. "Some kind of superhero? You can't even protect yourself properly, yet you rushed into danger without a second thought. Are you completely foolish? Do you have any idea how close you came to dying? The moment you fell..." His voice cracked, eyes burning crimson.

Only heaven knew the sheer terror that had gripped him when she'd slipped from that ledge.

At that moment, the only thing that could have calmed his rage was seeing Gregory Sinclair's blood on his hands.

"I didn't mean to put myself in danger. It was life or death - one second's hesitation and an innocent man would have been lost." Evelyn's voice trembled as she burrowed deeper into his embrace. "I swear I'll never do anything so stupid again. My arms hurt..."

Instantly, Dominic's attention shifted.

His hands shook slightly as he gently examined her arms, voice rough with emotion. "Where does it hurt? Show me."

Rolling up her sleeve revealed angry red marks circling her delicate wrists. Dominic's expression darkened at the sight - injuries sustained when she'd clung to Gregory. The sight made his chest constrict painfully.

If she couldn't even protect herself, what madness had driven her to play the hero?

Dominic's jaw tightened. Without a word, he scooped Evelyn into his arms and carried her toward the executive offices in Tower C.

Evelyn peeked at Dominic's stormy expression and wisely kept silent, curling into his chest like a chastened child.

The moment they entered the CEO's suite, a flustered assistant rushed forward. "Mr. Blackwood, Mr. Sinclair has been stabilized but remains emotionally distraught. He's demanding to see you—"

"Get him out of my sight!" Dominic's roar made the assistant jump. Never had anyone seen the usually composed CEO lose his temper so completely. The woman fled without another word.

Dominic deposited Evelyn onto the plush sofa before retrieving the first aid kit. His movements were precise as he applied antiseptic and bandages to her abused wrists.

Studying his expression, Evelyn ventured a timid whisper when he seemed calmer. "Dominic... could you say something? You're frightening me."

His response was a searing kiss that bordered on violent - more punishment than affection. Teeth scraped her lips until she whimpered, tears springing to her eyes.

When he finally pulled away, Evelyn's lips bore the faint coppery taste of blood.

His punishments always carried this dark, sensual edge.

Evelyn blinked up at him with wounded eyes, which only seemed to incense Dominic further. She was the one who'd acted recklessly, yet somehow he ended up feeling like the villain.

A sharp knock interrupted them. "Mr. Blackwood, the press, police, and Gregory's family are gathered downstairs..."

Dominic knew this wasn't the time for recklessness. With one last glance at Evelyn's pale face, he instructed Sebastian, "Contact Dr. Julian. Have him examine Evelyn for any other injuries."

Knowing her aversion to hospitals, Dominic preferred having their family physician assess her. Besides his medical expertise, Dr. Julian held a psychology degree - essential after today's trauma.

"Right away, sir," Sebastian nodded.

Dominic pressed a kiss to Evelyn's forehead. "Stay here. Don't move until I return."

Evelyn nodded obediently, watching his retreating form with anxious eyes. Drawing back the curtains, she surveyed the chaos below. Though she trusted Dominic's capabilities completely, unease still coiled in her stomach.

Outside T Corporation's headquarters...

Dominic emerged to a sea of flashing cameras, surrounded by bodyguards in dark suits. Reporters shouted questions while Gregory's brother and sister-in-law played the grieving relatives for the cameras.

"My brother's family burned alive because of T Corporation's negligence!" the man wailed dramatically. "And now they've driven him to suicide! Dominic Blackwood's crimes cannot go unpunished!"

Spotting Dominic, reporters surged forward like sharks scenting blood.

"Mr. Blackwood! When will T Corporation take responsibility for the Greenview Regalia fire?"
"Is it true safety systems were merely decorative installations?"
"Can you guarantee your newer developments like Grace Bay meet actual safety standards?"

Dominic stood unwavering, his icy composure cutting through the hysteria. Taking the offered microphone, his voice carried absolute authority.

"The Greenview Regalia tragedy is indeed regrettable. As CEO, I acknowledge shortcomings in our oversight." His piercing gaze silenced the crowd. "I give my word - the victims' families will receive full accountability."

"As for Mr. Sinclair's actions today..."
###Chapter 397

At the Prescott family mansion, Lillian had nothing planned for the day.

Jonathan and Genevieve were occupied elsewhere, and the housekeeper had returned to her hometown for the holidays. The grand estate felt eerily empty with only Lillian present.

Too lazy to cook, she grabbed a box of instant macaroni from the pantry and tossed it into the microwave.

As she ate, she flipped through TV channels, skimming past gossip shows before landing on a particular network.

Her new period drama was premiering tonight.

The program hadn’t started yet, so she idly watched commercials until breaking news flashed across the screen—a live report on the arson case.

A reporter stood outside T Corporation’s headquarters, microphone in hand. "Hundreds of journalists have gathered here, demanding answers about the Greenview Regalia tragedy. Earlier this morning, victim Gregory Sinclair attempted suicide by jumping from a building. Sources claim this was due to relentless pressure from T Corporation. We urge Mr. Blackwood to address these allegations—"

Lillian’s fork froze midair.

The screen was crowded, but her gaze instantly locked onto the man at the center.

Dominic Blackwood.

Even under the harsh sunlight, he stood out effortlessly—his chiseled features glowing, his presence commanding. Amid the chaos, he remained composed, untouchable.

She watched, mesmerized.

This was her chance. If T Corporation crumbled under scandal, she could finally get close to him.

The reporters hurled sharp questions, cameras flashing.

Dominic faced them, his voice steady. "Mr. Sinclair’s actions today were tragic, and we deeply regret his suffering. T Corporation extends our sincerest apologies to his family."

A calculated move—shifting blame onto himself. The crowd quieted momentarily.

Then Gregory’s brother erupted. "Lies! My brother was threatened into this! You destroyed evidence, silenced us online—what kind of monster does that?"

The media frenzy reignited.

Dominic didn’t flinch. "T Corporation prioritizes safety above all. If any misconduct occurred, we will investigate and hold those responsible accountable. Compensation will exceed legal requirements, and all proceedings will be transparent."

His tone turned steely. "But if false narratives continue, we will pursue legal action."

The reporters fell silent. His response was flawless.

Lillian’s appetite vanished.

Dominic’s composure was infuriating. How could she exploit this if he remained unshaken?

Worse—she’d recently discovered Evelyn was Jonathan and Victoria’s biological daughter.

If they found out, her chances with Dominic would vanish forever.
###Chapter 398

Evelyn Sinclair's eyes burned with searing hatred.

She rose from the couch, determination hardening her features. Beatrice Lockwood would be her target. That shallow socialite could be her ticket to Reginald Blackwood's favor.

With the old patriarch's approval and her parents' influence, Dominic would have no choice but to submit.

T Corporation.

Dr. Julian Whitmore completed his examination. Aside from Evelyn's sprained wrist, there were no physical injuries.

But her mental state told a different story.

Anyone would be traumatized after nearly plunging from the 88th floor.

Julian conducted a counseling session and prescribed herbal remedies. Only when Dominic confirmed Evelyn's calm demeanor did he dismiss the doctor.

Shock still lingered in Evelyn's system. Dominic forbade her from working, insisting she rest in his private lounge.

Later, tea brewed from Julian's prescription arrived.

Evelyn took one sip and grimaced.

She glanced furtively at Dominic, pressing her lips together.

"It's too hot," she murmured, clutching the bowl. "I'll drink it later."

Dominic's sharp eyes caught her discomfort but said nothing as he returned to his office.

Evelyn exhaled in relief.

The moment he left, she hurried to the bathroom sink, ready to discard the bitter liquid.

"What do you think you're doing?" His voice sliced through the air.

Evelyn nearly dropped the bowl, whirling to find Dominic leaning against the doorframe.

"Nothing," she stammered.

His lips curved knowingly as she fumbled for excuses.

Heat flooded Evelyn's cheeks when he called her bluff. "It's unbearably bitter! I don't need medicine for mere shock. And medications have side effects. I'll recover naturally."

Dominic's gaze pinned her in place.

Without warning, he snatched the bowl, swallowed a mouthful, then pinned her against the wall. His hand gripped her jaw as he transferred the liquid through a searing kiss.

Evelyn's eyes widened at the assault of bitterness.

Dominic spoiled her endlessly, but never at the expense of her health.

Her face contorted in protest. 'Julian Whitmore, you'll pay for this!'

Dominic ensured every drop was consumed.

As Evelyn slumped against the bed, her wavering gaze softened Dominic's resolve.

"Julian's remedies work," he said gently. "Refuse it, and tomorrow's migraine will cripple you."

Evelyn recognized his concern but still pouted. "The bitterness is unbearable."

Suddenly, Dominic produced a candy.

Her eyes lit up, expecting the treat. Instead, he unwrapped it and popped it into his own mouth.

Before she could react, his hand cradled her head, drawing her into another kiss.

His tongue breached her lips, depositing the candy amidst lingering bitterness. The clash of flavors - herbal remedy, her unique scent, and candy sweetness - intoxicated Dominic.

Color returned to Evelyn's pale cheeks, blooming into rosy apples. Satisfied, Dominic pulled away.

"Rest now. No more work today. With Thanksgiving approaching, consider this paid leave until after the holidays."

Evelyn frowned. "I'm fine. One day's rest suffices. Year-end workloads demand attention."

"Your choice," Dominic conceded. "Sleep now. Alert me when you wake."

He tucked her in before returning to work.

The medicine's drowsiness claimed Evelyn swiftly.

She awoke at six p.m. to blinking message notifications. Propping herself up, she checked her phone.

Concerned colleagues had flooded her inbox after witnessing her ordeal. Their warmth touched her.

She replied with grateful acknowledgments.

Abigail Thornton and Olivia Kensington had messaged most frequently, their anxiety palpable. Evelyn created a group chat.

[I'm recovering well. Just needed rest. Thank you for worrying.] She added a smiley face.

The group exploded with responses.

Abigail: [You scared me half to death! My unborn baby nearly leaped out! You owe us - this child demands compensation!]

Evelyn: [I'll be its godmother. Anything it wants!]

Olivia: [What about me? My soul left my body! Where are you now?]

Evelyn: [My deepest apologies, darling. Lunch on me soon? Currently in the lounge. See you tomorrow.]

Abigail: [THE lounge? As in Dominic Blackwood's private lounge? He was furious earlier. Confess - did he ravish you in passionate revenge?]

Olivia: [Abigail! Our Evelyn's pure! Though... you do sound post-coital. Are we interrupting?]

Evelyn: [...]

Their banter continued until Evelyn recalled Beatrice's message to Dominic.

Reginald Blackwood demanded a meeting. Her good mood evaporated instantly...
###Chapter 399

Evelyn Sinclair stood frozen in Dominic Blackwood's bedroom, her eyes locked on the breathtaking oil painting. The half-finished masterpiece depicted Diana, the Roman goddess, in a vibrant crimson gown playing with Cupid. The intricate details made the scene come alive.

Dominic's deep voice broke her trance. "Just something I do to pass time."

Her jaw dropped. "You painted this? All these?" She gestured at the other artworks adorning his walls.

He shrugged. "Doodles."

Evelyn couldn't believe it. This man kept surprising her at every turn. First his business acumen, now this artistic talent. Was there anything he couldn't do?

Downstairs, the atmosphere was thick with tension. Beatrice Lockwood's bridge party had come to an abrupt halt when Dominic walked in with Evelyn, completely ignoring Lillian Prescott's presence.

Lillian's manicured nails dug into her palms as she forced a smile. The other society ladies exchanged knowing glances. Mrs. Ashford's shrill voice cut through the silence. "Beatrice, darling, if my son brought home some... questionable company, I'd have his head!"

Beatrice's face turned crimson with embarrassment. "My Dominic will marry whomever his grandfather approves," she snapped. "And in my book, that's only Lillian!"

The unspoken words hung heavy - Evelyn Sinclair wasn't worthy.

Lillian maintained her gracious facade, though jealousy burned through her veins. The thought of Dominic taking Evelyn to his bedroom made her physically ill. Were they...? She couldn't even complete the thought.

Upstairs, Evelyn traced the edge of the easel, marveling at Dominic's hidden talent. The man was an enigma - ruthless businessman by day, passionate artist by night.

"Teach me?" she blurted out.

Dominic's lips quirked. "You want painting lessons from me?"

"Unless you're afraid I'll surpass you," she teased, emboldened by their growing closeness.

His dark eyes gleamed with amusement. "We'll see about that."

The moment was interrupted by raised voices from downstairs. Evelyn tensed, recognizing Beatrice's angry tones. Dominic's expression hardened as he moved toward the door.

"Stay here," he commanded.

But Evelyn followed anyway. She wasn't about to hide while others decided her fate. As they descended the grand staircase, all eyes turned to them - some curious, most hostile.

The real battle was just beginning.
###Chapter 400

Evelyn had always assumed the oil paintings adorning the living room of Blackwood Manor and Dominic's bedroom were priceless antiques.

Never in her wildest dreams did she imagine Dominic himself had painted every single one.

Painting was Evelyn's secret passion too.

She had a natural talent for it. During her studies abroad, she'd taken oil painting classes where her instructor constantly praised her work.

But art supplies were expensive. Juggling work and studies left little time for creative pursuits. Eventually, she abandoned painting altogether.

Whenever she passed the art studio and saw students absorbed in filling their canvases with vibrant colors, an ache of longing would grip her heart.

Dominic's commanding presence translated effortlessly onto canvas through bold, unrestrained brushstrokes. His paintings, much like the man himself, exuded nobility, elegance, and an air of mystery...

"If you enjoy painting, I'd be happy to teach you when we have free time."

Dominic opened a paint box, expertly mixed several colors, and placed a brush in Evelyn's trembling hand.

His calloused palm enveloped her smaller one as they continued working on the half-finished "Diana and Cupid" together. "I-I'm not very good. What if I ruin your masterpiece?" Evelyn's voice wavered despite Dominic's steady grip.

She felt utterly inadequate compared to Dominic's skill. The thought of damaging his work terrified her.

"Oil paints are forgiving," his voice, clear as a mountain stream, soothed her nerves. "Unlike watercolors where one wrong stroke means starting over, mistakes here can be corrected."

Though intellectually understanding this, Evelyn couldn't shake her nervousness.

Once she'd relaxed slightly, Dominic began instructing her like a seasoned master guiding his apprentice.

Their joined hands moved across the canvas, adding color stroke by deliberate stroke.

Gradually, Diana's crimson gown took shape while Cupid's bow and arrows materialized on his back.

Their first artistic collaboration flowed with surprising harmony.

Though Dominic did most of the work, the finished "Diana and Cupid" bore traces of both their styles - a perfect fusion of classical and impressionist techniques that left Evelyn swelling with pride.

Dominic found himself pleasantly surprised by Evelyn's natural ability.

Most beginners produced stiff, lifeless work. Yet despite her awkward movements, Evelyn's painting pulsed with genuine emotion.

Overcome, he kissed the woman who never ceased to amaze him.

Their intimate moment shattered when knocking interrupted them.

Lillian's voice floated through the door. "Dominic, Grandfather Blackwood requests your presence for dinner. Are you occupied? May I enter?"

Evelyn shot Dominic a suspicious glance at Lillian's intrusion, her displeasure evident.

Dominic pressed a finger to his lips before responding coldly, "Ms. Prescott, my fiancée and I are currently engaged in a rather private activity we both enjoy. Your interruption is most inappropriate. We'll join dinner shortly."

Lillian's outstretched hand froze mid-air.

Dominic's blunt description of their activities painted her cheeks scarlet.

The next instant, tendrils of hatred coiled around her heart, making breathing difficult.

Her angelic features twisted briefly before she schooled them into calm composure.

Lillian had always been obsessive. What she desired, she obtained - or destroyed trying.

This man would be hers, no matter the cost.

Even if Dominic married Evelyn, she'd ensure their divorce. For now, simple schemes would suffice to break them apart.

This thought calmed her as she descended the grand staircase in her designer heels.

In Blackwood Manor's dining room...

Lillian had Reginald Blackwood and Beatrice Lockwood in stitches with her witty anecdotes.

Meanwhile, Alexander and Isabella sat ignored at the table, exchanging unhappy glances at this "interloper" who'd somehow charmed their great-grandfather and grandmother.

Isabella whispered to her brother, "She's not half as pretty as Mommy, and her jokes aren't funny. Why are they laughing? I don't like her, Alex..."

Alexander's eyes sparkled mischievously as he whispered back, making his sister giggle.

While the adults conversed, the twins slipped unnoticed into the kitchen.

The busy chef paid them no mind as Alexander climbed onto a stool and ladled soup into a bowl.

Isabella gleefully added every spice and condiment within reach, while Alexander dumped in an entire jar of mustard. After thorough stirring, they carried their creation back to the dining room.

"Auntie Prescott," Isabella blinked her starry eyes innocently, "you must be thirsty after all that talking. We brought you soup from the kitchen..."

Lillian looked genuinely surprised.

Dominic's children had always been hostile toward her. This unexpected kindness touched her.

"Thank you, Isabella. How thoughtful." Accepting the bowl, she patted the girl's head before taking a large spoonful.

The moment the vile concoction hit her tongue, tears sprang to her eyes as her throat burned...
###Chapter 401

The soup exploded across Evelyn's tongue like a chemical reaction.

An assault of sour, bitter, spicy, and salty flavors burned through her sinuses. It felt like tiny needles stabbing her nasal passages, forcing beads of sweat to form on her upper lip.

Her throat convulsed. The urge to vomit clawed at her esophagus.

Yet Evelyn maintained perfect poise under the watchful eyes of the two Blackwood elders and the twins' eager gazes. She clenched her jaw against the nausea, her smile turning brittle.

"Is the soup not to your liking, Aunt Prescott? Big Brother said it's delicious!" Isabella's small hands twisted in her lace dress. "The chef used rare truffles. It'll make you even prettier!"

Beatrice Lockwood beamed at her granddaughter's thoughtfulness. Nothing pleased her more than seeing the twins warm up to Evelyn.

"My darlings are being so kind to you," Beatrice cooed. "You should finish every last drop, Evelyn."

Though Beatrice favored Evelyn as a potential daughter-in-law, her grandchildren held her heart. Their previous rejection of Evelyn had worried her. This sudden change was a blessing.

Evelyn dabbed her damp forehead, stomach churning. "Perhaps...later, Isabella?"

Tears welled in Isabella's enormous eyes. "Don't you like my gift? I picked it just for you!" Her lower lip trembled dramatically.

Reginald Blackwood's heart melted. He pulled his great-granddaughter close, feeding her a strawberry. "There, there, my precious. Let's eat dinner." His glare at Evelyn could have frozen lava.

Evelyn's blood ran cold. She'd forgotten the family patriarch's soft spot for the twins. His disapproval could ruin everything.

Gritting her teeth, she downed the entire bowl in one revolting gulp.

The empty dish clattered onto the table. Tears and mucus threatened to erupt as her digestive system rebelled. "D-delicious," she choked out. "Thank you, Isabella."

Alexander caught his sister's eye and flashed a covert thumbs-up. Both children muffled giggles at Evelyn's suffering.

Footsteps on the staircase announced Dominic's arrival with Evelyn cradled against his chest.

Evelyn's nausea momentarily forgotten, she stared hungrily at the man who moved like royalty. His sculpted features and commanding presence made her pulse race. Even in casual wear, he exuded power.

Evelyn reclined in his arms like a contented feline, her white dress accentuating porcelain skin. The sight made Evelyn's stomach lurch again.

After greeting the elders, the couple took their seats. Reginald gave Evelyn a curt nod before returning his attention to the twins. Beatrice's audible huff went ignored.

Evelyn observed Evelyn refilling Beatrice's teacup with sycophantic precision. The woman clearly believed winning over Dominic's mother guaranteed success.

A flawed strategy. Dominic bowed to no one's will - not even his grandfather's. All of Evelyn's efforts would prove futile.

Dinner proceeded in stiff silence, the tension palpable. Evelyn fidgeted, desperate to capture Dominic's attention.

Her gaze landed on the wall paintings. "Grandfather Blackwood, are those M originals? His realist works are so rare! What an impressive collection!"

Evelyn nearly choked on her wine. Two glaring errors in one breath - M was French, not English, and an impressionist, not a realist.

The corners of Dominic's mouth twitched. Even the twins exchanged knowing looks. Evelyn's face burned with humiliation as she realized her mistake.
###Chapter 402

Lillian's face darkened at Evelyn's laughter. "Did I say something inappropriate?"

Ever since being adopted by the Prescott family, she'd attended elite schools and even studied abroad for two years.

She refused to believe some uncultured nobody like Evelyn could outshine her.

Art had never been Lillian's passion, but her mother Genevieve was obsessed. She'd forced herself to study art history just to please her.

Yet the moment she opened those tedious books about theories and artists' lives, sleep would claim her. Eventually, she gave up and focused on other talents to impress her mother.

Lillian stole a glance at Dominic.

The man sat with perfect posture, his silence commanding the room. But when he poured Evelyn's tea, his entire demeanor transformed.

His piercing gaze softened. The corners of his lips curled into an indulgent smile.

Lillian's heart felt clawed by a wild beast - bloody, itching, burning.

She lowered her eyes in defeat.

Beatrice couldn't tolerate her son ignoring Lillian. Earlier, when Lillian confidently discussed the painting, her impression had improved. She didn't understand what went wrong.

Beatrice placed a scallop in Lillian's bowl. "See? This is what a cultured overseas education looks like. Far more refined than some provincial simpleton who's never traveled. I doubt certain people here could distinguish authentic art from forgeries, let alone appreciate it! Don't you agree, Father?"

Though she didn't name names, her disdainful glance at Evelyn spoke volumes.

Reginald Blackwood's expression darkened. He slammed his utensils down. "If you're ignorant, at least have the decency to stay quiet! You're embarrassing me!"

Beatrice didn't know Reginald had studied art history in his youth. He'd spent years in France, majoring in art before returning to build his empire.

While he'd left that world behind, his knowledge remained. Monet was among his favorite impressionists, with several originals in his collection.

Lillian's failed attempt at sophistication shattered Reginald's favorable opinion of her.

"Did I say something incorrect, Father?" Beatrice challenged.

Evelyn calmly interjected, "Aunt Beatrice, Monet was French, not English. And he was an impressionist, not a realist."

Beatrice nearly scoffed. What would some country girl know about art?

Reginald's eyes gleamed behind his glasses. "You know art history, young lady? Then tell me - does this painting depict sunrise or sunset?"

He pointed his cane at the water lilies hanging behind him.

Evelyn studied the painting intently, searching for clues. Without visible sky or stars, how could she tell?

Lillian watched coldly, anticipating Evelyn's humiliation.

Under the table, Dominic squeezed Evelyn's hand reassuringly.

She returned his gesture with a confident smile.

After careful examination, Evelyn answered, "It's sunrise, Mr. Blackwood. The dewdrops on the lily pads give it away. The water's light blue where shaded, golden where sunlit, and blue-green beneath the pads. Only morning light creates this effect. Nature itself reveals the truth."

For the first time, Reginald regarded Evelyn more favorably than Lillian.

His voice warmed. "I'm impressed by your knowledge. Tell me then - what are the major Western art movements? Their key figures and masterpieces?"

Evelyn answered flawlessly, even sharing amusing artist anecdotes.

Reginald chuckled at her witty responses, his admiration growing.

Lillian and Beatrice looked ashen. How had this happened?

Dinner had elevated Evelyn in Reginald's esteem while diminishing Lillian's standing.

Lillian returned home late to find Genevieve reading an art history tome in the living room.

Her elegant silhouette cast a tranquil shadow across the room.

For a fleeting moment, jealousy twisted Lillian's features.

Both Genevieve and Evelyn shared this passion for classical art. The realization unsettled her.

She took several steadying breaths before adopting a pitiful expression.

Genevieve set the book aside. "Have you eaten, darling? Shall I prepare something?"

Lillian shook her head dejectedly. "I dined at Blackwood Manor..."

Her pale lips pressed together, brows furrowed slightly.

Genevieve immediately noticed her daughter's distress. "What happened at the Blackwoods?" Her voice turned icy.
###Chapter 403

Genevieve Prescott was fiercely protective of Lillian.

After losing her biological child, she had come to see Lillian as her only daughter. Her heart ached when she noticed the unshed tears glistening in Lillian's eyes.

She pulled Lillian into a warm embrace. "Tell me what's troubling you, darling."

Lillian nearly confessed how cruelly Dominic had treated her.

But she feared her words might turn Genevieve against Dominic permanently.

She swallowed the confession burning her tongue.

Her lashes fluttered downward as quiet sobs shook her shoulders. "Mother... I think Dominic doesn't care for me at all. That Evelyn is far more cunning than I anticipated. She humiliated me at Blackwood Manor today, flaunting her intelligence before Reginald Blackwood. Even the old master favors her now... Dominic is the first man I've ever loved. What should I do?"

Lillian buried her face against Genevieve's shoulder, hot tears staining the expensive silk.

Genevieve tenderly dabbed her daughter's cheeks with a handkerchief. The sight of Lillian's distress twisted her heart.

She pressed a warm teacup into Lillian's hands. "Dry those tears, my dear. If Dominic is who you desire, I'll move heaven and earth to make it happen."

Lillian's fingers trembled around the porcelain. "No matter what I do, he remains indifferent. Yet my feelings only grow stronger, like water boiling over in a kettle. It's hopeless..."

The desperate longing in Lillian's eyes told Genevieve everything. Her daughter had fallen irrevocably in love.

Her voice softened with sympathy. "There's no shame in loving someone, especially since Dominic isn't married yet. But if his heart truly belongs to Evelyn, we mustn't interfere. You're an exceptional woman, Lillian. Never degrade yourself by breaking others' relationships."

Initially, Genevieve hadn't considered Evelyn a threat.

In her eyes, Lillian surpassed Evelyn in every aspect - beauty, pedigree, accomplishments. She'd been certain Dominic would naturally prefer her daughter.

Clearly, she'd underestimated Evelyn.

To Genevieve, Lillian embodied grace and refinement while Evelyn was nothing but a vulgar upstart. How could the prestigious Blackwoods accept such a woman?

Lillian shut her eyes to conceal her turmoil.

Dominic represented everything she'd ever wanted, yet that dream had transformed into a blade shredding her soul.

Still, she refused to let go.

She'd sacrifice anything - except that man.

Christmas approached swiftly.

Most T Corporation employees were on holiday, but Dominic had fallen ill during this rare break.

His relentless work schedule had finally caught up with him.

Dawn-to-midnight workdays spent buried in paperwork had taken their toll. The Greenview Regalia arson case demanded particular attention.

Jillian Dove's trial would commence right after Christmas.

He'd promised Gregory Sinclair a death sentence for the arsonist, and Dominic always kept his promises.

He'd pulled strings with federal officials, chaired emergency board meetings about equity restructuring, and secured two nine-figure international deals via video conference.

That afternoon, the twins developed stomachaches from spoiled food. He and Evelyn rushed them to the hospital, only returning by evening.

By nightfall, Dominic's iron constitution finally gave out. Exhaustion manifested in a raging fever.

He'd noticed the congestion and sore throat that morning but ignored them. Now his throat burned like fire while his body alternated between chills and sweats.

His skull throbbed as if split open, limbs weighed down by invisible concrete.

Evelyn perched on the bed, tucking blankets around him. Seeing the formidable Dominic Blackwood reduced to this state made her eyes sting.

Even steel would bend under such strain.

She slipped a thermometer between his lips.

"103.5! This is dangerous!" Her voice shook.

"Just a cold," Dominic rasped. "I'll recover."

To him, illness was insignificant.

Evelyn's brow furrowed. She fetched warm water, then soaked a towel in cold water to press against his forehead.

It was all she could do until help arrived.

In his feverish haze, Dominic inhaled Evelyn's delicate floral scent. Immediately, some tension left his body.

"Drink this." Evelyn leveraged her slight frame to prop him up.

She braced against the headboard, cradling Dominic's back against herself as she tipped water to his lips.

"Slowly now." Her movements were feather-light, as though tending a fragile child.

To Dominic, her voice was angelic, her touch miraculous.

No one had cared for him like this since childhood. Having Evelyn here felt like divine grace.
###Chapter 404

Julian Whitmore arrived promptly, examining Dominic with practiced ease before prescribing medication and administering fluids. Within hours, Dominic's raging fever began to subside.

Evelyn exhaled in relief.

The day had been exhausting. First, their twins needed hospitalization. Just as they recovered, Dominic fell ill. Juggling care for both her husband and children had drained her completely.

While preparing Dominic's herbal remedy, the pungent medicinal aroma assaulted her senses. A wave of nausea crashed over her without warning...

Evelyn barely made it to the bathroom, gripping the marble sink as dry heaves wracked her body. Nothing came up, but the discomfort lingered.

As the queasiness faded, realization dawned.

She remembered Abigail's similar symptoms at work. The memories of her own pregnancy with the twins surfaced vividly. Her hand flew to her mouth as she mentally calculated her cycle.

Her period was a week late.

Dominic always used protection - except that one passionate night last month when they'd gotten carried away. Evelyn had assumed it was her safe period, so she hadn't taken emergency contraception.

'Oh god, could I really be...?'

A whirlwind of emotions accompanied her return to the bedroom.

Dominic sat propped against pillows, reviewing financial reports while conversing with Julian. His sharp eyes immediately noted Evelyn's pallor.

Pulling her close, he murmured, "You've worked so hard today. You look exhausted. Julian, examine her immediately."

Julian, with his perpetually charming demeanor, smirked. "What's happening in this household? The twins get sick, then you, now Evelyn? Did you forget to leave offerings for the winter spirits this year?"

"Enough." Dominic's lethal glare silenced him instantly.

Julian adopted a professional tone. "Your wrist, Ms. Sinclair. Let me check your pulse..."

Evelyn extended her arm nervously.

Julian's fingers pressed against her pulse point. His expression shifted dramatically - brows furrowing, lips pressing into a thin line.

Evelyn's heartbeat accelerated. That look couldn't mean anything good.

"Am I ill?" she whispered.

Julian considered teasing her longer, but Dominic's predatory stare changed his mind.

"Relax," he said, raising his hands in surrender. "No need for that murderous look, Dominic. Your wife isn't sick. She's pregnant."

Thud!

Dominic's reports scattered across the floor.

His arms tightened around Evelyn's waist. "Say that again."

"Congratulations are in order. The Blackwood family will have a new member in about eight months." Julian grinned at his usually composed friend's reaction.

Evelyn's cheeks burned.

They'd planned to expand their family after the wedding. This unexpected development sent her emotions into chaos - equal parts panic and warmth.

Dominic inhaled sharply, his feverish body suddenly energized.

His eyes shone with unrestrained joy.

Crushing Evelyn against him, he seemed determined to merge their bodies together through sheer force of embrace.

This reaction surpassed even when she'd carried the twins.

Back then, her heart hadn't fully belonged to him.

Their relationship had been transactional, secretive. He'd only learned about the pregnancy during a routine hospital visit.

His feelings then had been different - present, but not this all-consuming.

The wedding was supposed to come first. The baby plans were for later.

Yet here they were.

The surprise short-circuited his normally razor-sharp mind.

Then realization struck - Evelyn had been caring for three sick family members all day while carrying their child.

In one swift motion, Dominic lifted her onto the bed, tucked her in, and smoothed the down comforter over her.

His fingers trembled against her cheek. "Rest now. Had I known... I wouldn't have gotten sick. Making you worry in your condition..." His words made no logical sense.

Evelyn blinked in bewilderment.

'Since when can people choose to fall ill?'

'They say pregnancy hormones cause mood swings, but he's acting more irrational than me!'

Dominic's unusual protectiveness felt both endearing and overwhelming. "It's just a pregnancy, Dominic. I'm fine. The twins should be waking from their nap—"

"Stay." His commanding tone brooked no argument.

Despite his stern expression, Evelyn's heart swelled at his concern.

Julian shook his head at the display. His once woman-averse friend had become utterly besotted.

The knowing wink he sent Evelyn deepened her blush.

Dominic's thoughts raced. 'With Evelyn pregnant, we can't delay the wedding any longer.'
###Chapter 405

Dominic's joy gradually settled into quiet contentment. He turned to Julian Whitmore with earnest questions about caring for a pregnant woman.

The family physician shared extensive advice.

Dominic listened with rapt attention. His fingers flew across his tablet, recording every word. He even requested Julian email him detailed notes later.

Julian recommended several authoritative pregnancy guides.

These volumes covered everything from prenatal care to postpartum recovery, including troubleshooting potential complications.

Evelyn nearly dozed off during the medical lecture. Dominic, however, kept typing furiously.

This wasn't their first child. Evelyn hadn't anticipated such intense preparation from her husband...

Before leaving, Julian flashed them a mischievous grin. "One last professional reminder, Evelyn. Don't be embarrassed."

Evelyn blinked in confusion.

'Embarrassed? What now?'

Julian addressed Dominic directly. "This is for you. Moderate exercise is fine during pregnancy, but you'll need to control certain... urges."

"Enough!"

Dominic launched a cushion at Julian's head, making the doctor duck with theatrical yelps.

Dominic hated personal discussions in front of others, especially when it made Evelyn blush.

"Medical advice only! Overexertion could harm the baby. After all my help, this is my thanks? Such terrible friends I have!" Julian pretended to sob. "Save me, Evelyn!"

Evelyn burst out laughing at the distinguished doctor's antics.

"Thank you, Dr. Whitmore. We'll follow your instructions carefully."

This second pregnancy felt different. No first-time fears, just pure joy.

Evelyn's hand drifted to her still-flat abdomen, her eyes softening with maternal warmth.

This child symbolized their love.

She'd missed Alexander and Isabella's early years. This time, she'd cherish every moment.

She'd give this child the complete childhood her twins had lost.

Only one worry remained - how the twins would react.

Horror stories flooded her mind. News reports of jealous siblings harming newborns...

Her fears proved unfounded.

The twins exploded with excitement upon hearing the news.

Now they debated loudly in the parlor.

"It's definitely a girl like me! Boys have boring toys. I want a sister to play house with! I'll braid her hair and share my doll clothes. A sister, please!"

Isabella struck a dramatic pose, finger pointed accusingly at her brother.

Alexander lounged on the sofa, the picture of his father in miniature.

He regarded his dramatic sister with amused tolerance. "It's a brother. Girls are fragile. When he grows up, we'll protect you together!"

Isabella sucked her thumb thoughtfully. "But brothers don't play dolls..."

"Foolish! You can dress him up! When he's older, he'll buy you mountains of dolls!"

Isabella's eyes widened. "You're right! I want a brother now! Yay!"

Alexander facepalmed at his easily swayed sister.

But secretly, he prayed for a brother.

Isabella was gullible enough. Protecting two naive sisters would exhaust him!

Isabella danced to Evelyn, pressing her ear against her mother's stomach. "Hello, little brother! I'm your big sister Isabella! Come out soon - I want my new toy!"

Evelyn didn't know whether to laugh.

Alexander's acceptance was expected. But possessive Isabella's enthusiasm surprised her - though treating the baby as a toy wasn't ideal.

Soon, pregnancy manuals and Julian's notes formed towering stacks by their bedside.

News spread through Blackwood Manor like wildfire.

When Margaret Lockwood heard Beatrice would gain another grandchild, she shattered her room's contents.

"That nightclub whore! Why does fortune favor her? Not only does her son control T Corporation, but grandchildren keep coming! If only that second car crash had finished them!"

Julian Blackwood froze in the doorway, shock etching his features. "Mother... you orchestrated Dominic's accident?"
###Chapter 406

Margaret Lockwood never anticipated Julian would be standing at the doorway.

Her mind snapped back to reality, recalling every venomous word she'd spat in her rage.

She couldn't deny that her toxic marriage to Edmund had left permanent psychological scars. Yet despite everything, she'd been nothing but a devoted mother to Julian.

Her position in the Blackwood family hung by a thread. With only her son as her anchor, she couldn't risk fracturing their relationship.

"What are you talking about, darling? I don't understand," Margaret feigned innocence. "Look, Dominic already has twins, and now Evelyn's expecting a third child. You need to step up and give me grandchildren soon. Otherwise, the Blackwood empire will fall entirely into Beatrice and her son's hands!"

"Tell me the truth, Mother. Did you arrange Dominic's car accident?" Julian cut straight to the chase.

Those piercing eyes—so much like Edmund's—made Margaret's breath hitch. Then came the familiar ache.

They were the same eyes that had once stolen her heart.

Edmund Blackwood had been a seasoned playboy. His empty promises had ensnared young Margaret completely. Her parents had seen through his charms, warning her about his unreliable nature.

But what did a lovesick socialite care about warnings?

Whenever they were together, Edmund made her feel like his entire world. She remained blissfully unaware of his countless affairs.

When her parents opposed the marriage, she'd threatened suicide. She'd even abandoned her strict upbringing to sleep with him. Left with no choice, her parents relented.

Marrying the man of her dreams, she thought her happiness was complete.

Then the other women started crawling out of the woodwork—before their honeymoon even ended.

Thus began her cold war with Edmund Blackwood.

At first, Edmund would try to placate her. Eventually, he grew tired of her tantrums and distanced himself. Sometimes disappearing for days.

She was forced to face reality.

Using her family's influence, she systematically eliminated Edmund's mistresses. But the man was insatiable—for every woman removed, a younger, prettier replacement emerged, mocking her efforts.

Eventually, she grew exhausted.

Her parents convinced her that bearing a son would secure her position. That all Blackwood riches would eventually be hers.

She stopped chasing mistresses. Instead, she ensured any pregnancies were terminated.

Until one slipped through.

Beatrice Lockwood, an escort and one of Edmund's dalliances, had gotten pregnant. By the time Margaret discovered it, Beatrice was already five months along—with a boy.

Margaret saw red. She wanted Beatrice carved into pieces!

Edmund must have sensed her intentions. He hid Beatrice away. Despite her best efforts, Margaret couldn't locate her. Beatrice successfully gave birth to Dominic.

But it changed nothing.

Margaret remained the legal Mrs. Blackwood. As long as she held her position, Beatrice would always be the mistress.

When Margaret was pregnant with Julian, Edmund died in an accident. Beatrice lost her footing in the Blackwood household.

Death threats and financial incentives made Beatrice remarry and abandon her child to an orphanage.

Later, Reginald Blackwood retrieved Dominic from the orphanage, missing his deceased son. Fearing the boy wouldn't adjust, he brought Beatrice back—against Margaret's wishes.

All Margaret could do was scheme against mother and son.

She never anticipated Dominic's brilliance—everything Julian wasn't. A business prodigy who earned Reginald's trust.

She feared for her and Julian's position...

Then fate smiled—Dominic was diagnosed with depression!

Reginald sent him to a small town to recover. Margaret arranged a near-fatal accident there, leaving him comatose for a year.

Miraculously, he survived.

After recovering, Dominic Blackwood returned changed. He studied abroad for years.

Reginald, suspecting something, assigned bodyguards. Margaret had to tread carefully.

Her influence didn't extend overseas. Dominic's activities remained a mystery.

Upon his return, he swiftly took control of Blackwood Enterprises, purging all her spies with ruthless efficiency.

She was powerless against him...

With his business acumen, Dominic multiplied profits exponentially, rebranding the company as T Corporation—A City's premier enterprise.

She regretted not killing him when she had the chance.

Now helpless, Julian was all she had left.

And here he was, accusing her of orchestrating Dominic's accident.

"How could you suspect your own mother? Everything I do is for you. If you don't trust me, why did I even bear you? I—"

Memories overwhelmed Margaret. Clutching her chest, she collapsed onto the couch.

With no other escape, she faked a heart attack to avoid her son's interrogation.
###Chapter 407

The study door creaked open.

Julian Blackwood stood there, watching his older brother Dominic immersed in paperwork. The heater hummed softly, casting warmth through the room. Dominic wore only a crisp black shirt, sleeves rolled up to his elbows, emphasizing the sharp lines of his shoulders.

Even from the doorway, Julian could see the way his brother’s legs were casually crossed, exuding effortless authority.

He sighed. If he weren’t straight, even he might have fallen for that man.

Dominic was a machine—working through holidays, through weekends, through every spare moment. Julian could barely sit still for thirty minutes without itching to escape. Yet here was his brother, buried in documents like they were his lifeline.

Dominic finally glanced up, his piercing gaze landing on Julian before flicking back to his papers.

Noon sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, framing Dominic in a golden halo. The light caught the sharp angles of his jaw, the faint shadow of stubble.

Julian swallowed.

"Dominic," he said quietly.

His brother exhaled a slow stream of smoke from his cigarette. "How’s your mother?"

Of course he knew about Margaret Lockwood’s collapse. Unlike Beatrice, who would’ve reveled in it, Dominic had done his duty—called Dr. Whitmore, ensured she was cared for.

Reginald Blackwood had begged Dominic to forgive Margaret’s sins. And Dominic had—not because he forgot the car crash she orchestrated, the years stolen from him and Evelyn—but because he understood.

His own mother, Beatrice, had shattered Margaret’s marriage.

Some debts could never be repaid.

"She’s resting," Julian said. "Dr. Whitmore says it’s psychological. She’ll need therapy." He hesitated. "I’m sorry, Dominic."

Dominic set down his pen, studying his brother. "You’re off today. What’s wrong?"

Julian clenched his fists. "I’ve decided. After this weekend, I’m joining the company—properly."

Dominic arched a brow. "You already are in the company, Julian."

Julian flushed.

Before, he’d only shown up under their grandfather’s threats. Skipped meetings, taken endless "sick days." His "help" had been not actively sabotaging Dominic’s work.

But now—knowing what his mother had done—

"I’m serious," Julian insisted.

Dominic’s lips twitched. "I believe you."

Julian exhaled in relief.

A glance at his watch reminded him of his next obligation. "I should go. Lillian Prescott’s birthday party is tonight. I need to prepare."

Dominic’s fingers stilled around his lighter. "Lillian Prescott?"

Julian nodded. "Her twenty-second. I got an invite."

Dominic said nothing.

These events were standard for socialites—networking disguised as celebration. He’d tossed Lillian’s invitation without a second thought. Crowds bored him.

But tonight—

He remembered Evelyn’s quiet fury after the last Norman family event.

A slow smirk curved his lips. "I’ll attend as well."

By six, dusk had settled over the city.

A sleek black Rolls-Royce glided toward the Prescott estate, cutting through the winter-bare landscape. Snow clung to tree branches like lace.

Evelyn stared out the window, fingers twisting in her lap.

She didn’t understand Dominic’s logic. He knew she despised Lillian. So why bring her to the viper’s den?

And after her last clash with Elizabeth Prescott—

"We’re here," the driver announced.

Dominic stepped out first, shielding Evelyn’s head as she followed.

The Prescott gates stood wide, a red carpet unfurling toward the mansion. Luxury cars lined the drive.

Inside, the hall glittered with politicians, tycoons, celebrities—all turning as Dominic and Evelyn entered.

Evelyn’s smile felt brittle as greetings bombarded them. She recognized faces from Forbes covers, news segments.

Dominic’s network was terrifying.

Then—

The crowd parted.

And there stood Lillian Prescott, encircled by socialites and starlets, her smile sharp as glass.
###Chapter 408

At the gala celebration, Evelyn noticed Genevieve surrounded by high society ladies.

Genevieve's hair was elegantly coiffed in an updo, her sapphire-embroidered gown shimmering under the chandeliers. She moved with effortless grace among her peers.

Truthfully, Evelyn had never encountered another woman who carried such refined sophistication as Genevieve Prescott.

She possessed aristocratic bearing without appearing haughty. There was kindness in her demeanor, yet an undeniable air of authority lingered beneath.

Though they'd exchanged sharp words before regarding Lillian, Evelyn found herself unable to dislike the woman. Strangely, she felt an inexplicable familiarity with the noblewoman.

"You're so fortunate, Mrs. Prescott! Your daughter is both accomplished and stunning!" One bejeweled matron gushed. "Indeed! Miss Prescott is the complete package - graceful, intelligent, and unattached. Might she be available for introductions?"

Genevieve smiled serenely. "You flatter her. Lillian remains unattached. Should you know any suitable gentlemen, I'd welcome introductions."

She understood her daughter's stubborn nature.

This first love had convinced Lillian that Dominic was her destiny.

But Genevieve knew better. Men of Dominic's caliber were rare, and his indifference toward Lillian was painfully obvious.

A loveless marriage would be torture. Even if Lillian succeeded, happiness would elude her.

That's why Genevieve sought potential matches tonight. She only wanted her daughter's genuine happiness.

Meanwhile, Lillian seethed with resentment.

Unaware of her mother's intentions, her obsession with Dominic only grew stronger with each rejection.

None of the men present could compare to Dominic's shadow, let alone his pinky finger.

She interpreted Genevieve's matchmaking as proof she wasn't truly loved - just an adopted daughter after all.

Dark emotions swirled in Lillian's eyes.

Needing composure, she reached for champagne, only to see Dominic and Evelyn reflected in the crystal flute.

The sight of Dominic shielding Evelyn through the crowd reignited her fury.

White-hot rage threatened to consume her.

"Mrs. Prescott." After greeting Jonathan, Dominic guided Evelyn toward Genevieve.

Genevieve studied Evelyn with unexpected intensity.

Evelyn wore a simple satin dress with minimal makeup. Her wavy hair framed delicate features. When she smiled at Genevieve, her expressive eyes seemed to speak volumes.

For a fleeting moment, Genevieve saw her younger self in Evelyn.

She dismissed the absurd notion immediately. This was Lillian's romantic rival. What resemblance could exist?

Dominic made formal introductions. "Mrs. Prescott, may I present Evelyn Sinclair - mother of my children, and soon to be my wife and lifelong partner."

Genevieve's initial surprise gave way to a gracious smile. "No need for emphasis, Mr. Blackwood. If you and Miss Sinclair have found love, you have my sincerest blessings. Love cannot be forced - I understand this better than most. Miss Sinclair, I regret our previous unpleasantness. Please consider yourself an honored guest tonight..."

Evelyn was taken aback.

Genevieve's attitude had transformed dramatically. While Dominic's influence played a role, she hadn't expected such a complete reversal from the doting mother.

Lillian remained silent, her eyes betraying heartbreak and envy. The chatter around her faded into white noise.

Dominic's declaration echoed in her mind: "My only partner in life." A bitter laugh escaped her lips.

'How can you be so certain, Dominic Blackwood? The wedding hasn't happened yet!'

The celebration officially commenced at 8:30.

Lillian, resplendent in a princess gown, stood beside Jonathan and Genevieve before a towering twelve-tier cake.

As the Norman heiress, she basked in admiration from society's elite.

Following the cake-cutting, Lillian performed her signature piano piece.

Nervous excitement coursed through her - more intense than any competition. The man she loved was watching.

Taking a steadying breath, she began.

While acting wasn't her forte, musical talent came naturally. Her rendition of "Swan Lake" flowed effortlessly.

The final notes brought thunderous applause.

Dominic and Evelyn observed from a quiet corner. He handed her warm milk while sipping red wine.

"Not bad," Evelyn admitted objectively.

Though untrained in music, the performance moved her.

Dominic tapped her nose playfully. "Technically proficient, but soulless. Competition material, not concert caliber."

Evelyn smiled knowingly.

'Is there anything this man can't do? Don't tell me he plays piano too!'

Genevieve beamed with maternal pride as Lillian curtsied gracefully.

Then Lillian glided toward them in her white gown. "I've heard you're quite accomplished at the piano, Miss Sinclair. Won't you favor us with a performance?" Her smile didn't reach her eyes.
###Chapter 409

Evelyn's palms grew clammy in Dominic's grasp as she faced Lillian's challenge.

She had zero piano skills.

Her pleading eyes sought Dominic's help, but his expression remained unreadably calm.

Dominic gave her hand a reassuring squeeze. "My girlfriend injured her finger yesterday," he announced smoothly to the crowd. "She won't be able to perform tonight."

He lifted Evelyn's hand—the one with the bandaged index finger from last night's apple-peeling mishap with the twins.

Murmurs of understanding rippled through the guests.

Dominic's lips curved. "But she has the voice of an angel. I'll accompany her on piano instead."

Evelyn's breath hitched.

She could sing, yes—but only alone in her room. Performing publicly made her want to vanish. How did Dominic even know about her secret talent?

He winked, mouthing "Later."

The memory surfaced abruptly—that summer night years ago when insomnia drove Dominic to wander the moonlit fields of her hometown. A crystalline voice had stopped him mid-step.

Hidden behind the ancient oak, he'd watched the girl with chestnut hair sing to the stars, her melody mending something fractured inside him.

That was how Dominic Blackwood first fell for Evelyn Sinclair.

"Trust me," he murmured now, fingertips brushing her wrist. "I know every song in your playlist by heart."

Evelyn exhaled. The moment her lips parted, the first notes of A Thousand Miles floated through the ballroom.

"Making my way downtown, walking fast, faces pass and I'm homebound..."

Gasps followed. Her voice—honeyed yet haunting—wove with Dominic's piano like silver threads through velvet.

But as she reached the bridge, a lump formed in her throat.

"If I could just see you tonight..."

The lyrics twisted into a premonition. Despite Dominic's promises, Lillian's venomous glare made Evelyn's chest tighten. Something was coming. Something that would tear them apart.

Dominic's hands flew across the keys, each chord amplifying her ache. Men dabbed at their eyes; women clutched their pearls.

When the final note faded, Dominic pulled her into an embrace scented with mint and regret.

Across the room, Genevieve Prescott stiffened.

This girl—this nobody—sounded exactly like her younger self. The resemblance went beyond looks. It was... unnatural.

The applause erupted like thunder, drowning out Lillian's furious whispers to her manager.

"Magnificent!" A duchess fanned herself. "Mr. Blackwood, you've hidden this prodigy from us!"

"Such chemistry," sighed a viscount. "Like watching Tristan and Isolde."

Lillian's manicured nails bit into her palms.

This was supposed to be Evelyn's humiliation. Instead, the little gold-digger had stolen her spotlight—with Dominic Blackwood as her willing accomplice.
###Chapter 410

The spotlight in the grand hall belonged entirely to Evelyn. Lillian Prescott's steps were rigid as she retreated to the ladies' room.

Several young socialites greeted her along the way, but she barely registered their presence.

Their whispered comments floated past her unnoticed. "Just an adopted daughter of Mr. Prescott. Who does she think she is?"

Inside the bathroom, Lillian splashed icy water on her burning face, trying to regain composure.

It didn't help.

The storm of rage and humiliation refused to subside.

The reflection staring back shocked her - a stranger with twisted features and wild eyes. Was this really her?

Tears broke free, streaking her carefully applied makeup.

Then came the terrifying moment when a hulking figure materialized behind her.

"What... how did you... this is the women's restroom!" Her voice cracked with panic.

Lillian's bloodshot eyes locked onto the predator's wolfish gaze. She tried to flee, but Wesley Thornton's iron grip closed around her wrist.

His sudden appearance felt supernatural.

That hungry look promised to devour her whole, carrying the metallic scent of violence.

Every instinct screamed danger. This man was quicksand - once caught, impossible to escape.

"Running from me, kitten? After how you begged for me that night? Remember how you wrapped those perfect legs around me?" Wesley's filthy whispers accompanied roaming hands.

Since their one-night encounter, no other woman satisfied him.

A month-long mission had delayed his pursuit. Now nothing would stop him.

Lillian, accustomed to genteel treatment, recoiled at his roughness. "Unhand me, you brute! How dare you speak such filth!"

Her slap never landed. With military precision, he twisted her wrist until bone popped from socket.

White-hot pain turned her face ghostly pale. Silent tears traced her cheeks as she bit her lip bloody.

"My bad, princess. Let me fix that." His laugh held no warmth.

The brutal relocation hurt worse than the injury. Her scream died behind clenched teeth.

"Get out! I'll call security!" She clung to her last shred of dignity.

Surely this beast couldn't belong to their elite circle.

Yet Wesley just chuckled darkly. "Scream away. Let them all see how the ice princess melts. Your precious father can't touch the Thornton family. I'll even marry you if it comes to that."

He produced damning photos - her naked form arched beneath him in ecstasy. "Who knew A City's darling was such a wildcat?"

Lillian's world tilted. That face, that body - undeniably hers. But how?

"You doctored these! Name your price! Was it Evelyn? I'll pay ten times whatever she offered!"

Wesley crushed her against the sink, muffling her hysterics. "Tearing these up changes nothing. I've got videos too. Want a preview?" His free hand wandered lower.

"Please... what do you want?" Her plea came out strangled.

"You. Now." His body pinned hers.

Initial pain gave way to shameful pleasure, stripping away her ladylike facade.

Afterward, as Wesley adjusted his uniform, Lillian mustered one last act of defiance - a stinging slap.

His eyes turned murderous. She fled before he could react.

Back in the ballroom, surrounded by oblivious guests, she almost felt safe. Until she spotted Evelyn laughing with her parents, and the jealousy returned tenfold.
###Chapter 411

The grand ballroom glittered with high society's elite. Crystal chandeliers cast shimmering light over the sea of designer gowns and tailored suits.

Evelyn's gaze locked onto the center of attention across the room.

Dominic stood with an aura of dangerous elegance, his sharp features carved from ice. Genevieve held Jonathan's hand as they posed together with Dominic and Lillian - the perfect picture of a happy family.

The sight made Evelyn's chest constrict.

She willed Dominic to glance her way, just once.

But his attention never wavered from Lillian. Those piercing eyes saw only her.

The lively chatter around Evelyn became unbearable white noise.

Retreating to her suite, Evelyn changed into a daring crimson gown that hugged every curve. When she reentered the ballroom, heads turned. She basked in the admiring stares.

Dismissing several dance requests, she made her way toward Dominic.

Jonathan was deep in conversation with him, clearly impressed by the younger man's business acumen. Genevieve whispered something that made Lillian smile sweetly.

"We're honored you could attend our daughter's celebration, Dominic," Jonathan said with a politician's practiced charm.

Dominic gave a curt nod. "The pleasure is mine, Mr. Prescott."

Jonathan pulled Evelyn forward. "You've known my daughter for some time now. What are your thoughts?"

Dominic's lips curved into a humorless smile. "Miss Prescott is... remarkable. But my heart belongs to another. She deserves better than a man who can't return her affections."

Evelyn's nails bit into her palms. She turned away to hide the tears threatening to spill.

Jonathan's expression darkened, but Genevieve intervened smoothly. "These matters of the heart can't be forced, darling. The young man has made his choice."

Evelyn forced a brittle smile, her lashes fluttering to conceal the storm in her eyes.

"Dominic Blackwood! Finally we meet." A rough voice cut through the tension.

Evelyn froze. Her pulse spiked when Wesley Thornton materialized beside her parents, sizing up Dominic with open hostility.

Dominic's polite mask didn't slip. "Mr. Thornton. I've heard... interesting things about you."

Their handshake became a silent battle of wills - Dominic's elegant fingers against Wesley's calloused grip.

The tension became palpable. Even Lillian shifted uncomfortably.

"Are you unwell, Miss Sinclair?" Evelyn asked with false concern, seizing the opportunity to grasp Lillian's arm. Her fingers discreetly tugged at Lillian's hair as she feigned support.

Lillian winced but forced a smile. "Just a passing discomfort. I'll sit for a moment."

Evelyn's mind raced. 'Morning sickness? Is she pregnant?'

"Nonsense," Evelyn insisted, signaling her maid. "Margaret, fetch the stomach medicine from my suite. We can't have guests suffering."

Lillian's grip tightened on her clutch. "That's unnecessary. I dislike medication."

"The Prescotts take hospitality seriously," Evelyn pressed, earning approving murmurs from nearby guests. "We insist."

As Margaret ascended the stairs, Lillian's knuckles turned white. That unmarked bottle could contain anything...
###Chapter 412

Dominic was engaged in conversation with Jonathan, but his attention never strayed far from Evelyn. He noticed her growing discomfort immediately.

Cutting the discussion short, he strode toward her with purposeful steps. His custom-tailored suit accentuated his commanding presence.

Lillian's breath caught when she saw him approaching. No man had ever looked so devastatingly handsome in formal wear.

Dominic's arm slid possessively around Evelyn's waist as he pressed a kiss to her forehead. "What's wrong?" he murmured.

Evelyn felt immediate relief, like a ship finding safe harbor in a storm. "I wasn't feeling well," she admitted quietly. "Ms. Prescott offered me medication. I'd rather not take it..."

She carefully omitted Lillian's aggressive insistence, mindful of their hosts. Business relationships mattered more than personal grievances.

Dominic's gaze turned glacial as it shifted to Lillian. "Are you medically qualified, Ms. Prescott? Would you take responsibility if Evelyn's condition worsened?"

Lillian couldn't meet his piercing stare. "I...I only wanted to help," she stammered. "My apologies. It was thoughtless of me."

Her calculated display of remorse made others perceive Dominic and Evelyn as unreasonable.

Evelyn intervened gently. "It's alright. Ms. Prescott meant well. Let's leave it at that."

Dominic remained silent, steering Evelyn away without another glance at Lillian.

Lillian stood frozen, the sting of rejection lingering.

Dominic had no desire to prolong their stay. After exchanging pleasantries with the Prescotts, he announced their departure. "My father expects us for New Year's Eve dinner."

Jonathan nodded, disappointment flashing across his features. His matchmaking hopes for Dominic and Lillian had clearly failed.

Genevieve clasped Evelyn's hands warmly. "Your designs are exquisite, dear. My father-in-law would love to meet you. Please visit again soon!"

Evelyn smiled graciously. "Of course, Mrs. Prescott. You have my contact details. I'm at your disposal."

As the striking couple departed, Genevieve sighed. "If our biological daughter had lived, she'd be Evelyn's age now..."

Jonathan squeezed his wife's shoulder. "Let the past rest. Leia is our daughter now."

Yet Genevieve couldn't shake the invisible barrier she felt with Lillian, no matter how dutiful the girl appeared.

The drive to Blackwood Manor passed through A City's glittering skyline. Dominic's low-profile luxury car moved smoothly through the nearly deserted streets - most businesses had closed early for the holiday.

The mandatory family dinner proceeded with typical formality. Afterwards, Dominic, Evelyn and their twins returned home.

The usually vibrant city seemed eerily quiet. Occasional fireworks briefly illuminated the skyline, though the council's ban dampened celebrations.

Dominic felt an unfamiliar warmth as he drove. Exhaustion from the long day mingled with profound contentment.

New Year's had always been his loneliest time - until now.

By the time they arrived home, the twins were clamoring for a late snack. Evelyn immediately set to work in the kitchen, filling the mansion with welcoming light and the rich aroma of homemade chicken soup.

As she stirred the pot, Dominic embraced her from behind, nuzzling her neck. "This is the happiest New Year's I've ever known," he murmured.

Their combined shadows stretched across the wall - a stark contrast to the solitary silhouette he'd known for so many years.

Evelyn turned in his arms, rising on tiptoes to brush her lips against his. "And I promise you'll never spend another New Year's alone."
###Chapter 413

New Year's Eve found Evelyn Sinclair and Dominic Blackwood curled up on the sofa with their twins, a simple supper spread before them as the television played in the background.

Neither had eaten much at Blackwood Manor earlier.

Their phones buzzed incessantly with New Year greetings - mostly generic, copied messages. Evelyn responded politely to each one from friends, colleagues, and clients. Dominic, however, only replied to close friends, ignoring the sycophants.

The modest meal was filled with warmth. The twins, exhausted from the day's excitement, went to bed early.

Dominic wanted to carry Evelyn to bed - she was pregnant and clearly exhausted. But she insisted on making a pot pie, a family tradition symbolizing unity and prosperity for the new year.

He resisted, not wanting her to overexert herself. But her pleading eyes broke his resolve. Soon they were back in the kitchen.

The well-stocked fridge provided everything needed. Since the twins loved meat, Evelyn decided on a meat filling. Dominic took charge of the prep work while she directed from her stool.

Following her instructions, he ground pork and beef, adding spices, spring onions, garlic, and seasonings until the filling was perfect. Then came the crust - his nemesis.

No matter how he tried, the dough refused to cooperate. Evelyn burst into laughter at the lumpy, misshapen mess. Who knew the mighty Dominic Blackwood could be bested by pastry?

She took over, expertly lining the pan and sealing the pie. By the time they finished, it was 1 AM.

Curled against Dominic's furnace-like warmth, Evelyn listened to his steady heartbeat. Sometimes she still couldn't believe this was real - that the man she'd idolized as a girl was now her husband.

At 5 AM, firecrackers shattered the predawn quiet. Though banned in A City, some defiant souls kept the tradition alive. Evelyn tried to rise, but Dominic's iron grip held her close.

The usually early-rising Dominic wanted nothing more than to stay in bed with his wife. But their peace was short-lived.

"Wake up, Daddy! Mommy!" Tiny fists pounded their door.

Evelyn smiled at Dominic's grumpy expression as they dressed. For once, he seemed to regret having children interrupting their private time.

Their affluent neighborhood ignored city ordinances completely. Firecrackers popped everywhere, filling the streets with festive chaos.

While Evelyn reheated the pie and set the table, Dominic took the twins outside with a string of firecrackers.

"Why do we set these off, Daddy?"
"Why do we eat pie today?"

Through the window, Evelyn watched Dominic patiently answer their endless questions, her heart swelling with love.

Alexander, ever the daredevil, insisted on lighting one himself. Isabella covered her ears and shrieked at each explosion, running circles around the yard until her brother mischievously tossed a lit firecracker her way.

"You're mean, Alex!" she wailed, scrambling for safety until Dominic scooped her up, shooting a warning look at his son. Alexander fled to Evelyn's protection, giggling uncontrollably.

Breakfast was a joyous affair. Afterwards, they visited Reginald Blackwood, then Reginald Sinclair, where the twins received lucky money from their great-grandfathers. Evelyn encouraged them to save it for something meaningful.

Their final stop was James Kensington's home - an invitation Dominic had repeatedly postponed due to work.

As they drove, Dominic turned on the radio. Both preferred its imaginative simplicity to television. Between songs, a poignant story caught Evelyn's attention...
###Chapter 414

The radio host's voice trembled as she shared the heartbreaking story. An elderly couple in A City had lost their firefighter son in a rescue mission. Their only comfort was their adopted ten-year-old daughter, Savannah, who now battled leukemia.

Dominic Blackwood's grip tightened on the steering wheel. Beside him, Evelyn Sinclair wiped away tears. Their twins, Alexander and Isabella, listened intently from the backseat.

"We have to help them," Evelyn whispered. The address sounded familiar - she'd passed that slum during fieldwork with Abigail Thornton.

Isabella clutched her stuffed unicorn. "Daddy, please? That little girl needs medicine!"

Alexander looked up from his tablet. "We can give them my birthday money too."

Dominic studied his family's determined faces. As CEO of T Corporation, he'd bankrupted competitors without remorse. Charity donations were strategic moves, not acts of compassion. Yet here he was, driving through winding backstreets.

"GPS can't find the address," Dominic admitted after hours of searching. "This might be a scam."

Evelyn shook her head. "What if it's real? That family lost their hero son. Now their daughter..." Her voice broke.

The radio station staff gaped when the Blackwood family entered. The manager nearly spilled his coffee recognizing the billionaire. "Mr. Blackwood! How much are you donating? We'll make headlines—"

"No publicity," Dominic cut in, shielding Evelyn from the man's curious stare. His wife's kindness wasn't for show.

Their guide led them to the city's forgotten outskirts. Rusted tin roofs sagged over crumbling walls. The elderly couple's home reeked of boiled cabbage and despair.

Savannah beamed despite her baldness from chemo. "Visitors!" She offered the twins her only toy - a hand-sewn cloth doll.

Dominic wrote a million-dollar check intended for Oliver Kensington. "For Savannah's treatment," he said, pressing it into the old man's calloused hands.

The wife trembled. "We can't accept—"

Evelyn closed the woman's fingers around the check. "Please. Let your daughter have the childhood your son never got to finish."

As they left, Isabella whispered, "Will Savannah get better now?"

Dominic glanced back at the slum. For the first time, his wealth felt meaningful beyond power. "Yes, princess. Because of you."
###Chapter 415

The tiny apartment felt even smaller with all of us inside. Evelyn turned to the trembling elderly woman. "Your daughter's condition is urgent. She needs immediate treatment. Savannah is still so young—you can't delay this any longer."

She reached into her purse, pulling out an envelope. "Today is New Year's. Let this be our gift to you."

The old woman's wrinkled hands shook as she clutched the envelope. Tears streamed down her face. "No one else came... We never expected kindness like this. May God bless you, my dear benefactors!"

The couple couldn't stop thanking Dominic and Evelyn, their voices thick with emotion. Evelyn gently squeezed the woman's shoulder, offering quiet reassurances.

Meanwhile, by the sick girl's bedside...

Isabella placed her favorite doll and a small pouch of coins into Savannah's frail hands.

Her voice was sweet, still carrying the innocence of childhood. "Big Sis, this is my most special doll. I want you to have her." She leaned in closer, whispering conspiratorially. "And this is all my New Year's money from Great-Grandpa and Aunt Beatrice. But don't tell Alexander—Uncle Julian gave me more than him! It's our secret, okay?"

She shot a smug glance at her brother, who pretended not to care.

Alexander rolled his eyes but kept his cool facade. He wasn't about to indulge his little sister's theatrics.

Savannah giggled, charmed by their sibling dynamic. She hooked her pinky with Isabella's. "I promise I won't tell."

Meeting these two had been the brightest spot in her otherwise bleak holiday.

Isabella's big, hopeful eyes blinked up at her. "Will I see you again, Big Sis?"

Savannah didn't hesitate. "Of course we will."

She had no idea their next meeting would be under very different circumstances—as rivals.

After saying their goodbyes, Dominic's family headed toward James Kensington's estate. But halfway there, James called, sounding flustered.

"Something came up," he muttered, voice strained. The call ended abruptly—but not before Dominic caught a distinctly feminine moan in the background.

He shrugged it off. James had always been a playboy. Probably tangled up with another fling.

No sooner had James hung up than Preston Worthington Sr. called, inviting them over instead.

With Evelyn's approval, Dominic turned the car toward the Worthington mansion.

Inside the lavish master bedroom...

Preston Worthington Jr. lounged against silk pillows, one leg in a cast, the other propped arrogantly on an antique side table.

Two naked women draped themselves over his bare chest, their skilled hands working desperately below his waist.

But nothing.

"Come on, baby," the brunette purred, arching her back. "You know you want me."

The blonde rivaled her efforts, but it was useless.

The organ that had once brought them both to screaming ecstasy now lay limp and unresponsive.

"Get out!" Preston roared, shoving them off the bed.

His face twisted in fury. This shouldn't be happening.

The mysterious car accident two months ago had shattered his leg—and apparently his manhood. No matter how beautiful the woman, his body refused to cooperate.

The thought terrified him. What good was his fortune if he couldn't enjoy this basic pleasure?

Worse, despite his brother's underworld connections, the perpetrator remained elusive. The driver had been terrifyingly skilled, deliberately aiming to kill. Preston still woke in cold sweats, reliving the moment of impact.

The car had fake plates. The vehicle vanished afterward. Every lead turned into a dead end. It was like chasing a ghost.

Preston's grip tore through the expensive bedding. When he found whoever did this, he'd make them suffer.

The brunette—his usual favorite—crawled back, reaching for him again. "Let me try one more—"

In a flash, Preston yanked open the nightstand drawer, pulled out a sleek pistol, and pressed it to her forehead. "I said get out."

Both women scrambled for the door, barely remembering to grab their clothes.

Alone, Preston glared at his useless body. This wasn't over. Not by a long shot.
###Chapter 416

Worthington Residence

Dominic lounged lazily on the couch, his left arm wrapped around the quiet Evelyn while his right hand swirled a crystal wine glass.

Preston Sr. adored fine wine, particularly reds. His collection spanned the globe.

Recently, an earl from England had gifted him a crate of premium vintage. Preston had invited Dominic, Julian, and a few close friends over for a tasting.

Dominic wasn’t much of a drinker. Alcohol clouded judgment, and he preferred clarity.

But Preston was an old friend, so he’d made an exception.

He’d sent the twins home since he’d be drinking. Only he and Evelyn had come.

Julian sat across from them, watching as Dominic set down his glass to peel a grape for Evelyn.

When he held it to her lips, she hesitated, but resistance was futile.

Julian gaped, horrified by the display of affection.

Was this really Dominic Blackwood? The ruthless tycoon known as the Ice King?

Julian smirked. "You two are inseparable now. Got any sisters, Evelyn? I need a girlfriend like you. Any recommendations?"

Before she could answer, Dominic popped the grape into her mouth. "Don’t bother. Evelyn’s one of a kind. Well, there’s her stepsister—Sophia, was it? Currently serving time. Feel free to visit her in prison."

Evelyn burst out laughing.

Julian nearly choked.

That’s how you treat a friend?

Dominic had never introduced him to anyone. And the first suggestion was a convict?

Julian shot Evelyn a wounded look. "See how he bullies me? Help a guy out. Introduce me to someone decent."

Evelyn blinked. "The women I know are all taken. If I meet someone, I’ll let you know."

She thought of Olivia.

Kind, resilient, loyal—qualities rare in anyone.

Julian was witty, caring, and a brilliant doctor. They’d make a good match.

But Olivia had just escaped hell. Men were the last thing she needed right now.

Better to wait.

Preston sipped his wine from a massage chair, his ethereal beauty as striking as ever. "Harvard-educated and still single? Pathetic. Take notes from Dominic. Maybe you’ll have triplets by next year."

Julian groaned.

As if taking advice from Dominic would help.

Before Evelyn, the man had been a glacier—untouchable, terrifying.

Dominic handed Evelyn a glass. "Merlot-Cabernet blend. Purple hue, rich flavor. Smell it."

She inhaled. She wasn’t a connoisseur, but the aroma was intoxicating—berries, honey, vanilla.

"Amazing. I can almost taste it already."

Preston grinned. "Take a few bottles home."

Julian scoffed. "Unbelievable. I begged you for one yesterday, and you refused. Now you’re handing them out? Some friend."

Preston rolled his eyes. "Bring a wife next time, and you can have whatever you want."

Julian glared. "Says the man who’s never even dated. At least I’ve had girlfriends. You? I bet even the flies around you are male."

A shadow crossed Preston’s face, gone as quickly as it appeared.

Dominic smirked but stayed silent.

Only he knew about the woman who haunted Preston’s past.

Dominic’s obsidian gaze swept the room, regal even as he drank. But when he turned to Evelyn, his expression softened.

Love really was magic, the two bachelors mused.

A butler hurried in, whispering to Preston. His face darkened.

"Family emergency. Make yourselves at home."

He and Julian rushed out.

Evelyn tugged Dominic’s sleeve. "What happened to Preston Jr.? Didn’t he just recover from a car crash?"

She still seethed over what he’d done to Olivia.

The crash two months ago had been satisfying—karma at work.

Dominic kissed her lightly, his breath warm against her ear. "I arranged that crash. Shattered his leg. And from what I hear, he’s… permanently impaired now."

He pulled back, watching her.

"Revenge enough for your friend?"
###Chapter 417

Evelyn's mouth fell open as she stared at Dominic.

She had assumed Preston's accident was just that—an accident. Never in her wildest dreams did she imagine it was orchestrated.

What shocked her more was discovering the ruthless side of this man who always carried himself with such refined elegance.

Evelyn thought Dominic would use his influence to ensure Preston faced legal consequences. She never expected him to arrange a car crash.

Watching him converse casually with Preston Sr. left her speechless.

Preston was Preston Sr.'s younger brother, yet Dominic spoke to him as if nothing had happened. His composure was unnerving.

If it were her, Preston Sr.'s piercing gaze would have exposed her guilt instantly.

Evelyn nervously wet her lips. "Preston and Preston Sr. are brothers. What if he finds out you caused the crash? Won't he become your enemy?"

Dominic's gaze dropped to her lips, darkening with desire.

He kissed her softly, amused by her flustered reaction. "Don't worry. I don't leave traces. Preston Sr. isn't a fool, but neither am I."

Evelyn frowned. "But you—"

Dominic simply watched her, unshaken.

Seeing his calm demeanor, she sighed. "Fine. I trust you. But this is too dangerous. Violence isn't the answer. The law should handle criminals."

Warmth spread through Dominic's chest at her concern.

He didn't argue. Instead, he pulled her into a tight embrace.

Evelyn was naive. The law worked for most, but a select few operated above it—those with power, wealth, or both. Preston was one of them.

Even if convicted, the Worthington family could bail him out within days.

For men like Preston, only violence delivered true justice.

But Evelyn didn’t need to know that. His job was to keep her safe in her bubble of idealism.

The caretaker opened Preston's door for Preston Sr. and Julian. They were met with a furious roar.

"Get out! Useless! Weeks and no progress! I should shoot you all!"

A glass flew toward the door, nearly hitting Preston Sr. in the face. He caught it just in time.

Preston Sr. strode forward, expression stormy.

The room was filled with A City's top urologists, all trembling under Preston's wrath. He held a gun, barrel pointed at their heads.

Their relief was palpable when Julian entered.

Julian Whitmore was a medical genius, renowned worldwide. Eccentric and unpredictable, he refused even the wealthiest clients—unless the mood struck him.

Now, he looked amused. "All of A City's urology experts gathered here? Having a party for Second Young Master Worthington's... little problem?"

The doctors stayed silent, terrified of the gun in Preston's hand.

Preston's glare turned icy. He swung the gun toward Julian. "Who the hell are you? Dare to mock me?"

Preston Sr.'s voice cut in, authoritative. "Mind your manners. This is Dr. Whitmore, here to treat you."

Preston laughed mockingly. "Him? That pretty-faced weakling? A doctor? You're joking."

Julian remained unfazed.

Without a word, he flipped Preston's blanket aside, produced silver needles, and inserted them into precise points on Preston's groin.

A scream tore through the room.

"Ah! What did you do?! It burns! I can't move! Kill him, brother!"

Julian crossed his arms, watching impassively.

"Enough games," Preston Sr. warned.

Julian removed the needles. "I'm the only one who can fix you. Be polite, or say goodbye to ever getting it up again."

Rage burned in Preston's bloodshot eyes.

But beneath the fury, hope flickered.

If this man could cure him, he'd swallow his pride.

And Julian had proven his skill. The needles brought agony—but also something new. A warmth. A sensation he hadn't felt in months.
###Chapter 418

Preston's despair transformed into joy at the unexpected news.

His attitude toward Julian softened slightly, though suspicion still lingered in his gaze. "You're a doctor?" he demanded.

Preston had always been a playboy. Fast cars, luxury yachts, exclusive nightclubs, and beautiful women were his only concerns. The world beyond his hedonistic pursuits remained a mystery to him.

He had no idea Julian Whitmore was a renowned figure in medical circles.

Julian crossed his arms, looking down at Preston with visible disdain. "Board certified."

Preston's nostrils flared. "Name your price if you can cure me!"

Julian scoffed. "That's rich coming from you. If your brother Preston Sr. made that offer, I might consider it - at least his word means something in this city. But you? Please."

Preston's face turned ashen with rage.

The barb struck true. Within the Worthington family hierarchy, Preston Jr. ranked far below his formidable older brother. In looks, status, resources, or capability, he couldn't hold a candle to the cunning and accomplished Preston Sr.

As the youngest Worthington son, Preston had been spoiled rotten since childhood. While excelling at extravagance, he lacked any sense of responsibility or moral compass.

Everyone knew Preston Worthington Sr. was the golden child - his promises carried weight. Meanwhile, the younger Worthington was just another trust fund brat living off family money.

Being compared to his brother always ignited Preston's fury. Preston Sr. loomed like an insurmountable mountain - no matter how hard he tried, he could never measure up...

Preston slammed his fist into the mattress. Silent tears streamed down his face as a fierce determination took root.

No more. He would prove his worth to the Worthingtons. He would accomplish something remarkable.

The new year passed in the blink of an eye.

For Evelyn, these days overflowed with contentment.

Dominic surprised her with thoughtful gifts regularly. Their twins behaved impeccably, requiring minimal supervision. Only the little one in her womb caused distress - morning sickness plagued her relentlessly. She could barely keep food down.

Dominic grew increasingly frantic.

He resented their unborn child for tormenting Evelyn. This little demon already wreaked havoc before birth - what chaos would it unleash afterward? For the first time, he regretted impregnating her.

Whenever the baby caused Evelyn discomfort, Dominic would scold her belly.

Evelyn found his behavior endearingly childish. How could a fetus possibly understand him?

Julian administered IV treatments for several days before her condition improved.

Eventually, Beatrice discovered Evelyn's pregnancy. Though drowning in her own sorrows, this was her grandchild. To maintain peace, Beatrice chose avoidance - shopping with society friends, spa treatments, beauty appointments. She rarely returned before nightfall.

Moreover, Evelyn and Dominic primarily resided in their penthouse, seldom staying at Blackwood Manor. Their paths rarely crossed, minimizing unnecessary conflict.

The happiest Blackwood was Reginald.

The patriarch always desired a large family. Initially concerned about the Blackwood lineage, Evelyn had already blessed him with great-grandchildren. Now expecting another, Reginald beamed constantly, declaring Evelyn the family's lucky star.

He promised lavish rewards regardless of the baby's gender.

Margaret Lockwood endured the most tedious New Year's celebrations.

Since learning of Evelyn's pregnancy, her venomous glares followed Evelyn's belly with such intensity others noticed. Evelyn pitied the woman betrayed by her husband, but those judgmental stares made her skin crawl.

Despite Reginald's authority, Evelyn avoided the oppressive atmosphere of Blackwood Manor.

Time marched on. The eighth arrived - back to work.

Dominic urged Evelyn to rest at home, but idleness didn't suit her. With her barely noticeable bump and excellent health, she insisted on returning to the office.

Knowing her stubbornness, Dominic relented. He'd assign light duties to minimize stress.

Unaware of his plans, Evelyn happily prepared for work.

After six months of dedication, she'd secured major contracts. Thrilled her designs earned client appreciation, she'd even drafted first-quarter goals and project plans at home.

Upon entering T Corporation's design department, Evelyn noticed employees staring - particularly Bernadette, whose smirk oozed schadenfreude.

Confused, Evelyn approached her workstation.

As she moved to sit, she spotted a fashionably dressed woman in oversized sunglasses occupying Abigail's seat. The stranger's back faced her, but her posture screamed beauty.

Even from a distance, Evelyn sensed her icy arrogance.

The aura felt familiar - reminiscent of Dominic.

Evelyn's confusion grew. Who was this intimidating woman making colleagues tremble? Instinct warned this wasn't someone to cross.

Olivia discreetly shielded her mouth, mouthing two words: "Vivienne Laurent..."

Hearing that long-absent name, recalling the lace panties in Dominic's car, Evelyn's heart plummeted. Ms. Laurent had returned.

Evelyn froze as Vivienne shifted her stiletto, swiveling the chair gracefully to face her.

The woman's glacial demeanor stole Evelyn's breath.
###Chapter 419

Vivienne Laurent stared at Evelyn Sinclair with icy detachment. The sight of Evelyn's delicate features and gentle gaze made her fists clench involuntarily. A flicker of envy twisted her otherwise composed expression.

"Can I help you, Ms. Laurent?" Evelyn greeted her with a soft, polite smile.

Vivienne remained silent, her chin tilted slightly upward in quiet arrogance.

Her sharp eyes studied Evelyn with unnerving stillness. This woman unsettled her in ways no other had.

She had never felt threatened by the countless women who threw themselves at Dominic Blackwood. She knew better—Dominic had built an impenetrable wall around himself, and every woman who tried to breach it had failed spectacularly.

For years, Vivienne had stood by his side, watching as he remained indifferent to every advance. Yet Evelyn was the exception.

Her instincts screamed that Evelyn was different.

The realization sent a chill down her spine. The fear of losing Dominic’s attention to another woman was paralyzing.

Bernadette Worthing, the design department lead, was her informant within T Corporation. While Vivienne had been stationed at another branch, Bernadette kept her updated on Dominic’s interactions. She needed to know if any woman dared to make a move in her absence.

None had ever concerned her—not even Lillian Prescott or Seraphina Prescott, despite their wealthy backgrounds.

But Evelyn was unlike any of them.

According to Bernadette, the usually unshakable Dominic had bent his own rules repeatedly for Evelyn. That alone was enough to put Vivienne on high alert.

Vivienne rose from the revolving chair, her fitted skirt accentuating her slender waist and curves.

She stepped closer to Evelyn, her voice dropping to a venomous whisper, her expression darkening where no one else could see.

"Ms. Sinclair, T Corporation is a global enterprise. As an employee, you should know your place. Focus on your work and stay away from what doesn’t belong to you. Office romances are strictly prohibited here—do I make myself clear?"

Her smile remained, but it was cold enough to freeze the air between them.

Evelyn barely blinked.

Since when did a supervisor have the right to dictate her personal life?

True, T Corporation had a policy against workplace relationships. The reasoning was sound—emotional entanglements could cloud judgment, compromise confidentiality, and create conflicts of interest.

But Dominic had already confided in Evelyn that he planned to abolish the rule after the 15th. Not even Sebastian Whitmore knew yet.

The irony of Vivienne’s threat almost made her laugh.

Evelyn’s lips curved into a serene smile. "Ms. Laurent, if there are any issues with my work, I welcome your guidance. But my personal affairs are none of your concern. Everyone has their own path. I’ve never crossed any lines, so I’m afraid I don’t understand what you’re implying."

Vivienne’s eyes narrowed at Evelyn’s feigned innocence. "You’re smarter than this, Ms. Sinclair. At your age, you should be settling down. I could introduce you to some eligible bachelors. A woman’s place isn’t in the corporate grind—it’s at home, raising children."

Evelyn tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, her smile sweet but razor-sharp. "How kind of you to worry, Ms. Laurent. But I thrive in my career—it gives me purpose. A woman shouldn’t be defined by love or a man. Financial independence is freedom. Besides, I’m only 24. You, however, must be… what, 29? If you have such excellent bachelors in mind, shouldn’t you be prioritizing your own love life first?"

Vivienne’s expression frosted over.

She hadn’t expected Evelyn—this seemingly fragile woman—to retaliate with such precision.

"Work hard, Ms. Sinclair. I hope you have a bright future here." Vivienne raised her voice deliberately, ensuring nearby eavesdroppers heard only professionalism.

As a supervisor, she couldn’t afford to let petty conflicts tarnish her reputation.

With one last icy glare, she turned on her heel and strode away.

She had underestimated Evelyn. This wasn’t some meek pushover—this was a wolf in sheep’s clothing, and the realization left her deeply unsettled.

Once Vivienne was gone, Evelyn sank into her chair, exhaustion weighing on her.

Vivienne’s words echoed in her mind, making her temples throb.

First, there was Lillian Prescott, still circling Dominic like a vulture. Now, Vivienne Laurent had entered the fray—far more cunning and dangerous.

Unlike Lillian’s blatant hostility, Vivienne was calculated, her threats wrapped in false concern.

How exhausting it must be to wear a mask every single day.

Olivia Kensington sidled up to Evelyn, curiosity gleaming in her eyes. "What did Ms. Laurent say to you?"

She knew Vivienne wasn’t the type to offer encouragement. The woman rarely acknowledged junior employees unless it served her.

Evelyn shook her head, organizing the files on her desk. "Nothing important. Just work matters. Speaking of which, the Vivi Group project is underway. I’ve added you to the design team. Let’s make this a success."

Olivia grabbed Evelyn’s hand, her eyes shimmering with gratitude. "Thank you, Evie."

She knew her skills weren’t the strongest in the department. This opportunity had Evelyn’s fingerprints all over it.
###Chapter 420

Evelyn had been completely swamped since the urban renewal project with Vivi Group commenced.

Dominic, concerned about her pregnancy, assigned her the lightest tasks. But Evelyn stubbornly insisted on completing her entire workload.

Though they kept their relationship discreet, the design department employees had silently recognized the bond between Dominic and Evelyn.

Despite proving her competence repeatedly since joining six months ago, many still dismissed her as just another pretty face.

She worked tirelessly to demonstrate her worth.

That morning, Evelyn met with city officials from Housing Development, Land Resources, and Urban Planning departments. She absorbed their renovation suggestions, analyzed existing issues, and strategized next steps.

By afternoon, she defied Dominic's protests to conduct a site visit with her team.

Her determination left Dominic no choice but to ensure daily tonics for her health. Yet despite his efforts, Evelyn still lost weight that week.

During lunch, Olivia Kensington gasped at Evelyn's gaunt appearance. "You're skin and bones! Eat more fish - it's good for the baby." She piled Evelyn's plate high.

"Thank you," Evelyn murmured, cheeks flushing as Abigail Thornton and Gregory Peterson stifled giggles nearby. Even Dominic's brother Julian showed concern - surely the Blackwoods were accepting her?

Bernadette Worthing glared from another table, cutlery clenched. How dare Evelyn flirt so brazenly with the General Manager?

Julian flashed his trademark charming grin. "Lunch is on me today, everyone! Order whatever you want!"

The staff cheered. "Really, General Manager?"

"Would this handsome face lie?" Julian teased, prompting laughter throughout the cafeteria.

Before leaving, Julian leaned close to Evelyn. "Dominic values this project, but don't overwork yourself. If anything happens to you, he'd be devastated."

Evelyn warmed at his kindness. "I understand."

"Come to me anytime with work issues," Julian added before departing.

Evelyn watched him go, surprised by his transformation. The former clown had become responsible since New Year's, lightening Dominic's workload.

Olivia and Abigail immediately pounced. "The General Manager cares so much! Has the family accepted you?"

"It's complicated," Evelyn admitted, unconsciously touching her stomach. She hadn't revealed her pregnancy, not even to friends who'd restrict her work if they knew.

"Anyway, you're perfect for our CEO!" Abigail gushed. "With Dominic by your side, nothing can stop you two!"

Olivia analyzed: "The real obstacles are Reginald Blackwood and Beatrice Lockwood. But grandparents love babies - once you're pregnant again, Reginald will approve fastest. As for Beatrice... well, mother-in-law relationships are tricky. But you already have Alexander and Isabella - just live separately after marriage."

Evelyn smiled ruefully. "We'll manage. Abigail, your baby's due soon - any plans?"

"I'll raise it alone," Abigail said breezily, devouring spicy food.

Olivia's face fell, remembering her forced abortion. She lowered her head, heart breaking.

Evelyn instantly regretted her carelessness. "About the project designs - any initial thoughts?"

Olivia brightened, launching into ideas as Evelyn exhaled in relief. She'd spend a lifetime making amends to Olivia.

At 8:45 PM, Evelyn still worked on designs when her phone startled her.

Dominic's low, angry voice demanded: "It's late. Why are you still working?"
###Chapter 421

A shiver ran down Evelyn's spine at Dominic's furious tone.

Oh no. She'd been so absorbed in work that she completely disregarded his explicit orders about not overexerting herself. He'd strictly forbidden overtime at the company.

"I'll be finished soon..." Evelyn's voice came through clearly on the phone.

Dominic remained silent for a beat. Then his voice sharpened. "I specifically instructed Bernadette to assign you light tasks. Did she disobey me?"

"No..." Evelyn fumbled awkwardly. "Everyone else is swamped. It wouldn't look right if I'm the only one not contributing. Besides, this urban renewal project is crucial—"

Her left hand held the phone while her right continued moving the cursor across her design drafts. Stacks of documents surrounded her.

"If I hadn't called, how late were you planning to stay?" Dominic's tone turned icy.

"Um... maybe another thirty minutes?" She glanced at the clock in the corner of her screen. "Time flies when I'm focused."

Normally, Lawrence drove Evelyn home. Dominic, being a workaholic, often stayed late himself. On rare evenings when he left early, they'd go home together.

Dominic sighed deeply. "What am I going to do with you?"

The line went dead without warning.

Evelyn blinked at the abrupt disconnection, then shook her head. No point overanalyzing.

Facing the mountain of paperwork and unfinished designs on her computer made her head spin.

She grabbed her facial mist, spritzed herself awake, and dove back into work.

In the vast empty office, only the clicking of her mouse broke the silence.

When uninterrupted, Evelyn worked with remarkable efficiency. Before she knew it, thirty minutes had passed, and she neared completion.

She considered finishing before heading to the CEO's office, but knowing Dominic's temper, he'd be furious if she stayed past nine.

Evelyn saved her progress, copied files to her flash drive, and began packing up to complete the work at home.

As she organized her materials, footsteps sounded behind her.

Evelyn froze.

The office should have been deserted at this hour.

Yesterday's accidental click on a "Haunted Office Buildings" video flashed through her mind.

Panicked, she grabbed the nearest object—a heavy pen holder—and hurled it toward the sound.

"Attempting spousal homicide?" A deep male voice chuckled before strong arms enveloped her.

Evelyn looked up in shock to find Dominic. He held her with one arm while the other hand clutched the projectile she'd launched. Heat flooded her cheeks.

"Sorry! I thought—I didn't realize—" She hastily retrieved the pen holder, mortification burning her face.

"Let's go. It's the Light Festival tonight. I'm taking you somewhere." Dominic's eyes held nothing but tenderness.

Under the office lights, his chiseled profile appeared even more striking, his jawline impossibly perfect.

Evelyn nodded obediently. She quickly organized her documents into her bag before beaming up at him. "Ready!"

Dominic ruffled her hair as they left.

Their BMW glided toward a historic town outside the city. Dominic played Evelyn's favorite violin concertos—light, uplifting melodies that made the hour-long drive feel like minutes.

The festival had drawn massive crowds. Parking should have been impossible, but Dominic had arranged for space at a luxury hotel owned by an acquaintance.

After parking, he took Evelyn's hand as they wandered the cobblestone streets.

Phoenix Town, a thousand-year-old northern treasure, ranked among the nation's most enchanting destinations, famous for its nighttime beauty.

Lanterns glowed above every doorway, casting warm light on smiling faces below, transporting visitors to another era.

Clutching Dominic's arm, Evelyn marveled, "This is so different from my hometown. Ours resembles Peaceful Town—ebony window frames, tiled roofs, that merchant compound grandeur. But here... it's like walking through a painting. So tranquil..."

Dominic adjusted her coat belt tenderly. "As long as you're happy."

Though born in the north, Evelyn lacked the region's typical boldness, instead embodying southern grace. He'd known she'd adore this town's dreamy ambiance and made time to bring her here despite his packed schedule.

For the first time ever, he'd skipped the traditional family Light Festival dinner at Blackwood Manor for this.

The striking couple drew admiring glances from passersby even as they admired the lanterns.

Countless red lanterns stretched endlessly, their glow softening Evelyn's features until Dominic's chest ached.

He'd never cared for holidays before. Meeting Evelyn had changed everything.
###Chapter 422

The narrow alley buzzed with tourists clutching vibrant lanterns, their faces glowing with delight.

For Dominic Blackwood, this was his first real experience of the Light Festival celebrations.

Thousands of lanterns dangled beneath the eaves, each symbolizing reunion and hope.

Noticing others carrying their own, Dominic purchased one for Evelyn—a stunning oval design wrapped in crimson roses that seemed to bloom when the candle inside flickered to life. Golden dragons coiled around its frame, their scales shimmering as if alive under the warm light. Evelyn adored it.

Watching her radiant smile as she twirled the lantern, Dominic chuckled. "I never realized how vibrant the Light Festival could be."

In previous years, he'd spent the occasion buried in work or sharing a drink with associates at the club. Never like this—carefree, immersed in tradition.

Evelyn gripped the lantern in one hand and his fingers in the other. "This festival has lasted over two millennia," she mused. "Our ancestors created these traditions to break life's monotony. If they knew how to celebrate, shouldn't we embrace it too?"

She looked breathtaking.

There was an effortless allure about her, especially when she laughed. Dominic's mind flashed to their first meeting—a quiet girl sitting beneath a tree while her classmates played. Her gentle profile had caught his eye, and when she'd smiled at a whispered joke, the warmth of it had stayed with him.

He'd been right about her. Evelyn had a tenderness that could soften even the hardest edges.

Now, with the girl he'd once admired beside him, he pulled her close, savoring the night.

He bought her an array of street snacks, though he monitored her intake—she was carrying their child, after all.

When they reached an arched bridge, Dominic led her onto a sightseeing boat. Crowds weren't his preference, so he rented the entire vessel, ensuring their privacy and safety.

His extravagance drew irritated glances, but the tourists quickly noted his designer attire and the seven-figure watch on his wrist. No one dared protest.

As the boat glided forward, Dominic wrapped Evelyn in his arms. She sat on a woven bamboo chair, admiring the riverside lights but frowning slightly. "You didn’t have to book the whole boat. It’s unfair to others."

He brushed a strand of hair from her face. "Too many people mean unpredictability. I won’t risk your safety—or our child’s."

Evelyn fell silent, touched by his protectiveness.

The boat moved smoothly, lanterns along the banks forming a dazzling river of light. Reds and golds streaked past like falling stars.

Across the water, fireworks erupted, their reflections dancing on the waves. The spectacle felt dreamlike, yet the warmth of Dominic’s hand in hers anchored her to reality.

She didn’t know what he was thinking, but his presence alone filled her with contentment.

The boatman, a chatty young man, engaged them after setting the autopilot. "You should visit Gentle Brook," he suggested. "Their lantern display made the evening news—spectacular!"

Dominic nodded, rubbing Evelyn’s hands between his to keep them warm. "We’ll go."

The boatman grinned. "Newlyweds? You two look perfect together."

Evelyn flushed, but Dominic answered smoothly, "Married for years. Our twins are almost five, and we’re expecting another."

The boatman’s eyes widened. "No way! Your wife looks so young!"

"Ten years together," Dominic added casually.

The boatman gaped. Ten years ago? He went after her when she was just a kid? His expression shifted from admiration to horrified disbelief.

Evelyn bit back a laugh, shaking her head. She’d never expected her usually stoic partner to have such a mischievous side.
###Chapter 423

Hole! 1

Evelyn and Dominic were still lost in their passionate embrace.

Meanwhile, Lillian Prescott was having the worst day of her life.

In a luxury hotel suite.

Lillian stood naked beside the king-sized bed, staring at the equally naked man sleeping soundly. Her eyes burned with pure hatred.

Wesley Thornton!

This man had ruined everything. He'd blackmailed her with compromising photos, forcing her to endure unspeakable acts.

She couldn't refuse.

If those photos got out, she'd become the laughingstock of high society. Her acting career would be over instantly.

Even with her adoptive father being Governor Jonathan Prescott, Lillian couldn't risk her future.

She slipped out of bed silently, wincing at the sharp pain between her legs.

"Bastard," she muttered, hating Wesley even more. The brute had no concept of gentleness, taking her roughly until she passed out - only to start again when she came to.

After a quick shower, Lillian wrapped herself in a plush towel. As she reached for her clothes, something caught her eye.

A fruit knife on the coffee table.

Her pulse quickened. A dangerous idea took root.

She concealed the knife in her towel and padded silently across the thick carpet toward the sleeping man. Her gaze fixed on his exposed throat.

Blind rage clouded her judgment.

Lillian slid the knife under the pillow before letting her towel drop. For the first time, she initiated contact, pressing herself against Wesley's half-asleep form.

Her lips trailed down his collarbone with false passion.

Wesley was already awake.

He'd sensed her movement immediately but kept his eyes closed, still exhausted from their earlier activities.

Her sudden enthusiasm surprised him. Though suspicious, desire quickly overtook reason.

But Lillian's eyes remained cold as ice. There wasn't an ounce of real desire in them.

As Wesley thrust into her, Lillian's fingers closed around the hidden knife. With all her strength, she stabbed downward!

She expected to see blood spray across the sheets...

Bright red liquid did flow - but not from him.

Wesley's furious gaze locked onto hers. He could snap her neck with minimal effort. His voice came out in a dangerous growl. "I stopped believing in God or trusting women the day I was born. When you hid that knife, I prayed you wouldn't use it. Guess prayers don't work."

Years of combat training had honed his instincts. Even in passion, part of him remained alert.

When Lillian struck, Wesley twisted her wrist effortlessly. The blade plunged into her own left hand instead.

He laughed darkly, his movements turning punishing. "Ms. Prescott, trained assassins have tried to kill me. Did you really think you could? Behave, or I'll ruin you publicly. Not even your precious Governor father could save you then."

Agony radiated from her hand and lower body. Lillian squeezed her eyes shut, hiding her simmering hatred.

If she couldn't kill him today, she'd make him pay eventually.

Later, wrapped in layers to conceal the bruises, Lillian wandered the streets like a ghost, tears soaking her scarf repeatedly.

The world felt vast yet offered no refuge.

Would her adoptive parents defend her if they knew?

Perhaps her father would confront the Thornton family. But with their equal political influence, the best outcome would be a forced marriage - destroying her pristine reputation.

And she despised Wesley.

The brute was everything she hated - crude, vulgar, unbearably macho. The polar opposite of Dominic's refined elegance.

As the Norman heiress, she deserved only the best. Not some lecherous thug.

Lost in misery, a grimy hand suddenly grabbed her coat. "Found you at last, Lillian! Been searching everywhere!"

She recoiled in disgust at the homeless-looking man. "You're mistaken. I don't know you!"

His stench made her gag. Had he not bathed in years? And he'd dared touch her designer coat!

As she stormed toward the parking lot, his shout froze her: "Your childhood nickname was Coco because you were darker! Your birth mother Susanna named you! And you've got an apple-shaped birthmark under your left arm!"

Lillian whirled around, blood running cold.

Who was this man? How did he know such intimate details?
###Chapter 424

Lillian Prescott stared intently at the disheveled homeless man.

Even covered in grime and looking utterly exhausted, there was something unsettlingly familiar about his face.

A chill ran down her spine as she met his bloodshot, filmy eyes.

Then it hit her like a freight train.

The man who drank himself into stupors, gambled away their last dime, and beat her mother black and blue—her biological father.

Donovan Sinclair.

Her mother had lost an eye and broken multiple bones under his relentless abuse. Lillian's own back still bore the scars from his belt.

This man was the reason for every nightmare.

Worse than trash, he'd forced his wife into prostitution to fund his gambling. He'd even tried to sell his own daughter for pocket change.

She'd only escaped because she was smart enough to run.

As the memories flooded back, Lillian's entire body went rigid with revulsion. Every instinct screamed at her to flee.

But outwardly, she remained perfectly composed.

Coolly sliding on her sunglasses, her voice turned arctic. "I don't know you. Stop harassing random women or I'll have you arrested for attempted kidnapping."

She moved to step around him toward the parking lot.

"Lillian! Don't walk away from your own father!" The homeless man spread his grimy arms, blocking her path. "After all I sacrificed for you? Is this how you repay me?"

The stench of alcohol and unwashed flesh made her gag. Lillian spun on her heel and sprinted to the security booth.

Tugging off her silk scarf, she let tears well up as she addressed the guards. "Please help me. That man's been following me. I'm terrified."

Though not Hollywood A-list, Lillian's face was recognizable from numerous indie films.

The guards—usually ignored by glamorous actresses—swelled with protective fury. "We'll handle this, Ms. Prescott."

Electroshock batons crackled as they intercepted the staggering drunk. "Trespassers aren't welcome here. Get lost!"

The man wiped his dirty hands on his tattered coat. "That's my daughter! I just want to talk—"

The taller guard snorted. "Ms. Prescott? Your daughter? Are you delusional? She's the governor's adopted child. Now scram before we get serious!"

Ignoring them, the man shouted after Lillian. "Remember the cotton candy I bought you at the park? Come home, Lillian! I've searched for years!"

Leaning weakly against the booth wall, Lillian let a single tear fall. "He's clearly disturbed. Please make him leave..."

Nothing moved men faster than a beautiful woman in distress.

The batons struck with a sickening zap. The homeless man collapsed, twitching violently.

Lillian felt no pity—only cold satisfaction.

A smirk played on her lips as she walked away. If only they'd finished the job.

She slid into her convertible and peeled out without a backward glance.

Meanwhile in Phoenix Town...

As night fell, Dominic Blackwood escorted Evelyn Sinclair onto a gondola to admire the illuminated waterways.

The riverside promenade glittered with elaborate lantern displays—playful rabbits, proud peacocks, sinuous dragons. Every few yards revealed new marvels.

Giant lotus lanterns floated on the water, their petals rippling in the artificial mist. The effect was downright magical.

Evelyn gasped at each new discovery like an enchanted child. Dominic followed silently, his stern features softening whenever she turned to share her delight.

The lanterns meant nothing to him. But watching her eyes sparkle? That was everything.

Each time they passed a particularly stunning display, he'd press a kiss to her hair. This simple intimacy warmed him more than any lantern ever could.

When Evelyn began yawning, Dominic immediately summoned a private boat back to their luxury bed-and-breakfast.

Their suite featured a lavish bathroom with floor-to-ceiling glass overlooking the nightscape. After disinfecting the jacuzzi, Dominic lifted Evelyn into the steaming water.

Just as he joined her, violent thuds erupted from the adjacent room.

A woman's breathy moans mingled with a man's guttural commands: "Harder... yes, just like that..."

Evelyn's cheeks pinked at the unmistakable sounds. Dominic frowned.

That voice... why did it sound so familiar?
###Chapter 425

The night was thick with shadows, wrapping around them like a velvet cloak.

Silence finally settled in the next room after what felt like hours of unrestrained passion.

Dominic had been stirred by the sounds. His hands moved carefully as he washed Evelyn's body, starting with gentle, controlled strokes. But soon, his restraint began to crumble.

Her skin carried the delicate scent of violets—fresh, intoxicating, impossible to ignore.

The warmth of the water mirrored the heat rising in his veins.

His touch grew bolder, tracing the curves he knew so well.

Exhausted but still aware, Evelyn caught his wrist.

"No," she murmured. "The doctor said the first three months are too risky. It could hurt the baby."

Dominic had kept his distance since learning of her pregnancy, though it hadn't been easy. He prided himself on self-control, but with her, it vanished.

"I won't hurt you," he promised, pulling her close until their bodies melded together. "Or our child."

His gaze locked onto hers, darker than the night outside. The effort to hold back left his forehead damp with sweat, his jaw tight with tension.

Evelyn's heart ached at the sight.

She hesitated, then whispered, "If... if it's too much, I can... help you another way."

Without meeting his eyes, she reached down.

Dominic hadn't expected this. His breath hitched as he watched her, cheeks flushed, lashes lowered. The sight reminded him of their first night together—electric, unforgettable.

Nearly an hour later, Evelyn's fingers were stiff, but Dominic finally found release.

He exhaled, satisfied, then carefully cleaned them both before carrying her to bed.

Pregnancy drained her quickly.

The moment her head touched the pillow, she curled into the blankets and was asleep within seconds.

Dominic brushed a strand of hair from her face, watching her peaceful expression.

They already had two beautiful children. Now, another was on the way.

Their wedding, originally planned for winter, would have to be moved up. May seemed perfect—early enough that her belly wouldn’t show.

He imagined her in white, walking toward him, and his chest tightened.

Dawn broke, but Lillian hadn’t slept.

The events of yesterday replayed in her mind like a nightmare. The pain, the humiliation—it left her trembling until her phone rang, jolting her back to reality.

The hospital. The DNA results were ready.

She hung up, dragged herself up, and yanked open the curtains. Sunlight stabbed at her eyes.

Seven-thirty.

She'd barely slept, tossing until dawn. Her bandaged hand ached, a bitter reminder of last night.

Her adoptive parents had been too busy with their precious family gathering to even call her.

Did they even care?

The thought twisted inside her.

Downstairs, Genevieve was arranging flowers in the living room.

Lillian forced a smile.

Genevieve set down her shears. "Lillian, you're awake. Your grandfather had a heart attack last night. We tried calling, but your phone was off."

Lillian bit back a scoff. As if that old man would ever ask for me.

Still, she feigned concern. "Is he okay?"

She made sure to let her injured hand catch Genevieve’s attention.

"He's stable now—" Genevieve's eyes widened. "What happened to your hand?"

Lillian's chest warmed slightly. At least someone noticed.

"Just a prop accident on set," she lied, pulling away. "It's nothing."

Genevieve frowned. "No more filming until it heals. You should've told us!"

Lillian hugged her arm. "I’m fine, Mom. I’ll go get Dad for breakfast."

"Your father’s in the study with Lucas. Hurry back."

Lillian headed upstairs, but as she reached the study door—left slightly ajar—she froze.

Lucas's voice drifted out.

"Mr. Prescott, I found proof of Dominic’s bribery eight years ago..."

Her pulse spiked.

This changed everything.
###Chapter 426

"Dominic bribed someone?"

Lillian Prescott could hardly picture the composed, dignified man resorting to bribery. The revelation hit her like a physical blow.

Holding her breath, she strained to catch every word of her adoptive father's hushed conversation with his secretary.

"Last month, Municipal Party Committee Secretary Mr. Whitmore was detained in a major corruption case. To reduce his sentence, he provided detailed accounts of everyone involved, including past bribery schemes. Shockingly, one of those names was Dominic Blackwood—the rising star of A City, the man who single-handedly boosted its economy..."

"Mr. Prescott, here's the evidence. Mr. Whitmore was meticulous. He secretly recorded every transaction. What should we do?"

If this involved an ordinary executive, the law would take its course. But Dominic wasn't just anyone.

He controlled two-thirds of A City's economy. His downfall would send shockwaves through the stock market, scare off foreign investors, and trigger an economic crisis. The fallout would be catastrophic.

The rustling of papers filled the room.

Jonathan Prescott's voice was measured, deliberate. "We can't move against him yet. This is too big. Let me think it through. We'll escalate only if absolutely necessary."

Disappointment laced his sigh.

Jonathan had always admired Dominic.

The man was brilliant—bold, visionary, relentless. He'd transformed a failing company into a global empire in mere years.

But no successful businessman had clean hands.

Jonathan could overlook minor indiscretions—if they stayed buried. But this? Hard evidence of bribery? A stain that couldn't be erased.

"Suppress it for now. I need time."

Weighing the consequences, Jonathan finally gestured to his secretary. "It's late. You came early to brief me. Lucas, join me for breakfast."

Lucas inclined his head. "As you wish, sir."

Their footsteps echoed as they left the study.

Lillian barely had time to pretend she'd just arrived. Heart pounding, she raised a hand as if to knock.

"Dad! I was just coming to get you for breakfast. Uncle Lucas, you're here too." She forced a smile. "Mom sent me."

Jonathan beamed, always pleased with his clever daughter. "Perfect timing. Let's go down together."

Lucas's sharp gaze flicked to Lillian. He said nothing, but his scrutiny made her skin prickle.

She kept her expression neutral, though cold sweat dampened her back.

Only when they descended did she exhale.

Lucas missed nothing. But she was a good actress. Surely he hadn't noticed her eavesdropping.

Before following, she stole one last glance at the study.

The shock still reverberated through her. And then—an idea. Wild, dangerous.

Breakfast was a blur.

Lillian rushed to an exclusive hospital—a favorite among elites for its discretion.

The doctor, a woman in her thirties with an impeccable reputation, handed her a sealed envelope.

Lillian's hands trembled as she tore it open.

The DNA report.

A 99.99% match.

Her face drained of color.

"No... This can't be right." Her voice shook. "Doctor, there must be a mistake."

"Ms. Prescott, if you doubt my work, test elsewhere. But I stand by my results." The doctor's tone turned frosty.

Lillian barely heard her.

Stumbling out, she locked herself in a bathroom stall.

With frantic fingers, she shredded the report.

Hatred burned in her chest.

Evelyn Sinclair—Genevieve Prescott's biological daughter?

Anyone but her.

Anyone.

Fifteen minutes later, she emerged, composed.

A starstruck girl gasped. "Oh my God! You're Lillian Prescott! From The Orphan's Secret! Can I—"

Lillian shoved past without a word.

The girl blinked, then peered into the stall. Torn paper littered the floor.

"Wow," she muttered. "Celebrities are such slobs."
###Chapter 427

Phoenix Town.

Just after seven in the morning, Dominic and Evelyn stepped out of their suite, preparing to return to A City.

As Evelyn passed the adjacent room, she noticed the door slightly ajar. Her gaze instinctively drifted inside.

A young woman with long hair sat wrapped in a white bathrobe, leaning against pink cushions in a daze.

Purple wind chimes tinkled softly above her head.

The girl's delicate face was streaked with tears, her expression distant as if lost in another world.

Evelyn froze when she recognized those features. It was Scarlett Fairchild, the waitress from Blue Honors Club.

She wanted a closer look when suddenly - BANG! - the antique carved door slammed shut, cutting off her view.

"Dominic," she tugged his sleeve urgently. "The girl next door looks exactly like Scarlett..."

Dominic frowned. "Scarlett? Who?"

His indifference toward other women extended to forgetting their names and faces entirely.

"The Blue Honors waitress whose Persian cat got drugged," Evelyn reminded him.

Recognition flashed in Dominic's eyes. His expression darkened at the memory. "That animal scratched you. We never settled that score."

Evelyn sighed at their communication gap.

"It was just a scratch. She seemed genuinely kind - definitely not intentional..." Evelyn bit her lip. "But why is she here crying? Do you think someone hurt her?"

Last night's disturbing noises from that room replayed in her mind - desperate sobs and repeated cries of "No!" It hadn't sounded like playacting. More like genuine distress.

Seeing it was Scarlett intensified Evelyn's concern. Despite their brief acquaintance, she'd felt an odd connection to the girl.

Dominic guided her firmly toward the exit. "Curiosity killed the cat, darling. Not our business. This resort has excellent security - nothing dangerous would happen here."

"But—"

When Evelyn kept glancing back, Dominic simply scooped her up. "We're leaving now or we'll be late. My schedule's packed today. Didn't you say your quarterly review presentation is due this afternoon?"

"What? Today? But I'm only halfway—"

"Exactly why we need to leave." Satisfaction curled Dominic's lips when her attention shifted.

He'd always been ruthlessly selective about who deserved his concern. That waitress's pet had harmed Evelyn - she was lucky he hadn't retaliated. No chance he'd intervene in her problems now.

The car glided smoothly back to A City, finally parking at T Corporation's garage.

Dominic turned to find Evelyn fast asleep, her heart-shaped face relaxed in slumber.

He'd never realized pregnancy could make someone this drowsy.

His hand hovered, then retreated. Instead, he adjusted the heating and reclined her seat into a makeshift bed.

Retrieving documents from his briefcase, he settled in to work.

When Evelyn finally stirred, she blinked groggily at her watch. "9:30? You should've woken me! We're half an hour late!"

"You needed rest more." Dominic's thumb brushed her cheek. "You come first. Work can wait."

Evelyn's breath caught.

Hearing those words from this work-obsessed man left her both touched and guilty. His devotion overwhelmed her.

After changing in the ladies' lounge, Evelyn finalized her presentation. By 2 PM, she'd completed everything flawlessly.

The design department's quarterly review commenced precisely on schedule.

Dominic presided at the head table with Julian on his left and Vivienne on his right. Every seat filled as colleagues arranged themselves by rank.

Though experienced with public speaking, Evelyn's stomach fluttered nervously. This was her first formal corporate review.

Hearing Abigail, Gregory, even Bernadette deliver incisive analyses only heightened her anxiety.

"Evelyn," Olivia whispered, nudging her discreetly.

Dominic's baritone echoed simultaneously: "Your turn."

Steadying herself, Evelyn approached the projector. Her USB clicked into the laptop as she began:

"I'm Evelyn from Design Team Two. Please direct your attention to the screen. This summarizes my Q3 performance—first, order volume; second, profit analysis; third, client satisfaction; fourth, Q4 projections..."

In her tailored suit with hair swept into a sleek ponytail, Evelyn's natural glow outshone any makeup. Unlike others' dry templates, her vibrant slides combined precision with visual elegance.

Her half-hour presentation earned resounding applause.

"Brilliant work!" Julian gave an approving thumbs-up.

Dominic's jaw tightened. Since when did others praise his woman?

Evelyn beamed under the accolades from Olivia, Abigail, Gregory and team. Only Vivienne and Bernadette's smiles didn't reach their eyes.

Particularly Vivienne - her gaze simmered with barely concealed envy.

Unaware, Evelyn had no premonition of the gathering storm about to break over her...
###Chapter 428

The meeting concluded at 3:30 sharp.

Design department employees filed back to their workspaces, resuming their tasks.

Evelyn Sinclair opened her work inbox and spotted an email from Christopher Prescott.

The retired statesman had left detailed feedback on her architectural design.

He wrote that encountering a talent like hers was rare, and invited her to visit his residence. Several sheepish emojis followed, making him seem almost childlike.

Evelyn chuckled. The notoriously demanding old man had an unexpectedly endearing side.

As she closed her mailbox, a notification popped up—a friend request from "ElegantDuchess."

Her fingers hovered over the screen. Then she remembered Genevieve Prescott asking for her contact details earlier.

She'd assumed it was just politeness, but here was the actual request.

Evelyn accepted. She waited, but no message appeared. Probably offline.

She resisted sending a greeting first. No need to seem like she was currying favor. Socializing with strangers wasn't her forte anyway.

Curious, she browsed Genevieve's profile.

No selfies. Just philosophical musings, wellness articles, and elegant event photos showing her profile.

The tasteful posts painted a portrait of a sophisticated woman who appreciated painting, flower arrangement, piano, and yoga. There were even shots of her completing endurance races.

Evelyn was impressed. Mrs. Prescott might be the most remarkable woman she'd ever encountered.

A thick stack of documents slammed onto her desk.

"Bold of you to scroll through social media during work hours," Bernadette Worthing snapped.

Evelyn calmly locked her phone and slid it away.

She turned with practiced neutrality. "How may I assist you, Madam?"

Bernadette jabbed a manicured finger at the papers. "I need these reports and spreadsheets copied."

"Of course." Evelyn gathered the documents.

This had been routine since she joined T Group—endless menial tasks outside her job description. But they took little time or effort, so she never complained.

Olivia Kensington caught her arm as she passed. "You're too accommodating! You've been here six months and Granny Worthing still treats you like an errand girl. You're a certified designer now—why tolerate this?"

Evelyn smiled. "It's nothing demanding. I'll finish quickly."

Olivia huffed. "You're letting her walk all over you! No one else gets assigned this nonsense. She's got it out for you!"

"It's fine. Focus on your work." Evelyn walked away.

Olivia shook her head. Evelyn's kindness made her an easy target.

If Olivia had the CEO in her corner like Evelyn did, she'd never let Bernadette act so high-handed!

Near the copy room, Evelyn spotted Dominic Blackwood speaking with Sebastian Whitmore.

"Mr. Blackwood." She nodded politely.

His top shirt buttons were undone—likely due to the building's aggressive heating. The glimpse of toned chest reminded Evelyn of last night, when she'd drowsily nuzzled against that warmth.

A faint blush rose as she recalled the heat of their entangled bodies.

Dominic noted her flushed cheeks with a slight nod. His gaze dropped to the financial reports in her hands—far outside her usual responsibilities. His brow furrowed.

Sebastian greeted her. "Making copies, Ms. Sinclair?"

"Yes."

"Machine one's down—technician's en route. Use number three."

"Thank you, Mr. Whitmore."

They parted ways. Inside, Evelyn efficiently copied the documents.

Returning to the office, she found Yvonne Blackwell from Vivi Group with her team, including a new member—a mixed-race man she hadn't met.

"Ladies and gentlemen, pleased to meet you. I'm Alistair Montgomery!"

His Indian heritage lent striking features to his handsome face. His cheerful demeanor instantly charmed the room.

Then his bright blue eyes landed on Evelyn.

She was tall and slender, skin so flawless it begged to be touched. Delicate features contrasted with her sharp business suit. Her gaze held an otherworldly clarity, like some ethereal being who'd wandered into the mortal world.

Alistair stared, transfixed...

Evelyn tensed as she passed him.

Back at her desk, she checked her reflection. Was there something on her face?

Why else would the new hire be staring so intensely?

It was unnerving.
###Chapter 429

Evelyn took her seat as Yvonne Blackwell's sharp gaze swept across the office. "With the urban reconstruction project underway," she announced firmly, "I expect nothing less than your absolute best. Teamwork is mandatory—any sabotage attempts will result in immediate removal from the project."

A chorus of agreements followed, though Evelyn caught Bernadette Worthing's barely concealed smirk.

As the workday neared its end, Yvonne revealed tomorrow's joint meeting between T Corporation and Vivi Group would review project progress. Both companies' top executives—including Dominic Blackwood himself—would attend this unprecedented gathering.

The announcement sent a chill down Evelyn's spine. Could she maintain composure under such scrutiny?

She considered staying late to prepare, but Yvonne insisted the team dine together at Blue Honors. "Perfect chance to welcome our new member and bond," she declared.

"Blue Honors' cuisine is divine!" Abigail Thornton chirped while organizing her desk. "My little one deserves this treat."

Olivia Kensington shot her a look. "Haven't you read those pregnancy articles? Overeating leads to oversized babies and C-sections."

Abigail gasped. "That can't be true!" Her appetite had been insatiable since conception.

Rolling her eyes, Olivia countered, "Why would I lie?"

"Ugh...guess I'm dieting now." Abigail rubbed her belly mournfully. "You hear that, baby? Mommy's suffering because of you."

The shared glance between Olivia and Evelyn held quiet amusement. Evelyn's smile softened as her fingers brushed her own flat stomach.

Olivia nudged Evelyn playfully. "You've been spacing out lately with that secret smile. Spill—any news between you and Mr. Blackwood?"

"Don't be ridiculous," Evelyn deflected, shutting down her computer. "Let's go. The Vivi team's already left."

With even pregnant Abigail attending, Evelyn had no excuse to decline. She texted Dominic about the dinner plans, assuring him she'd cab home later.

Knowing Percy Worthington owned Blue Honors put Dominic at ease. His reply came swiftly: No alcohol. Call for pickup afterward.

The group filed out, but Bernadette suddenly clutched her stomach near the restroom. "Cramps! Go ahead—I'll catch up."

Yvonne hesitated. "Room 808. Don't dawdle."

As the others departed, Bernadette's gaze locked onto Evelyn's retreating figure, scheming.

Blue Honors never failed to impress Evelyn with its opulent interiors. The dinner's atmosphere warmed quickly—Yvonne's off-duty persona as a witty, approachable mentor surprised everyone.

Alistair Montgomery proved memorable too, his constant jokes sparking laughter. Yet his lingering, affectionate stares at Evelyn unsettled her.

Post-dinner, Yvonne suggested karaoke on the eighth floor. The spacious VIP room accommodated their entire party. After brief socializing, Yvonne excused herself.

Gregory Peterson and Malcolm Whitmore dominated the liquor while Miranda Caldwell butchered pop songs off-key. Only Geoffrey Winslow clapped enthusiastically. Abigail and Olivia stifled giggles.

Evelyn nibbled fruit from the coffee table when Alistair slid beside her. "Enchanté," he murmured with a French accent. "Might I inquire about your relationship status?"

She edged away. "Taken."

Disappointment flickered across his handsome features. "Pity. I thought I'd found my soulmate." He brightened. "Not married though, yes?"

"Engaged. Wedding preparations are underway."

Alistair's eyes gleamed. "No ring means fair game! There's a saying—"

"—All's fair in love and war," Evelyn finished dryly. His shameless persistence left her speechless.
###Chapter 430

Alistair studied Evelyn's delicate features. The more he observed her, the stronger his attraction grew.

Though half-Indian himself, he'd never been drawn to women of his own heritage.

His preferences leaned toward Caucasian beauty, just like his father's.

Evelyn's petite frame and porcelain complexion captivated him completely.

Her apparent disinterest didn't discourage Alistair.

He understood winning a woman's heart required patience and strategy.

This wasn't about a fleeting encounter - he was playing the long game.

Noticing the women's deliberate exclusion of him, he smoothly changed tactics. "I'm rather new to this country, Evelyn," he said with practiced charm. "Perhaps an English name would help me fit in better? I'm struggling to choose one."

Olivia and Abigail munched on snacks while watching Alistair's attempts to charm Evelyn with amusement.

'Our CEO has competition!'
'Evelyn's allure strikes again!'
'This passionate newcomer seems smitten. Wonder what Dominic will think?'

Evelyn considered his polite request. "What style of name appeals to you?"

Alistair shrugged dramatically. "They all carry such historical weight. I'm at a loss."

Abigail cracked another peanut. "You speak perfect English! Don't play modest, Alistair!"

Olivia selected a watermelon slice. "That's quite the outdated pickup line. How about Godfrey or Orcus?" She barely suppressed a grin.

Abigail nearly choked on her drink.

Bewildered, Alistair scratched his head. "Are those names humorous? Why the laughter?"

Abigail composed herself. "General Godfrey Wellington was a renowned statesman. Brought prosperity, then got quartered." She paused. "That's when they tear a man limb from limb with horses..."

Alistair turned slightly green.

Evelyn added softly, "Viscount Orcus Hellinger was medieval royalty. Ambitious fellow - tried to overthrow the crown." She took a delicate bite of strawberry. "They sliced him 3,357 times over three days. His enemies ate the strips of flesh afterward."

"Urk—" Alistair barely reached the trash bin in time.

The women exchanged amused glances while Evelyn savored another strawberry - mindful of her pregnancy.

Three minutes of retching later, Alistair wiped his mouth weakly. "Must you discuss such gruesome topics at a party? Surely there are heroic names?"

Evelyn's lips curved. "There's one conqueror whose name starts with 'A' like yours. Built an enormous empire."

Alistair's eyes lit up. "Perfect! What's the name?"

"Adolf," Evelyn said sweetly.

"Adolf it is!" Alistair declared, slapping the table.

Abigail and Olivia collapsed into hysterics.

"What?" Alistair frowned. "Isn't it a good name?"

Through giggles, Abigail gasped, "Oh it's perfect! We'll call you Adolf from now on!"

Olivia's face turned crimson from suppressed laughter.

Evelyn's prank had been executed flawlessly.
###Chapter 431

Late night.

Evelyn Sinclair was in the final trimester of her pregnancy, her movements restricted by the growing life inside her. That's why she left the gathering early.

Abigail Thornton and Olivia Kensington also felt exhausted and bid their farewells. With most women gone, only men remained in the private karaoke room.

After exchanging superficial goodbyes, the men continued their revelry.

Alistair Montgomery wanted to escape the dull atmosphere. Feigning drunkenness, he claimed he needed to go home and rest. No one stopped him.

The remaining colleagues had their own agendas.

Once the female coworkers departed, the usually serious male executives summoned the club manager. Several attractive escorts joined them, and the party continued...

Inside, the room buzzed with energy. Outside Blue Honors, the biting winter wind cut through the air.

Fortunately, Evelyn, Abigail, and Olivia wore thick down jackets and scarves, shielding them from the cold.

"Should I see you home, Abigail?" Evelyn asked, eyeing her colleague's prominent belly.

Though only five months pregnant, Abigail's stomach suggested twins.

Abigail laughed heartily, patting her belly. "No need. My ride's arriving any minute. You two should get home and rest. Did you call cabs?"

Olivia linked arms with Abigail. "Evelyn texted Mr. Blackwood half an hour ago. His car should be here any moment. As for you, traveling alone at night while pregnant isn't safe. I'll stay over tonight and we'll go to work together tomorrow."

Gratitude filled Abigail's eyes. "Thank you, Olivia."

Before pregnancy, she wouldn't have hesitated to travel alone at night. Now, she couldn't risk her baby's safety.

Olivia smiled. "What are friends for—"

A car horn interrupted them.

A white Mercedes pulled up nearby.

Beyond it, partially hidden around the corner, a sleek black Rolls-Royce waited like a shadowy predator.

Abigail recognized their CEO's vehicle immediately. Waving to the Mercedes, she called, "Over here!"

As the car approached, Abigail turned to Evelyn. "Our ride's here. Mr. Blackwood's waiting around the corner. Get home safely. Tomorrow will be busy."

Evelyn waved. "Rest well, both of you."

Once they departed, Evelyn spotted the familiar Rolls-Royce.

Dominic Blackwood emerged from the vehicle. Evelyn dashed into his arms like an excited sparrow.

Alistair witnessed this intimate reunion from Blue Honors' entrance.

Her swift, graceful movements captivated him.

Suddenly, harsh headlights blinded him, forcing him to squint.

Coming from wealth, luxury cars didn't impress him. Yet seeing this extravagant vehicle waiting for Evelyn unsettled him.

He watched as Evelyn melted into a tall man's embrace. The stranger cradled her waist tenderly, rubbing warmth into her cheeks.

Though shadows obscured the man's face, his commanding presence radiated both elegance and latent danger.

'Is that Evelyn's lover? His aura is... formidable.'

Though he knew eavesdropping was improper, curiosity propelled him forward. Concealing himself behind a nearby sycamore, he strained to hear their conversation.

Dominic's rich, cello-like voice carried through the cold air. "My reckless little bird, must you always dash about? What if you'd fallen?"

Alistair couldn't hear Evelyn's response, but saw her playfully punch Dominic's chest. The man chuckled, capturing her wandering hands before claiming her lips in a deep kiss...

Jealousy burned through Alistair.

After finally finding a woman who stirred his heart in this foreign land, she belonged to another. The injustice!

Furious, he slammed his fist against the tree trunk.

Instantly, Dominic's piercing gaze snapped toward him!

Alistair barely ducked behind the tree in time. 'How perceptive!'

Dominic stared intently at the quivering sycamore. Had someone been there?

A strong gust shook the branches violently. Perhaps it had just been the wind?
###Chapter 432

Dominic's chiseled features were bathed in the golden glow of streetlights and silvery moonlight.

Evelyn's breath caught in her throat as she saw his face clearly for the first time.

His aristocratic lips curved with effortless grace, exuding an otherworldly nobility that seemed almost surreal.

For a fleeting moment, Evelyn imagined him as a prince stepping out from the pages of a fairy tale.

His commanding presence was breathtaking, yet he radiated a calm serenity like the moon itself.

Evelyn couldn't deny the magnetic pull she felt.

The man she'd recently labeled as her "rival" stood with regal poise, while the graceful woman in his arms completed the perfect picture. Their embrace was poetry in motion.

Anyone would be captivated by either of them.

Her crush melted into his arms like putty.

Alistair's stomach twisted. He wanted to greet Evelyn, but Dominic ushered her into the car with gentlemanly precision.

Evelyn's radiant smile could rival the sunrise.

Alistair stood frozen, unable to take another step.

He had no place there. All he could do was watch the luxury vehicle disappear into the night.

Morning came too soon.

Evelyn rose with the sun, preparing breakfast for Dominic and the twins. After their family meal, they dropped Alexander and Isabella at kindergarten before heading to Blackwood Enterprises.

At her desk, Evelyn frowned. Her drawer was unlocked.

She distinctly remembered rushing to Blue Honors last night. Had she forgotten to lock it?

Her documents appeared undisturbed - the top sheet still showed today's meeting agenda. Satisfied, she gathered the files and headed to the conference hall.

This wasn't an ordinary meeting. Alongside Blackwood's designers and project staff, Vivi Group's team was present. Most importantly, both companies' top brass attended.

Dominic and Vivi's chairman sat at opposite ends of the conference table.

Quentin Prescott commanded attention on the left - a stern, authoritative figure accustomed to giving orders. His lean frame and perpetual seriousness spoke of decades in power.

Dominic occupied the right in his signature black suit. Though younger, his presence matched Quentin's in intensity.

Executives filled the front rows while other employees sat further back.

Yvonne's team occupied the third row.

Evelyn sat with Abigail, Olivia, and Gregory in the fourth row's center.

An empty seat beside Evelyn caught Alistair's eye.

Ignoring her icy expression, he claimed the spot.

Evelyn sighed. With the meeting starting, she wouldn't cause a scene over seating.

The summit commenced.

Both leaders shook hands before presenting their urban renewal project research.

Profit distribution remained contentious - today's purpose was finding common ground.

Executives from both sides argued their positions passionately, each fighting for their company's advantage.

When leadership finished, design teams took the stage.

Yvonne spoke first, followed by Vivienne.

Both women dazzled with eloquence, showcasing blueprints that highlighted their respective companies' strengths.

Evelyn marveled at Vivienne's avant-garde designs - no wonder she led Blackwood's creative team.

Yet Yvonne's striking concepts held equal merit. The competition was fierce.

Alistair's presentation shocked Evelyn.

She'd assumed the newcomer shared her rookie status. Instead, his innovative designs revealed remarkable talent.

Her opinion of the seemingly frivolous man improved slightly.

Olivia and Miranda presented next.

Miranda's usual provocative style had toned down considerably with her chairman present. Her conservative black jacket couldn't completely hide the scandalous white blouse beneath.

While Miranda's work lacked her colleagues' brilliance, it held unique merits. Yvonne wouldn't tolerate mediocrity.

Evelyn's turn approached, her pulse racing.

"You've got this, Evie!" Abigail whispered. "Just pretend it's a regular meeting."

Olivia added, "I was sweating bullets too, but once you start, it's not so bad."

Evelyn took a steadying breath, gathered her materials, and approached the podium.

As she inserted her flash drive, no one noticed Bernadette's smirk of anticipation...
###Chapter 433

Evelyn stepped onto the podium, her eyes instinctively seeking out Dominic in the crowd.

She caught his encouraging gaze, which steadied her nerves slightly.

Distributing copies to the executives from both companies, she inserted the flash drive into the laptop.

Adjusting the microphone, she prepared to begin her presentation.

Quentin Prescott flipped through the documents, his expression darkening instantly. "Ms. Sinclair, are you confused about today's agenda?"

Evelyn checked her copy and froze. This wasn't her prepared presentation - just last week's department report.

The Vivi Group chairman slammed the documents on the table.

Quentin's voice turned icy. "How could a professional designer make such an elementary mistake? Even an intern wouldn't be this careless! Is this really the caliber of talent we're working with?"

His accusatory glare shifted to Dominic. "This is your company's standard? Remarkable."

Evelyn's cheeks burned with humiliation.

She frantically searched her flash drive for the project files, but they'd vanished.

Her face paled. She'd triple-checked everything yesterday. How could this happen?

Vivienne Laurent watched with a cold smirk. This was the woman the CEO favored? Crumbling under basic pressure.

Such weakness would never match Vivienne's own capabilities.

Murmurs spread through the conference room.

Executives shook their heads as they watched the cursor dart between empty folders.

The organizational structure showed competence - which made this failure more baffling.

Olivia Kensington clenched her fists, wanting to rush forward and comfort her friend.

Only Dominic remained composed.

Though he saw Evelyn's distress, he didn't intervene. In personal matters, he'd shield her completely. Professionally, she needed to learn crisis management.

He signaled Sebastian Whitmore, who approached Evelyn. "Ms. Sinclair, could the files be elsewhere? Perhaps you forgot to print them?"

Evelyn shook her head. "I stored everything in my unlocked drawer yesterday. This morning I grabbed the stack without checking..."

Sebastian's eyes narrowed at the mention of the unlocked drawer.

"Absolutely certain you didn't take them home?"

"Positive," Evelyn confirmed.

Quentin checked his watch sharply. "Enough excuses! Fifteen minutes to rectify this or you're off the project. I don't tolerate incompetence!"

Dominic's gaze turned glacial at Quentin's tone, though he remained motionless.

Evelyn swallowed her tears. She wouldn't break down here.

Bowing deeply, she apologized. "I'll retrieve the correct documents immediately."

Her hurried footsteps echoed as she left.

Returning empty-handed minutes later, Evelyn faced the room again. "I've searched everywhere. The files are gone."

Quentin's expression darkened further. "Results matter, not excuses! Safeguarding critical data is basic professionalism. Mr. Blackwood, surely you agree she's unfit for this project?"

The weight of collective judgment pressed on Evelyn's shoulders.

Meeting Dominic's gaze, she expected disappointment. Instead, she found quiet encouragement.

Her spine straightened.

She wouldn't let the company - or him - down.

Taking a steadying breath, she addressed the room. "While I've lost the physical documents, I remember every detail. With your permission, I'll recreate the presentation from memory."

Gasps rippled through the audience.
###Chapter 434

The audacity! Did she even realize what she was saying?

Most people would spend weeks preparing their presentations and still make mistakes. Yet here she was, about to improvise hers on the spot!

All eyes turned to Evelyn Sinclair, their gazes heavy with skepticism. Her palms grew damp with sweat.

She tightened her grip on the stack of papers in her hands.

Earlier, while searching for her missing files, she had stumbled upon a collection of design sketches in her cabinet.

These weren’t polished floor plans or digital renderings—just rough concept drawings she had done in her free time with colored pencils.

Evelyn had no formal training in illustration, but she had a natural talent. Whenever inspiration struck, she preferred sketching her ideas on paper rather than working digitally.

The thick stack was filled with her conceptual designs for the project.

Her department head had once teased her for being old-fashioned, but Evelyn didn’t care. This was her creative process.

With her digital files gone, these sketches would have to do.

Gathering her courage, she stepped onto the podium and placed her sketches down.

She lifted the scanner lid, placed a sketch face-down, and swiftly operated the machine.

The audience watched, baffled, wondering what this flustered employee was about to do.

Then, the large screen in the conference hall flickered to life, displaying rough but striking concept sketches alongside photographs of the old urban district.

Evelyn’s voice, clear and confident, filled the room. "My apologies for the delay. Let’s begin. These are my preliminary sketches—charcoal and colored pencil concepts—along with the reasoning behind my designs."

The reactions in the room were mixed.

Curiosity. Disbelief.

Dominic Blackwood’s lips curved into a faint, approving smile.

Quentin Prescott frowned.

Olivia Kensington and Abigail Thornton exhaled in relief.

Yvonne Blackwell narrowed her eyes, reassessing Evelyn.

Alistair Montgomery and Malcolm Whitmore looked stunned.

Vivienne Laurent, however, was seething. Her fists clenched, her expression dark.

Evelyn, unfazed, used a laser pointer to highlight the current state of the commercial district on the screen.

"The area in question is a prime location in the Cercis Business District. A decade ago, it was the city’s busiest hub. But as the city expanded and trends shifted, its outdated design became a liability. The only solution is complete redevelopment."

"As a designer, my task is to transform this space into a modern landmark—a convergence point for commerce and foot traffic."

"Most existing structures follow a classical style, which now feels outdated. Given its central location, surrounded by high-end residential and commercial zones, the new design must be contemporary and dynamic. My sketches reflect this vision—each building distinct yet interconnected, with open gardens and ecological landscapes woven throughout."

Her sketches were raw, but her talent was undeniable. The buildings were vibrant, irregular in shape, yet harmonious. Modern elements blended seamlessly with functional spaces.

Dominic studied her, fascinated.

The nervous woman from before was gone. In her place stood someone composed, articulate, and utterly captivating.

She answered Quentin’s nitpicking questions with ease, her confidence unshaken.

The room’s perception of her shifted in real time.

Dominic’s smile deepened.

His woman never failed to impress.

Meanwhile, Vivienne was unraveling. Watching Evelyn speak with such effortless grace made her want to claw that perfect face apart.

How had this happened?

Her plan should have been flawless. How had this woman turned the tables with nothing but rough sketches?

When Evelyn finished her presentation, the room was silent.

Then Dominic began clapping.

The others followed, applause filling the hall. Olivia was practically beaming, her hands stinging from how hard she clapped.

Even Quentin, initially displeased, looked grudgingly impressed.

"You have quite the talent in your company, Mr. Blackwood," he admitted. "A minor blunder at the start, but nothing unforgivable. I’ll add another five percentage points to the deal. We can sign today."

Five points was a significant concession.

For corporations like theirs, where deals spanned hundreds of millions, that was no small offer.

But Dominic’s gaze remained steady. "Make it ten."

The Vivi Group representatives nearly choked.

Quentin’s expression darkened.

The audacity of this man!
###Chapter 435

The urban renewal project involved funds exceeding a hundred billion dors. The partnership between Blackwood Enterprises and Prescott Group wasn't just about the astronomical sum—no single corporation could secure exclusive development rights for the entire district.

To stimulate economic growth, the local government refused to hand the entire project to one company, even if they had the capability.

Every percentage point of profit from this venture represented a staggering amount. Prescott Group wasn't about to surrender without a fight.

Negotiations had reached a deadlock. Prescott's entire executive team was livid.

They were prepared to claw for one or two percentage points. But Dominic demanding ten? That ignited fury.

Politeness had evaporated. With no need for pretense, Prescott's board members grew bolder, adamantly backing Quentin's proposal.

Some even suggested slashing Blackwood's share further. They wouldn’t budge.

Their confidence stemmed from knowing Blackwood couldn’t secure full development rights alone—and Prescott’s financial strength matched theirs.

Blackwood’s executives were baffled. They couldn’t decipher their CEO’s strategy.

Several senior shareholders frowned openly. Though Dominic fought for their interests, they deemed his approach too audacious.

Yesterday’s board meeting had settled on a 50-50 split with Prescott. Some were even willing to concede points to finalize the deal.

When Quentin offered Blackwood an extra five points, they’d been thrilled—a bonus atop the collaboration. Dominic’s counteroffer blindsided them.

The ensuing debate grew fiercer. Neither side yielded.

As tension mounted, Prescott’s executives lost composure.

Dominic remained unshaken.

Even the usually unflappable Quentin began to sweat.

He couldn’t help but admire Dominic’s prowess.

Their first meeting had been a decade prior, during another high-stakes negotiation.

Dominic had been younger then—driven and sharp, but inexperienced.

Yet even back then, he’d been formidable.

Quentin had predicted this extraordinary man would dominate A City’s economic landscape.

His prophecy had come true.

Years in the cutthroat business world had honed Dominic into something ruthless. His commanding presence left no trace of the green negotiator from before.

Quentin stood no chance.

The stalemate dragged past an hour with no resolution.

Dominic didn’t flinch. Quentin refused to fold.

Blackwood’s executives grew restless. After over a year of preparation, they were inches from signing—until Dominic’s sudden shift derailed everything.

Evelyn’s worry surpassed them all. No one understood the effort Dominic had poured into this project better than her.

Countless late nights refining proposals—why had he changed course?

Dominic stayed calm. He gestured for Sebastian to light his cigarette.

His leisurely exhale only stoked Prescott’s fury.

Julian leaned in, voice low. "Dominic, five points is fair. Shouldn’t we sign?"

This was Julian’s first time witnessing his brother negotiate. The sheer dominance left him awestruck.

He’d never reach this level.

But the deal mattered. The profits would fuel Blackwood’s next expansion.

Dominic smiled faintly, patting Julian’s shoulder. "Relax. Even if this fails, I’ll secure those rights."

Julian wanted to argue, but Dominic’s confidence silenced him.

His brother never gambled. If he said he could do it, he would.

Quentin exhaled smoke, tension visible. "Seven points, Mr. Blackwood. My final offer. Take it or leave it."

Dominic tapped ash into the tray. His gaze drifted past the room, landing on Evelyn.

Seeing her concern softened his eyes.

When they returned to Quentin, they’d frosted over.

"Ten points, or nothing." Dominic’s voice was steel. "Prescott isn’t our only option. Preston Worthington, James Kensington, even Everett Kingsley—they’ve all begged to partner with us. I chose Prescott for your design team. But if you refuse..."

He let the threat hang.

Quentin had publicly reprimanded Evelyn.

What better revenge than bleeding him dry?
###Chapter 436

Quentin Prescott's face turned crimson with rage when he heard Dominic's counteroffer.

His hands trembled as he realized multiple potential partners were waiting in the wings.

The sheer scale of T Corporation's operations gave him pause.

If he rejected Dominic's terms now, the ruthless businessman would undoubtedly turn elsewhere.

And those alternative partners? None would be pushovers...

Clutching his tightening chest, Quentin waved weakly. "I need to consult my executive team. You'll have our answer shortly."

Dominic stubbed out his cigarette with finality. "Feel free to use any conference room, Mr. Prescott."

The meeting adjourned abruptly.

Vivi Group's executives filed into an adjacent boardroom for emergency discussions.

Meanwhile, Evelyn Sinclair returned to the design department with her colleagues.

Her fingers itched to comfort Dominic after the grueling negotiations. She longed to wrap her arms around him and ease his tension.

But their relationship remained strictly confidential at work.

No sooner had Evelyn settled at her workstation than the internal phone rang.

Dominic's deep voice commanded: "My office. Now."

Under Abigail's knowing smirk and Bernadette's jealous glare, Evelyn rose and walked toward the executive suite.

The hallway's new Persian carpet felt luxuriously soft beneath her feet, its intricate patterns whispering of Dominic's care.

She smiled, remembering how he'd installed the plush flooring after learning of her pregnancy - just to prevent any potential falls.

At the CEO's door, she barely had time to knock before strong arms yanked her inside.

Dominic's lips crashed against hers before she could protest, his embrace crushing the air from her lungs.

She pushed weakly against his chest. "Dominic... I can't... breathe..."

He released her reluctantly, hands lingering on her shoulders.

The mingled scents of tobacco and his cologne filled her nostrils. Normally repulsive, the smell now made her heart ache.

She knew he chain-smoked to cope with stress. Yet since her pregnancy began, he'd never lit up in her presence.

If the craving became unbearable, he'd excuse himself entirely.

This small sacrifice touched her deeply.

Resting her head against his chest, she listened to his steady heartbeat beneath the crisp white shirt.

Her fingers traced the stubble along his jaw. "Why the last-minute change? This deal means everything to you. You've barely slept preparing for it. Quentin's offer met all your requirements..."

Dominic's usually clean-shaven face showed signs of exhaustion. She knew profit margins weren't the issue.

Instead of answering, he kissed her again, softer this time.

When they parted, his gaze burned with quiet intensity.

In private, Dominic showed endless tenderness. But Evelyn recognized the ruthless ambition beneath - his true goal wasn't partnership, but complete acquisition of Vivi Group.

Meanwhile, Vivienne Laurent approached the CEO's suite in stiletto heels.

The plush new carpet silenced her footsteps.

Noticing the slightly ajar door, she raised her hand to knock - then froze.

The man she'd secretly loved for a decade stood embracing a petite woman, their lips locked in passionate kiss.

Though the woman faced away, Vivienne recognized Evelyn Sinclair instantly from her clothing and profile.

Bernadette's warnings about Dominic's infatuation came rushing back. Vivienne had dismissed them as jealous rumors.

Even photographic evidence hadn't convinced her that a man like Dominic would settle for someone so... ordinary.

Now, witnessing their intimacy firsthand, jealousy surged through Vivienne like poison.

Her nails dug into her palms as she watched Dominic's hands roam possessively over Evelyn's body.

This couldn't be happening.

Not after everything she'd done to position herself as his perfect match.

Vivienne stumbled back silently, her carefully constructed world crumbling around her.
###Chapter 437

Evelyn marched straight to the CEO's office, determined to confront Dominic about his sudden change of heart regarding the Vivi Group deal.

Just before the meeting, he'd assured her they would sign the agreement.

The scene that greeted her at his office door shattered her composure completely.

Evelyn tried to swallow the lump forming in her throat. It burned like acid, making her eyes water.

She'd fallen for Dominic the moment they first met.

After graduating from a prestigious international design school, Evelyn had returned home with multiple job offers from top corporations.

Yet she chose the nearly bankrupt Crawford Industries solely because Dominic was its general manager. She'd recognized his potential immediately.

True to her instincts, Dominic turned the company around spectacularly. He expanded the business, wrested control from his family, and rebranded it as T Corporation.

With each interaction, Evelyn fell deeper under his spell.

Her love grew like a flower trapped in perpetual twilight - unable to bloom yet refusing to wither.

Though Dominic remained oblivious to her feelings, Evelyn counted herself fortunate he never indulged in scandalous affairs with socialites or celebrities.

His impeccable reputation satisfied her. She believed persistence would eventually make him notice her.

After all, their values and worldviews aligned perfectly. No other woman could possibly suit him better.

Then six years ago, her world collapsed when Dominic appeared cradling twin babies, announcing he'd become a father.

The revelation struck like lightning.

Seeing those children tore Evelyn's heart to shreds.

When had this happened?

How had she missed any signs of his involvement with another woman?

Looking back, she recalled how distracted he'd become during their work discussions, often smiling absently. At the time, she'd attributed it to a personality shift.

Now she understood - Dominic had been in love.

Evelyn hired private investigators, but every lead went cold. Whenever she subtly probed about the twins' mother, Dominic expertly deflected.

His growing impatience forced her to drop the subject.

Years passed without any sign of her supposed "rival."

Dominic remained unchanged except for the two adorable children by his side. His routines stayed consistent, and Evelyn continued waiting.

Unrequited love bred an inferiority complex she couldn't shake.

Fear of rejection paralyzed her. The potential damage to their professional relationship terrified her more than perpetual longing.

Now witnessing Dominic's intimate embrace with another woman, tears threatened to spill. Normally unshakable, Evelyn found herself drowning in a toxic cocktail of agony, jealousy, and despair. Her usually composed face paled.

She turned silently and walked away.

Her posture remained rigid, though her beautiful eyes turned glacial...

Inside the office, the passionate couple remained oblivious to Evelyn's presence at the door.

When Dominic finally released Evelyn Sinclair, her flushed face and swollen lips made his heart swell with tenderness.

One kiss wasn't enough. He stole another quick peck. "Head back to design first. I've got a board meeting about Vivi Group potentially withdrawing from our collaboration. Those old fossils will need pacifying."

Evelyn Sinclair nodded, cheeks still burning. "Understood."

Returning to the design department, she found employees chatting instead of working, anticipating their recall to the conference hall.

Olivia and Abigail were engrossed in playing Flappy Bird when Evelyn tapped Olivia's shoulder.

Startled, Olivia tapped her screen - sending her bird to an untimely demise.

"Evie!" Olivia whined, turning. "I was about to hit 400 points!"

Abigail smirked, waving her phone. "Pathetic. I'm past 1000 already!"

Putting her phone away, Abigail pulled Evelyn close and whispered, "When I went to the restroom earlier, I saw Ms. Laurent exiting the CEO's private elevator looking absolutely devastated. You didn't have words, did you?"

"Vivienne was at Dominic's office?" Evelyn frowned. "I didn't see her."

Abigail leaned closer, eyes gleaming with gossip. "Between us, Vivienne's been in love with the boss for years. Watch your back - she's ruthless. You know why Dominic's never had a girlfriend all these years? It's not just his disinterest - Vivienne systematically eliminates any woman who shows him attention."

As a longtime T Corporation employee, Abigail had heard all the rumors. Little escaped her notice.

Olivia eavesdropped, eyes widening. "Ms. Laurent likes the boss? But she always keeps her distance!"

"That's exactly her strategy," Abigail scoffed. "Men want what they can't have. The more elusive, the more desirable."

Noticing Evelyn's discomfort, Abigail quickly added, "Not that our boss is that shallow. He only has eyes for you. But still, be careful with Vivienne - who knows what she's capable of."
###Chapter 438

Evelyn remained silent.

From the moment she discovered Vivienne had planted a pair of lace panties in Dominic's car, she knew exactly what kind of woman Vivienne was.

Yet she believed nothing could break the bond between her and Dominic.

What did it matter if Vivienne schemed?

She was the woman Dominic loved.

If Dominic had any feelings for Vivienne, they would have been together long ago. Vivienne wouldn't need to wait.

Evelyn flashed Abigail a confident smile. "I understand your concern, but our love can withstand anything. If he's truly mine, no one can take him away. If not, then forcing him to stay would be pointless. We've survived too much to be torn apart now."

Seeing Evelyn's unwavering faith, Abigail and Olivia exchanged glances but said nothing more.

They genuinely wished for Evelyn's happiness. A woman like her deserved true love.

Olivia lightened the mood. "Hey, how about a round of Flappy Bird? Let's see who can score highest!"

Evelyn and Abigail immediately agreed.

Just as they pulled out their phones, the department head announced the meeting would resume.

The conference hall buzzed with tension when they returned.

Vivi Group's executives sat stiffly, especially Quentin, whose thunderous expression spoke volumes.

In contrast, T Corporation's team radiated confidence. Dominic's earlier briefing had clearly reassured even the most skeptical board members.

Dominic dominated the room from his seat, his commanding presence undeniable as he regarded Vivi Group's representatives.

The corporate giants engaged in silent warfare.

Finally, Vivi Group's chairman broke the stalemate. "Mr. Blackwood, after deliberation, we'll proceed with the collaboration—with one additional clause. Should your company commit any major errors or attempt further profit encroachment, we reserve unilateral termination rights."

A satisfied gleam appeared in Dominic's striking eyes. "Agreed."

"Then let's sign today."

After finalizing amendments, both parties shook hands and signed.

Dominic checked his watch diplomatically. "Congratulations again, Mr. Prescott. May our partnership thrive. I've arranged a celebratory dinner—will you join us?"

"Another time." Quentin's curt refusal mirrored his displeasure at the unfavorable terms. With a sharp gesture to his team, he snapped, "We're leaving."

Vivi Group's deflated exit starkly contrasted their earlier confidence.

T Corporation's executives barely contained their elation at Quentin's unexpected concession, praising Dominic's negotiation skills.

Dominic dismissed the team, watching as they filed out.

Evelyn lingered at the back. Turning, she caught sight of Dominic reviewing documents, occasionally murmuring instructions to Sebastian and Julian beside him.

Her heart swelled with admiration for his sharp intellect and undeniable magnetism.

Sensing her gaze, Dominic looked up. His icy demeanor melted instantly when their eyes met, a private smile curving his lips.

The electricity between them was palpable.

Vivienne watched bitterly as Dominic's angelic smile—never directed at her—lit up for Evelyn. Her legs turned leaden with envy.

After Evelyn disappeared from view, Vivienne trudged away, resentment festering.

That evening, in a luxury hotel suite...

The air hung thick with tension above the disheveled bed where Lillian endured Wesley's latest assault.

"Turn over," he commanded.

Lillian whimpered, attempting to cover herself.

Wesley scoffed, roughly yanking her hands away. "Why bother hiding? I know every inch of you."

Humiliated tears spilled down her cheeks.

"Spare me the act," he sneered. "You're quite the performer."

Her fingers trembled against the sheets. "I'm not acting!"

"Aren't you?" His mocking tone cut deep.

Lillian's tear-filled eyes burned with hatred.

She should have been the esteemed Ms. Prescott—not this monster's plaything, forced to obey his every whim lest he release those damning photos. She fantasized about driving a knife through his heart.

But the throbbing scar on her wrist served as a grim reminder: without a flawless plan, any rebellion would only hurt herself.

The bedside phone's ringing interrupted them.

Wesley stilled, his expression darkening at the caller ID. With abrupt detachment, he stood. "I have business. Remember what happens if you misbehave."

Lillian masked her relief behind submission. "Understood."

Satisfied, Wesley dressed with military precision—a display that both impressed and terrified her, reinforcing how thoroughly trapped she was.

After he left, Lillian received a call from Genevieve. Her grandfather had taken ill again, and her parents needed her to fetch his supplements.

Agreeing, Lillian winced at her soreness as she entered her family home later. Spotting the supplements on the living room sofa, she headed upstairs to change.

Passing her father's study, she noticed the slightly ajar door. On impulse, she pushed it open and stepped inside...
###Chapter 439

Dominic Blackwood's study housed an imposing ten-tier mahogany bookshelf that spanned the entire length of one wall.

Each shelf was meticulously organized with leather-bound volumes.

Lillian Prescott crept into the room like a shadow, swiftly locking the door behind her. Her breath caught as she surveyed the thousands of books before her.

She knew her adoptive father kept sensitive documents in a safe, but its location remained a mystery.

Kicking off her stilettos and rolling up her sleeves, Lillian moved soundlessly across the Persian rug. She searched behind paintings, beneath the antique desk, even inside the decorative fireplace.

Thirty minutes later, sweat dampened her brow with no safe in sight.

Frustrated, she slammed her fist against the bookshelf. A hidden mechanism clicked, rotating the top shelf to reveal a gleaming titanium safe.

Her pulse quickened. Scaling the library ladder, she reached the top and hesitated before the keypad.

Her first attempt used Genevieve Prescott's birthday - a testament to Jonathan's devotion to his wife.

Access denied.

Next, she tried her own birthday.

Another failure.

The blinking red warning light indicated one final attempt before permanent lockdown.

Lillian bit her lip. Should she risk it?

Success meant everything. Failure would alert Jonathan to her trespassing. But walking away now might mean losing her only chance.

Her phone vibrated violently in her pocket, startling her so badly she nearly toppled from the ladder.

"Hello, Mother?" She forced calm into her voice.

"Darling, where are you?" Genevieve's concerned voice came through. "You should have arrived by now."

"Traffic's dreadful, Mother. There's been an accident on Flue Road - police everywhere." Lillian fabricated smoothly. "How's Grandfather?"

"An accident? Take the beltway instead!" Genevieve fretted. "Your grandfather's stable. Drive safely, darling. We'll talk when you arrive."

Ending the call, Lillian made her decision.

Her fingers hovered over the keypad. Instead of Jonathan's birthday, she entered another date - the birthday of Genevieve's biological daughter.

The safe clicked open.

Lillian froze. The revelation burned through her like acid.

With trembling hands, she sifted through documents until her fingers closed around a silver disc at the bottom.

Triumph surged through her.

She replaced it with an identical blank CD before restoring everything precisely.

Back in her suite, she inserted the disc into her laptop.

The high-definition video showed an impossibly young Dominic Blackwood - barely eighteen - sliding a briefcase across a table to Samuel Whitmore.

When opened, the case revealed tea leaves concealing stacks of hundred-dollar bills - at least two million.

Though youthful, Dominic carried himself with the poise of a seasoned executive. His articulate negotiation with the much older committee secretary revealed a frighteningly precocious businessman.

Lillian traced Dominic's face on the screen possessively.

This magnificent man would be hers. She might have missed his past, but she'd claim his future.

After making multiple backups, she smiled darkly at Jonathan's CD.

"With this, Evelyn Sinclair, let's see how long you last with Dominic."

Meanwhile, Evelyn tossed restlessly in bed.

An inexplicable unease had plagued her since leaving work. Even Dominic's embrace couldn't soothe her.

Exhausted from overwork, he'd fallen asleep immediately.

Dawn approached before Evelyn finally drifted off.

Saturday meant no work, but Dominic rose early, pressing a kiss to her cheek before hurrying downstairs.

The Vivi Group partnership had quadrupled his workload, stealing their leisurely family breakfasts...

###Chapter 440

The twins, still in their dinosaur-patterned pajamas, sat cross-legged on the living room couch with their schoolwork spread before them. 

Though classes were canceled today, their internal clocks woke them at dawn. 

They remembered Daddy's strict instructions: Mommy needed extra rest because of the baby growing inside her. No disturbances allowed.

That's why they tiptoed downstairs to study instead of playing in their rooms. 

Alexander chose the living room specifically - it offered the perfect vantage point to see Mommy the moment she emerged from the bedroom.

Dominic descended the stairs to find his children immersed in their morning routine. 

Isabella hunched over a sketchpad, her tiny fingers deftly maneuvering a paintbrush across the paper. A mesmerizing underwater scene bloomed beneath her strokes - vibrant coral reefs teeming with fantastical sea creatures. The girl's artistic talent clearly came from Evelyn.

Meanwhile, Alexander frowned in concentration over advanced calculus problems. Though only entering first grade next term, the boy's mathematical aptitude rivaled most fourth graders. 

The sight filled Dominic with quiet pride.

Hearing footsteps, Isabella bounded toward her father, waving her masterpiece. "Daddy! Look! My entry for the Citywide Youth Art Competition finals next week!"

She'd aced the preliminary round with top honors. Dominic examined the painting seriously before mussing her silky hair. 

His daughter grew more like Evelyn each day - the same heart-shaped face, luminous eyes, and delicate features. Even her thoughtful expression mirrored her mother's.

"Impressive improvement," he conceded. "But don't get complacent. Keep refining your technique."

Isabella beamed and scampered back to her artwork.

Alexander closed his workbook respectfully. "Father," he greeted with unusual formality for a six-year-old.

Dominic reviewed the completed problems. Every complex equation solved flawlessly. 

"Acceptable," he said evenly, though inwardly astonished by his son's prowess. The boy inherited his own analytical genius.

Seeing Alexander's slumped shoulders, Dominic softened. "You think I'm too hard on you? That your sister gets to play while you study?"

The child shook his head, but his trembling lip betrayed him.

"As the Blackwood heir, you'll bear responsibilities others can't fathom." Dominic crouched to eye level. "You must become strong enough to protect Mommy, Isabella, and your unborn sibling. These lessons seem harsh now, but they'll forge you into the man our family needs. Understood?"

Alexander nodded solemnly. Though he couldn't grasp everything, the weight of his duty settled on small shoulders. He'd work twice as hard to become worthy.

Dominic's phone interrupted the moment. He ordered breakfast from their usual caterer. 

Between corporate obligations and security concerns, hiring household staff proved complicated. After the infamous nanny arson case, background checks became exhaustive. Dominic insisted on vetting not just candidates but their entire family trees. 

Until approvals cleared, takeout would suffice. He refused to let pregnancy fatigue push Evelyn back into kitchen duties.

At nearly ten, Evelyn finally emerged, rubbing sleep from her eyes. She paused on the staircase, heart swelling at the domestic scene - Dominic reviewing schoolwork while the twins chattered excitedly. 

The simple normalcy eased her lingering anxieties. Whatever storms lay ahead, this was the calm worth fighting for.
###Chapter 441

Evelyn couldn't pinpoint why she'd been restless all night. Maybe it was the pregnancy hormones playing tricks on her emotions.

The uneasiness clung to her like a second skin. Even Dominic's presence beside her did little to ease the gnawing discomfort in her chest.

Seeing her husband and twins interacting normally this morning finally made her feel alive again.

A glance at her watch showed 10 AM. Guilt twisted her stomach when she realized she'd overslept breakfast.

"Mommy, you're awake!" Isabella's sharp eyes spotted Evelyn first.

The little girl abandoned her hairbrush, rushing to Evelyn's side on tiptoes. Tiny fingers gently pressed against Evelyn's belly. "Hi Baby Brother! It's your big sister Isabella! Were you good in Mommy's tummy last night?"

This had become their morning ritual.

Though they didn't know the baby's gender, Alexander had convinced his sister it must be a boy.

Evelyn's heart melted at her daughter's antics.

She pulled Isabella close, crouching to plant a kiss on her forehead. "Baby Brother behaved, just like you." Isabella whispered, "When will he come out, Mommy? I want to play with him so bad."

Evelyn rubbed her stomach with a soft smile. "A few more months, sweetheart."

After their chat, Evelyn remembered breakfast. "I should prepare—"

Dominic cut her off with an indulgent look. "Already ordered delivery. We were waiting for you to wake up. The kids had milk and bread. They won't starve."

Relief washed over Evelyn.

Lately, she'd been sleeping later than usual.

Work concerns nagged at her. Being housebound during pregnancy might drive her insane - she couldn't stand idleness.

Breakfast arrived ten minutes later.

An extravagant spread covered the table: gourmet sandwiches, layer cakes, eggs prepared three ways, soups, fresh juices, dairy products, and two boxes of pregnancy-friendly fruits.

Dominic meticulously peeled a hard-boiled egg for Evelyn, piled her plate high, then filled her bowl with oatmeal. He blew on the steaming porridge until it cooled, nearly spoon-feeding her.

The twins exchanged eye rolls at their father's pampering.

Even they hadn't received such royal treatment.

Evelyn flushed with embarrassment.

Since her pregnancy, Dominic had become increasingly attentive, treating her like a fragile doll. The initial awkwardness had gradually faded into acceptance...

Post-breakfast, the twins played while Evelyn scrolled through social media.

Abigail's latest post showed disastrous salon results - her waist-length curls butchered into a failed Korean perm. The accompanying crying-face emoji made Evelyn chuckle. She hit 'like.'

Abigail responded instantly with a middle-finger emoji.

Evelyn laughed, continuing her scroll.

Olivia's feed showed several photos at a local orphanage with smiling children. Clearly another charity visit.

Since her abortion recovery, Olivia appeared cheerful, but Evelyn detected subtle differences.

The smiles didn't reach her eyes anymore. A silent sorrow lingered beneath the surface that made Evelyn's heart ache with guilt.

Further scrolling revealed Genevieve's concerning post - a stern elderly man's photo captioned simply: "Prayers."

The post disappeared moments later, but the unease remained. Evelyn's pulse quickened.

After deliberation, she messaged Genevieve privately: [Good morning Mrs. Prescott. Evelyn Sinclair from T Corporation here. Saw your recent post - hope I'm not overstepping, but is Mr. Prescott alright?]

The message sent, Evelyn worried it might seem intrusive. Yet she didn't hesitate when typing.

To her surprise, Genevieve replied within a minute: [Father-in-law had an arterial blockage yesterday. Thankfully timely intervention saved him. He's stable now. Thank you for your concern, Ms. Sinclair.]

Evelyn's breath hitched.

She remembered Mr. Prescott's vitality at his birthday celebration. How could such robust health deteriorate so suddenly?

Pity twisted her heart for the ailing patriarch.

After consideration, she responded: [In that case, he should avoid exertion, emotional stress, and temperature fluctuations. Wishing him speedy recovery...]

Genevieve's reply came swiftly: [Actually, Father-in-law mentioned you earlier. His new residence construction begins soon, but he wishes to discuss details. Are you available today? He'd like to meet.]

Evelyn set her phone down, emotions swirling. Even without the invitation, she'd planned to visit.

Though their interactions were few, Mr. Prescott's kindness always felt strangely familial - almost grandfatherly...
###Chapter 442

Evelyn sighed and tossed her phone onto the glass coffee table. She decided she'd visit Mr. Prescott later that afternoon.

The elderly gentleman was an important client, after all. And Genevieve had personally extended the invitation. It would be rude not to pay her respects.

Turning her head, she noticed Alexander struggling with an advanced mathematics textbook.

Curiosity piqued, she leaned closer. The book was clearly meant for fourth graders.

Evelyn snatched it from his small hands, frowning. "Alexander, you're starting first grade next month. Why are you doing fourth-grade problems?"

The boy straightened his posture. Determination flashed in his bright eyes. "I want to skip to third grade, Mommy. First grade is too easy for me."

Her breath caught.

That serious expression on his young face reminded her of his teacher's comments during last semester's parent-teacher conference.

"Alexander shows exceptional intelligence for his age. He's practically a child prodigy."

"His cognitive abilities match those of a third or fourth grader. Going through standard elementary curriculum would be wasting his potential. Grade skipping should be considered."

While proud of her son's brilliance, Evelyn had reservations.

Child prodigies often burned out too young. More importantly, she wanted him to experience a normal, carefree childhood.

Grade skipping had never been part of her plans.

Now faced with her son's unexpectedly mature decision, she felt at a loss.

"Do you understand what skipping grades entails, Alexander?"

"I do, Mommy."

Those big, earnest eyes stared up at her as he clasped his hands behind his back like a miniature adult. "I'm six now. Old enough to make my own choices and take responsibility for them. When I grow up, I'll help Daddy with work so he doesn't have to work late every night. Then he'll have more time for you and Isabella..."

The boy had noticed how rarely his father had free time for family outings.

Their family was different.

Other parents took their children hiking or to amusement parks. Not them.

Alexander believed it was because his father worked too much.

Tears pricked Evelyn's eyes as she studied his serious little face.

Why did he have to be so perceptive?

Sometimes she wished her children could remain blissfully ignorant, enjoying their childhood without burdens.

She cupped his soft cheeks. "We'll discuss this with Daddy first. You're still young, Alexander. I just want you and your sister to grow up happy."

He planted a wet kiss on her cheek. "I know, Mommy."

Dominic emerged from the kitchen just in time to witness the exchange.

Seeing his wife receive affection from another male - even if it was their son - made his jaw tighten.

A flicker of jealousy darkened his deep-set eyes as he took in his son's handsome features.

Dominic approached with deliberate steps. "Finished your homework, Alexander?"

The boy turned, blinking innocently before breaking into a grin. "Almost done, Daddy. I completed all the problems you assigned."

He proudly flipped to the last page of his workbook, awaiting praise.

Dominic gave it a cursory glance. "Hmm. Since you've finished, let's move on to something more challenging. This seems too easy for you."

Alexander's face fell. He shot Evelyn a wounded puppy-dog look, radiating injustice.

Evelyn pulled him into a protective embrace, glaring at Dominic. "He's just a child! Why overload him with work? Modern parenting emphasizes reducing academic pressure, not adding to it. Learn to balance work and play. Alexander, ignore Daddy. You're done - go play now."

Seeing Evelyn's temper flare, Dominic's stern expression softened instantly. "Don't be angry, Evelyn. Whatever you say. Alexander, you may go play."

The boy stuck his tongue out at his father.

Maybe Daddy intimidated him, but Daddy feared Mommy, and Mommy listened to him. With Mommy's protection, he didn't need to be scared!

Evelyn informed Dominic about Mr. Prescott's condition.

Learning the elder statesman was recuperating, Dominic insisted on accompanying her.

He shared a close bond with Mr. Prescott. Even without personal ties, the businessman in him recognized the value of maintaining relationships.

Though retired, Mr. Prescott's son Jonathan wielded considerable influence in the city. Cultivating this connection would benefit Blackwood Enterprises.

For the visit, Evelyn selected fruits rich in vitamins and pectin to aid recovery.

After dropping the children at Blackwood Manor, they drove to the Prescott estate.

The Prescott residence stood on sprawling grounds far from urban bustle.

The architecture appeared dated but well-maintained, the gardens immaculate - clear indicators of the Prescotts' appreciation for order.

An elderly gentleman with silver-white hair basked in sunlight on a rattan chair - Mr. Prescott himself.

He conversed with Jonathan while Genevieve hung fresh laundry. Despite household staff, the Prescotts preferred handling chores themselves.

Mrs. Prescott prepared tea nearby as Lillian, impeccably dressed, regaled her with amusing anecdotes that drew laughter.

The family turned at the sound of an approaching vehicle.

A luxury car pulled up outside.

Dominic emerged carrying a fruit basket while Evelyn stepped out the opposite side.

Lillian's pulse quickened at Dominic's arrival. But spotting Evelyn beside him, her heart constricted as if swarmed by angry hornets.

Damn it. Why did Dominic always bring that woman everywhere?
###Chapter 443

Dominic steadied Old Mr. Prescott as he rose. The elderly gentleman's eyes sparkled with gratitude when he saw Evelyn.  

"You came, Dominic and Evelyn. How thoughtful of you to visit an old man like me. And you brought gifts!"  

Dominic gave a respectful nod and placed the fruit basket on the table. He guided Old Mr. Prescott back into his chair. "Please rest. Evelyn and I heard you weren't feeling well. How are you now?"  

"Nothing serious, just old age catching up," Old Mr. Prescott chuckled warmly. "Evelyn, I've been meaning to ask you about the design plans. There are a few details I don't quite understand..."  

Evelyn smiled softly. "I'd be happy to clarify everything for you, Old Mr. Prescott."  

"Wonderful! Lillian, come greet our guests," he called out.  

Lillian approached with practiced grace, her voice honeyed. "Grandfather."  

Her smile was flawless, but Evelyn caught the icy daggers in her gaze. A shiver ran down her spine.  

Old Mr. Prescott beamed. "This is Evelyn Sinclair, the brilliant architect from T Corporation. Such talent at her age!"  

Lillian masked her disdain. "We've met, Grandfather. Evelyn... assisted me during my commercial shoot at T Corporation."  

The memory of losing her endorsement deal to this woman still burned.  

"Oh? You know Ms. Sinclair?" A sharp voice cut in. Old Mrs. Prescott eyed Evelyn critically. "Which university did you attend, dear?"  

The older woman knew her granddaughter's feelings for Dominic. She approved of the match—Lillian was refined, accomplished, and beautiful. Far superior to this nobody.  

Evelyn sensed the hostility but remained composed. "Just an ordinary school abroad, Old Mrs. Prescott. Names matter less than skills, don't you think? Degrees open doors, but ability keeps them open."  

Old Mrs. Prescott sniffed. "My Lillian graduated from London College of Arts—top-tier globally. She won Best Actress in her debut! Unlike some who probably bought their degrees..."  

Evelyn's smile didn't waver. "My alma mater doesn't sell degrees, Old Mrs. Prescott. St. Andrew's ranks third in England for academic rigor. Not Oxford, but certainly no diploma mill."  

The barb struck home. Lillian flushed—her prestigious-sounding school ranked far lower.  

Old Mrs. Prescott pursed her lips but held her tongue. She wouldn't make a scene in front of guests.  

Meanwhile, Dominic, Jonathan, and Old Mr. Prescott discussed business. Jonathan grew increasingly impressed by Dominic's acumen. T Corporation dominated the city's economy under his leadership, contributing a third of its tax revenue.  

The bribery evidence in Jonathan's pocket suddenly felt heavier. Report it? The consequences could be catastrophic. He shelved the dilemma for later.  

"What's the status on the downtown redevelopment?" Jonathan asked instead.  

Dominic, dressed in understated black, exuded quiet authority. "T Corporation and Vivi Group have finalized contracts. Construction begins next week. The district will be transformed."  

Old Mr. Prescott sighed. "Edmund was lucky to have you. His son Zachary was a disappointment... Dominic, I'd have made you my grandson-in-law if you weren't already taken."  

Dominic's gaze softened as it found Evelyn. His voice carried quiet finality. "I appreciate the sentiment, but my heart belongs to Evelyn. We're getting married May first."  

The declaration silenced the garden. Reactions varied—Old Mr. Prescott's disappointment, Old Mrs. Prescott's frustration, Jonathan's shock, Genevieve's resignation, Evelyn's stunned disbelief.  

May first? Since when?  

Lillian's heart twisted violently. So soon? Her nails dug into her palms as she glared at Evelyn. The hatred in her eyes could melt steel.
###Chapter 444

Christopher Prescott gestured for Genevieve to bring Evelyn's architectural plans.

The elderly statesman and the young designer became engrossed in discussing intricate details of the countryside villa design.

Despite their significant age difference, their conversation flowed effortlessly.

Though retired from politics, Christopher possessed vast knowledge across multiple disciplines. He even used technical architectural terms that would baffle most junior designers, impressing Evelyn greatly.

Evelyn, in turn, had captured Christopher's admiration.

The young woman wasn't just beautiful - her innovative design sensibility, contemporary thinking, and humble demeanor pleased the old gentleman immensely.

His gaze shifted critically to his granddaughter Lillian, dressed like royalty, before turning away with visible dissatisfaction.

While his family adored Lillian's gentle facade, Christopher found her affected mannerisms insufferable. Her obsession with the superficial entertainment industry particularly displeased him.

Lillian shifted uncomfortably.

The technical discussion between her grandfather and Evelyn left no opening for her to interject. When Christopher's disappointed glance sliced through her, she felt as though a steel ruler had cleaved her heart in two, leaving her seething with unexpressed fury.

She knew with certainty her grandfather remained unaware Evelyn was his biological granddaughter. Yet after just two meetings, they bonded like family.

Was this some subconscious blood recognition?

Lillian's eyes turned glacial. She wouldn't let this interloper steal everything from her!

Oblivious to his granddaughter's darkening mood, Christopher pointed at the garden plot on the blueprint. "Since we're building a pastoral retreat, what would you recommend planting here, Evelyn?"

Unconsciously, he'd begun using the familiar "Evelyn" instead of "Ms. Sinclair."

Evelyn considered briefly. "Vitamin-rich vegetables would be ideal - carrots, eggplants, bok choy, lentils. Homegrown produce contains more nutrients without pesticides. Excellent for your health."

Lillian nearly choked imagining vegetable patches beside an elegant mansion!

'That country bumpkin Evelyn knows nothing! Who plants vegetables at an estate?'

She lifted her chin. "Grandfather, vegetables seem... inappropriate. Flower gardens suit prestigious homes better. No respectable mansion grows produce."

An awkward silence followed.

Evelyn stared at the haughty socialite, speechless.

Lillian preened at having silenced her rival.

Christopher's face darkened instantly. "Since when do I need permission to plant what I like? Flowers are merely decorative - vegetables serve practical purposes!"

"Historical figures maintained vegetable gardens during retirement. Who are you to dictate my choices?"

Lillian flushed crimson. "I didn't mean..."

"Then what did you mean?" Christopher's face reddened with anger. "That only peasants grow vegetables? Your ancestors were peasants! I was raised on a farm!"

"Every bite you eat comes from farmers' labor, yet you scorn them? Without their toil, you'd starve! If I hadn't left farming, you'd still be picking vegetables yourself!"

Genevieve quickly intervened with tea. "Father, Lillian meant no offense. Please calm yourself - your health..."

Lillian shot her mother a resentful look before forcing an apology. "Forgive me, Grandfather. I spoke carelessly. Plant whatever you desire - I'll source the seeds myself."

Christopher ignored her.

Elizabeth Prescott chided her husband. "Must you overreact? Flower gardens are traditional for good reason - imagine the spring blossoms! Though vegetables have merits too. Lillian merely expressed an opinion - why berate our granddaughter?"

The atmosphere turned uncomfortably tense. Evelyn decided to excuse herself to the restroom.

The Prescott's vine-adorned bathroom featured a modern dual design - vanity area separated from the toilet facilities.

As Evelyn exited, she found Lillian blocking her path in towering heels...
###Chapter 445

Evelyn stepped into the restroom.

Lillian gave her a curt nod. "Ms. Sinclair."

She moved toward the sink, squeezing liquid soap onto her palms. The mirror reflected Lillian's flawlessly made-up face - beautiful yet chilling.

Despite Lillian's pleasant smile, Evelyn felt unease crawling up her spine.

She knew better than to trust Lillian's innocent facade.

Memories flooded back - the shopping mall confrontation, the humiliating T Corporation commercial shoot, the vicious Persian cat attack at Blue Honors...

The evidence might point to Lillian's assistant, but Evelyn wasn't naive. She recognized the puppet master. Only Lillian's status kept Evelyn from exposing her.

Evelyn broke the silence first. "Did you need something, Ms. Prescott?"

Lillian turned on the adjacent faucet. "You've gained weight. Life must be treating you well."

Evelyn wasn't in the mood for pleasantries. "Get to the point."

A smirk played on Lillian's lips. "Smart but dull. Do you really think you'll marry Dominic on May 1st? What makes you worthy? Mediocre looks, no family connections. A City has countless better women. I can't fathom why he chose you. Even I—"

"Not your concern," Evelyn cut in. "Dominic loves me. That's all that matters."

Lillian's four-inch heels gave her a height advantage. She loomed over Evelyn with false superiority. "You're mismatched. Leave him before you regret it."

Evelyn met her gaze steadily, showing no fear.

Flustered by Evelyn's composure, Lillian produced a check from her purse. "Ten million dollars. Take it and disappear. Otherwise, you'll regret it."

Evelyn accepted the check.

Her lips curved at the amount. "Generous. This could buy a decent house."

Disgust twisted Lillian's features. How could Dominic love such a gold-digger?

Then Evelyn did the unexpected.

She methodically tore the check to shreds and tossed it in the trash. "Dominic and I are getting married. Accept it. Let go of what was never yours. Consider this conversation forgotten."

Lillian's face darkened with rage. "I always get what I want! No commoner like you will touch the man I love!"

Evelyn laughed bitterly. The audacity to claim Dominic!

"Ms. Prescott, I'm Dominic's girlfriend. Has he ever acknowledged you? From what I recall, he's consistently rejected you. Shall I have him remind you personally?"

Lillian's chest heaved with fury.

Suddenly, her tone softened. "We're both women, Evelyn. A woman's heart is fragile. Dominic's the only man I've ever loved. Let me have him."

"There are plenty of men in A City. Why obsess over one? I'm becoming depressed... You're kind-hearted. You wouldn't want that, would you?"

Tears glistened in Lillian's eyes as she grasped Evelyn's arm. "Name your price. Just leave him alone!"

Evelyn nearly laughed aloud.

The sheer shamelessness! Lillian framed herself as the victim in this twisted narrative.

Evelyn pushed her away. "Sorry, but I'm keeping Dominic. Feel free to attend our wedding on May 1st."

Lillian's sudden, chilling laughter raised goosebumps on Evelyn's skin. "I guarantee you won't marry him that day. Care to wager?"

Evelyn left without another word.

As they drove from the Prescott estate, Dominic noticed Evelyn's troubled expression. He ruffled her hair gently. "What's wrong? You seem more upset now than when we arrived."

Evelyn studied Dominic's profile as the memory of his words at the Prescott mansion resurfaced. 

Her fingers twisted in her lap. "You mentioned our wedding is set for May 1st. What's happening?"

Dominic eased his foot off the accelerator slightly.

When his gaze met hers, warmth flooded his expression. "It was meant to be a surprise, but circumstances forced my hand. Evelyn, I want the world to know you're carrying my children and that you're the woman I love. We're having the grandest wedding this city has ever seen."

"May 1st? That's...so soon." Evelyn's pulse stuttered at the suddenness of it all. 

Dominic's knuckles whitened around the steering wheel. "Do you not want this?"

The abrupt chill in his voice made her stomach drop. She reached for his arm. "No! It's not that. I just need time to process. I always knew we'd marry, but I never imagined it happening this fast..."

Their love had been a fragile seed buried deep, nearly suffocated by neglect and circumstance. Only recently had they nurtured it back to life, tenderly coaxing forth delicate buds. 

Now it was about to blossom in full glory, and Evelyn's heart swelled at the thought.

Dominic's shoulders relaxed. "Leave everything to me. Just focus on becoming my beautiful bride."

He harbored no doubts about her commitment. Their bond ran deeper than either could articulate. Making Evelyn his wife wasn't just desire—it was destiny.

Evelyn worried her lower lip. "But your mother still doesn't approve, and my grandfather and aunt don't even know—"

"Mother's opinion is irrelevant." Dominic cut her off gently. "We won't be living under her roof. As for your family, I'll visit them this week. Invitations go out soon, and we'll take wedding photos in April—the weather will be kinder for you."

Evelyn's throat tightened. This seemingly aloof man had orchestrated every detail without her knowledge. 

Yet Leia's warning slithered through her mind like venom.

She considered telling Dominic about the ten-million-dollar check Leia had slipped her in the restroom. But seeing his determined expression, the words died on her tongue. 

The Prescotts valued their social standing above all. However much they wanted Dominic for their daughter-in-law, their pride wouldn't permit outright interference...

Meanwhile, in the Prescott kitchen...

Genevieve tied her apron strings, scrubbing pork ribs under running water.

Lillian swept in.

"Let me help, Mother." Lillian forced cheer into her voice while grimacing at the vegetable leaves staining her manicure. 

Dirt lodged beneath her polished nails. Disgust churned her stomach, but she soldiered on.

Genevieve remained oblivious to her daughter's revulsion. 

"Darling, you should rest. You've lost weight!" She fretted over Lillian's bandaged hand submerged in the sink. "Your injury needs to stay dry. I appreciate the help, but your health comes first. The kitchen's no place for you right now."

Lillian pasted on a smile. "It's nearly healed, Mother. I wish I could cook like you—I'd prepare meals for you and Father every day..."

Genevieve sighed. "Stubborn girl. Just don't aggravate that wound."

Lillian's expression darkened. "Mother, that Evelyn Sinclair is marrying Dominic on May 1st. She's utterly ordinary—what does he see in her? Am I not good enough?"

Genevieve deftly sliced ginger, her usual aristocratic demeanor softened by domesticity. "You're exceptional, darling. But Dominic's heart belongs to another. No good comes from forcing such matters."

Tears welled in Lillian's eyes. "I can't live without him, Mother. Help me stop this wedding. Once they're married, I'll lose him forever!"

Her fingers curled into fists, smearing vegetable dirt across her designer blouse. The ten-million-dollar bribe had failed. Now she needed more drastic measures.

Tears welled up in Lillian's eyes as she spoke.

She cried silently, her face the picture of abandonment and despair.

Her vulnerability mirrored that of a helpless infant.

This had always been her winning card. Countless times, she'd manipulated Genevieve with tears to get whatever she desired.

But this time, Genevieve only sighed deeply.

Genevieve tenderly wiped Lillian's tears with a tissue. "My dear, trust me, Dominic isn't your fairytale ending. Stealing another woman's man is wrong. You'll find someone who cherishes you properly. You may not understand now, but you will. Let me make your favorite dish..."

Lillian's mood instantly darkened.

Her fail-proof tactic had failed. The tears stopped abruptly.

Resentment burned in her cold gaze.

All Genevieve's declarations of love rang hollow when she refused to help Lillian obtain the man she craved. The injustice burned.

Blood ties meant nothing to Genevieve!

In that moment, years of Genevieve's kindness evaporated from Lillian's memory.

Her dissatisfaction grew, projecting her hatred for Evelyn onto Genevieve.

The vegetables before her became Evelyn in her mind. Lillian's eyes darkened with malice as she viciously shredded them.

'Dominic belongs to me, Evelyn. No one takes what's mine!'

Noticing Lillian's distress and the mutilated vegetables, Genevieve shook her head. "Go rest, darling. I'll handle dinner."

Lillian abandoned pretense, retreating under the guise of reviewing scripts.

Genevieve sighed at the destroyed vegetables. Her precious girl excelled at everything except domestic skills. But she'd spoiled her only child willingly.

Meanwhile, Dominic worked in his study while Evelyn showered and lounged in bed. Exhausted yet exhilarated about their May 1st wedding, she messaged her friends.

[Guess what, lovelies? Wedding bells on May 1st!]

The dormant group chat exploded.

Olivia responded first: [So soon! Did Mr. CEO propose properly?]

Abigail chimed in: [OMG! I demand bridesmaid duties! I must witness your happiness firsthand!]

Before Evelyn could reply, Abigail added: [Wait... is there another bun in the oven?]

Evelyn rolled her eyes but sent a voice message: "Will you both be my bridesmaids?"

Abigail replied with a crying emoji: [Can a pregnant whale even be a bridesmaid? The horror of not fitting the dress!]

Olivia teased: [They make dresses for all sizes! Saw a 200-pound bride last week looking stunning!]

Their banter continued until Abigail excused herself: [Baby shopping! Visit soon!]

At the boutique, Abigail's radiant smile made clerks assume she texted her husband. "Miss, you and your husband must be so in love!" one gushed.

Abigail didn't correct them. "Recommend newborn outfits please. Two sets each for boy and girl."

Her recent ultrasound revealed twins - an unexpected blessing that eclipsed her one-night stand trauma.

Suddenly, Sebastian appeared.

The clerks retreated at his signal. "Ms. Thornton," he greeted, startling Abigail.

Her clothes tumbled as she gasped: "Mr. Whitmore! Are you stalking me?"

"Can't I browse baby clothes?" he teased, amused by her overreaction.

Pregnancy had softened Abigail's usual reserve, making her reactions delightfully raw.

Fascinating.

Unbidden, his mind returned to that mysterious night with an unknown woman.

"Stop staring!" Abigail snapped, shielding herself. Since that night, male attention repulsed her.

Sebastian chuckled. Her fiery demeanor starkly contrasted her office persona.

Annoyed, Abigail prepared to leave when new customers entered.

The garishly dressed woman clinging to her foppish companion barely registered - until Abigail saw the man's face.

Recognition struck like lightning.

Her steps faltered, tears threatening to spill...

Abigail froze when her eyes landed on Henry Caldwell.

Never in her wildest dreams did she expect to encounter her ex-lover again.

The man she'd sacrificed everything for stood there grinning, his arm draped around an obscenely overweight woman.

A bitter laugh escaped Abigail's lips at the absurdity of it all.

Five years. 

They'd spent five inseparable years together. 

Both came from poverty, though Henry's family had it worse. During high school, she'd worked multiple jobs to support them both.

When college acceptance letters arrived, Abigail turned down a full scholarship. She needed to start earning immediately to fund Henry's education.

For three years, she paid his tuition, rent, groceries - everything. Touched by her devotion, Henry had vowed to marry her. 

Then graduation day came. 

He dumped her while holding hands with Jane Kensington, whose father chaired the Municipal Legal Committee. That connection could fast-track Henry's career by a decade.

Abigail would never forget Henry's cruel smirk or Jane's condescending stare.

Years later, Jane had ballooned in size. Her face resembled a bloated moon, eyes nearly disappearing in folds of fat. That protruding belly could be pregnancy or just gluttony.

Jane spotted Abigail immediately. She lifted her chins haughtily. "Well, if it isn't Miss Thornton! Knocked up already? Surprising anyone would touch Hank's leftovers. These clothes look expensive - sure you can afford them? Need charity?"

"Save your pity for orphans," Abigail replied coolly. "They actually need it."

Henry gaped at Abigail. The girl he remembered wore thick glasses and frumpy sweaters. 

This woman radiated metropolitan elegance. Sleek hairstyle, designer outfit, confident posture - she'd transformed into a vision of sophistication.

Compared to his porcine wife, Abigail might as well be a goddess.

Jane noticed Henry's slack-jawed stare. Rage twisted her doughy face. She yanked his ear viciously. "Enjoying the view, husband? I'm standing right here!"

"Ow! Sweetheart, please - think of the baby!" Henry whimpered, attempting to embrace his wife's mountainous form. His arms couldn't even reach halfway around her girth.

He planted sloppy kisses on Jane's greasy cheek. "You're my everything, darling. The most beautiful woman alive."

Jane sniffed. "Liar! You were eyeing your ex like a starving mutt!"

Her beady eyes darted to Abigail. That frumpy girl had blossomed into serious competition. Jane's grip on Henry suddenly felt precarious.

Eager to appease his wife, Henry sneered at Abigail. "Why would I look at her? She's nothing to me - less than a stray dog. Can't hold a candle to you."

The words ripped open old wounds. 

Three years of backbreaking labor. Three years of selfless support. And she meant less than a stray animal?

White-hot anger surged through Abigail. "How noble of you, Henry. Who paid your tuition? Your rent? Your parents' medical bills? I slaved for years without complaint, and this is your gratitude? Calling me a stray because her daddy could get you a fancy job?"

The public humiliation turned Henry crimson. Onlookers' disdainful glances burned into him. 

"I...I..." he stammered, unable to meet Abigail's gaze.

Jane bristled. "Shut your filthy mouth! No wonder he dumped you - look at you, pregnant and alone. Must've spread your legs for half the city, you slut!"

Abigail's hands clenched into fists. She ached to wipe that smug smirk off Jane's face.

Just as she stepped forward, a deep voice cut through the tension like a blade. "She's carrying my baby."

Strong arms enveloped Abigail from behind...
###Chapter 446

Sebastian's muscular frame stood silhouetted against the light. He shielded the pregnant Abigail with the protective stance of a true gentleman.

His piercing gaze swept from Henry to Jane, then settled on Abigail.

The ice in his eyes melted when he saw the anguish reflected in Abigail's tear-filled eyes.

Meanwhile, Jane studied how Sebastian cradled Abigail possessively. The distinguished man in his thirties radiated wealth and power.

His custom Ermenegildo Zegna suit and platinum Piaget watch screamed affluence. Jane's lips twisted in envy, refusing to acknowledge Abigail had landed such a catch.

"Who knew my husband's discarded trash could attract rich men now?" Jane sneered, voice dripping with venom. "Quite the upgrade, Abigail. You've perfected your gold-digging skills!"

Jane refused to believe Henry hadn't slept with Abigail during their five-year relationship. Not when Henry performed so skillfully in bed - he must have practiced on Abigail!

This thought fueled Jane's burning hatred.

Abigail itched to stitch Jane's poisonous mouth shut.

Her fiery temper flared. She'd never tolerate such slander.

"Shameless hypocrite!" Abigail shot back. "Henry's not even worthy to lick my shoes. Only a desperate fool like you would want such trash. I wasted five years nurturing that ingrate - I should've raised a dog instead!"

She continued mercilessly, "At least a dog shows gratitude. You two deserve each other! I just pity your unborn child inheriting such disgraceful genes!"

"You... you vicious witch!" Jane's plump frame trembled with rage.

This wasn't the meek Abigail she remembered - the girl who used to cower in corners when bullied. When had she grown such sharp claws?

Sebastian watched with quiet amusement. Abigail had eviscerated the couple without a single curse. In different circumstances, he'd applaud her verbal execution.

"Hit that bitch, Henry! How dare she curse our baby! Make her pay!" Jane kicked Henry viciously.

Henry hesitated, eyes darting between the women.

Jane slapped him hard. "Useless coward! Still carrying a torch for her? Either beat her now or I'll divorce you tonight! Daddy will throw you out with nothing!"

Panicked, Henry lunged at Abigail like an obedient attack dog.

Abigail instinctively shielded her belly, heart shattering as her ex-lover raised his hand against her.

'Damn it! He's really going to hit me!'

Before Henry could strike, Sebastian twisted his wrist with bone-crushing force.

"Argh!" Henry howled in agony. "P-please, sir... l-let's talk..."

Jane flailed hysterically. "Release my husband! Do you know who my father is? Daddy will—"

Sebastian cut her off with a glacial stare. "I couldn't care less about your family. Disgusting behavior, assaulting a pregnant woman. Get out of my sight!"

He flung Henry aside like garbage. "Next time I catch you harassing women, consequences will be severe."

"You'll regret this!" Jane screeched, dragging Henry away as store employees laughed at their retreating figures.

"Are you alright, Ms. Thornton?" Sebastian asked gently, pity stirring in his chest.

'No wonder she distrusts men after surviving such toxicity.'

"I'm fine. Thank you, Mr. Whitmore." Abigail turned to leave before her brave facade crumbled.

Having her darkest shame exposed publicly was humiliating enough. Worse, Sebastian Whitmore - her professional equal - had witnessed everything.

"Let me drive you home," Sebastian offered impulsively, watching her stiffen.

"No need. I have my car." She walked away without looking back.

Sebastian shook his head in frustration.

'Why must she be so stubborn? Must she always reject help?'

The next morning after breakfast, Dominic prepared to meet a mysterious contact.

Concerned Evelyn might grow restless alone, he recalled the nearby peach orchard in full bloom - the perfect distraction.

After three hours' drive, they arrived at the meeting point's hotel parking lot.

Their contact had been delayed. With an hour to spare, Dominic guided Evelyn through the private orchard nestled against mountain foothills.

Pink petals swirled like enchanted snow as they walked hand-in-hand beneath flowering branches.

"Who is this important friend?" Evelyn asked curiously, marveling at the ethereal beauty around them.

She couldn't imagine anyone warranting such an elaborate journey...
###Chapter 447

Dominic's fingers trailed through Evelyn's silky strands as he pressed a kiss to the tip of her nose. "That man's an international fraud wanted by Interpol. Doesn't that scare you?" 

Evelyn's lips parted in shock. 

Unable to resist her adorable reaction, Dominic pinched her earlobe. "Darling, you actually believed that?"

She playfully swatted his chest when she saw his teasing grin. "Don't joke about such things! You had me genuinely worried."

Warmth flooded Dominic's chest as Evelyn's smile outshone even the most vibrant spring blossoms. 

It wasn't just her beauty that captivated him, but the grace and kindness radiating from her very being. Just being near her eased his burdens.

"Some decisions I make have complex reasons behind them," he murmured, cradling her delicate hand. "As a mother of three, you should focus on setting examples rather than fretting over every little thing."

"I know," Evelyn sighed. "Pregnancy hormones make everything feel more intense."

Dominic laced their fingers together as they ventured deeper into the peach grove. "With me here, you'll never need to shed another tear."

The garden unfolded like a living painting - endless rows of peach trees heavy with blossoms ranging from delicate snow white to passionate sunset pink. 

For the first time in weeks, Dominic's corporate responsibilities faded from his mind. The woman beside him was his sanctuary, his reason for understanding love's true meaning.

After ten minutes, Evelyn suddenly halted, studying his chiseled features with newfound intensity. 

Dominic smirked. "Tired? I can carry—"

Her lips silenced him as she rose on tiptoes, trailing kisses from his forehead down to his strong jawline. A mischievous glint sparkled in her eyes - a rare display of boldness from his usually reserved wife.

Dominic arched a brow. "In public? Where's my shy girl gone?"

Evelyn's coy smile held secrets. "There's nobody here. Besides, it's my turn to initiate." She gestured toward a vintage gazebo where another couple was lost in their own intimate moment. 

Spring's embrace surrounded them - fragrant blossoms, birdsong, and the intoxicating promise of new beginnings.

Each time Evelyn stretched to kiss him, Dominic had to bend slightly. Yet he adored this playful side of her emerging like the season's first blooms.

The further they wandered, the more intense the floral perfume grew until they reached a secluded resting area with rattan chairs.

"This place is magical," Evelyn breathed. "The owner must cherish life's beauty."

Dominic's response was immediate. "Shall I purchase it for you?"

He might as well have been discussing buying a cup of coffee for how casually the multimillion-dollar offer left his lips. For Evelyn's happiness, no price was too steep.

Her eyes widened. Seeing his seriousness, she quickly shook her head. "This garden is someone else's labor of love. I couldn't possibly take that away."

More importantly, the sprawling estate on A City's outskirts carried an astronomical price tag. Evelyn never exploited Dominic's devotion with unreasonable demands - a quality he treasured.

"Then I'll acquire land for your own garden," he vowed. "Where you can cultivate whatever your heart desires."

Assuming he jested, Evelyn lost herself in admiring his striking features framed by falling petals. Words felt inadequate - only physical closeness could convey the depth of her emotions.

Their lips met again until something cool brushed Evelyn's nape. A breathtaking emerald necklace glimmered against her skin, its turquoise hues rivaling tropical waters.

Recognizing Dominic's extravagant tastes, she immediately removed it. "You've already gifted me jewelry. I can't—"

"I purchased this during my last business trip," he interjected smoothly. "A modest piece, really. Barely a few thousand."

Only years later at an antique auction would Evelyn discover the devastating truth - her "affordable" necklace was a one-of-a-kind museum-worthy artifact. Dominic's little white lie had been for her comfort, not his wallet. 

For now, she accepted the gift with trusting innocence, unaware of its priceless legacy...
###Chapter 448

Dominic carefully fastened the emerald necklace around Evelyn's slender neck. "This has a tracking device," he murmured, his fingers lingering on her skin. "Wherever you go, I'll always be able to find you."

Evelyn's fingers brushed against the delicate jewelry, her eyes widening in surprise. She never expected such advanced technology in what appeared to be an ordinary necklace.

Most people would assume only million-dollar jewels came equipped with tracking capabilities. But Evelyn trusted Dominic implicitly - if he said it had a tracker, then it did.

"How does it look?" she asked, twisting to admire the piece in the mirror.

Though newly pregnant, Evelyn still maintained her petite frame. At this moment, she glowed with the giddy excitement of a schoolgirl receiving her first love token.

"Perfect," Dominic replied, his gaze warm with admiration. Evelyn was his entire world.

They strolled through the garden for thirty blissful minutes until Evelyn's energy waned. Without hesitation, Dominic swept her into his arms, carrying her all the way back to their luxurious hotel suite.

The five-star accommodations exuded opulence. A massive circular waterbed dominated the room, surrounded by cascading layers of fresh roses. Sheer white curtains added an air of mystery to the romantic setting.

As an architect, Evelyn immediately noticed the impeccable design details. She marveled at how the roses maintained their vibrant freshness indoors, making mental notes for future projects. Every new space offered inspiration to improve her craft.

While Evelyn studied the room's architecture, Dominic met with a mysterious figure in the penthouse suite. "Welcome home," Dominic said, raising his wine glass in greeting.

The clink of crystal echoed through the room as Dominic continued in his signature cool tone, "How does it feel to return to your homeland after all this time?"

A tall, shadowy figure stood silhouetted against the floor-to-ceiling windows. When he turned, the light revealed a startling contrast - one side of his face angelically handsome, the other horrifically scarred from burns.

"Home feels... familiar," Gideon Blackwood rasped in his surprisingly melodic voice, though his expression remained icy. "But the real performance hasn't begun yet."

Dominic lounged casually on the sofa, swirling his wine as he studied Gideon's dour expression. "I didn't go through all that trouble breaking you out just to see that sour face," he remarked with amusement.

Gideon barely glanced at Dominic as he lit a cigarette. "Get to the point. What do you want?"

"You should cut back on those," Dominic said mildly. "Lung cancer isn't pleasant."

Gordan exhaled a plume of smoke with practiced nonchalance. "Haven't you heard? The wicked prosper while the righteous suffer. Your warnings don't apply to someone like me."

Dominic simply smiled. Gideon remained as arrogant and unpredictable as ever.

Despite his youthful appearance, Gideon was anything but ordinary. His greatest asset wasn't wealth, but his extraordinary intellect. As the youngest criminal ever featured on the FBI's Most Wanted list, he'd become legend in law enforcement circles.

A master of disguise and evasion, Gideon could slip through police dragnets with ease. In his most infamous escape, surrounded by armed officers, he'd impersonated an FBI agent so convincingly that he walked right past them.

After abandoning financial fraud, Gideon's reckless lifestyle caught up with him when he impregnated a crime lord's mistress. The enraged mobster disfigured half his face and nearly executed him before Dominic intervened during a business trip abroad.

True to form, Gideon showed no gratitude. Instead, he offered Dominic three favors to repay the debt - after which they'd be even. Dominic, ever the strategist, recognized Gideon's potential value and agreed.

"I have a simple proposition," Dominic said. "Since you're at loose ends, why not join my company? We're expanding into South America - you'd oversee operations there as General Manager."

Gideon took a long drag from his cigarette, irritation flashing across his scarred features. "You know I don't play by corporate rules. If you're looking for a desk jockey, you've got the wrong man. Surely you have another favor in mind, Mr. Blackwood?"

Dominic chuckled. The rumors were true - Gideon chafed at any constraints. But Dominic didn't care about Gideon's eccentricities, only his results.

As Dominic laughed, Gideon studied the enigmatic man before him. Who would guess this composed gentleman was the ruthless "Ice King" of the business world? The title came not from Dominic's demeanor, but from his cutthroat tactics.

Dominic's smile faded as he met Gideon's gaze. "You won't be chained to a desk. No nine-to-five, no corporate bureaucracy. Complete autonomy - work remotely, set your own hours. Just get results. And the compensation will be... substantial."

It was an offer Gideon couldn't refuse - especially when he needed the money.
###Chapter 449

Gideon Blackwood barely hesitated before agreeing to Dominic Blackwood's proposition.  

The money was too tempting to refuse.  

Though he'd amassed fortunes through shady dealings, his extravagant lifestyle had drained every penny.  

Now he was drowning in debt with empty bank accounts.  

Still, curiosity got the better of him. "Mr. Blackwood, I appreciate your trust, but aren't you worried I'll swindle your company like I've done to others?"  

Dominic's lips curved into a confident smirk. "Mr. Blackwood, if you can pull it off, be my guest."  

His tone was light, but his piercing gaze told another story.  

That deceptively gentle stare sent chills down Gideon's spine. He remembered the dossier he'd dug up on Dominic.  

Behind that charming smile lurked a predator who dismantled enemies with ruthless precision.  

Turning a failing company into a global empire in mere years? No one achieved that by playing nice.  

Gideon's playful demeanor vanished. He raised his glass solemnly. "To our partnership, Mr. Blackwood."  

"To us," Dominic echoed.  

This alliance was a calculated risk. Gideon was a wildcard—brilliant but unpredictable.  

Yet Dominic trusted his instincts. Controlled properly, this madman could become his most valuable weapon.  

Back at the hotel suite, Evelyn Sinclair lounged on the velvet sofa, engrossed in a fashion magazine.  

Curled up like a contented cat, she absentmindedly twirled a rose petal caught in her chestnut locks.  

The juxtaposition of innocence and allure was mesmerizing. Dominic had known countless beauties, but none radiated Evelyn's tranquil warmth.  

He scooped her up effortlessly, settling her onto his lap. "What's so fascinating?"  

"Oh! Is your friend gone?" She snuggled closer, her citrusy perfume enveloping him.  

"Mm. We're heading back to A City soon. Hungry?" He interlaced their fingers, resting his chin on her head.  

Pregnancy had turned his usually disciplined Evelyn into a snack monster.  

She gestured to the half-eaten tiramisu. "Room service already spoiled me. But look—" She grabbed his hand excitedly. "This magazine teaches palm reading!"  

His elegant fingers resembled sculpted marble.  

The deeply etched career and wisdom lines spanned his palm impressively.  

"Your fate lines are incredible!" Evelyn traced them with awe. "Smooth sailing through life's storms. And this—" Her fingertip paused between his index and middle fingers. "Your heart line shows deep commitment capacity... though these minor branches indicate serious lady-killer tendencies."  

Seraphina Prescott. Lillian Prescott. Vivienne Laurent. The names flashed through her mind like warning signs.  

Why did women flock to this man like moths to flame?  

Dominic nipped her pout with a kiss. "Only weak men stray. You're my entire universe, Evelyn. Those girls are children compared to you."  

Her cheeks pinked. "I'm not your wife yet, Mr. Blackwood."  

Their playful banter distracted them from the ominous tangle where his heart line crossed his lifeline—a twisted fusion ending at his wrist's edge.  

The conversation turned to wedding plans until Evelyn hesitated. "I had this nightmare... You vanished on our wedding day. Left me standing alone in white, humiliated..."  

Dominic crushed her against his chest. "Never. Dreams lie. If anyone gets abandoned, it'll be me." His lips found her forehead. "Our wedding will be perfect. I promise."  

He maneuvered her onto the bed, spooning her from behind. Burying his face in her nape, he inhaled her jasmine scent.  

Exhaustion weighed heavy—back in A City, corporate battles awaited. But here, wrapped around Evelyn, he found peace.  

Reassured by his heartbeat, she turned to face him. Two months until she became Mrs. Blackwood!  

Giddy excitement overtook her. She rained featherlight kisses across his face—forehead, brows, nose, even his stubbled jaw.  

Each peck was sweeter than the last. She'd doze off, then wake to repeat the ritual like a lovestruck teenager.  

Finally, Dominic pinned her beneath him, eyes darkening. "Keep this up, and I won't be responsible for the consequences."  

Evelyn giggled her surrender.  

As she settled against him, Dominic kissed her temple, arms locking possessively around his sleeping fiancée.  

His eyelids grew heavy...  

###Chapter 450  

Cassandra Prescott invited Lillian to an exclusive gathering for high-society elites.  

At first, Lillian had no intention of attending. But she couldn’t let Cassandra get away with what she’d done—that fake drug had ruined everything.  

The venue was a lavish private suite in the city’s most exclusive nightclub.  

The moment Lillian stepped inside, the bass-heavy music pulsed through her bones. The scent of expensive liquor filled the air.  

A circular stage dominated the center of the room, a gleaming steel pole at its core.  

Cassandra moved like a serpent, her body twisting in perfect rhythm with the music. Heavy makeup accentuated her seductive allure.  

Every provocative sway of her hips sent the men into a frenzy.  

Lillian, in contrast, wore minimal makeup. Yet she commanded attention effortlessly.  

Her natural beauty outshone the other women, their heavy cosmetics and desperate attempts at allure paling in comparison.  

As she walked through the crowd, gazes locked onto her.  

Most of the guests were from the same elite circles. They recognized Lillian instantly.  

"Ms. Prescott! What an honor!"  

"Lillian, you look stunning tonight."  

She acknowledged them with a polite nod, her poise flawless.  

The men were captivated. Unlike the spoiled heiresses they were used to, Lillian carried herself with effortless grace.  

Inside, she sneered.  

These men were nothing but trust-fund babies, living off their family names.  

A few were handsome, but none measured up to her standards.  

Her future partner had to be at the pinnacle of power and wealth. These playboys were beneath her.  

"Lillian! I can’t believe you actually came!" Cassandra rushed over, grabbing her hand with exaggerated enthusiasm. "You look absolutely breathtaking!"  

She was laying it on thick, desperate to maintain their "friendship."  

Lillian was the treasured daughter of Jonathan Prescott. Cassandra, an illegitimate child of the Weish family, clung to her for status.  

Lillian forced a smile. "You look lovely too."  

Then she leaned in, voice dropping to a whisper. "We need to talk. Somewhere private."  

Cassandra eagerly led her to an adjacent room, oblivious to the dangerous glint in Lillian’s eyes.  

The moment the door closed, Lillian locked it.  

Cassandra tensed. "Lillian? What’s going on? Why—"  

A sharp crack echoed as Lillian’s palm connected with Cassandra’s cheek.  

Cassandra staggered, hand flying to her stinging face. Blood coated her tongue.  

She gaped at Lillian. "What the hell was that for?"  

Lillian’s lips curled into a cold smile. "You know exactly why. That drug you gave me was useless. I drugged Dominic Blackwood, but when I woke up, it was Wesley Thornton in my bed!"  

Cassandra’s eyes widened. "That’s impossible! I’ve used it myself—it always works! I swear, if I’m lying, may I get hit by a car the second I step outside!"  

Lillian hesitated. Cassandra seemed sincere.  

"Then explain what went wrong."  

Cassandra swallowed her fury, forcing patience. "Think, Lillian. Did you accidentally expose it to air? That drug is potent—just opening the lid too soon can ruin it. Maybe you messed up the dosage?"  

Lillian’s memory of that night was hazy. But one thing was certain—Wesley had taken advantage of her, and Cassandra was to blame.  

Her nails dug into her palms. "I don’t remember. But this is your fault. You ruined me!"  

Cassandra suppressed a smirk. How satisfying it would be to expose Lillian’s true nature to the world.  

Instead, she feigned remorse. "Lillian, you’re my dearest friend. I’d never hurt you." She dabbed at fake tears. "It’s just a membrane. Medical science can fix that easily."  

Lillian’s eyes sharpened. "Fix it?"  

"Of course!" Cassandra lied smoothly. "I know a specialist—100% success rate. Let me make this up to you. I’ll do anything."  

Lillian’s expression softened. Then, without warning, she traced Cassandra’s cheek with a chilling smile.  

"Your face is so beautiful… I have a task for you."  

She pressed a shiny disc into Cassandra’s hand.  

"Seduce a man for me. And give this to Evelyn Sinclair at T Corporation."
###Chapter 451

Evelyn frowned at the CD in Lillian's hand. Without questioning, she snatched it.

She smirked. "I'd walk through fire for you."

Handing a woman a CD meant nothing to Evelyn.

Her priority was keeping Lillian happy to maintain their friendship.

Without Lillian's backing, she'd never gain acceptance among high society.

Lillian whispered more instructions in Evelyn's ear.

Before leaving, Lillian shot her a warning glare. "Don't screw this up."

Her voice dripped with menace. "Or I'll make sure you're blacklisted from every elite circle in town."

Evelyn swallowed hard. 

She was nobody. If Lillian turned against her, she'd lose her foothold instantly.

Evelyn plastered on a sycophantic smile. "Trust me, Lillian. That bitch stole your man? Consider her my enemy too." She crossed her heart. "Give me time. You'll love the results."

Lillian gave a curt nod, somewhat appeased.

Evelyn ventured, "So...who's the target?"

"Wesley Thornton." Lillian spat the name like poison. "Youngest son of the Thornton dynasty."

Evelyn racked her brain through society's eligible bachelors.

Recognition dawned. The Thorntons! Military aristocracy. Eldest son in politics, second in business. The youngest? Elite special forces - rarely seen in public.

She'd glimpsed Wesley once. Towering. Rugged. Those muscles left her breathless.

The thought of running her hands over his combat-honed body sent heat pooling low in her belly.

Capturing a Thornton heir would elevate her status immeasurably.

Evelyn flipped her hair. "Consider it done. But..." She bit her lip. "He's never in town. How do I even find him?"

Lillian shrugged. "I'll alert you when he returns." Her smile turned predatory. "The Thorntons are A-list royalty. I'm handing you this opportunity - don't waste it."

Evelyn practically vibrated with excitement. "If I become a Thornton, I'll owe you forever."

Lillian hid her disgust. "Enough. I have engagements. Remember - that CD goes to Evelyn Sinclair. No mistakes."

Once Lillian's silhouette disappeared, Evelyn's smile dropped. She spat on the marble floor.

"Who does that orphan bitch think she is? Lucky adoption doesn't make you blue blood."

T Corporation.

Evelyn usually thrived under pressure. Today, unease coiled in her gut.

Distracted, she submitted her architectural drafts to Bernadette.

Rubbing her temples, she sighed. Pregnancy had drained her stamina.

Olivia noticed her pallor. "You look awful. Should you be here?"

Evelyn forced a smile. "I'm fi-"

Stiletto clicks interrupted. Bernadette stormed over, slamming papers on Evelyn's desk.

"Is this your work?" The older woman's voice could freeze hell.

Evelyn scrambled to check. Her stomach dropped. A decimal point error in the load-bearing wall specs.

Bernadette's tirade continued. "One misplaced decimal could collapse buildings! Are you trying to bankrupt us?"

Cold sweat drenched Evelyn's back. That mistake could've killed people.

"I'm sorry, Madam. It won't happen again."

Bernadette's eyes glittered with malice. "Architecture tolerates no errors. Are you incompetent or just stupid?"

Since Evelyn's hiring, Bernadette had scrutinized her every move like a hawk. Today, she'd finally drawn blood.

And the viper struck without mercy.
###Chapter 452  

Bernadette screamed at Evelyn mercilessly.  

Evelyn's face burned with humiliation, but she had no choice but to endure the verbal assault. She had made a mistake, after all.  

She wanted to slap herself for such a careless error—one that could have had disastrous consequences.  

How could I be so distracted? After all this time working here, how did I let this happen?  

Clenching her fists, Evelyn forced herself to meet Bernadette's furious gaze. "I'm sorry, Bernadette. I swear this won't happen again. Please give me another chance."  

Bernadette scoffed, her voice dripping with disdain. "You think your looks and connections make you untouchable? Just because you have someone backing you doesn't mean you can slack off. My department isn't a charity for incompetents like you!"  

Olivia couldn't take it anymore.  

She shot up from her seat, eyes blazing. "Bernadette, everyone here knows Evelyn's track record. She's been nothing but dedicated since she joined. In six months, she hasn’t made a single mistake—until now. And let’s not forget how many clients her designs have brought in. You’re acting like she’s some useless intern!"  

Abigail stood as well, crossing her arms. "The higher-ups are well aware of Evelyn’s contributions. But you? You’re tearing her apart over one slip-up. Meanwhile, other new hires have messed up way worse, and you never humiliated them like this."  

Her words carried a sharp edge.  

It was true—every new designer at T Corporation made mistakes at some point. Bernadette usually reprimanded them, but never with this level of cruelty.  

If an outsider walked in, they’d think Evelyn and Bernadette were sworn enemies, not colleagues.  

Olivia and Abigail fired off their arguments like rapid gunfire.  

They knew speaking out against their boss was risky. Bernadette could dock their pay, make their lives miserable—or worse, get them fired.  

But they didn’t care.  

For one, Evelyn had Dominic’s backing. More importantly, they knew she was an asset to the team. Seeing her publicly shamed for a single error was unacceptable.  

The entire design department had stopped working to watch the drama unfold.  

Everyone knew Evelyn was involved with Mr. Blackwood.  

So why was Bernadette daring to scream at her like this? Was she trying to get fired?  

Bernadette’s face twisted in fury at being challenged. "Oh, so now you’re all ganging up on me? Defending incompetence instead of correcting it?"  

With that, she slammed a folder onto a desk and stormed toward Vivienne’s office—only to find it empty.  

Fuming, Bernadette hated Evelyn even more. And now, she despised Olivia and Abigail too.  

Once Bernadette was gone, the office slowly returned to work.  

Olivia turned to Evelyn, baffled. "Why didn’t you fight back? You just let her walk all over you!"  

Evelyn gave a tired smile. "I messed up. I deserved the criticism."  

Abigail opened her mouth to argue, but seeing Evelyn’s defeated expression, she nudged Olivia to drop it.  

They gave Evelyn space to collect herself.  

Evelyn couldn’t shake the feeling that something bad was coming.  

That unease had distracted her, leading to the mistake.  

She tried to refocus, but her mind kept wandering. For the first time, she considered going to Dominic’s office.  

Usually, he was the one who summoned her.  

Should she go?  

Finally, she decided to text him.  

She scrolled through a cute sticker pack and sent him a playful GIF with "Love and Kisses" written in bold letters.  

But even that didn’t lift her mood.  

---  

Meanwhile, in the CEO’s office...  

Vivienne stood before Dominic’s desk, delivering her report on the Western Europe projects.  

"Mr. Blackwood, the deals are finalized. Last month, my team secured a $700 million contract with the British AC Design Group. A strong start to the year."  

Dominic nodded. "Impressive. Name your reward—within reason, of course."  

He always rewarded excellence.  

Vivienne hesitated, then took a breath. "I’d like to be transferred back to headquarters. Permanently."  

She’d worked tirelessly, not just to prove herself, but to return to him.  

Her desperate gaze locked onto his, making him narrow his eyes slightly.  

Why was she so eager to come back?  

Then, a memory surfaced—the lace panties mysteriously appearing in his car months ago.  

The incident had nearly destroyed his relationship with Evelyn.  

His voice turned probing. "Ms. Laurent, the last time you were in my car... did you leave anything behind?"  

Vivienne’s pulse spiked.  

Does he know?
###Chapter 453  

Vivienne was mentally strong.  

Under Dominic's penetrating stare, she maintained a cool smile, though her chest tightened.  

She knew exactly how sharp Dominic was.  

Lying to him wasn't an option, so she confessed openly. "Yes, Mr. Blackwood. When I was in your car last time, I stopped by a convenience store to buy lingerie. But when I got home, one piece was missing. I didn’t dare ask you about it—after all, it’s intimate, and I felt awkward..."  

The usually composed and icy Vivienne displayed an uncharacteristic flush of embarrassment.  

Seeing her admit it so frankly, Dominic's suspicion faded.  

If there had been any doubt, it vanished now.  

He even found it amusing that Evelyn had made such a fuss over a random piece of women's clothing.  

His woman was perfect in every way—except for her possessive streak.  

But he adored her. He could indulge her, tolerate everything about her.  

Vivienne had worked for him for years. Dominic knew her value.  

Ms. Laurent was one of T Corporation’s top executives, generating immense wealth through sheer dedication. Yet she showed no interest in men and treated him with nothing but professional respect.  

It never crossed Dominic’s mind that his subordinate harbored deeper feelings.  

"I see. A simple oversight, then." Dominic nodded, satisfied.  

Vivienne exhaled in relief.  

"Don’t let it happen again, Ms. Laurent. I dislike personal belongings—especially women’s lingerie—cluttering my car. It leads to misunderstandings."  

Her body stiffened.  

Knowing his temperament, she understood the matter was closed. "Understood, Mr. Blackwood."  

She was clever enough to use such tricks only once. Never again.  

"Good." He returned to his work without another glance.  

Vivienne hesitated, watching him with silent longing.  

As Dominic reviewed documents, his phone buzzed—a message from Evelyn. Uncharacteristically, he set aside his work and opened it.  

A playful GIF from her made the corners of his stern lips lift.  

He replied swiftly.  

Dominic: [You can kiss and hug me all you want when I get home.]  

After a pause, he added a smirking emoji. The thought of Evelyn’s reaction softened his expression.  

Vivienne froze, stunned by the sudden warmth in his eyes.  

To her, Dominic was always ruthless, cold, decisive. She’d never seen him like this.  

She tilted her head subtly, trying to glimpse his screen—and saw a cute profile picture labeled "Darling."  

Darling?  

A bolt of shock struck her chest.  

When had Dominic grown so close to that woman? Close enough to call her Darling?  

Her vision blurred. Her heart felt crushed under a weight she couldn’t breathe through.  

She stood motionless, a statue before his desk, tears threatening to spill.  

Dominic glanced up. "Ms. Laurent? Anything else?"  

His deep voice snapped her back. Masking her pain, she forced a smile. "No, Mr. Blackwood. Excuse me."  

She turned away, unable to face his indifference—his tenderness reserved for another.  

---  

Later, Dominic worked overtime. He insisted his driver take Evelyn home, but she refused, waiting to leave together.  

Worried about his pregnant wife’s hunger, he sent her to a renowned dessert café nearby.  

The café buzzed with patrons, its air sweet with the scent of pastries.  

Evelyn sat by the window, savoring their signature stroopwafel—crisp outside, honeyed caramel within.  

Then the door chimed.  

Cassandra Prescott strode in, sunglasses perched arrogantly.  

She’d been watching Evelyn since Lillian’s secret mission.  

Today, luck favored her.  

Cassandra slid into the seat opposite Evelyn, startling her.  

"Ms. Sinclair. Evelyn Sinclair?" Cassandra removed her shades, revealing striking, sharp features.  

Evelyn frowned at the gaudily dressed stranger. "Yes. Who are you?"  

Cassandra lit a cigarette, blowing smoke carelessly. "No need for names. Just leave Dominic."  

The smoke made Evelyn nauseous. But the demand left her numb.  

Who is this woman? Why is she telling me to leave my husband?
###Chapter 454

Evelyn Sinclair fixed her gaze on Cassandra Prescott, refusing to let her composure slip. Her usually gentle eyes turned icy.

She took a deliberate sip of milk. "I don't know who you are, Miss. Whether you're Dominic's secret admirer or have some past grievance with him, let me make one thing clear. I'll never leave him unless he asks me to. Who are you to demand such a thing?"

Cassandra narrowed her eyes at the composed Evelyn, her cigarette pausing mid-air.

The young woman before her carried herself with grace and beauty. Pleasant-looking, yet her words cut sharp and precise. Not someone to underestimate. Cassandra felt like she was punching air.

Blowing a smoke ring, Cassandra grabbed a dessert from the table and shoved it into her mouth. "Not bad. This caramel pudding is divine."

The unwelcome visitor had ruined Evelyn's appetite.

She rose gracefully, looking down at Cassandra from her full height. "Enjoy the desserts. I'm leaving."

What rotten luck to encounter such a lunatic today.

The dessert café buzzed with evening diners, but Evelyn had chosen a secluded corner shielded by potted plants, away from prying eyes.

As she reached for her purse, Cassandra stretched out a leg to block her path. "Running away? Too guilty to face me? You're not worthy of Dominic. Take a good look at yourself."

Evelyn's lips curled into a cold smile. "Maybe I'm not, but Dominic loves me anyway. Since you can't have him either, doesn't that make you worse than me?"

Cassandra's smirk froze.

She hadn't expected such defiance. The mask slipped. "Don't be shameless, Evelyn. Leave Dominic voluntarily if you're smart. Otherwise, I'll take this to the Public Integrity Committee!"

She twirled a CD between her fingers.

Evelyn's stomach dropped at the sight of it. She lunged, but Cassandra dodged with a smirk.

Holding the disc between two fingers, Cassandra blew smoke in Evelyn's face. "This contains dirt on Dominic. Guaranteed to interest you... I've made copies. You have until May 1st to leave him. If I submit this, you know the consequences."

With that, she tossed the CD onto the table and strutted away.

Evelyn pocketed the disc, her hands trembling. The desserts turned to ash in her mouth.

Who was this woman? Why target her? An obsessed fan? Someone's pawn? What secrets did the CD hold that made Cassandra so confident?

The questions swirled until her head throbbed.

Then Dominic appeared.

Impeccable in his tailored suit, he moved with effortless grace. The crisp white shirt and navy tie accentuated his aristocratic bearing, drawing every eye in the café.

Normally reserved, Evelyn threw herself into his arms. "Dominic..." Her voice cracked.

He enveloped her, pressing his jaw into her hair before kissing her forehead. "What's wrong? Bad dessert? Rude service? We won't come back."

Seeing her distress, his expression darkened. He raised a hand to summon a waiter.

Evelyn shook her head, nestling closer. "It's fine. The food and service were perfect."

His frown deepened. "But you're upset."

He noticed everything about her. Every flicker of emotion mattered.

She considered telling him about Cassandra, but decided to review the CD first. He had enough work stress without her adding to it.

Countless women pursued him. If he had to personally handle each one, when would he rest? She needed to outmaneuver these rivals herself!

As long as Dominic loved her, she wouldn't surrender to some stranger's threats.

The thought made her chuckle darkly, then suddenly energized.

Turning to him sheepishly, she asked, "Maybe it's pregnancy hormones making me emotional. If I become too dramatic, will you lose patience?"

She held her breath for his answer.

His handsome face turned solemn. "You're my everything. I could never tire of you."

Sweet warmth flooded her.

Cassandra's shadow lifted.

Dominic's mere presence intoxicated her. Even silent, his gaze spoke volumes.

And he'd called her his everything.

She giggled like a schoolgirl.

Her smile lit up her face, long lashes fluttering. The delicate dimples that appeared made her even more captivating, holding Dominic's gaze completely.
###Chapter 455

Dominic's intense gaze made Evelyn self-conscious. "What?" She touched her cheek playfully. "Do I have something on my face?"

His dark eyes softened with affection. "Nothing but perfection. You outshine any flower."

A blush crept up Evelyn's neck.

He chuckled and brushed his lips against hers in a fleeting kiss.

Evelyn's eyes darted around the crowded patisserie, noticing several families with children. The heat in her cheeks intensified. "Not here," she whispered.

Dominic gave her nose an affectionate pinch - his signature gesture. "Let's go home," he said, steering her toward the exit.

The city lights painted the night in vibrant hues as they drove toward Blackwood Manor. Tonight was the fifteenth - family dinner night. Dominic planned to announce their wedding date.

Evelyn remained oblivious, her stomach knotting as they approached the imposing estate. She always dreaded these gatherings, though Reginald had grown warmer toward her lately. Beatrice and Margaret still treated her with icy disdain, but Evelyn had learned to tune them out.

She focused on feeding Alexander and Isabella, her movements precise and gentle.

Reginald observed her discreetly, satisfaction growing. 'Excellent. Evelyn possesses both grace and kindness. Though her lineage isn't distinguished, her character and beauty more than compensate. She'll make a fine Blackwood bride.'

Midway through dinner, Dominic set down his silverware with deliberate calm. After wiping his hands, he made his declaration: "Evelyn and I will marry on May first."

The twins squealed with delight while the other adults froze.

Reginald studied his grandson before rumbling, "I won't interfere. So long as you're certain."

Beatrice dropped her fork with a clatter. "Absolutely not!" She turned her venomous glare on Evelyn. "Dating is one thing, but marriage? Never!"

She'd tolerated this arrangement only because of the pregnancy. Once the baby arrived, she'd planned to discard Evelyn and secure a proper society match for Dominic.

Margaret's lips curled as she eyed Evelyn's stomach, barely concealing her schadenfreude.

Julian raised his glass. "Congratulations, brother. I'd be honored to stand as your best man."

Beatrice shot him a murderous look he cheerfully ignored.

"Dominic," Beatrice pleaded, "May is too soon! Your wedding must be flawless - our reputation depends on it. Wait until after the birth at least."

Dominic took Evelyn's hand, his voice steel wrapped in velvet: "This isn't a request. Our wedding is May first, with or without your blessing. You're welcome to attend - or not. I'll be announcing it publicly either way."

The dining room fell silent under the weight of his declaration.

Alexander and Isabella beamed at their father with newfound awe.

Reginald exhaled heavily. Unlike his weak-willed father, Dominic had always been decisive. There would be no changing his mind.

As Reginald began discussing wedding details with Dominic and Julian, Beatrice stormed upstairs, too furious to even look at Evelyn.

"Evelyn," Reginald asked, "when might your grandfather and aunt be available? We should arrange a formal dinner to deliver the invitations..."

Evelyn sat stunned, barely registering the question. This couldn't be real. After all the obstacles, was marriage actually happening?

Dominic squeezed her hand, jolting her back to reality. "Hmm? Sorry, Grandfather?"

Reginald, too pleased by the upcoming nuptials to notice her distraction, repeated: "Choose a date this month for our families to dine together. Then we'll deliver the invitations for your May first wedding. When are your grandfather and aunt free?"
###Chapter 456  

Evelyn felt her cheeks burn under the intense gazes of Reginald Blackwood, Dominic, and Julian.  

She quickly apologized to the elderly man. "Forgive me, Mr. Blackwood. My mind wandered for a moment. I'll visit my grandfather and aunt this weekend to discuss the engagement. Once we settle on a date, I'll inform you immediately."  

Reginald cleared his throat loudly. "Good. I'll arrange dinner with the family and consult the almanac for the most auspicious date. There are still formalities to complete."  

The old man was meticulous about choosing the perfect day. Dominic understood—his grandfather had always been superstitious about such matters.  

With Reginald's blessing on their marriage, Dominic couldn't hide his satisfaction. "Whatever you decide, Grandfather. Evelyn and I will proceed with the engagement preparations. She's already two months along—we can wait, but your great-grandchild certainly can't."  

Reginald raised his cane and lightly tapped his favorite grandson. "Brat. If you knew they couldn't wait, you should've married her first before getting her pregnant. Take better care of Evelyn. She looks thinner—has she been eating properly?"  

Evelyn flushed. In truth, she had gained nearly fifteen pounds since her pregnancy.  

Her sweet tooth and frequent snacks had padded her frame, though her naturally slender build made it less noticeable.  

A small worry nagged at her—would she balloon into a penguin by her third trimester if she didn't control her cravings?  

Defending Dominic, she said softly, "Grandpa, Dominic spoils me rotten. I eat more than enough to nourish the baby. Overeating during pregnancy can actually cause complications."  

Reginald's eyes widened. "Really? My old friends force their daughters-in-law to drink tonics daily, insisting it makes the baby smarter and healthier. Back when your grandmother was pregnant, I was just starting my business. We were poor, but I still scraped together money to buy her supplements. And sure enough, she gave me a chubby son."  

A wistful expression crossed Reginald's stern features at the memory of his late wife.  

But the thought of his wayward son, Edmund—who had died young after squandering his brilliance on scandals—made him sigh. "At least that fool left me an exceptional grandson like you, Dominic... Ah, why dredge up the past? Dominic, cherish Evelyn while she's carrying your child. Don't let her suffer."  

Dominic's dark eyes locked onto Evelyn with silent intensity.  

He squeezed her hand. "Grandfather, Evelyn is my everything. I could never love her enough, let alone neglect her. Rest assured, I'll take care of her and our children."  

His warm gaze drifted over Evelyn's delicate features before landing on the twins, who were listening with rapt attention, cheeks propped in their hands.  

Every year of waiting had been worth this moment.  

Julian, ever the mischief-maker, smirked at his brother's lovestruck expression. "Tsk. Grandpa, look at him—already whipped before the wedding. What'll he be like after?"  

Reginald's cane came down hard on Julian's foot. "Your brother's having his second child, and you're still single. Aren't you ashamed?"  

"Ow! Grandpa, I'm barely twenty-five! Must you humiliate me every time?" Julian yelped, hopping away like a startled rabbit.  

Damn. The old man hits harder than ever.  

"Mommy, are you really marrying Daddy?" Isabella tugged Evelyn's sleeve, eyes wide with disbelief.  

Evelyn wiped a smudge from her daughter's lips. "Yes, sweetheart. Would you and Alexander like to be our flower girl and ring bearer?"  

"YES!" Isabella burrowed into Evelyn's arms like an excited kitten, shooting her brother a triumphant look. "Alex! We get to be in the wedding!"  

Alexander nestled close without a word, but his toothy grin said everything.  

Mommy marrying Daddy? Best. News. Ever.  

With Reginald's approval secured, Evelyn floated through the week in high spirits.  

By Saturday, she and Dominic took the twins to visit her grandfather, Reginald Sinclair.  

Having called ahead, they found Gwendolyn already waiting.  

"Great-Grandpa! Aunt Gwendolyn!" The children rushed in—Isabella launching herself at the old man while Alexander shyly kissed his aunt's cheek.  

Reginald Sinclair beamed, squeezing his great-grandchildren. "I've missed you both terribly!"  

Clutching Evelyn's hand, he ordered, "Gwendolyn, prepare their favorites—Evelyn loves fried chicken and grilled salmon. Dominic, what do you prefer? Tell us so we can—"  

Dominic, towering elegantly in the room, interrupted gently. "Grandfather, Aunt Gwendolyn, don't trouble yourselves. We're here to discuss our wedding. We've set the date for May 1st."
###Chapter 457

"May 1st? That soon?" Reginald Sinclair and Gwendolyn exclaimed simultaneously.

Though he'd always known Evelyn would marry someday, the old man's heart still clenched painfully. His beloved granddaughter, the little girl who'd once depended on him for everything, was about to start her own family.

The thought made his wrinkled hands tremble as he wiped unexpected tears from his eyes. "Evelyn, I've waited for this day...but now that it's here, I can't bear to let you go."

Seeing her grandfather's tears shattered Evelyn's composure. Her throat tightened, but years of emotional control kept her own tears at bay.

She gently dabbed his face with a tissue. "Grandfather, marriage won't change anything. We'll still be in the same city. I'll visit whenever I can."

Gwendolyn bounced Alexander on her hip while offering comfort. "Father, Evelyn's at the perfect age for marriage. And Dominic is an exceptional match - we should be celebrating!"

With a heavy sigh, Reginald placed Evelyn's hand in Dominic's. "Young man, my granddaughter has a tender heart beneath her strong exterior. Treasure that. And Evelyn," he turned to her, "Dominic's position demands certain social obligations. You must learn patience."

Dominic guided the elderly man back to the sofa. His voice rang with conviction. "I swear on my life to protect and cherish Evelyn. As proof, I'll transfer all my personal assets to her name after our wedding. Should I ever fail her, I'll walk away with nothing."

Gwendolyn's jaw dropped. The Blackwood fortune was staggering - this would make Evelyn one of A City's wealthiest women overnight. Studying Dominic's earnest expression, she saw only genuine devotion. Her niece had found true love, unlike her own tragic past...

Reginald chuckled through his tears. "Nonsense! Evelyn's no gold-digger. She's lucky to have you. If this girl gives you trouble, you come straight to me."

Evelyn shot her grandfather an indignant look. "Already taking his side before we're even married?"

Dominic's warm fingers closed around hers, radiating heat through her skin.

Meanwhile, at the film studio...

Lillian Prescott adjusted the elaborate hairstyle of her period costume. The historical drama "Court of Petals," adapted from a bestselling novel, depicted the star-crossed romance between a wartime general and a female diplomat.

Today's scene involved the lovers' separation and dramatic reunion after the diplomat's near-fatal punishment. Lillian watched disinterestedly as her stunt double endured the whipping scene.

Her two attendants hovered nearby - one shading her with an umbrella, the other peeling grapes. The double performed adequately, so they moved to the intimate reunion scene where the general carries his wounded love to safety.

Lillian's co-star, a rising talent in the industry, delivered his lines with passion. But compared to Dominic Blackwood, he might as well have been a street beggar. Her wooden performance made the director grind his teeth.

Originally, they'd cast an acclaimed young actress, but "unforeseen circumstances" had installed Lillian instead. The disastrous shoot dragged on for hours before the director reluctantly called it a wrap.

Back in her trailer, Lillian changed with her agent's assistance. A satisfied smile played on her lips - Cassandra had confirmed Evelyn received the damning package. Soon Dominic would be free, and with her parents' influence combined with her charms, she'd have him exactly where she wanted.
###Chapter 458

Lillian's arrogance was misplaced.

She had spent years preparing to enter the Blackwood family. Genevieve had taught her high-society etiquette, piano, floral arrangement, and basic culinary skills.

She even studied investment strategies and business management with her mother.

With such refined talents, she was certain to become Dominic's wife...

Lillian's agent followed her, suggesting, "There's a dinner with the production team tonight. Attending could strengthen your connections with the director and producer. More roles would follow."

Lillian dismissed the idea instantly. "I'm too busy for social gatherings. Maybe another time."

No amount of persuasion could change her mind. Her agent sighed at her stubbornness.

As they passed another trailer, female voices drifted out. Lillian paused when she heard her name.

"Honestly Theresa, you resemble Lillian Prescott so much," one actress remarked. "Yet she's the lead while you're just an unnamed double. Life's unfair."

Theresa scoffed. "Only because of her father! Without his influence, would she even be here? Did you see her performance today? Like watching paint dry. Film school graduate my foot - I could act circles around her..."

Another voice agreed. "Rich privilege. Normal folks like us don't stand a chance."

Theresa added viciously, "Wealth can't buy talent. I saw her changing once - flat as a board, barely 34A!"

Peals of laughter erupted before Lillian kicked the door open, shocking the occupants.

Theresa froze mid-gesture, legs crossed on the makeup table. "M-Ms. Prescott?" she stammered.

Lillian's icy gaze swept over them. To her agent: "Apparently I'm overpaying Theresa Whitmore. Settle her account and remove her immediately."

The audacity!

Lillian's pleasant facade shattered under her fury.

Theresa panicked. "I didn't mean it! Please give me another chance—"

Lillian looked at her like garbage. "Dare to bite the hand that feeds you? I've no time for trash. Remove her now." 

"Understood," her agent nodded.

Lillian memorized the other actresses' faces - their reckoning would come later.

As she stormed out, her agent coldly informed Theresa: "Pack your things. You're fired."

Theresa's hate-filled eyes followed Lillian's retreating figure.

Meanwhile, the Blackwood and Sinclair families finalized Dominic and Evelyn's wedding plans.

The engagement was set for the 18th.

Dominic sent invitations to political and business elites, including Jonathan and Genevieve Prescott.

Returning home, Lillian found her mother holding a crimson invitation.

"Who's getting married?" she asked, embracing Genevieve.

"The Blackwoods. Dominic and Evelyn's engagement is on the 18th. We're invited."

Lillian's hands trembled as she read the names. An atomic explosion detonated in her mind.

Impossible.

Cassandra swore she'd given Evelyn that damning recording.

If Evelyn loved Dominic, she should have left.

Why was the engagement proceeding?

Feigning illness, Lillian locked herself in her room and dialed Cassandra...

Meanwhile, Evelyn basked in joyful anticipation.

Her engagement was two days away - a moment she'd dreamed of.

Dominic worked late nightly to clear his schedule. Worried he'd lose weight, Evelyn prepared nourishing tonics.

Tonight found her cooking as the twins played barefoot nearby.

Watching them, Evelyn touched her stomach, imagining Dominic's loving smile.

This was her perfect life: loving husband, happy children, a warm home.

Her phone rang. Expecting Dominic, she answered to hear a shrill voice:

"Evelyn Sinclair! Did you watch that recording? I warned you to leave Dominic! Yet you're still marrying him? Don't you care what happens to him? You have two days to disappear - or I'll destroy him!"
###Chapter 459

The call ended abruptly after delivering its cruel message, leaving Evelyn no chance to respond.

At first, she dismissed it as a prank. But as she turned toward the kitchen, a memory surfaced - that mysterious woman in the dessert café days ago.

The stranger had pressed a CD into her hands, claiming it contained damning evidence against Dominic. Her threat had been clear: leave him or face the consequences.

Evelyn had completely forgotten about the incident until now. Pregnancy brain, they called it.

Now the woman's warning echoed in her mind. What could possibly be on that disc to shake her so deeply?

She adjusted the stove to low heat, letting the herbal tonic simmer. Digging through her purse, she found the forgotten CD.

Her hands trembled as she inserted it into the player.

The screen flickered to life. Evelyn's gentle expression froze. A bone-chilling cold swept through her body as if she'd plunged into arctic waters.

Midnight found Evelyn standing by the window in silk pajamas, moonlight painting silver streaks across her troubled face. The children slept soundly while she wrestled with her thoughts.

Dominic entered quietly, his sharp eyes immediately finding her silhouette. Moonlight draped over her slender frame like liquid gold, her solitude tugging at his heart.

Shrugging off his coat, he approached silently and wrapped his arms around her from behind. His stubbled jaw brushed her shoulder. "My love, you'll catch cold standing here. Why aren't you in bed?"

Evelyn buried her face against his chest. Her arms locked around his waist with desperate strength, as if he might vanish. "Our engagement ceremony is in two days, Dominic. What if... what if it never happens?"

Dominic's muscular arms encircled her delicate frame, pulling her flush against him. "Who could possibly stop us now? Everything's arranged. Just focus on being my beautiful bride. Leave the rest to me."

Moonlight danced across Evelyn's tear-streaked face as Dominic studied her sudden melancholy. His sharp gaze narrowed. "Are you having second thoughts? Do you want to call it off?"

She shook her head violently.

Tears welled as she brought his fingers to her lips, pressing featherlight kisses along them. "No one wants this more than I do. You're everything to me, Dominic. My greatest blessing. To be your wife, bear your children, share your life - that's all I've ever dreamed of. I want to grow old with you, never parted..."

Her dark tresses cascaded forward as she bowed her head. Trembling lashes cast shadows on her cheeks, her vulnerable beauty igniting Dominic's primal hunger.

It had been too long since he'd tasted her.

In one smooth motion, he lifted her carefully and carried her to bed, mindful of her pregnancy. Evelyn gasped as he caged her beneath him without putting pressure on her stomach.

"You're playing with fire, darling," he murmured, voice thick with desire. "Don't you know how dangerous this is for me?"

Evelyn stiffened at the smoldering intensity in his eyes. She wedged her arms between them protectively. "It's... it's not safe yet... we can't..."

Her whisper was barely audible - shy, fearful, and heartbreakingly sweet like a drenched kitten seeking shelter.

Dominic nuzzled her ear, his warm breath sending shivers down her spine. "I know your condition, my love. No matter how much I want you, I'd never risk harming you or our baby. You know that."

Tears clung to Evelyn's lashes as she clung to him. "You're too good to me. I don't... I don't deserve..."

Her broken whisper might have been meant for him, or perhaps just for herself.

Dominic attributed her mood swings to pregnancy hormones. Lately, she'd become increasingly emotional - nothing unusual, the doctor had said.

His tongue traced the seam of her lips until she yielded, allowing him to plunder her sweetness. His embrace radiated warmth and safety, his sun-kissed scent enveloping her completely.

Between kisses, his velvet voice whispered promises against her skin: "If you can't let me go, then stay with me forever. You're my everything, Evelyn. My salvation. I want you by my side for all our days..."

She drowned in his affection, clinging like a shipwreck survivor to driftwood. Without Dominic, she had nothing. Only in his arms did she find true security.

He claimed to love her, but her love ran deeper still.

Yet Evelyn knew their happiness was borrowed time.

Any moment now, it could all come crashing down.

She pushed the thought away, determined to savor every second they had left together.

Morning brought them to A City's most exclusive bridal boutique. Dominic's assistant had arranged everything in advance.

The entire staff stood at attention when the Lamborghini pulled up. "Mr. Blackwood has arrived!"

The manager barely finished speaking when Dominic emerged, then carefully helped his beautiful companion from the passenger seat.
###Chapter 460

Dominic Blackwood exuded effortless elegance. The moment he emerged from the luxury vehicle, every female employee in the bridal boutique clutched their chests, hearts practically leaping from their eyes.

"Oh my God! Mr. Blackwood is divine! He makes every Hollywood actor look plain in comparison..."

"That financial magazine cover doesn't do him justice! I might actually faint..." "What I wouldn't give to be that woman marrying him..."

The whispering staff lined up like starstruck schoolgirls, their gazes locked onto Dominic's chiseled features with undisguised admiration.

The object of their affection stood ramrod straight, his military-trained posture impeccable as he guided Evelyn Sinclair through the boutique entrance with protective precision.

"Mr. Blackwood, Ms. Sinclair."

The boutique manager greeted them with practiced professionalism. "We've just received exclusive wedding gowns handcrafted by Milan's finest designers. Whether you prefer classic elegance, modern minimalism, or daring avant-garde, we can accommodate every preference. What style speaks to you, Ms. Sinclair?"

Cradled against Dominic's side, Evelyn responded with hollow detachment. "Whatever's fine."

The manager's eyebrows lifted slightly.

The bride-to-be couldn't be older than twenty-two, her natural beauty requiring no makeup enhancement. Even through professional detachment, the manager noted her flawless complexion and enviable curves.

Yet something felt...off. Most brides glowed with anticipation, especially those marrying Dominic Blackwood - a man whose engagement announcement had shattered countless socialite hearts across the city.

Why did this girl seem so...resigned?

Pushing aside his curiosity, the manager gestured toward a mannequin. "This is our signature piece, Ms. Sinclair. A perfect fusion of timeless tradition and contemporary design. Would you like to try it?"

Evelyn's clear eyes sought Dominic's.

He dipped his head, pressing a tender kiss to her lips. "Go ahead. I want to see my bride in white." A quiet "Mm" was her only reply before she followed attendants to the fitting room.

Dominic settled onto a plush sofa, idly flipping through a business magazine while sipping espresso. His relaxed posture belied the intensity in his gaze whenever it flickered toward the dressing room.

Inside, attendants gasped at Evelyn's transformation, though she remained oblivious to their reactions.

A storm of emotions raged within her - love, longing, despair. Each breath felt like swallowing glass.

"You're absolutely breathtaking, Ms. Sinclair," gushed a bun-wearing attendant adjusting the side zipper. "The cut complements your figure perfectly. A duchess tried this same gown last week and looked like a sack of potatoes by comparison!"

Evelyn's vision blurred with unshed tears. The cruel irony wasn't lost on her - she could wear the dress, but never truly be Dominic's bride.

"Ms. Sinclair? Are you unwell?" A shorter attendant frowned at Evelyn's pallor. "We have a private lounge if you need to rest."

Evelyn shook her head mutely.

The poisonous secret festering in her heart was aimed directly at Dominic - a dagger poised to strike the moment she let her guard down. She'd buried it deep, protecting him even from herself.

But she was powerless against the woman's threats. The impending separation felt like having her soul ripped in two.

"Wedding jitters are normal," the bun-wearing attendant soothed. "Every bride worries about losing freedom. But when you love someone as extraordinary as Mr. Blackwood..."

"Yes," Evelyn forced out. "I used all my lifetime's luck meeting him. Now...there's none left." Her whisper faded into nothingness, lips moving soundlessly.

The attendants exchanged confused glances. Most women would be delirious to marry Dominic Blackwood. Why did his fiancée seem like she was attending a funeral?

The fitting room curtains parted.

Gasps echoed through the boutique as Evelyn emerged - a vision in white silk with delicate lace accents. The off-shoulder design showcased her porcelain skin and elegant collarbones. Minimal makeup enhanced her natural beauty.

She stood motionless, a living masterpiece.

Dominic's magazine slipped from his fingers.

His chest tightened at the sight of his would-be bride. Then he noticed every male employee's hungry stares.

Possessive fury surged through him. He wanted to wrap Evelyn in shadows where no one could glimpse her perfection.

And so he did.

In three strides, Dominic draped his jacket over Evelyn's bare shoulders, pulling her flush against him. When his lips brushed her tear-stained cheek, he tasted salt and sorrow.
###Chapter 461

Dominic gently wiped away Evelyn's tears in full view of everyone. "What's this? My future Mrs. Blackwood crying before her wedding?" His teasing tone carried warmth.

Though joking, his heart ached seeing her pale complexion. Those red-rimmed eyes gripped something deep in his chest.

Evelyn clutched his sleeve, struggling to contain her emotions. She shook her head. "I'm just... overwhelmed. Sometimes I still can't believe this is real."

His hand came to rest on her head, fingers threading through her hair like she was the rarest treasure. "Still dreaming, sweetheart? We're literally picking your wedding dress."

The boutique staff stood frozen. This tender man contradicted every rumor about Dominic Blackwood - the ruthless CEO nicknamed "The Ice King" by business rivals.

Could this be the same man whose mere presence made board members sweat?

Dominic ignored their stares, pulling Evelyn closer until the world narrowed to just them. Only when she noticed the envious glances did she attempt to create distance.

"Your reputation," she murmured.

He only smiled wider, pressing a kiss to her cheek. "You're breathtaking in that dress. If I could marry you this instant, I would. Claim you before anyone else gets ideas."

His words seeped into her bones like an intoxicating poison. No antidote existed for this kind of love.

Eyes misting, Evelyn turned away to hide her vulnerability. "I'd say yes if you asked right now."

The manager beamed. "Such devotion! May your love shine forever."

"Thank you." Dominic's response startled everyone - gratitude wasn't his usual currency.

The manager practically glowed. "We have more designs perfect for Mrs. Blackwood. Would you like to see?"

Evelyn opened her mouth to decline, but Dominic answered first. "Let her try everything."

Seven outfits and three hours later, they settled on four wedding dresses, four evening gowns, and six pairs of shoes. The price tag made Evelyn dizzy, but Dominic swiped his black card without blinking.

Back at Blackwood Tower, Dominic buried himself in contract negotiations for a ten-billion-dollar deal. The stakes demanded his full attention - one misstep could cost everything.

He didn't notice Vivienne's arrival until she spoke. "Is it true? The engagement's tomorrow?"

Signing a document, he glanced up. "You received the invitation. Carlton Hotel at seven. I expect you'll be there."

Her laugh held bitterness. "How special I must be - learning about your engagement with the rest of the staff. What exactly am I to you, Dominic?"

His brow furrowed at her uncharacteristic behavior. "My apologies for the late notice. Between us, you've always been my most valuable executive. These past years, no one's matched your competence."

Most valuable executive. That was all?

Vivienne's heart shattered. After everything, she remained just another employee in his eyes. The cruelest fate imaginable.
###Chapter 462  

Vivienne couldn't stand watching the man she'd loved for a decade become someone else's husband.  

Her fists clenched so tightly they trembled. "Are you certain you want to marry an ordinary employee, Mr. Blackwood? You deserve someone better. Ms. Sinclair lacks experience, no matter how you look at it..."  

Dominic's gaze turned icy. "Oh? What kind of woman do you think I should deserve?"  

Normally perceptive, Vivienne missed his displeasure entirely, too consumed by emotion.  

She pressed on. "Mr. Blackwood, you need a woman who excels professionally yet remains gentle in private. A capable wife could share your burdens. You wouldn’t have to exhaust yourself like this."  

Dominic set his pen down, his piercing eyes locking onto hers. "You're mistaken, Ms. Laurent. I want a wife who is my soulmate, not my business partner. Evelyn makes me feel at ease—something no one else can. She’s like the rib God took from me. Now that she’s back, my life is complete."  

His voice softened, but his words cut deep. "You’ve never known true love, Ms. Laurent. That’s why you set conditions for a partner. When you find it, you’ll realize none of those conditions matter."  

I already found him ten years ago! Vivienne wanted to scream.  

But pride held her back.  

Defeated, she murmured, "Forgive the interruption, Mr. Blackwood. I’ll return to work."  

Dominic barely acknowledged her, already refocused on his documents.  

Vivienne left his office, her mood black.  

Back in her own space, she nearly shattered everything on her desk in fury.  

Bernadette entered with coffee, well aware of Vivienne’s rage over Dominic’s engagement.  

"Drink this. Calm down, Ms. Laurent."  

Vivienne knocked the cup aside, her glare venomous. "Do I look like I want coffee?"  

The scalding liquid burned Bernadette’s hand, but she bit back a cry. "Panicking won’t help. Honestly, I despise Evelyn Sinclair even more than you. That woman’s a seductress—flirting with the CEO and the general manager. How does Mr. Blackwood not see it?"  

Vivienne’s frown deepened. "What? Evelyn’s involved with the general manager too?"  

Bernadette spun her tale eagerly. "The entire design department’s seen it. During lunch, General Manager Blackwood sat so close to her, whispering things that nearly led to a kiss. She’s greedy—already has the CEO but still chases his brother-in-law!"  

Her jealousy over Julian Blackwood’s attention toward Evelyn fueled her lies.  

Vivienne’s hatred flared. "How could Mr. Blackwood love someone like that? Tell me, Ms. Worthing—do men really think with their dcks? What does she have that I don’t?"  

Bernadette smirked. "Some men prefer women who seem pure but are wild in bed. That’s the only way she’s fooled Mr. Blackwood. Don’t worry—women like her always get dumped."  

But Vivienne refused to believe Dominic could be so shallow. "No. He’s not that type. She must have manipulated him somehow."  

Seeing her fury, Bernadette shivered but pressed on. "An engagement isn’t a marriage. For someone as brilliant as you, tearing them apart should be easy."  

Vivienne suddenly laughed, her composure returning. "You’re right. Bring me another coffee."  

Once alone, her smile turned chilling.  

Bernadette’s correct. They’re only engaged.  

As long as they don’t marry, I’ll find a way to destroy them.  

---  

At the Mansion  

The engagement ceremony was tomorrow, but Evelyn’s nerves were frayed.  

The CD’s threats echoed in her mind, wearing her down.  

Her children played word games on the couch until Isabella noticed her mother’s distress.  

She climbed into Evelyn’s lap, tiny fingers smoothing her furrowed brow. "What’s wrong, Mommy? You’re marrying Daddy tomorrow. Why are you sad?"  

Evelyn hugged her tightly, inhaling her sweet scent. "Mommy’s just..."  

A shrill ring cut her off.  

The caller ID flashed Unknown.  

Evelyn’s face paled.
###Chapter 463

The phone wouldn't stop ringing. Evelyn wanted to hurl it against the wall.

But she couldn't. That woman held Dominic's darkest secret.

With trembling fingers, Evelyn finally answered.

A shrill voice screamed through the receiver. "Ignoring me, Evelyn Sinclair? Fine! I'm standing outside the Ethics Commission right now. One step inside and Dominic Blackwood's career is over!"

A text followed immediately - a selfie.

The sunglasses-wearing woman smirked, holding up a CD in front of the government building's sign.

Evelyn's pulse raced while her blood turned to ice.

That CD would destroy Dominic beyond redemption.

No power or influence could save him then.

Her grip tightened on the phone. "Stop! Please... I'll do anything. No engagement tomorrow. I'll leave the city tonight. Just don't submit that CD!" Her voice broke with desperate sobs.

A cold laugh answered. "Too late for easy solutions. Had you left when I first warned you... Now? You'll proceed with the engagement. And when he proposes, you'll reject him publicly. Humiliate him completely."

Evelyn froze.

This went beyond leaving. They wanted her to crush Dominic's pride before everyone.

She bit her lip until copper filled her mouth. "I'll disappear tonight. But I can't... I won't humiliate him like that!"

Dominic's pride was everything. Public rejection would destroy more than their relationship - it would shatter him.

The woman's mocking laughter grated. "Sentimental fool! You're in no position to bargain. Either obey or watch his downfall. Imagine the headlines: 'Blackwood Empire heir exposed as criminal'!"

Another video arrived - the woman's hand on the Commission's door handle.

Panic seized Evelyn. "I'll do it! I'll reject him tomorrow! Just don't go inside!" she screamed.

"No tricks. I'll be watching. Cross me and he's finished." The line went dead.

Evelyn didn't realize she'd dropped her phone.

Outside, fluffy clouds blurred through her tears.

She remembered the hope in Dominic's eyes yesterday at the bridal fitting. Despair swallowed her whole.

Dominic returned home early to prepare for tomorrow.

The mansion smelled of simmering soup. Alexander and Isabella played on their tablets in the living room.

Hanging his coat, Dominic scanned for Evelyn. "Where's your mother?"

Isabella didn't look up. "Mommy's resting. Said not to disturb her."

Frowning, Dominic set the dinner table himself - something he rarely did.

After feeding the children, he carried a tray upstairs - pork ribs with mushroom soup, Evelyn's favorite.

She lay curled up, tear tracks glistening. Her eyelids fluttered like trapped butterflies.

Setting the tray aside, Dominic traced her cheek. Soft. Warm. Like rose petals after rain.

Just watching her eased his work fatigue.

But why had she been so distant lately?

He stayed, content to watch her sleep. She looked so fragile beneath the blanket - like the kitten he'd adored as a boy.

Evelyn dreamed of their wedding.

Dominic knelt, radiant as a god, ring in hand. As she opened her mouth to say "yes," a bloody specter lunged, skeletal fingers piercing her chest—

She woke screaming, drenched in sweat.

Dominic's concerned face filled her vision. "Bad dream?" He pulled her close, wiping her damp forehead. "The children said you're unwell. I brought dinner. Some soup?"

She shook her head, clinging to him.

After a long silence, Evelyn whispered the question tearing her apart: "Dominic... what if... what if we postponed tomorrow's engagement?"
###Chapter 464

Dominic froze.  

The man who had faced countless battles suddenly felt his heart submerged in scalding oil.  

He didn't answer Evelyn's question.  

Instead, he crushed her lips in a possessive kiss, stealing both her breath and any chance of further conversation.  

No one could fathom how long he'd waited for this moment.  

Since childhood, he'd known Evelyn Sinclair would be his wife.  

After overcoming every obstacle, she was finally in his arms. He burned to declare to the world that this woman belonged to him.  

Yet she hesitated to become his bride.  

That was unacceptable.  

Evelyn gasped for air when he finally released her.  

Dominic pulled her close, his piercing gaze locking onto hers. "If you want to postpone the wedding, I'll consider rescheduling. But if you ever think of canceling..." His voice turned dangerous. "I'll drag you to that altar bound in ropes if necessary."  

Tears pooled in Evelyn's eyes, making her delicate frame appear even more fragile.  

Dominic tilted her chin up. "What's wrong lately? We're partners. Soon to be husband and wife. Share your burdens with me."  

He knew her tendency to suffer silently.  

Evelyn blinked rapidly, swallowing back tears.  

"Dominic..." Her whisper trembled as she studied his striking features.  

Her erratic moods puzzled him.  

A single blink sent tears cascading down her cheeks.  

"Don't cry." Panic edged his voice.  

Nothing terrified him more than Evelyn's tears.  

When her silent weeping continued, he gathered her against his chest, kissing away each salty drop. But her quiet sobs only intensified.  

Dominic rocked her gently, as one would comfort a child. Gradually, her trembling subsided.  

The bedroom held only the sounds of his steady breathing and her occasional sniffles.  

He'd initially blamed pregnancy hormones for her mood swings. Now he sensed something darker at play.  

After tomorrow's engagement ceremony, he'd launch an investigation.  

Evelyn's sensitive nature meant threats wouldn't make her talk. He'd uncover the truth another way.  

The thought of humiliating Dominic tomorrow shattered Evelyn's heart.  

But if she didn't, that woman would destroy his reputation.  

She couldn't bear imagining him behind bars when his crimes came to light.  

Noting her calmer state, Dominic brushed his lips against hers. "You're about to become a bride. Tears don't suit you. Agitation harms both mother and child."  

Evelyn bit her lip and nodded. Suddenly, her fingers clutched his sleeve.  

Her glittering eyes met his with desperate intensity. "I love you, Dominic. So much. If I ever hurt you... know it's not by choice. Promise you won't hate me?"  

Dominic traced her lips thoughtfully before answering. "I promise."  

His unconditional trust broke her anew. Tomorrow she'd betray that trust.  

The cruel reality carved through her chest like a blade scraping bone.  

She had no alternative.  

The Carlton Hotel's lavish interior resembled a dreamscape.  

Graceful fountains danced to melodic tunes in the grand lobby.  

Inside the bridal suite—  

Abigail and Olivia gaped at Evelyn's wedding gown transformation.  

Waddling forward, Abigail placed a hand on her rounded belly. "You finally bagged the boss! Stunning doesn't begin to cover it!"  

Olivia beamed. "Half of A City's elite are out there—faces we only see in society pages. The Blackwood connections are insane! Dominic's pulling out all stops for you, Evie. This puts celebrity weddings to shame."  

Before the mirror, Evelyn sat motionless. Her upswept hair and form-fitting gown accentuated every curve, drawing envious glances.  

Their joyful praise should have delighted her. Instead, dread coiled tighter in her stomach.  

Dominic entered abruptly.  

"Mr. Blackwood," the women chorused.  

Impeccable in his tuxedo, he nodded curtly at them before his gaze softened on Evelyn. "It's time."  

He guided her toward the ballroom with possessive hands.  

The venue overflowed with guests. The Blackwood and Sinclair families occupied front-row seats—Reginald Sinclair wiping his eyes while Gwendolyn Sinclair radiated joy.  

Applause erupted as the couple appeared. Some guests even chanted for Dominic to kiss his bride.  

He obliged without hesitation, claiming Evelyn's mouth in a searing kiss that left the crowd cheering. His grip on her waist suggested he'd never let go.  

At a nearby table, Lillian Prescott's smile froze.  

Beside her, Cassandra Prescott clapped politely, a sinister smirk playing on her lips.
###Chapter 465

Evelyn's body went slack after the kiss. The pounding in her head intensified.

Her senses were overwhelmed - the chatter of guests, swaying floral arrangements, dancing water fountains, and melodic orchestra music.

The joyful atmosphere clashed violently with her inner turmoil.

Evelyn scanned the crowd.

Reginald Blackwood stood conversing with guests, his usual stern expression softened by smiles.

Dominic beamed with happiness.

Margaret Lockwood maintained perfect aristocratic composure despite her lack of smile.

Even Beatrice Lockwood, who'd opposed their union most vehemently, wore a strained smile as she accepted congratulations.

At another table, Reginald Sinclair and Gwendolyn Sinclair smiled through tears of joy for Evelyn.

Evelyn fought back her own tears. Then her gaze landed on a familiar face among Dominic's friends - Everett Kingsley, James Kensington, Preston Worthington Sr., and others.

Every major conglomerate heir was present.

Dominic guided Evelyn through introductions to his extensive family.

"My paternal uncle," he presented a distinguished gentleman in his sixties.

"My elder cousins." A strikingly handsome young man and elegant woman nodded.

"My younger cousin brother. My second uncle."

The sheer number of Blackwood relatives astonished Evelyn. Though only a few were direct family, all carried the distinctive Blackwood good looks.

Dominic chuckled at her overwhelmed expression. "Just remember the immediate family," he whispered. "The others you'll rarely see."

Evelyn nodded absently, then froze. Her eyes locked onto Jonathan Prescott and his wife - with their daughter Lillian standing beside them.

Lillian, impeccably dressed, stared at Evelyn with icy contempt.

The gaze held mockery, superiority, and something more disturbing - triumph.

But what made Evelyn's blood run cold was seeing that woman - the one who'd threatened her with the CD - seated beside Genevieve Prescott.

Alarm bells screamed in Evelyn's mind. How had that woman infiltrated the event? What connection did she have to the Prescott family?

The entire hall's attention focused on Evelyn - curiosity, judgment, awe, envy, and jealousy all directed at the unremarkable woman engaged to Dominic Blackwood.

Four ornate chests dominated the stage - Dominic's engagement gifts to Evelyn. Bundles of hundred-dollar bills tied with satin ribbons.

Gold bars. Diamond rings. Deeds to mansions. Jewelry collections. Luxury watches. A breathtaking display of wealth.

The guests murmured in awe. Only the Blackwoods could afford such extravagance! This clearly demonstrated the bride's importance to Dominic.

Yet Evelyn felt no joy. Her palms grew clammy as she spotted that sinister woman in the crowd.

Her grip on Dominic's arm tightened. Chills raced through her body. She forced herself to keep smiling as they walked to center stage.

The short distance felt endless.

The emcee announced the ceremony's commencement.

Dominic's usually stern features softened with warmth as he gazed at Evelyn.

Embracing her, he addressed the crowd: "Thank you all for sharing this moment. I stand here happier than I ever imagined possible - about to pledge myself to the woman I love. I believed I'd remain unmarried forever, yet fate brought Evelyn into my life. Her kindness and warmth have transformed my world. I vow to cherish, protect, and adore her always. My deepest gratitude to her grandfather and aunt for raising such an extraordinary woman."

Thunderous applause followed.

Reginald Sinclair and Gwendolyn Sinclair wept joyful tears at Dominic's heartfelt words.

Evelyn nearly succumbed to tears herself. The typically reserved Dominic had never spoken so publicly or emotionally. His sincerity overwhelmed her.

Kneeling before her, Dominic presented a ring with a dazzling diamond. "Evelyn Sinclair, will you marry me? Let us journey through life together, experiencing all its wonders. Will you be my wife?"

'Yes! A thousand times yes!' Evelyn's heart cried out.

She extended her left hand automatically.

Then her gaze lifted - and she saw that woman whispering to Jonathan Prescott, whose expression darkened abruptly.

The woman retrieved something small and flat from her gown, pressing it into Jonathan's hand...
###Chapter 466

Evelyn's heart nearly burst from her chest at that moment.

Every fiber of her being burned with excruciating pain.

Seeing Jonathan about to take the disc from the woman's hand, Evelyn suddenly screamed at Dominic, "No! I don't want to marry you! I refuse this engagement!"

The grand ballroom fell deathly silent.

You could have heard a feather drop.

Dominic remained frozen on one knee, completely stunned.

He'd always known Evelyn anticipated their wedding more than he did. This rejection blindsided him.

Reginald Blackwood's face turned ashen. His walking stick trembled in his grip.

Sebastian rushed forward to steady the elderly patriarch.

Margaret Lockwood showed no reaction.

Having suffered through an unhappy marriage herself, she secretly approved of the young woman's decision.

Beatrice Lockwood seethed with rage. Were it not for her social standing, she would have clawed Evelyn's face to shreds right then.

Countless society daughters dreamed of marrying her son!

Yet this insignificant nobody from humble origins dared publicly reject Dominic? The Blackwood name would never recover from this humiliation!

Reginald Sinclair and Gwendolyn stood shocked.

Evelyn had always been so gentle and considerate. Why would she...

Even if she had reservations, she should have discussed them privately. This public spectacle would make Dominic the laughingstock of high society!

Dominic's piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn. Her words turned his heart to ice.

Still kneeling, he demanded, "Why?" He needed to understand.

Evelyn felt her heart being torn in two.

Trembling uncontrollably, tears welling in her eyes, she forced out the words. "We're not suited. You're elite aristocracy - brilliant, accomplished. I'm just a talentless pauper with nothing to offer. I can't help your career. I can't give you what you need. I'm sorry!"

Through her anguish, Evelyn clung to one shred of logic.

She didn't know this woman's identity or motives, but the disc could only mean two things:

Either she was one of Dominic's admirers, or someone had hired her.

Either way, her goal was to force Evelyn away from Dominic.

Evelyn gambled that if she left willingly, the woman wouldn't release the disc regardless of her motives. There'd be no benefit.

As for humiliating Dominic, she couldn't bear that.

So Evelyn took full blame for the rejection.

The woman might not be completely satisfied, but the engagement would certainly be canceled. No aristocratic family would accept her after this public disgrace.

The woman would achieve her goal, and Evelyn could spare Dominic some pain.

Agony like a thousand knives shredded Evelyn's heart. The pain was so intense she thought she might vomit.

Dominic saw through her flimsy excuses instantly.

Yet his normally unshakable heart ached terribly.

Rising, he gripped Evelyn's shoulders and whispered for only her to hear, "I don't believe a word of this, Evelyn! Tell me what's really happening! If you're not ready, I'll wait - ten years, twenty, my entire life if needed..."

His voice dropped lower. "I'll wait until you say yes. You know I'd never force you."

Evelyn's head throbbed as if struck by a hammer.

His words filled her with unbearable guilt.

In that moment, her mind had never been clearer, yet her eyes overflowed with helpless despair.

Dominic saw the torment in her gaze.

A spark of hope ignited in his eyes. She wasn't truly rejecting him! He waited for the real explanation.

Evelyn shook her head, her delicate face growing paler.

Before Dominic could press further, Evelyn's body went limp, collapsing unconscious...

"Evelyn!" Dominic caught her just in time.

His handsome face drained of color as he stared at her lifeless form.

Excruciating pain gripped his heart.

Had he pushed too hard? Perhaps she simply wasn't ready.

The crowd erupted in shocked murmurs.

An engagement ceremony derailed by rejection and fainting? Unprecedented.

Guests whispered behind gloved hands, pointing and smirking at the unconscious girl.

Dominic lifted Evelyn in a bridal carry.

Standing tall as an oak, he faced the microphone, his expression grave.

His commanding presence silenced the room instantly.

"Ladies and gentlemen." Dominic's cool, elegant voice carried through the golden microphone. "My apologies for this unexpected turn. My fiancée contracted a severe flu last night - 104-degree fever, overnight IV treatment. She's clearly not herself today. Please disregard her earlier words. We'll postpone the engagement, but dinner will proceed as planned."

His smile didn't reach his icy eyes as he continued, "To all media present - I expect zero speculative reporting about Evelyn tomorrow. You understand my meaning."

Though spoken softly, his gaze promised winter's wrath. Reporters shuddered, spines tingling with dread.

Everyone knew Dominic's gentle demeanor masked ruthless efficiency.

No one dared cross him and survive the consequences!

Dominic carried Evelyn from the hall.

Lillian Prescott ground her teeth so hard they creaked. This wasn't supposed to happen!

Evelyn had publicly humiliated Dominic and the Blackwoods. Shouldn't he despise her now?

Why was he still protecting that wretched girl?
###Chapter 467

The Blackwood Estate.

Dominic stood on the grand balcony, cigarette smoke curling around him as his gaze fixed on the cherry blossoms below.

The tree was in full bloom. Pink petals danced in the breeze, creating a delicate carpet on the ground.

Evelyn adored flowers. That's why he'd transformed the estate's gardens into a floral paradise - his gift to her.

A surprise that had gone terribly wrong...

Dominic's eyes narrowed as he watched the falling petals. He crushed his cigarette into the ashtray with more force than necessary.

The master bedroom door opened silently.

Two nurses attending to Evelyn immediately stood. "Mr. Blackwood," they greeted in unison.

Dominic's expression softened as he took in Evelyn's pale face. "How is she?"

"Dr. Grant administered medication an hour ago," one nurse replied. "Her fever has broken, but she remains exhausted."

A dismissive wave sent the nurses away.

Alone now, Dominic sat beside the bed, his fingers tracing Evelyn's cheekbone.

Afternoon sunlight painted gold across her features.

Even in sleep, her brow remained furrowed. The sight twisted something in his chest.

Her public rejection still burned like a fresh wound.

Logically, he knew it wasn't her choice. Emotionally? That knowledge provided little comfort.

She was supposed to become Mrs. Blackwood. They'd both dreamed of that day.

Something had changed.

Dominic's jaw tightened. He craved another cigarette.

But Evelyn hated the smell, especially during her pregnancy. He'd mostly quit, reserving smoking for extreme stress.

He would uncover the truth.

Evelyn looked fragile as porcelain beneath the blankets.

Unable to resist, he captured her lips in a gentle kiss. "Why the sudden change?" he murmured against her mouth. "You will be mine, Evelyn. There's no escape."

The kiss deepened, growing more insistent.

Evelyn stirred awake.

Sunlight haloed Dominic's face, making her breath catch.

Memory flooded back - the ceremony, her cruel rejection, his devastated expression.

Guilt jolted her fully awake.

"I'm sorry," she choked out, unable to meet his eyes. "So sorry..."

Dominic cradled her face, pressing a kiss to her forehead. "I could never stay angry with you."

Evelyn kept her gaze lowered.

"Evelyn Sinclair," Dominic murmured, voice tender yet firm. "Promise you'll stay with me forever."

Her lashes fluttered in surprise.

After humiliating him publicly, how could he still want her?

Evelyn shut her eyes against his intense stare. "I...can't," she whispered.

Dominic didn't react with anger. Instead, he pulled her close. "Tell me why."

She was his everything.

Before Evelyn, his world had been monochrome. Now? He'd never let her go.

Evelyn curled into him like a wounded creature.

Overwhelmed, she clung to him instinctively.

His steady heartbeat thrummed against her ear. "Whatever it is, we'll face it together."

Tears threatened as his words pierced her heart.

She'd hurt him terribly.

It felt like plunging a knife into her own chest, then turning it on him. The guilt was crushing, but necessary.

Evelyn knew Dominic was in pain. So was she.

Agony seeped into every fiber of her being, stealing sleep.

Outside, spring flourished.

New leaves unfurled beneath the golden sun.

Evelyn gripped his arm weakly. "Please...don't push me."

She couldn't mention the CD. Couldn't risk him finding out.

The woman's threat echoed in her mind - if Dominic discovered the truth, she'd leak it everywhere. To the Integrity Committee. To every major news outlet. The scandal would be uncontrollable.

Dominic held her tighter. "Rest now. I'm not going anywhere."

His expression hardened when Evelyn couldn't see.

Sebastian was already tracing Evelyn's recent movements.

Answers would come tomorrow.

The Prescott Residence.

Cassandra gasped upon entering Lillian's walk-in closet.

The space dwarfed her entire apartment.

Rows of designer garments, shelves of luxury handbags, and cases of glittering jewelry left her dizzy.

"You've done well, Cassandra."

Lillian noted the greed flashing in Cassandra's eyes but maintained her gentle demeanor.

"Evelyn rejected Dominic's proposal publicly. The Blackwoods won't tolerate such humiliation, no matter how much he loves her." Lillian smiled. "As reward, take anything you like."

Cassandra trembled with barely restrained excitement. "Truly, Lillian?"

As an illegitimate Weish daughter, she'd never owned such luxuries.

Now Lillian offered them freely - most items still tagged.

"Of course." Lillian's smile turned sharp. "But first, there's one more small favor..."
###Chapter 468  

Cassandra's eyes gleamed as she sifted through racks of designer clothes, all untouched with tags still attached.  

She slipped into several pairs of shoes that caught her eye, marveling at how perfectly they fit.  

Lillian's height, body shape, and shoe size were nearly identical to hers. Cassandra couldn't contain her delight—it was as if these luxurious items had been tailor-made for her!  

As she continued browsing, she turned to Lillian. "Just tell me what you need me to do. I'll give it my all."  

"Evelyn may have rejected Dominic's proposal, but he made sure the media wouldn't smear her name. That doesn't sit right with me." Lillian's voice was sharp. "Here's what I want you to do, Cassandra. Buy up every trending topic and keyword across all major platforms—Twitter, Yahoo, TMZ, Instagram. I want Evelyn's reputation destroyed beyond repair. Make sure she can't show her face in A City again. Money isn't an issue—I'll cover everything. You just need to handle the negotiations."  

"And don't overlook those influencers with millions of followers. Their reach is massive. Also, target the struggling print media outlets. The big players might fear Dominic, but the small ones? They're desperate. They'll publish anything for a quick buck."  

Lillian was undeniably cunning.  

With the decline of print media, many had shifted online, relying on social media for survival.  

Cassandra hesitated, recalling Dominic's icy glare at the engagement ceremony.  

"Lillian, you know Dominic controls A City. He can manipulate the news flow. I doubt anyone would dare cross him..."  

Lillian cut her off. "What are you so afraid of? My father is the Provincial Committee Secretary. With me backing you, no one will touch you. Didn't you always want to break into the entertainment industry? Once this is done, I'll make sure you get roles. Big ones."  

The promise ignited Cassandra's ambition. Visions of fame and adoring fans flashed through her mind.  

"Fine," she said firmly. "I'll do it."  

Meanwhile, tension thickened the air at Blackwood Manor.  

Reginald Blackwood slammed his walking stick against the floor. "That reckless boy! Causing a scene at his own engagement and then vanishing without a word? He's ruined the family's reputation!"  

Julian Blackwood placed a calming hand on his grandfather's shoulder. "Dominic never acts without reason. Something must have happened. Let's hear him out when he returns."  

Reginald Sinclair sighed deeply. "I apologize, Reginald. Evelyn has always been thoughtful and composed. She must have been unwell—her complexion was off at the ceremony."  

Gwendolyn Sinclair nodded in agreement. "My niece isn't the type to cause a scene. Dominic said she had a fever. Please understand."  

They pleaded for understanding, convinced there was more to Evelyn's rejection.  

Margaret Lockwood sat quietly, sipping tea as if the chaos didn't concern her.  

Beatrice Lockwood, however, was livid. She jabbed a finger at Reginald and Gwendolyn. "How dare you defend that shameless girl? She humiliated my son in front of everyone! Clearly, she wasn't raised right. And you—" She sneered. "No wonder she turned out this way, coming from a family like yours!"  

Reginald Sinclair's face paled. He had never been insulted so brazenly.  

His hands trembled with anger. "You—you—"  

Beatrice scoffed. "What? It's the truth. That girl seduced my son, got herself pregnant, and now she dares to reject him publicly? She has no shame! And neither do any of you!"  

Her words struck like venom.  

Reginald Sinclair had thought Dominic was a good man, but his mother was another matter entirely.  

He had hoped Evelyn would eventually win Beatrice over, but now he saw the truth.  

This woman would never accept his granddaughter.  

And he would never allow Evelyn to suffer under such cruelty.
###Chapter 469

Gwendolyn Sinclair's blood boiled at Beatrice Lockwood's words.

How dare this woman insult her revered father and beloved niece?

She sprang to her feet instantly. "What exactly do you mean by that, Mrs. Lockwood? Even if you refuse to forgive Evelyn, there's no need for such vile language! How could you speak this way to your elders when our families aren't even officially connected yet? I respected you as Dominic's mother, but clearly that respect was misplaced."

Her eyes flashed with contempt. "You look down on our modest means? Tell me, Mrs. Lockwood - or should I say mistress Lockwood? The true Mrs. Blackwood is Margaret Lockwood, the woman legally married to Dominic's father. You're nothing but a kept woman living off your son's generosity. Does that make you feel superior?"

Gwendolyn had been a formidable businesswoman in her prime, running major corporations alongside her ex-husband. She'd dealt with countless socialites - handling Beatrice was child's play. She knew exactly where to strike.

Meanwhile, Margaret Lockwood watched the unfolding drama with amusement.

A satisfied smile curved her lips as Gwendolyn's verbal daggers found their mark.

It was refreshing to have someone else put Beatrice in her place.

In the corner of the couch, Alexander and Isabella huddled together, still dressed in their ring bearer and flower girl outfits.

The adults' shouting made their ears ring.

They hated this toxic atmosphere but didn't know where their parents had disappeared to.

Had Mommy and Daddy abandoned them?

Tears pricked their eyes as they remembered the disastrous engagement ceremony.

Beatrice's chest heaved with rage at Gwendolyn's words. Her precarious position in the Blackwood family was her most sensitive wound.

No one was allowed to mention it, even if it was the undeniable truth.

Blind with fury, Beatrice raised her hand to strike Gwendolyn, forgetting the children were watching.

But Gwendolyn caught her wrist mid-swing and shoved her back forcefully.

Beatrice staggered backward, barely catching herself on the coffee table.

She stared at the slender woman in shock. How could someone so delicate be so strong?

Reginald Sinclair's face darkened when Beatrice not only insulted his family but attempted to physically assault his daughter.

Leaning heavily on the couch, he struggled to his feet, trembling with outrage. "Gwendolyn, if the Blackwoods don't want us, we'll leave! My granddaughter can find a worthy husband anywhere. Dominic is a good man, but we won't grovel at the feet of the elite! Come to Great-Grandpa, Alexander, Isabella. You won't learn proper manners here. Let's go home to your mother."

He extended his arms lovingly to the twins.

The children glanced uncertainly between Reginald Blackwood and Beatrice. Should they leave Blackwood Manor with their great-grandfather?

Beatrice grabbed their wrists painfully. "Alexander and Isabella belong to the Blackwoods! What right do you outsiders have to take them?"

She didn't realize her grip was hurting them.

Reginald Sinclair's heart clenched when he saw the twins' tear-filled eyes and quivering lips.

Shaking with anger, he pulled Gwendolyn toward the door. "Let's go! Who needs the Blackwoods? I'll never set foot in this house again!"

Gwendolyn shot Beatrice one last scathing look before helping her father leave.

"Wait, Reginald! Let's discuss this..." Reginald Blackwood called out anxiously, motioning for Julian to help him up.

Despite his anger over Evelyn humiliating the family at the engagement, she carried Dominic's child.

If Reginald Sinclair truly intended to marry Evelyn off to someone else, what would happen to the baby?

Beatrice, still smarting from her humiliation, stopped her father-in-law. "Father, that poor family isn't worthy of us. Let that Evelyn woman marry whoever she wants. We'll just take the child after she gives birth. Dominic deserves better."

Reginald Blackwood glared at her, barely restraining himself from hitting her with his cane. "Disgraceful!"

Pushing her aside, he and Julian hurried after the departing Sinclairs.

Julian threw Beatrice a disapproving glance over his shoulder.

"Great-Grandpa..."

The twins tried to follow their beloved great-grandfather and aunt.

But Beatrice held them back.

With Reginald Sinclair gone, she didn't hesitate to smack each child's bottom several times. "Ungrateful brats! After everything I've done for you, you'd abandon me for those outsiders?"

"Great-Grandpa Sinclair isn't an outsider! He loves us!" Alexander declared defiantly, though tears streamed down his face.

"Bad Grandma! You made them leave! I hate you!" Isabella suddenly wrenched free and ran after the Sinclairs.

"Wait for me!" Alexander followed.

Beatrice ground her teeth as she watched her precious grandchildren flee.

"You'll never be part of this family, Evelyn Sinclair!" she hissed.

Meanwhile, at the mansion...

Evelyn remained blissfully unaware of the explosive confrontation between the families.

Dominic had turned off his phone and spent the night with her.

She'd fallen asleep curled against his chest.

Waking alone the next morning, she found a note on his pillow:

"Business to attend to, Evie. Back in two hours. This is our new home - peaceful surroundings, fresh air, perfect for our baby. Our family of five will live here undisturbed from now on. I love you."
###Chapter 470  

Evelyn Sinclair massaged her throbbing temples. The unfamiliar surroundings made her pulse quicken.  

The bedroom was enormous, with a breathtaking floor-to-ceiling window framing the view outside.  

She couldn't resist stepping closer.  

A sea of cherry blossoms stretched before her, their petals like delicate snowflakes, their scent intoxicating.  

It was more stunning than the garden Dominic had once shown her. But Evelyn couldn’t appreciate it.  

Not after rejecting his proposal yesterday.  

The Blackwood family must be furious. Her grandfather and aunt were probably heartbroken, thinking her reckless.  

But what choice did she have?  

Her phone buzzed—Olivia’s name flashed on the screen.  

Evelyn answered.  

"Have you seen Twitter today?" Olivia’s voice was frantic. "Every major account is sharing this disgusting article! I sent you the link. That coward hiding behind a screen—I swear, if I find out who wrote this—"  

Evelyn opened the message.  

The headline alone made her blood run cold.  

"Gold-Digging Liar Exposed: How a Scheming Employee Fooled a Billionaire."  

Her fingers trembled as she tapped the link.  

The page loaded slowly.  

"Let me read it first," Evelyn said. "I’ll call you back."  

"Don’t let it get to you," Olivia warned. "You and the baby come first."  

The call ended.  

Evelyn skimmed the article. Her stomach twisted.  

It detailed yesterday’s failed proposal—how "Miss S" had publicly humiliated "Mr. B."  

No names were used, but everyone would know.  

The writer, calling herself "Rosalind," painted Evelyn as a manipulative seductress. A woman who abandoned her sick grandfather, sold her family home for selfish reasons, and funded her lavish lifestyle with unspeakable acts abroad.  

According to Rosalind, Evelyn had seduced Dominic Blackwood, CEO of T Corporation, tricking him into believing she was the twins’ mother.  

But her lies were exposed at the engagement party by a "close friend."  

The article included scandalous photos—a woman with Evelyn’s profile entangled with faceless men.  

If Evelyn didn’t know better, she might’ve believed it was her.  

Every claim was backed with "evidence." The public was eating it up.  

A City’s elite circles were small. Everyone knew "Miss S" was Evelyn Sinclair.  

And "Mr. B"? Dominic Blackwood.  

Months ago, JK Media had celebrated their love story. Now, people wondered—had Dominic been fooled?  

Was the sweet, devoted Cinderella actually a ruthless opportunist?  

Twitter was on fire. Verified accounts with millions of followers shared the article. The comments were brutal.  

Some defended her, pointing out JK Media’s credibility versus Rosalind’s sensationalism.  

Most called her a liar.  

Evelyn exhaled sharply.  

She couldn’t control the rumors. All that mattered was Dominic’s trust.  

But thinking of him made her chest ache.  

Too many obstacles stood between them.  

Maybe she was the problem.  

Maybe she should let him go.
###Chapter 471

Blue Honors

Cassandra Prescott strode into the VIP lounge, draped in the most exquisite designer outfit and shoes gifted by Lillian. 

Her informant had revealed Frederick Kingsley, the legendary director, was casting unknown actors for his new $100 million film. 

That same friend knew Frederick's producer personally, which secured Cassandra this rare audition opportunity.

After reviewing Cassandra's portfolio, Frederick agreed to meet her. 

When she learned he'd reserved Blue Honors' private suite, Cassandra nearly fainted with excitement. Her friend miraculously obtained an invitation for her.

Clutching the engraved invitation, Cassandra entered Blue Honors with calculated sway in her hips. 

She intended to make an unforgettable impression. Perhaps the director would be so captivated by her curves that he'd rewrite the casting rules.

"Mr. Kingsley..." Her sultry voice preceded her entrance.

She tugged her plunging neckline lower, fingers brushing the door handle when it suddenly swung open. 

Cassandra tumbled forward, landing painfully on the marble floor.

Looking up, her breath caught. 

Dominic Blackwood sat shadowed in the corner like a dark prince, his commanding presence dimming the room's lights. 

Cassandra paled. Had he discovered her smear campaign against Evelyn?

The man was terrifyingly omniscient.

But Cassandra knew men. She recovered with practiced ease, batting her lashes. "Mr. Blackwood. How...unexpected to see you here under Mr. Kingsley's name."

Her hungry gaze devoured him. Were it not for his four imposing bodyguards, she'd have ripped off her dress already.

Dominic lounged on the sofa, one leg crossed over the other. Cigarette smoke curled around his sharp jawline as he tapped ashes into the tray.

"No games," he said silkily. "Just tell me what you said to Evelyn Sinclair at Monke Dessert Cafe that made her reject my proposal. The CD you gave her - what was on it?"

Though Dominic maintained business ties with the Prescott family, he knew Cassandra was Channing Prescott's illegitimate daughter - beautiful but morally bankrupt.

He'd ignored her until security footage revealed Evelyn's demeanor shifted after their cafe meeting. She'd asked unsettling questions, even mentioned calling off their engagement.

At first, Dominic attributed it to pre-wedding nerves. But after the disastrous ceremony, he needed answers.

His velvet voice struck Cassandra like thunder. 

She averted her eyes. How had he uncovered so much? Had Evelyn betrayed their agreement to leave quietly?

Playing dumb, Cassandra pouted. "I don't know any Evelyn Sinclair. CDs? How antiquated. That gold-digger doesn't deserve you. Why not try me instead? No strings attached..."

Bold as ever, she tore her flimsy dress and lunged.

Dominic didn't flinch. His mocking gaze flickered with disgust as a bodyguard kicked her away violently.

Cassandra crashed into the coffee table, ribs screaming in protest. Metallic blood filled her mouth.

Stunned, she gasped, "I'm Lillian's best friend! How dare you-"

Dominic cut her off. "Last chance. What did you tell Evelyn? Who sent you?"

Cassandra switched tactics, bursting into theatrical sobs. "I...I did meet her! Because I'm madly in love with you! My father can vouch how I pine for you day and night! I threatened her to leave you out of jealousy!"

Dominic's glacial stare froze her tears. "Since you crave men so badly, my guards will oblige you today." He stood. "Just don't kill her."

As he exited, the bodyguards opened a leather case revealing terrifying implements - whips, restraints, cruel metal tools.

Though no stranger to kink, these were instruments of pure torture. Used fully, they'd leave her dead.

Cassandra trembled. The gentle facade hid a monster!

As the men advanced, she shrieked her confession: "It was Lillian Prescott! She made me give Evelyn that CD!"
###Chapter 472

Dominic halted mid-step. 

He turned sharply, his piercing gaze turning glacial. "Is this the truth?"

With a dismissive wave, his security team released Cassandra.

She was trembling on the verge of tears.

While she enjoyed certain...adult games, they were only fun when consensual. Those instruments could be exciting during intimate moments, but seeing them wielded as weapons had chilled her to the bone.

Collapsing to her knees, she begged. "I was wrong, Mr. Blackwood! Please forgive me! I bear no grudge against Evelyn Sinclair. Lillian Prescott forced me into this! She threatened to ruin me in A City if I refused. I had no choice! I swear I'll never do it again—"

Dominic loomed over her like a marble statue, though Cassandra was in no state to appreciate his sculpted features. The man radiated deadly menace.

"What was on that CD that made Evelyn reject my proposal?" His voice was deceptively calm.

Cassandra's eyes darted nervously to the four bodyguards. Dominic gave an almost imperceptible nod.

The men filed out silently, closing the door behind them.

"Speak." The single word held terrifying weight.

Cassandra spilled everything. "Mr. Blackwood, Lillian's been obsessed with you since your first meeting. She knows you love Ms. Sinclair, but she's determined to marry you regardless. That woman's a master manipulator—playing the innocent while scheming behind the scenes. She's insulted Ms. Sinclair to my face countless times, swearing to break you two apart..."

She recounted every malicious act, watching Dominic's expression darken with each revelation.

"Recently, Lillian obtained a CD allegedly containing evidence of your bribery dealings. She ordered me to deliver it to Ms. Sinclair with threats—leave you or face consequences. I only complied under duress!"

Dominic absorbed this calmly, though his eyes had turned stormy.

'So that's why Evelyn refused me at the altar.'

Mission accomplished, he strode from the room, security detail falling into step behind him.

Cassandra slumped in relief, wiping sweat from her brow—until realization struck. If Lillian discovered her betrayal...

Panicked, she recalled her latest sugar daddy—a wealthy, unattractive tycoon who'd promised a Maldives getaway. Perfect timing for an extended overseas vacation.

Inside the car, Sebastian handed Dominic a tablet. "Sir, defamatory articles about Ms. Sinclair are trending across all platforms. This is clearly a coordinated smear campaign."

Dominic's face darkened as he scanned the content. "Amateur hour. Identify this 'Rosalind' and terminate every account sharing this filth."

Sebastian hesitated. "With the recent media regulation crackdown targeting corporations like ours—"

"I'll take full responsibility," Dominic cut in coldly. "Lawbreakers face consequences. Execute my orders."

Sebastian sighed. His normally strategic boss became recklessly impulsive where Evelyn was involved.

"One more thing." Dominic's lips curled dangerously. "Compile every piece of dirt on Lillian Prescott. I want her name dominating tabloids for the next month."

Let the schemer drown in her own tactics.

Sebastian masked his surprise. "Understood, sir."

"And summon Gideon Blackwood immediately."

As the car moved, Dominic leaned back, eyes closed but mind racing. That bribery CD? A trivial matter. Old Samuel Whitmore had been more thorough than expected.

His smirk held no warmth. The game had just begun.
###Chapter 473

Sebastian drove Dominic back to the Blackwood estate.

As Dominic stepped out of the car, Evelyn's distressed voice carried through the courtyard. "Let me go! I need to leave!"

"Mrs. Blackwood, Sir's orders are clear - you can't leave without his permission." The housekeeper's voice remained firm.

Dominic quickened his pace.

He found Evelyn standing at the grand foyer, wearing only a thin blouse, facing off against two staff members.

His chest tightened seeing her stubborn defiance.

"Evelyn!" His deep voice cut through the tension.

She turned, her eyes glistening with unshed tears when she saw him.

Immediately she spun back around, presenting him with her rigid back.

The impossibility of their situation weighed heavily on her.

Yet her traitorous heart leapt at his return. She couldn't allow herself to look at him.

Dominic's piercing gaze swept over her profile before settling on her tense shoulders.

A nearly imperceptible sigh escaped him.

Even without seeing his face, Evelyn could feel the heat of his stare burning into her.

She ducked her head. He had every right to be furious.

In three strides, Dominic closed the distance and wrapped his arms around her slender frame.

His sharp eyes caught the untouched meal on the dining table. "Has my wife not eaten?" The question carried an edge.

"Mr. Blackwood," one housekeeper stammered, avoiding eye contact. "Mrs. Blackwood said she wasn't hungry..."

"Is this how you perform your duties?" Dominic's accusatory tone made both women flinch.

They stood frozen, barely daring to breathe under his glare.

Though Evelyn had refused the food, neither dared say so.

The senior staff member bowed slightly. "Our apologies, Sir. We'll do better."

They bore the unjust reprimand without complaint.

After the fire incident, Dominic had personally vetted every staff member. These women were the most experienced professionals available.

Evelyn couldn't stomach their punishment. "It's not their fault! I refused to eat. Don't blame them."

Dominic's expression softened slightly. He pinched her earlobe gently. "You're grown yet acting like a child. If not for yourself, eat for our baby. Starvation harms you both."

"Not your concern!" Evelyn tried to pull away, her resolve weakening under his touch.

She turned her face, unable to bear looking at his devastating features.

Dominic's lips curved into a dangerous smile as his palm settled on her stomach. "You're my wife carrying my child. How is this not my concern?"

The staff took their cue to leave. "We'll reheat lunch immediately, Sir."

They efficiently cleared the table, granting the couple privacy.

Alone in the cavernous hall, Evelyn squirmed uncomfortably.

When she tried to move away, Dominic pulled her onto his lap. "Going somewhere?"

"Home." The word came out barely above a whisper.

She crossed her arms defensively between them.

Dominic's grip tightened. "Home? Where exactly is that?" His gravelly voice held warning.

Evelyn bit her lip, lashes fluttering. "To my grandfather and aunt. That's where I belong—"

Her words were cut off as Dominic captured her lips in a searing kiss, his tongue claiming her mouth ruthlessly.

She gasped for air, lightheaded from the assault.

Then pain exploded as he bit down sharply.

The metallic tang of blood flooded her mouth.

When Dominic finally released her, his gaze held a turbulent mix of tenderness and fury.

Evelyn touched her stinging lips in shock, heart pounding too loudly to speak.

This particular punishment always signaled his darkest moods.

"Never say that again." After the brutal kiss, he pressed a feather-light peck to her swollen lips. "Disobey me again, and I'll make sure you can't speak for days."

Tears welled in Evelyn's eyes like dew on rose petals. "I'm nothing but trouble for you, Dominic. You deserve better. Yes, I humiliated you by rejecting your proposal publicly, but it was for your own good. You don't understand—"

Dominic forced her to meet his gaze. "Was this about the recording?"

Evelyn froze. "How...how do you know about that?"

He tapped her forehead. "Foolish girl, why didn't you come to me? Am I so unimportant that you'd carry this alone? Or do you truly think me incapable of handling it?" His tone held equal parts reproach and self-recrimination.

The dam broke. Evelyn shook her head violently. "That woman has proof of you taking bribes! If I didn't comply, she'd release it. Your reputation would be destroyed—you could go to prison! You're the man I love most—I can't bear that. I'm powerless to help...I'm so sorry..."

Her anguish spilled out in ragged breaths.

Dominic pulled her close, an unexpected smile playing on his lips. "Look at you, crying over nothing. Don't worry, darling. I have everything under control."
###Chapter 474  

"You're not concerned about your safety at all?"  

Evelyn's eyes widened in shock at Dominic's words. She pressed a hand to her chest, willing her racing heart to calm.  

The past few days had been torture. Every night, she'd wake up drenched in sweat from nightmares of enforcement officers dragging Dominic away. Helpless. Powerless.  

And yet here he was, completely unfazed by the existence of that damning CD.  

Did he not realize how catastrophic its contents would be if leaked?  

Dominic's fingers tightened around her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze. "Why didn't you tell me something this serious was happening? Do you have any idea how relieved I was when I found out you rejected my proposal because of that CD? But I'm also furious you kept it from me."  

Evelyn stayed silent.  

How could she explain? She'd wanted to protect him.  

His sharp gaze pinned her in place. Every time he looked at her like this, it was because she'd messed up.  

Her fingers curled into fists. "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have hidden it. But I was terrified this would ruin your future—"  

Dominic flinched.  

His thumb brushed over her swollen lips—a reminder of his earlier punishment. "Between my future and you, you matter more. Understand?"  

His voice dropped lower. "If you face trouble, you come to me. Keeping it to yourself only leads to misunderstandings and plays right into their hands. Do you get that now?"  

Evelyn focused on the glint of his wristwatch instead of his face. "I'm sorry—"  

"Don't." His expression darkened. "No more apologies. Next time, you tell me first. No matter what it is, we'll handle it together."  

She nodded.  

Then her stomach growled, shattering the tension.  

Heat flooded her cheeks.  

Dominic chuckled. "Hungry? You're neglecting your duties as a mother. Starving yourself means starving our child. Let's eat."  

He scooped her into his arms.  

Evelyn clung to his neck, flustered. "Put me down. I'm pregnant, not crippled. I can walk."  

She worried her added weight would strain him.  

Dominic shot her a look. "You're my wife. There's no one else I'd carry. What, should I haul Alexander and Isabella around instead? They're grown. They'll have their own partners to carry them someday."  

Evelyn gaped.  

Is he serious? If the twins didn’t look exactly like him, I’d question if he’s their real father.  

###  

Soft music played in the dining room. The scent of roses drifted from the centerpiece.  

Every dish had been carefully curated by a nutritionist for her pregnancy.  

After their heart-to-heart, the weight crushing Evelyn’s chest finally lifted.  

What she’d seen as an insurmountable crisis, Dominic treated like child’s play.  

She’d thought hiding it would protect him. Instead, she’d only made him worry. From now on, no more secrets.  

Dominic placed chicken on her plate. She took small bites.  

Then she hesitated. "What’s the plan for the CD? The evidence inside... it’s bad. I refused that woman’s demand to leave you. What if she leaks it? Did you really do what’s on there?"  

Dominic’s hand settled on her head. "Ten years ago, Blackwood Industries was drowning in debt. Banks pulled out. Clients betrayed us. I had no choice but to take risks."  

His voice hardened. "The property market was booming. I bribed Samuel Whitmore—then the vice secretary—for land to save the company. I didn’t expect that old fox to keep proof."  

He met her eyes. "I have a solution. But you’ll need to play along. It might be hard on you for a while."  

He’d already devised a plan.  

One where they’d fake a breakup.  

Evelyn didn’t hesitate. "I’ll do whatever it takes to clear your name."  

She knew it meant harboring a crime. But for him? Without question.  

She used to think women who took the fall for their lovers were fools.  

Now she understood.  

Love made people reckless. Willing to leap into the abyss.  

For Dominic, she’d act.  

For Dominic, she’d do far worse.
###Chapter 475

The hotel suite was bathed in dim golden light, creating an intimate atmosphere. 

A masked man stood by the window, the uncovered half of his face strikingly handsome. 

Gideon Blackwood held a woman close in his arms.

Then he saw it - a faint red dot flashing outside the window. 

In one fluid motion, he tightened his grip on the woman and rolled them both off the bed.

A silenced bullet whizzed through the air, embedding itself where Gideon's head had been moments before.

The mattress now bore a smoking hole.

Two figures clad in black crashed through the window.

Their assassination attempt foiled, they immediately raised their weapons toward the masked man.

But Gideon was faster. 

His gun appeared as if by magic, two precise shots ringing out in quick succession.

Both bullets found their mark between the assassins' eyes.

Blood trickled down their foreheads as their bodies collapsed. 

Their eyes remained wide open, frozen in shock at Gideon's lightning-fast reflexes.

The woman finally noticed the two fresh corpses in their room.

Her piercing scream filled the suite. "Ahhh! Help! Murder!"

"Quiet!" Gideon snapped, already dressing with practiced efficiency. 

He removed his mask, revealing the horrifically scarred other half of his face.

This only made the woman scream louder.

Fortunately, the soundproofing in the VIP suite was excellent.

Gideon silenced her with a precise pressure point strike to her neck.

Lighting a cigarette, he exhaled sharply.

He'd been laying low in A City, yet Antonio Moretti's men had still found him. 

Just his luck.

His phone vibrated abruptly.

Dominic Blackwood's name flashed on the screen. 

Gideon answered with a grunt. "Make it quick, Blackwood. I'm busy." 

He eyed the two corpses dispassionately.

Silence greeted him.

"Spit it out already," Gideon growled impatiently. 

He needed to dispose of the evidence quickly.

Dominic's voice was deceptively warm. "How would you like to stop running?"

"What?" Gideon frowned.

"Help me with something, and I'll make Antonio call off his dogs."

Gideon's interest was piqued.

He'd been hunted across continents - by law enforcement and criminals alike.

None bothered him except Antonio Moretti. 

The ruthless Italian mobster had slaughtered his own brother's family, including a child, to seize power.

After Gideon swindled him, Antonio had spared no expense hunting him down.

No matter where Gideon hid, Antonio's reach extended there.

"You can really make him back off?" Gideon asked skeptically.

"My word is my bond," Dominic replied confidently.

Gideon considered Dominic's reputation for cunning. 

"Deal," he said finally. 

He'd do anything to escape Antonio's relentless pursuit.

Meanwhile, at Blackwood Manor...

Dominic sipped tea across from Reginald Blackwood. 

"You wanted to see me, Grandfather?" he asked directly.

Reginald's expression darkened. "You've humiliated this family! That disgraceful engagement fiasco - how do you expect me to face society? Your precious Evelyn has failed us!"

Dominic set his cup down calmly. "It's merely postponed. I've explained everything to our guests."

"You still intend to marry her?" Reginald raised his cane threateningly.

Beatrice Lockwood intercepted it hastily. "This is all Evelyn Sinclair's fault! She rejected Dominic publicly and shamed us. My son did nothing wrong. Father, remember your blood pressure!"

She shot Dominic a meaningful look, urging him to placate the old man.

Dominic ignored her. "What would you have me do then?"

Reginald glowered. "Evelyn may seem decent, but she's clearly unfit for our family after this scandal. I refuse to accept her as my granddaughter-in-law!"

Beatrice barely concealed her satisfaction. "It's not just Evelyn. Her entire family is problematic - her grandfather and aunt insulted me personally! With that upbringing, she'll never be worthy of you. You can't make a silk purse from a sow's ear-"

"Enough," Dominic cut in coldly. "Did you summon me just to criticize Evelyn?"

Beatrice frowned. "Why are you so stubborn? What does that girl have that-"

Reginald's cane struck the floor sharply. "After she delivers the baby, bring it here and pay her off. Cut all ties. If you defy me, don't blame me for what happens next."

In his youth, Reginald had been just as ruthless as Dominic. 

They both knew exactly what that warning meant.

"Fine," Dominic said simply.

Both Reginald and Beatrice froze.

Had they heard correctly?

Was Dominic actually agreeing to abandon Evelyn Sinclair?
###Chapter 476

The following morning.

Lillian sat in the makeup chair as the artist worked on her face. She scrolled through her phone impatiently, searching for updates about Evelyn's scandal.

She could practically see Evelyn's devastated expression in her mind.

But as Lillian checked Twitter and various influencer accounts, she found nothing about Evelyn. Not a single scandalous headline.

Her stomach dropped. Something was wrong.

Just last night, the gossip sites had been buzzing. Now everything had vanished overnight.

Worst of all, the accounts Cassandra had contacted to spread the article were gone too. Vanished without a trace.

Panic set in.

Lillian immediately dialed Cassandra's number, ignoring the makeup artist's protests. The call rang endlessly with no answer.

She nearly threw her phone across the room.

"Ms. Prescott, is everything alright?" the makeup artist asked timidly. Everyone knew better than to upset Jonathan Prescott's daughter.

Lillian barely heard her. Her mind raced with questions.

Cassandra had promised dozens of influencers would share the article. Lillian had paid them a fortune. This was supposed to be Evelyn's downfall, not... whatever this was.

"That incompetent fool," Lillian seethed silently. "I'll deal with her later."

Her phone vibrated suddenly, startling her.

When she saw Dominic's name on the caller ID, her anger evaporated instantly.

She nearly answered immediately but stopped herself. This was their first phone call - she needed to play it cool.

Letting it ring twenty seconds, she finally answered. "Hello?" she purred.

"Ms. Prescott. Are you free for dinner tonight?" Dominic's deep voice sent shivers down her spine.

She considered playing hard to get but remembered Dominic's notorious impatience. What if he never called again?

"I'd love to," she gushed. "My commercial shoot wraps at 5:30." 

"Perfect. Restaurant Nine at 6:30." 

"Dominic, could you—" 

The line went dead before she could ask him to pick her up. She wanted everyone to see the powerful Dominic Blackwood arriving for her.

Still, excitement bubbled inside her. This was progress. If he was giving her a chance, she'd make sure he never looked back.

"Is that your boyfriend?" the makeup artist cooed. "His voice is dreamy!"

"Yes," Lillian preened. "And he's absolutely perfect in every way."

The artist applied blush carefully. "Someone as stunning as you deserves only the best. He must be incredibly successful."

Lillian pretended to be modest but couldn't hide her smirk. "Oh, many powerful men have pursued me. But my heart belongs to Dominic Blackwood, CEO of T Corporation. I don't ask for much - just his devotion."

The makeup artist gasped. "The Dominic Blackwood? Every woman in the city dreams of him! And he's never involved in scandals. You're so lucky - only a man of his status deserves you!"

Flushed with pleasure, Lillian promoted the woman to her personal makeup artist on the spot.

For the rest of the day, she floated on cloud nine, Evelyn completely forgotten. She could barely focus, counting down the minutes until her date.

Meanwhile at T Corporation...

Evelyn and Olivia entered the design department to find colleagues whispering and staring. Some pointed openly while others shot pitying looks.

Evelyn's stomach twisted. Why was everyone acting so strangely?

Groups of male coworkers huddled together, glancing at their phones then at her. Their expressions ranged from shock to mockery.

Only Abigail looked genuinely concerned.

Though Dominic had acted quickly, some employees had seen the article. Their judgmental stares made Evelyn's skin crawl.

She ignored them, greeting Abigail before sitting at her desk.

Bernadette sauntered over, makeup caked thickly. "Who knew our little Evelyn was so... adventurous?" she sneered. "All those foreign men must have been quite the experience. Tell me, how many does it take to satisfy you? You're quite the celebrity now!"

A male colleague chimed in lewdly, "I would've never guessed from her innocent act. Bet she's a real wildcat in bed—"

Evelyn's cheeks burned with anger. She fixed them with an icy glare. "I've respected you as my superior, but if you continue this harassment, don't blame me for what happens next."

Bernadette fake-gasped, clutching her chest. She pulled up photos on her phone. "The evidence is right here! Look at that disgusting face - clearly you couldn't get enough!"
###Chapter 477

Evelyn glanced at the photos on Bernadette's phone.

A cold laugh escaped her lips. "This is what you wanted to show me? Some poorly edited pictures? Do you honestly believe that's me in those photos? With today's deepfake technology, anyone can create fake evidence. The article itself is riddled with factual errors. Are you really that naive?"

As Bernadette fumbled with her phone, searching for a comeback, Evelyn continued sharply. "Haven't you noticed something else? Every account sharing that trash article got suspended. Can you even open the link now? No. Know why? Because it's libelous slander. Mr. Blackwood already filed legal complaints. Anyone spreading this nonsense will face consequences."

Olivia glared at Bernadette, then at the eavesdropping male colleague.

Bernadette's pulse quickened. Panic set in.

She'd heard from Vivienne that Evelyn had publicly rejected Dominic's proposal, humiliating the Blackwood family. Given Dominic's ruthless reputation, Bernadette assumed Evelyn would be discarded immediately. That's why she'd dared to confront her so boldly.

She never expected Dominic would still protect Evelyn after the scandal. Had she known, she wouldn't have opened her big mouth.

The male colleague was sweating bullets too.

Considered handsome with decent design skills, he enjoyed playing hard-to-get with female coworkers. He'd thought Evelyn was pure - discovering her alleged promiscuity intrigued him. He'd even considered offering money for her services.

Now realizing his boss still defended her despite the rumors, he regretted speaking up. It had taken years to climb the corporate ladder. One careless comment could ruin everything.

Other colleagues silently thanked their restraint.

Until facts emerged, silence was safest.

Though frightened, Bernadette wasn't done. Her voice softened but dripped venom. "How pretentious! Everyone knows you came from nothing. Who wouldn't believe you sold yourself abroad? Need me to connect you with some wealthy clients again, Evelyn?"

She turned to the male employees. "Next time you're... in need, why go elsewhere? We've got our own department whore. Cleaner and cheaper than streetwalkers!"

Several jealous female coworkers burst into laughter.

Evelyn had joined later but outperformed them in looks and skills. She blocked their promotions. Seeing her humiliated delighted them.

The men exchanged lewd glances but stayed silent, not wanting trouble.

Only Gregory spoke up. "Do you actually believe tabloid trash, Bernadette? If it were true, why was it deleted? We've worked with Evelyn long enough to know her character. Judging someone from edited photos is beyond immature."

Bernadette flushed with anger. "Defending her, Gregory? Didn't know you two were so close. Or is there something more between—"

Evelyn slammed design files onto the desk. "Enough!" Her voice cut like ice. "Spread one more libelous word, Bernadette Worthing, and we'll settle this in court. Section 246 of the Criminal Code imposes three years for defamation through fabricated facts. Have personal issues with me? Say it to my face. But slander me again, and my lawyer will handle you."

Her commanding tone reminded everyone of Dominic Blackwood himself. Bernadette shut her mouth.

"Hmph, I didn't make it up! Blame that Rita woman!" Bernadette shot Evelyn a nervous glance before barking at gawking employees. "What are you staring at? Back to work!"

She scurried to her office like a frightened mouse.

The gossip died instantly. Work resumed.

Evelyn massaged her temples, forcing calm. Anger wasn't good for the baby.

Olivia and Abigail comforted her until she relaxed. She turned her focus to architect certification materials.

Though holding a master's in engineering economics, she lacked the required two years' experience, including one year managing construction projects.

After nearly a year at T Corporation overseeing designs and projects, she'd qualify in two months.

The certification was invaluable - only 400,000 certified architects existed nationally. It was essential for advancing at T Corporation.

After work...

Dominic drove Evelyn home, brushing his lips against her cheek. "Sorry, I have to go out. You and the kids eat first. I won't be late."

She knew it was another "date" with Lillian. Agony twisted her heart, but she forced a smile, straightening his tie. "Alright. Come home soon."
###Chapter 478

Dominic sensed Evelyn's unease. He pulled her close, his arms wrapping around her petite frame as if trying to merge their bodies together. "It's just temporary. This will pass soon."

A soft smile touched Evelyn's lips.

She rose on her toes, pressing a gentle kiss to his mouth. "We'll be waiting for you."

Dominic lowered his head, his lips brushing against the delicate curve of Evelyn's neck.

Then he was gone.

From the second-floor window, Evelyn watched the Bentley disappear down the driveway. A hollow feeling settled in her chest.

The thought of Dominic's "date" with Lillian Prescott made her skin crawl.

Logically, she knew it was just an act. But logic did little to ease the knot in her stomach.

Right now, patience was their only option to resolve the CD scandal.

Lillian adjusted her designer sunglasses, humming as she parked her Lamborghini near Restaurant Nine that evening.

Just as she stepped out in her thousand-dollar heels, a shadowy figure collapsed in front of her car with a dramatic wail. "Ah! You hit me! This rich bitch is trying to kill a poor man!"

Lillian froze. A filthy, disheveled man lay sprawled before her bumper, fake blood smeared on his arms and legs.

There was something disturbingly familiar about his face.

She'd been driving at walking speed. This was clearly a setup.

Normally, she'd have put this scammer in his place. But she couldn't afford to be late for her date with Dominic.

Snatching a wad of cash from her purse, she flung it at him. "Take this and disappear before I call the cops!"

The man's grimy hands scrambled for the money. When he looked up, recognition flashed in his eyes.

Abandoning his act, he lunged forward and grabbed her leg. "My daughter! My precious girl! Lillian, I've searched for you everywhere! Look how you live in luxury while your own father starves! Where's your filial piety?"

Lillian recoiled as if burned. This couldn't be happening.

The homeless man's face suddenly clicked - Donovan Sinclair, the stalker who'd been harassing her.

"Release me! You've mistaken me for someone else!" She kicked at him, revolted by his touch. "Keep this up and I'll have you eliminated!"

But Donovan clung like a leech. "No mistake! You're the spitting image of your mother Susanna. That birthmark under your left arm proves it! Everyone knows Jonathan Prescott adopted his daughter from an orphanage. Take my DNA if you don't believe me!"

The mention of her birthmark made Lillian's blood run cold. She needed to get that removed ASAP.

As for Donovan... she'd deal with him permanently.

More cars were arriving for dinner service. She couldn't risk being seen with this human trash.

Grabbing another stack of bills, she threw them at his face. "Here's your blood money! Now vanish! If you approach me again, my father Jonathan will bury you alive!"

"Such a dutiful daughter!" Donovan cackled, too busy gathering cash to notice her threat. "Don't worry, I won't bother you... unless I need more money!"

Lillian slipped away while he was distracted, her stomach churning with disgust.

What was she going to do about this so-called "father"?
###Chapter 479  

Lillian had chosen a white dress, believing it made her appear angelic and virtuous.  

Someone once told her she resembled a blooming lily when dressed in white.  

On the way to the restaurant, Donovan had accidentally stained Lillian's dress.  

Though the mark was barely noticeable, Lillian, ever the perfectionist, stopped at the boutique next door.  

She purchased an entirely new outfit.  

After changing, Lillian arrived at Restaurant Nine, but Dominic hadn't shown up yet.  

Seated by the window in the lavish restaurant, she gazed at the city lights, her beautiful face etched with discontent.  

Normally, the man would be the one waiting for the woman.  

Yet here she was, having made the reservation herself, sitting alone like some desperate fool. The injustice of it stung.  

Lillian wore an elegant yellow cocktail dress. Paired with her alluring makeup, she looked like a vision under the soft restaurant lighting.  

Her delicate features carried a hint of vulnerability, the kind that made men want to protect her.  

She had deliberately chosen a table in the open instead of a private room.  

First, because she wanted her beauty to be admired. Second, because if she and Dominic were seen together, it would make headlines by morning.  

Exactly as she intended.  

Half an hour later, Dominic finally arrived.  

He spotted Lillian by the window, chin resting on her hand, lost in thought. Approaching quietly, he took the seat across from her.  

"Apologies, Ms. Prescott," he said smoothly. "Work has been relentless lately. I didn’t mean to keep you waiting."  

He pulled out the chair and sat, every inch the aristocratic gentleman—cold, composed, effortlessly captivating.  

The moment Lillian saw him, her earlier irritation melted away. The world seemed brighter, colors more vivid, just because he was in it.  

He was like sunlight after a storm, reviving her parched spirit.  

Just being near him made her feel alive.  

She smiled sweetly. "It’s no trouble at all. I just got here myself."  

Even if she’d waited an hour, she would’ve gladly waited all night just to see him.  

Dominic masked the ice in his gaze with a polite smile. "What would you like to order? Shall I call for the menu?"  

Lillian tilted her head thoughtfully. "I’m not picky. You can choose whatever you prefer."  

The more she looked at him, the more his sharp features mesmerized her.  

Dominic chuckled lightly. "Nonsense. Surely you have favorites, Ms. Prescott. Order whatever you like—don’t hold back on my account."  

He had no intention of eating. Even if this place served ambrosia, he wouldn’t stomach a bite across from her.  

If not for his ulterior motives, he wouldn’t waste a second on this charade.  

All he wanted was to go home—to Evelyn and the children.  

Evelyn’s cooking, simple as it was, surpassed any gourmet meal. These days, with her pregnancy, they’d hired chefs to ease her burden, but she still cooked for them sometimes.  

Those family dinners were what he truly cherished.  

Lillian blinked at his refusal but quickly recovered, her smile widening. "Dominic, we’ve known each other so long. Must you still call me 'Ms. Prescott'? Just 'Lillian' is fine."  

She leaned forward slightly. "I’ve dined here before with my parents. The food is exquisite. Why don’t you tell me your preferences, and I’ll order for you?"  

Dominic met her gaze evenly. "That’s kind of you, Ms. Prescott, but I have no particular tastes. Please, order as you wish."  

Lillian’s smile tightened.  

He still refused to call her by her first name.  

Yet he’d never referred to Evelyn as "Ms. Sinclair." The double standard grated on her.  

But it was this very arrogance that drew her in.  

Patience, she reminded herself. Evelyn would be out of the picture soon.  

The thought soothed her irritation.  

To avoid awkwardness, Lillian placed their order—small, delicate portions of the restaurant’s finest dishes.  

The waiter returned swiftly with their food, then discreetly retreated.  

Lillian picked at her meal, stealing glances at Dominic, who barely touched his drink.  

Seizing the moment, she ventured, "Dominic… what happened between you and Ms. Sinclair? I heard she called off the engagement. I always thought you two were so in love."  

Her wide, innocent eyes hid her true intent.  

Internally, Dominic scoffed. Outwardly, he shrugged. "These things happen. Perhaps my flaws made her insecure. She chose to leave."  

Lillian sighed sympathetically. "If she wants to go, let her. She’s losing an incredible man. Half the women in this city would kill to marry you." She smiled coyly. "One tree falls, but the forest remains."  

Dominic’s lashes lowered, shadowing his cold gaze. "Does that forest include you, Ms. Prescott?"  

He had no interest in forests.  

His heart had been barren for years—until Evelyn took root there. Fragile yet stubborn, she’d brought life to his wasteland.  

Lillian was testing him. He knew it.  

So he met her eyes, his voice cool. "Some forests aren’t worth the trees."  

One day soon, she’d pay for her games.
###Chapter 480  

At the dinner table, Lillian gazed at Dominic, utterly mesmerized. She completely missed the icy chill in his piercing gaze.  

With practiced shyness, she murmured, "That's hardly surprising. No woman could resist your magnetism. A man of your intellect must know how I feel about you. It was love at first sight—deep and genuine."  

Dominic masked his disdain behind a neutral expression. "Flattered, Ms. Prescott. I'm unworthy of such affection."  

He checked his watch—nearly 8 PM. Evelyn would be waiting anxiously.  

"Ms. Prescott, are you finished? I have pressing matters to attend to." His tone left no room for argument. "Until next time."  

Lillian bit back her frustration, forcing a nod. "Of course. Duty calls." She knew patience was key in conquering Dominic Blackwood. Push too hard, and everything would crumble.  

Dominic drove her home.  

The entire ride, Lillian's heart fluttered like a trapped butterfly. Every glance at his sharp profile under the streetlights sent shivers down her spine—the perfect blend of elegance and raw power.  

To her, he was sculpted by divine hands.  

Silence stretched between them until the car halted outside the Prescott estate.  

"Thank you for tonight," she breathed, unfastening her seatbelt.  

Before he could react, she leaned in, pressing a fleeting kiss to his cheek. Then she bolted from the car, slamming the door behind her.  

Heart racing, she touched her burning cheeks. She'd never been so bold.  

But the night had felt... magical.  

Time would erode his attachment to Evelyn. Men clung to the past for two reasons: insufficient time, or inadequate replacements.  

Lillian was more than adequate.  

---  

Inside the car, Dominic grabbed a disinfectant wipe, scrubbing his cheek raw. Disgust twisted his features.  

That woman was a necessary pawn in his game. Otherwise, he'd have made her regret breathing.  

---  

The Prescott residence glowed warmly.  

Genevieve sat knitting when Lillian floated in, radiant. "Mom! I'm falling in love!"  

Genevieve set down her needles. "Really? Who is he? Bring him home!"  

Lillian hugged her, evading details. "Not yet. But you'll adore him."  

Genevieve stroked her hair. "Sweetheart, looks fade. Character matters most."  

"I know! He's perfect."  

Suspicion crept in. "It's not... Dominic Blackwood, is he?"  

Lillian stiffened.  

Genevieve sighed. "Men like him are emotional fortresses. You deserve better."  

Irritation flared. "I know what I'm doing!"  

Genevieve relented, unaware she'd just widened the rift between them.  

---  

Meanwhile, Evelyn sat frozen on the carpet, an unread book in her lap.  

Her phone buzzed—Olivia and Abigail's messages piled up. She replied mechanically, her mind elsewhere.  

8:30 PM. No Dominic.  

Her stomach churned imagining him laughing with Lillian over wine.  

Damn his unfairly gorgeous face. If only he were plain, life would be simpler.  

The door burst open.  

Cold air rushed in as Dominic strode through, moonlight outlining his frame.  

Evelyn turned away, storming off—but he caught her wrist, spinning her back.  

He pinned her against the wall, his body caging hers.
###Chapter 481

Evelyn's phone clattered to the floor with a sharp crack.

In the group chat, Olivia kept bombarding Evelyn with messages. [Eve? What's wrong? Are you fighting with Dominic again?]

The constant pinging annoyed Dominic. He reached down and powered off Evelyn's phone.

"Let me go." Evelyn found herself pinned against the wall by Dominic. She struggled carefully, mindful of the baby growing inside her.

Dominic felt a mix of frustration and amusement watching her squirm like a restless kitten in his arms.

He pressed his palms against her shoulders and tilted her chin up. "Throwing another tantrum, little wildcat?"

Evelyn kicked his shin and glared. "You liar. How was your romantic dinner with Lillian?"

Dominic nearly choked at her accusation. Without warning, he scooped her up and marched toward their bedroom.

His arms cradled not just his wife, but their unborn child as well.

With a teasing smirk, he said, "If dating other women was so enjoyable, would I be rushing home to you? Stop pouting or else..."

The bedroom door swung open as Dominic kicked it. He sat on the bed with Evelyn securely in his lap.

Seeing her still sulking, he chuckled. "Still upset? You look just like Isabella when we deny her sweets. I never realized our daughter inherited that pout from you. I wonder if this little one will too."

Evelyn's anger wavered, a reluctant laugh escaping her lips.

Then she caught the unfamiliar floral scent clinging to his clothes. Her nose wrinkled. "Smooth talker. You had dinner with Lillian but come home reeking of perfume. What really happened?"

Pregnancy hormones made Evelyn paranoid. Dominic might be honorable, but Lillian was cunning...

Reasoning with a pregnant woman proved challenging. 

Lillian had drenched herself in that overpowering perfume at dinner. Dominic had endured the cloying scent all evening - absolute torture! How could Evelyn understand?

With a sigh, he wrapped his arms around her, gazing at her troubled expression. "Don't overthink this, Eve. You're tormenting us both."

Evelyn suddenly bit his forearm. "This is your punishment."

Dominic knew she needed to vent. He offered his arm willingly, knowing she'd regret it later.

The first bites were fierce, but soon Evelyn couldn't bear to hurt him further.

Dominic pulled her closer. "Silly girl, I'd never betray you. You're my soul. Don't accuse me of things I haven't done. It's my fault - I'll never dine with another woman again. No more letting other women's perfume cling to me. No business drinks without you. My phone stays on 24/7 for you. No more making you feel insecure... Darling, please don't be angry?"

Evelyn studied him. "You're dangerously charming - in business and with women."

Her words ignited something in Dominic. With her soft body in his lap, her breath warm against his skin, desire surged through him.

They hadn't been intimate since her pregnancy began.

Suppressing his urges, he patted her back. "I've never lied to you, and I never will. Don't push me away, love. We've fought too hard for this happiness."

Evelyn melted against his strong shoulders, soothed by his tenderness.

She realized how unreasonable she'd become. Once so rational and composed, now she threw jealous tantrums like a lovesick girl.

She adored when Dominic calmed her with his velvet voice, when he looked at her with that indulgent gaze...

Love had changed her.

Falling in love really did make fools of women.

Was she turning into one of those clingy wives?

Lost in thought, Evelyn suddenly felt weightless as Dominic lifted her.

She instinctively wrapped her arms around his neck. "It's bedtime. What are you doing?"

Dominic nuzzled her forehead. "We're taking a shower together."

He couldn't stand Lillian's cloying perfume on his skin. Though he'd avoided physical contact, the scent clung stubbornly. He needed to wash every trace of that woman away.

Dominic pressed the pearl button on the wall, activating the bath's automated system. By the time they reached the bathroom, steaming water would await them.

Evelyn gave a soft hum.

Though staff could assist, Evelyn preferred privacy. She'd never adjusted to aristocratic luxuries.

But Dominic was different - he was hers.

Soon, the oversized tub filled with warm water.

Dominic carefully removed Evelyn's pajamas and lowered her into the bath.

Then he undressed and joined her.

Evelyn sat in one corner, her slight baby bump barely visible beneath the water.

The water nearly covered her entirely. Her pale skin glowed pink beneath the surface. Droplets clung to her long lashes as she gazed at him with clear eyes - the sight made his blood run hot.

Dominic's throat tightened. His brows furrowed, lips pressing into a thin line. His hungry expression clearly said one thing: I want you.
###Chapter 482

Evelyn studied Dominic's ravenous expression and shivered.

She nearly refused, but then caught the pleading look in his eyes.

That uniquely vulnerable gaze only a man could master.

"It's been three months, Evie. The doctor cleared us after three months. I swear I'll be gentle."

To the world, he was the ruthless Ice King. To her? A starving puppy. The contrast made Evelyn's lips twitch.

She remembered all those cold showers Dominic endured these past months. Finally, she relented.

Sliding her arms around his neck, she whispered, "Alright..."

Dominic nipped at her earlobe. "I'd never harm you or our baby."

His restraint was remarkable. Evelyn felt his desperate hunger tempered with exquisite tenderness. She floated on clouds of pleasure.

Late that night.

Moonlight spilled into the bathroom where their passion had lasted hours. When Dominic carried her back to bed, they collapsed together.

He pulled Evelyn flush against him, pressing her palm to his pounding heart. "No matter what happens, this beats only for you. Wherever I am, my heart stays with you. I love you too much to ever hurt you."

Evelyn felt the erratic rhythm beneath her fingers.

She'd been unreasonable earlier. Knowing Dominic's act was just that, she'd still thrown a fit. Guilt gnawed at her.

Noticing her expression, Dominic tapped her nose. "Hungry? I'll have supper prepared." 

Now that he mentioned it... "A little." Pregnancy had amplified her appetite.

Dominic summoned the staff. Within minutes, a tray arrived. He lifted a forkful of cake. "Open up. Your favorite."

Evelyn hesitated, recalling an online article. "Maybe something lighter? Too much sugar isn't good for the baby."

Dominic arched a brow.

"That article said excess sweets cause fetal macrosomia and gestational diabetes," she explained.

Dominic chuckled. "Where do you find this nonsense?"

"The internet. I've been researching pregnancy guidelines."

He shook his head. "Consult Julian if you have concerns. This cake was specially formulated by our nutritionist. Low sugar, perfectly safe."

Touched by his thoughtfulness, Evelyn took a bite. The creamy dessert melted on her tongue, deliciously sweet yet light.

The sweetness wasn't just in the cake—her heart swelled with it. She offered Dominic a bite. "Try it."

Though he disliked sweets, her radiant smile convinced him. "Mmm. Very sweet indeed."

He meant her, of course. Thinking he referred to the cake, Evelyn agreed. "Obviously."

After she finished one slice, Dominic stopped her from taking another. "That's enough for tonight. You'll sleep better." 

Evelyn obediently set down the fork, brushed her teeth, then curled against him. A soft kiss to his cheek, then she settled to sleep.

Dominic captured her lips in a searing kiss. "Evie, forgive me for earlier. Still upset? Hit me." He guided her fist toward his chest.

Evelyn pulled back, breathing in his familiar scent. "I forgave you hours ago. We shouldn't sleep angry. I overreacted—no need for apologies."

Dominic held her close, thinking, My sweetest burden.

Blackwood Manor.

Lillian arrived early, artfully made up to appear youthful and innocent. 

She presented Reginald Blackwood with an antique pipe and premium tea leaves. For Beatrice, exquisite jewelry and designer handbags.

Her calculated generosity delighted them.

Reginald puffed his new pipe. "Such thoughtful gifts! You're always welcome here."

Lillian's eyes sparkled. "Your happiness is my pleasure."

Beatrice fawned over the glittering gems. "Visit more often! Dominic needs a virtuous beauty like you. What a perfect daughter-in-law you'd make!"

Masking her cunning, Lillian probed, "Aunt Beatrice, what really happened at the engagement? Why was it canceled?"

Beatrice's face darkened. "That Evelyn Sinclair humiliated us! Everything was perfect until she backed out. As if my son isn't the catch! Don't worry—if you marry Dominic, those twins will stay here. They won't bother you. And when Evelyn delivers the third baby, it'll live here too. No burdens for you."

What? Evelyn's pregnant again? 

Lillian nearly bolted from her seat.
###Chapter 483  

Evelyn noticed the shock in Lillian's eyes and realized she had no clue about the pregnancy.  

She mentally kicked herself. Why did I have to blurt that out?  

What if this ruins everything between Lillian and Dominic?  

Evelyn leaned back on the couch, taking Lillian's delicate hand in hers. "The baby was completely unplanned. None of us expected Bernadette to pull such a stunt before the wedding. But don't worry—the Blackwood family has more than enough resources. One more child won't make a difference. The staff and I will handle everything so it doesn’t interfere with your life together."  

She spoke so dismissively of Bernadette that she conveniently forgot she’d done the same thing—using a pregnancy to force her way into the family.  

Reginald Blackwood coughed sharply at her words.  

Evelyn immediately fell silent, but Lillian, still reeling, didn’t catch the exchange.  

The news of Bernadette’s pregnancy felt like a knife twisting in Lillian’s chest.  

Yet she forced a smile, feigning grace. "You’re too kind, Aunt Evelyn. Any woman would be lucky to marry Dominic. I adore children—they’re sweet, innocent, and bring so much joy to a home. The more, the merrier!"  

"What a wonderful girl. Genevieve raised you well. You’re just like her," Evelyn said approvingly, though her tone carried a hidden edge.  

To Evelyn, Lillian was perfect—beautiful, poised, generous. She even brought thoughtful gifts. A far cry from that scheming Bernadette.  

Lillian demurred, "You flatter me, Aunt Evelyn. I’m nothing compared to Mother. She’s a true lady. I still have so much to learn."  

The mention of Genevieve made Evelyn’s expression darken.  

She remembered Genevieve in their youth—radiant, kind, effortlessly elegant. Men flocked to her, heirs and politicians alike, while Evelyn struggled to keep their attention.  

Then Jonathan Prescott, the handsome son of a high-ranking official, fell for Genevieve at first sight and never looked back.  

Meanwhile, Evelyn became a revolving door for wealthy men who used her and discarded her. The humiliation festered.  

That’s why she did what she did.  

Now, seeing Genevieve raise another woman’s daughter as her own while her biological child was ridiculed and reduced to a broodmare for her son?  

Poetic justice.  

With a smirk, Evelyn said, "Yes, your mother certainly raised an exceptional daughter."  

Lillian knew Evelyn and Genevieve had once been close, but their friendship had mysteriously soured.  

She’d hoped to mend bridges, but Evelyn’s reaction told her to drop the subject.  

Glancing at the clock, she stood. "Aunt Evelyn, I’m afraid I have an engagement. Reginald, I’ll visit again soon."  

"Stay a little longer," Evelyn urged, gripping her wrist. "Dominic will be home any minute—let him drive you."  

Under normal circumstances, Lillian would’ve waited. But she had urgent business.  

"Another time. It’s getting late."  

"Next time, call ahead. I’ll send a car for you," Evelyn said, admiring the bracelet Lillian had gifted her.  

Reginald wished her a safe trip before retreating upstairs.  

Lillian sped away in her luxury car, dialing a number as she merged onto the highway.  

Ten minutes later, she hung up, her eyes glinting with malice.  

How dare Bernadette carry Dominic’s child?  

She thinks a baby will secure her place?  

Let’s see if she lives long enough to deliver it.  

---  

Meanwhile, in the secluded mansion Dominic had purchased, Bernadette was under virtual house arrest.  

The scandal at the engagement party and Dominic’s overprotectiveness had forced her into hiding.  

The estate was lavish—gardens, fountains, even a private waterfall. Security was impenetrable. Her twins visited often, but after weeks of isolation, boredom gnawed at her.  

That morning, as she helped Alexander and Isabella with homework, her aunt Gwendolyn called.  

Reginald Sinclair was ill and asking for her.  

Guilt twisted Bernadette’s stomach. She’d only called her grandfather and aunt sporadically to reassure them.  

Now, without waiting for Dominic, she texted him and had her assigned driver rush her to the Sinclair estate.  

---  

Lillian had been unraveling for days.  

Overnight, her scandals had exploded across every major news outlet—tantrums on set, stunt doubles, green-screen fraud.  

But worse?  

Her orphanage past—how she’d framed Scarlett, her desperate attempts to bury her origins.  

Her pristine image was crumbling.  

She begged her father to suppress the stories, but they resurfaced faster than he could squash them.  

Whoever was behind this wasn’t afraid of Jonathan Prescott.  

Then, the private investigator finally called.  

A slow, venomous smile spread across Lillian’s face as she hung up.  

Found you, Bernadette.  

This time, she wouldn’t come back.
###Chapter 484

The weekend had arrived. As Evelyn prepared to leave, the twins clung to her, begging to tag along.

Concern for her grandfather left no room for negotiation. With no time to console them, she had no choice but to take Alexander and Isabella with her.

Their car pulled into the parking lot near Centercourt Plaza. Strapped in her car seat, Isabella suddenly whimpered, "Mommy, my tummy hurts. I need the bathroom..."

She'd ignored Evelyn's warnings last night and eaten too much honeydew melon.

Seeing her daughter's pained expression, Evelyn instructed Sebastian to park. She left him with Alexander while taking Isabella to the mall restroom.

Ten minutes later, they emerged.

Hand in hand, they waited at the crosswalk, oblivious to the danger lurking nearby.

Lillian Prescott sat in an unmarked vehicle, her dark eyes fixed on the woman holding Isabella's hand.

It was definitely Evelyn.

After months of Dominic hiding her away, here she was - exposed in public.

To Lillian, Evelyn would always be trash. An orphan with a dead father, imprisoned stepmother, and burdensome grandfather. Yet this nobody had stolen what rightfully belonged to her.

Every memory of Dominic doting on Evelyn made Lillian's blood boil.

The simmering rage had become unbearable. She'd plotted endlessly to drive Evelyn from the city.

Now, discovering Evelyn's pregnancy, Lillian needed her gone immediately.

The child clinging to Evelyn's hand was Isabella - Dominic's precious daughter.

Dressed in matching outfits, their identical eyes left no doubt about their relationship. The resemblance was uncanny.

Lillian's hands clenched the steering wheel.

Though media reports claimed Evelyn was the twins' biological mother, Lillian had refused to believe it.

But seeing them together forced the bitter truth upon her.

Now Evelyn carried another of Dominic's children. The injustice fueled Lillian's hatred. Who was this gutter rat to bear his heirs?

She would marry Dominic and have his legitimate children. Evelyn's bastard would never compete with hers for affection or inheritance!

As the traffic light changed, Lillian made a call.

A single "Understood" answered before she hung up.

She snapped the SIM card and tossed it away.

Evelyn chatted with Isabella as they crossed, unaware of the black sedan with fake plates tailing them.

The car followed steadily as they left the crowded streets for a quieter alley.

The private parking lot lay just ahead. Engrossed in conversation, neither noticed their stalker.

Halfway down the alley, the sedan suddenly accelerated.

Few pedestrians shared the space. One screamed as the car barreled toward Evelyn.

The shriek pierced the air.

Evelyn turned - just in time to see death approaching.

Instinct took over. With no time to save herself, she shoved Isabella to safety.

The impact sent Evelyn flying like a broken doll. She skidded across pavement, arms instinctively cradling her belly.

But crimson already stained the cobblestones.

"Mommy!"

Isabella's terrified wails filled the air. The child knelt beside her mother, tiny hands hovering helplessly over the spreading blood.

Bystanders gathered quickly.

"Madam! Alexander!"

Sebastian and Alexander came running at the commotion.

Good Samaritans rushed to help while others called for aid.

The hit-and-run driver wore a hat pulled low. Seeing Evelyn's motionless form, he smirked before speeding away.

Alexander memorized every detail of the fleeing vehicle. Rage transformed the usually cheerful boy's features.

Sebastian dialed emergency services with shaking hands. When he moved to lift Evelyn, Alexander stopped him. "Don't touch her! I'm calling Dad."

Though his voice remained steady, sweat beaded on the child's forehead.

Kneeling beside his mother, Alexander's small hands trembled as he explained the situation to Dominic.

He knew it was bad. His teacher had warned never to move accident victims with unknown injuries.

Terror gripped him - the fear of loss overwhelming for one so young.

But he couldn't lose her.

Alexander clenched his fists, his normally bright eyes now mirroring Dominic's icy determination.

The ambulance arrived swiftly.

Dominic, mid-billion-dollar negotiation, abandoned everything when Alexander called. The news of Evelyn's accident turned his world upside down.
###Chapter 485

The sterile hospital corridors reeked of antiseptic.

Every second counted as Evelyn's life hung by a thread.

The operating room doors swung open abruptly.

Dominic and the twins rushed toward the white-coated physician, desperation in their voices as they demanded answers about Evelyn's condition.

Alexander's small frame tensed visibly, his breath caught in his throat while awaiting the doctor's verdict.

The middle-aged physician removed his mask with grave finality. "Who's the patient's next of kin? She requires immediate surgery and we need family consent!"

"Doctor, I'm just her employee," Sebastian said anxiously. "The children are too young to consent. Mr. Blackwood is en route. Could you operate first and get his signature upon arrival?"

Time was slipping away, but without proper authorization, the medical team's hands were tied.

Alexander asked with unsettling calm for a child, "How serious is my mother's condition? What procedures does she need?"

The doctor marveled at the boy's composure before delivering the devastating news. "We must terminate the pregnancy immediately and perform a uterine curettage. Worse still, your mother's leg injuries are beyond repair - we must amputate to prevent fatal infection."

The words struck like physical blows.

Alexander's face drained of color while Isabella's silent tears stopped mid-stream. Even Sebastian stood frozen.

Their unborn sibling would be lost. Their mother might never walk again.

"Decide quickly," the doctor urged. "Every minute worsens her prognosis."

Isabella tugged at the doctor's coat, her swollen eyes pleading. "Please save Mommy's baby! Don't take her legs! This is all my fault..."

The physician could only pat her head sorrowfully. "Without surgery, your mother will die."

Alexander's jaw set with determination. "We'll wait for Father. He'll find a way." He immediately called Dominic again.

Stuck in gridlock, Dominic nearly rammed through traffic after hearing his son's report. "Put the doctor on," he demanded.

Once the physician explained the dire situation, Dominic's response shocked him. "Save the baby if possible, but my wife keeps her legs!"

"But Mr. Blackwood, without amputation-"

"Can you guarantee her survival for twenty-four hours? Yes or no?"

The surgeon hesitated. "We can stabilize her, but delaying will-"

"Then do it. I'll be there in ten minutes." Dominic knew Evelyn's perfectionist nature - she'd rather die than live disabled.

Hanging up, he immediately dialed another number. "Julian, drop everything and get to A City now!"

When traffic became hopeless, Dominic abandoned his car mid-street and sprinted toward the distant hospital.

Bursting into ICU, he found Evelyn barely recognizable - tubes snaking from her pale form, blood matting her hair against the pillow.

She looked like a dying flower, petals moments from crumbling.
###Chapter 486

Dominic inhaled the metallic scent of blood mixed with antiseptic.

His powerful frame trembled momentarily as weakness overtook him.

Sitting vigil beside Evelyn's hospital bed, his long fingers shook visibly as they brushed through her blood-streaked hair.

When his touch moved lower, Dominic traced the cold pallor of Evelyn's delicate face. The unnatural whiteness made her dark lashes appear even darker against her skin.

"Abortion... curettage... hysterectomy..."

The doctor's clinical terms echoed in his mind. Dominic's hands clenched into fists as the horrific image of Evelyn being struck by the car replayed behind his eyes.

This woman he cherished above all others - the treasure he guarded with obsessive care - now lay broken before him like a dying flower, her life hanging by a thread.

The fragile figure on the bed looked heartbreakingly small and vulnerable.

Dominic gently cradled Evelyn's limp hand. Her fingers felt unnaturally cold from blood loss, refusing to warm despite his desperate grip.

There was no answering squeeze, no playful tracing of circles on his palm like she used to do.

Memories collided with cruel reality, shattering Dominic's composure. His breathing grew ragged with suppressed emotion.

Just hours earlier, she'd texted him about her plans. Now she lay here, battered and barely alive. The injustice of it fueled his simmering rage.

Sebastian observed Dominic's stormy expression before speaking cautiously. "Mr. Blackwood, the hit-and-run driver escaped. We're still determining if it was drunk driving or..."

Dominic's glacial glare cut him off. "Mobilize every resource. Find that bastard - I don't care what it takes!"

Sebastian nodded sharply. More than just a driver, he was former special forces recruited specifically to protect Evelyn.

After receiving further instructions, Sebastian left to investigate the suspicious accident.

"Daddy..." Small voices pulled Dominic from his dark thoughts. Alexander and Isabella stood beside him, their young faces etched with fear as they stared at their unconscious mother.

Isabella burst into fresh tears, clutching Dominic's leg. "It's my fault! If I didn't get a stomachache... if we didn't have to stop... Mommy wouldn't be hurt! Punish me instead, Daddy!"

Her delicate face flushed from crying, the little girl gripped her father's hand desperately.

Dominic gathered his sobbing daughter close, pressing his forehead against hers to hide his own anguish. "This wasn't your fault, sweetheart. Your mother would hate seeing you blame yourself."

Isabella, who bore such striking resemblance to Evelyn, had always held a special place in Dominic's heart.

Even if their daughter's needs had indirectly led to the accident, he refused to let her bear that guilt. She was just a child.

After long minutes, Isabella's tears finally subsided. She gazed at Evelyn with heartbreaking hope. "When will Mommy wake up? I want to say sorry..."

"Mommy needs rest. It might take time." Dominic's voice strained as he studied Evelyn's frightening stillness.

Her unresponsiveness felt like knives slicing through his nerves. The normally unshakable tycoon found himself drowning in unfamiliar fear.

Alexander stood solemnly by the bed. "Dad... the doctor said they couldn't save the baby. Did we lose our little sibling?"

The twins had often talked to the baby through Evelyn's stomach, delighting in every tiny kick. Now that hope had been cruelly snatched away.

"There will be other chances." Dominic closed his eyes against the pain. No one had wanted this baby more than him - their first child conceived purely from love, not obligation.

He brought Evelyn's cold palm to his lips, whispering hoarsely, "Forgive me, Evie. I failed you."

The hospital had become a grim battlefield that day, thick with tension.

Every medical professional worked with desperate urgency, knowing the consequences of failure. Even the hospital director personally intervened to placate Dominic.

No one dared make mistakes with the notorious Blackwood empire's wrath hanging over them.

At 4 PM, Evelyn's condition suddenly deteriorated. Severe bleeding sent her rushing back to surgery.

Bodyguards cleared the ICU corridors as Dominic watched them wheel his pale, lifeless wife away. At the last moment, he slammed a hand against the operating room doors.

The hospital director nearly collapsed from panic. "Mr. Blackwood, please! We must focus on saving your wife. Any interference could—"

His plea died as Dominic seized him by the collar, lifting him effortlessly.

The billionaire's voice dripped lethal promise. "Listen carefully. If my wife doesn't walk out of here alive, neither will your hospital."
###Chapter 487

The hospital director trembled under Dominic's furious glare, beads of cold sweat forming on his forehead. "Y-yes, Mr. Blackwood. I'll do everything possible to save your wife!"

Dominic's icy stare intensified. "Don't give me possibilities. I demand guarantees."

The director's teeth chattered uncontrollably. "O-of course, Mr. Blackwood..."

As Dominic released his grip, the director scrambled into the emergency room like a frightened rabbit.

The operating lights flickered back to life.

Dominic's powerful frame slumped against the closed doors, his pristine white shirt now stained with Evelyn's blood. The metallic scent filled his nostrils, making his stomach churn.

Each breath came harder than the last, as if invisible hands tightened around his throat.

For twenty-nine years, Dominic had lived in emotional isolation. Work became his only companion in a world devoid of warmth.

Then Evelyn happened.

She brought color to his monochrome existence - her gentle intellect, her radiant smile that could melt glaciers, her quiet strength that anchored him.

Now fate threatened to rip her away.

Dominic's fists clenched until his knuckles turned white. The mighty Dominic Blackwood stood vulnerable outside an operating room, praying to gods he never believed in.

The director emerged again, face ashen. "Mr. Blackwood, we must perform an immediate amputation and terminate the pregnancy. Any delay could be fatal-"

"Wait." Dominic's voice cracked. "My team is arriving."

Though every instinct screamed to consent, he hesitated. Saving Evelyn's life meant condemning her to waking up without their child... without her legs.

Just as Dominic opened his mouth to agree, a familiar arrogant voice cut through the tension. "Amputation? Or is this just your surgical incompetence?"

The director bristled at the insult from the impeccably dressed Julian Whitmore.

Little Alexander and Isabella rushed forward, clinging to Julian's legs. "Uncle Julian!"

Dominic practically dragged Julian toward the OR. "Save her. Both of them. I'm begging you."

Julian's eyebrows shot up at the unprecedented plea. "Relax. You'll have your wife back in perfect condition."

After quick sterilization, Julian disappeared behind the swinging doors.

"Daddy?" Isabella sniffled. "Remember when Uncle Julian saved my bunny? He'll save Mommy too, right?"

Dominic stroked her hair. "Yes, sweetheart. He will."

He had to believe that. Julian wasn't just a doctor - he was the miracle worker who'd revived a bullet-riddled general declared unsalvageable.

Hours crawled by.

The exhausted children refused to leave until Sebastian forcibly escorted them home.

Finally, the OR doors swung open. Julian emerged first, surgical mask dangling around his neck, followed by a team of smiling medical staff...
###Chapter 488

The medical team trailing behind Julian Whitmore regarded him with awe, as if witnessing a miracle worker in action.

Dominic Blackwood's fingers twitched nervously despite his unwavering faith in Julian's expertise.

"How's Evelyn now?" His voice was tight with concern.

Julian stretched lazily, flashing a confident grin. "Relax. I could revive your wife even if Death himself came knocking. Your third child is perfectly safe, and no amputation needed. Satisfied with my work?"

"Thank you, Julian." The gratitude in Dominic's voice was palpable.

This stoic billionaire rarely expressed appreciation. Yet for Evelyn Sinclair, he'd thanked Julian multiple times tonight.

Julian arched an eyebrow. "Well now, that's a first."

Dominic's mood had improved considerably. "Name your price. Within reason, I'll grant any request."

Before Julian could respond, nurses emerged from the OR pushing a gurney.

Evelyn remained unconscious post-surgery.

Dominic's breath hitched. A sharp pang pierced his chest.

He reached to touch her pale cheek, but Julian blocked him.

"Don't." Julian's tone turned serious. "She's fragile right now. Your hands carry bacteria."

Dominic reluctantly lowered his hand. For once, he didn't bristle at Julian's interference.

His delicate wife lay motionless on the stretcher.

The sight tore at his heart.

"Mr. Blackwood, we'll transfer Ms. Sinclair to her room now," a young nurse murmured, casting shy glances between the powerful CEO and his unconscious wife.

Every woman in A City knew their story. While versions varied, none could deny their envy of this modern-day Cinderella.

"I'll do it." Dominic commandeered the gurney, his expression tender as he guided Evelyn down the corridor.

The nursing staff exchanged astonished looks. The infamous ice-cold CEO of T Corporation pushing a hospital gurney? Unthinkable.

Julian shook his head as Dominic disappeared around the corner. The man was hopelessly love-struck. No saving him now.

Night fell over the hospital ward.

Moonlight streamed through the windows, painting the ICU in silver hues.

Only the ventilator's rhythmic hum and Dominic's watchful gaze disturbed the stillness.

Dominic stood vigil by Evelyn's bedside. His shadow, cast by the dim wall light, enveloped her fragile form.

The usually composed tycoon looked haggard. His brows knitted together as he studied Evelyn's parched lips. With meticulous care, he moistened them with a water-soaked swab.

Those lips that usually resembled ripe peaches now looked painfully dry.

After tucking the blankets around her, Dominic lifted her left hand - the one free of IV tubes - and pressed it to his lips.

Her fingernails matched her pallid complexion.

Julian entered with the hospital director in tow.

After exchanging greetings, Julian checked Evelyn's vitals and reviewed her postoperative status.

"Your little fighter's got impressive tenacity," Julian remarked with genuine surprise. "Most pregnancies wouldn't survive such trauma. This one clung on like a champ."

Dominic's hand drifted to the slight swell beneath the blankets. His gaze softened.

Their third child had endured so much before even taking its first breath.

They'd spoil this baby rotten once Evelyn delivered.

"Thank you." Dominic's gratitude was unmistakable. "When will she wake?"

Julian grinned. "Tomorrow, most likely. I'm dead on my feet though - flew straight here after a complex procedure overseas. Two major surgeries back-to-back. How about showing some appreciation, hm? Maybe a kiss—"

"Get out." Dominic's scowl returned.

Julian chuckled. "Typical. Use me and toss me aside. Heartless."

"Dr. Whitmore," the hospital director interjected eagerly, "might I trouble you tomorrow? Just thirty minutes to discuss some medical complexities..."

The renowned director behaved like an eager student around Julian.

The older physician held immense respect for the younger man's skills. That such a talented surgeon remained absent from international conferences baffled him.

Julian offered a polite smile. "No need for formalities, Director. I'm just an ordinary physician. And my surname isn't Whitmore - it's Park."

He'd grown accustomed to being called "Dr. Whitmore" - his middle name. But Park was his true surname.

A name he rarely acknowledged. Those memories belonged buried.

"Your wife's stable now," Julian told Dominic, covering a yawn. "I'm heading home before I collapse. Try not to worry."

The director followed Julian out like an obedient puppy.

Once alone, Dominic's tender expression hardened into something dangerous.

"Whoever dared harm my wife," he murmured to the silent room, "has signed their death warrant."
###Chapter 489

In the hospital.

After sending the twins home, Sebastian returned to the ward. His breath caught when he saw Dominic's expression.

Dominic had always carried himself with aristocratic poise. But now, under the harsh fluorescent lights, his chiseled features looked gaunt with grief.

Sebastian opened his mouth to speak when Dominic's piercing gaze locked onto him. "Find whoever did this immediately. They won't live to see another sunrise. Sebastian is already investigating. Work with him."

His voice was rough with barely contained fury. Each word dripped with lethal intent.

Sebastian gave a curt nod. "Understood, sir. If this was an accid—" 

"It wasn't an accident!" Dominic's voice cracked like a whip. 

Sebastian flinched at the raw anger. 

"My gut tells me this was deliberate. My wife and unborn child almost died. They're lying in that bed right now. Does that look like an accident to you?"

They say women's intuition is strong, but a man's instincts can be just as deadly accurate.

Sebastian swallowed hard. Seeing his usually composed boss unravel was unsettling.

Finally, he responded, "On the drive back to Blackwood Manor, young Master Alexander gave me the license plate and model of the vehicle that hit Mrs. Sinclair. If the plates are fake, it'll complicate things, but rest assured, Mr. Blackwood, we'll hunt them down."

Dominic's eyes darkened like gathering storm clouds. 

Whoever dared harm his wife would pay with their life.

Dominic didn't sleep all night.

The ICU had round-the-clock nurses. His presence wasn't necessary.

Yet he refused to leave Evelyn's side.

Though a cot sat nearby for family members, Dominic remained perched on Evelyn's bed, cradling her limp hand until dawn.

Morning light spilled through the blinds, painting golden stripes across Evelyn's peaceful face.

She still hadn't woken.

At 8:30 AM, a nurse arrived with Evelyn's medication.

She carefully propped Evelyn up and attempted to spoon-feed the liquid medicine—crushed pills mixed with water to prevent post-op complications.

Dominic's intimidating presence made the nurse's hands shake.

Most of the medicine dribbled down Evelyn's chin as her lips remained stubbornly sealed against the bitter taste.

Dominic's expression darkened.

The nurse fumbled with a damp cloth, smearing medicine across Evelyn's cheek under Dominic's glacial stare.

"Enough." Dominic snatched the bowl from her trembling hands. "I'll do it."

"But Mr. Blackwood, this is my—"

"Get out." His voice could've frozen hell.

The nurse fled without looking back.

Once alone, Dominic's demeanor softened. He gathered Evelyn against his chest and took a sip of the medicine himself.

Then he pressed his lips to hers, transferring the liquid.

Just as he finished, Evelyn's fingers twitched.

Dominic stilled. "Evelyn?" His voice was uncharacteristically tender.

The heart monitor beeped faster.

Evelyn's lashes fluttered. Then her eyes opened—hazy with confusion.

The normally stoic man nearly wept with relief. "Evelyn? Can you hear me?" He hit the call button.

Her head throbbed. The room swam into focus slowly.

When she tried rubbing her temples, Dominic intercepted her hand. "Headache? Let me." His skilled fingers worked magic on her pounding skull.

Then realization struck. Her hand flew to her abdomen. "The baby! Dominic, is our baby—"

Her stomach ached terribly. Had they lost it?

Dominic gathered her close. "Shh, our child is safe. Still with us."

Evelyn searched his face. "You're not lying to me?"

"I swear it."

The hospital director burst in with a team of nurses, visibly relieved to find Evelyn conscious.

After a thorough exam, the director marveled at Julian Whitmore's surgical skill—he'd never seen such medical brilliance. Both mother and child had been saved against all odds.
###Chapter 490  

The hospital director's face lit up with astonishment after completing the examination. "Mr. Blackwood, Ms. Sinclair's legs are saved. She'll require physiotherapy for full recovery, of course. And the baby—remarkably resilient. Emotional distress must be avoided at all costs. Another miscarriage could..."  

Evelyn shifted uncomfortably at being addressed as "Ms. Sinclair."  

She and Dominic weren't married yet. Not after the humiliation she'd brought upon the Blackwood family at their engagement ceremony. The title felt like salt on a wound, but since Dominic didn't correct it, she let it slide.  

"Thank you, Director," Evelyn said warmly, relief flooding her at the news of her baby's safety.  

"Don't thank me," the director chuckled, rubbing his neck. "The credit goes to Dr. Julian Whitmore. I merely assisted. Frankly, his skills put mine to shame."  

Decades of medical practice, yet outshone by a young prodigy. The irony wasn't lost on him.  

"Regardless, you all saved me. That deserves gratitude," Evelyn insisted.  

"How long until I walk again?"  

"Patience, Ms. Sinclair," the director cautioned. "Your right leg has a hairline fracture. Rushing recovery risks permanent imbalance. A month of strict bed rest post-discharge, then crutches. Return in six months for X-rays. Only when the bone fully heals can you resume normal activity."  

After final checks and dressing changes, he left with his team.  

Alone with Dominic, Evelyn studied her mummy-like bandages and exhaled shakily. "That crash... I thought it was over. Is Isabella alright?"  

The memory of screeching metal still haunted her.  

"Just shaken," Dominic murmured, stroking her hair. "Rest now. Leave the investigation to me. Whoever did this will pay."  

Evelyn's hand drifted to her stomach.  

At three months, the bump was more pronounced than her first pregnancy. Her fingers trembled—how close she'd come to losing this child.  

Fate had granted her mercy.  

Their conversation paused as lunch arrived—oatmeal, sausages, raisin toast, eggs—from an upscale diner. The aroma made Evelyn's stomach growl.  

Dominic lifted a spoonful of oatmeal to her lips. "Open wide." His tone was playful, coaxing.  

Evelyn reached for the bowl. "My hands work fine."  

He held firm, spoon hovering. "I'm your future husband. Feeding you is my privilege." A smirk. "Unless you'd prefer someone else?"  

Defeated, she accepted the bite.  

A knock interrupted them.  

"Enter," Dominic called, expecting Sebastian.  

Instead, Vivienne Laurent stepped in, poised in a tailored pantsuit. Her wavy hair was slicked into a high ponytail, accentuating sharp cheekbones. Stiletto heels added inches to her already statuesque frame.  

"Ms. Laurent." Dominic acknowledged her with a glance before resuming feeding Evelyn, unabashed.  

Vivienne's grip tightened on the fruit basket she carried. Her smile was polished. "Mr. Blackwood, Sebastian mentioned Ms. Sinclair's accident. I hoped to visit."  

Evelyn's pulse spiked.  

She'd never forgotten Vivienne's private warnings—the thinly veiled threats from a woman obsessed with Dominic. Still, manners prevailed. "That's kind of you, Ms. Laurent. Just a fractured leg—a few months' rest."  

Disappointment flickered in Vivienne's eyes.  

Such a pity. Why didn't the crash finish her?  

Watching the mighty CEO dote on Evelyn like some common housewife made her blood boil. A decade of devotion, yet he reserved such tenderness for this... nobody.  

She set the basket down. "It's nothing. One mustn't visit empty-handed."  

Her gaze swept over Evelyn—pale, fragile, swathed in hospital garb. What did Dominic see in her?  

Vivienne's nails dug into her palms.  

In every measurable way—beauty, intellect, pedigree—she surpassed Evelyn. Yet Dominic remained blind to her.  

The injustice burned.
###Chapter 491

Vivienne lingered in the hospital room longer than necessary.

Dominic's doting treatment of Evelyn made Vivienne's chest tighten with suffocating envy.

Finally, she stormed out, bitterness and resentment clinging to her like a second skin.

After Vivienne's departure, Abigail, Gregory, and Olivia arrived bearing gifts.

They exchanged polite greetings with Dominic before fussing over Evelyn's condition.

His commanding presence made the atmosphere stiff and uncomfortable.

Recognizing their discomfort, Dominic excused himself with a casual remark about needing a smoke, giving Evelyn space with her colleagues.

"How did this happen? A car accident? And such a severe one at that." Olivia clutched Evelyn's hand, frowning at the bulky cast encasing her leg.

"Just a stupid accident while crossing the street. Really, I'm fine now." Evelyn downplayed the life-threatening collision to spare them worry.

Abigail's twin pregnancy had reached six months. Her swollen belly made walking precarious.

She rubbed her lower back while scolding gently, "You must be more careful crossing roads these days. With so many reckless drivers around, it's like playing Russian roulette. Here I thought I'd be hospitalized first when I deliver in three months. What idiot wasn't watching the road?"

"Sit down before you exhaust yourself, Abigail. The babies need their rest." Evelyn gestured to the nearby chair, concerned about the strain on her colleague.

Abigail gratefully sank onto the chair but kept busy peeling an apple. "With injuries like these, you won't be walking properly for months. Just focus on recovery and forward any pending work to me."

Gregory chuckled. "Still the workaholic, Abigail? Even heavily pregnant? Find yourself a good husband and you wouldn't need to work so hard."

Abigail shot him a glare. "I have perfectly functioning limbs, thank you. Why rely on a man? Most are about as reliable as a chocolate teapot. They'll promise you the moon until someone shinier catches their eye. I'd rather invest in myself than gamble on some man's fleeting attention."

Evelyn nodded in agreement. "Abigail's right, Gregory. The world won't go easy on us just because we're women. Our hard work isn't about wealth—it's about proving our worth through what we can achieve."

Gregory mock-applauded. "Bravo, ladies. Your determination puts us men to shame. I'd better step up my game or risk being left behind by such brilliant women. I was looking forward to collaborating on the urban renewal project, Evelyn, but it seems you'll be sidelined for a while."

Evelyn absently touched her cast. "No one expects accidents. But don't worry, I can still work remotely during recovery. My door—or hospital bed—is always open for discussions."

Olivia handed Evelyn a peeled orange segment. "You should be resting, not working. Trying to outdo Abigail in independence?"

Before Evelyn could respond, Abigail cut in sharply. "What's wrong with independence? Evelyn's brilliant, ambitious, and talented—she's more than capable. Frankly, among us three, she'll be the first to get promoted."

Evelyn gave a modest smile. "I just do my best without ulterior motives. Actually, I have good news—I'm three months pregnant."

The announcement stunned them into silence.

Olivia recovered first with an ear-piercing squeal. She pinched Evelyn's shoulders excitedly. "When did this happen? You kept this secret so well!"

Abigail abandoned her half-peeled apple to stare at Evelyn's flat stomach. "After that horrific crash and the baby's still safe? That's one lucky child! Congratulations, Evelyn. My twins will have a playmate soon."

As the only man present, Gregory couldn't fully relate but offered sincere congratulations nonetheless.

Though not officially married to Dominic yet, everyone knew Evelyn might as well already be Mrs. Blackwood in all but name.

Meanwhile...

Taking advantage of Reginald Blackwood and Margaret's absence while the twins were at school, Beatrice invited Lillian for a tour of Blackwood Manor.

Playing the gracious hostess, Beatrice led Lillian through various rooms until they reached Dominic's private quarters.

Producing an electronic keycard, Beatrice announced proudly, "My son's obsessively private—no woman's ever entered his room. But since you're practically his girlfriend already, I'll let you have a peek."

Lillian feigned shy hesitation.

She burned with curiosity but pretended modesty. "Aunt Beatrice, wouldn't Dominic be upset if we entered without permission?"

Beatrice waved dismissively. "Why would he? He's my son—he listens to me."

A mocking smile threatened to break through Lillian's carefully constructed demure expression.

If Dominic truly obeyed his mother, she'd have been his wife years ago.

Heart pounding, Lillian imagined finding Dominic waiting inside.

After several failed attempts, Beatrice stood frozen in humiliation.

The realization hit her like a slap—Dominic had changed the locks.
###Chapter 492

Evelyn's heart sank when Beatrice failed to open Dominic's bedroom door.

She quickly masked her smirk with a practiced look of sympathy. "Dominic values his privacy. Since we're not officially together yet, I shouldn't invade his personal space. I wouldn't want him getting upset - especially not at you, Beatrice."

"You're absolutely right, Evelyn." Beatrice beamed. "Once you're engaged, he'll bring you in himself without me saying a word. I can't wait for that day!"

With each interaction, Beatrice grew more convinced Evelyn would make the perfect daughter-in-law.

'She's not even married to Dominic yet, but already considers my feelings. What a compliant daughter-in-law she'll be,' Beatrice thought approvingly.

"Is Dominic terribly busy lately?" Evelyn inquired casually.

She'd visited T Corporation multiple times without success. Dominic's movements remained frustratingly opaque - no amount of threats or bribes could loosen the receptionists' tongues. Crawford Manor had become her last resort.

"Absolutely swamped with that urban renewal project," Beatrice sighed dramatically. "He's working himself to the bone, losing weight by the day. It breaks my heart to see it."

She leaned in conspiratorially. "Winning a man's heart requires strategy, Evelyn. My son prioritizes his career and can be... slow in matters of the heart. But you're perfect for him. Persistence will pay off."

Beatrice's eyes glazed with nostalgia. "When I pursued Edmund, women swarmed around him like flies. None lasted more than a month. Know why I succeeded? I understood what he truly wanted."

Evelyn recalled Beatrice's humble origins as a struggling dancer who'd clawed her way to becoming the Crawford matriarch, even surpassing Margaret Lockwood's status. The woman's cunning impressed her.

"I'll do my best," Evelyn murmured obediently. "When will Dominic return?"

"The family gathers for dinner on the 15th of every month without fail. Today's the 15th - he'll definitely come home."

Evelyn feigned disappointment. "Oh dear, it's Grandmother Prescott's birthday today. I must visit her. If Dominic returns late, I'll have to catch him another time."

They descended to the parlor, chatting about designer labels and skincare routines - Beatrice's limited repertoire of conversation topics. Evelyn wondered how such a vapid woman had ensnared the sophisticated Edmund Crawford.

'Thank heavens Dominic inherited his mother's looks and his father's brains,' she mused.

The crunch of tires on gravel announced arrivals. Dominic entered the living room with Alexander and Isabella in tow.

A shadow flickered across his striking features at the sight of Evelyn before his usual icy composure returned. "Ms. Prescott. When did you arrive?"

"Just visiting Beatrice. Did you collect the children from school?" Evelyn's gaze lingered hungrily on Dominic.

He seemed more devastatingly handsome each time she saw him. His diamond-bright eyes held an intrinsic brilliance needing no external light.

The twins clung to their father's hands, scowling at Evelyn without greeting. To them, she represented the villain trying to steal their father from their mother - deserving no courtesy.

Undeterred by their chilly reception, Evelyn produced two children's outfits from her designer bag. "Alexander, Isabella, I bought these for you! Try them on!"

She unveiled a biker set for the boy and a princess dress for the girl.

Alexander declined with a miniature version of Dominic's piercing stare. "Thank you, Aunt Prescott, but we have more clothes than we can wear."

Isabella was blunter. "Mommy bought me a similar dress last month. I prefer hers."

Evelyn's smile stiffened. These weren't the pliable children she'd anticipated. Becoming their stepmother would prove challenging.

If she married Dominic, she'd ensure these troublesome brats didn't remain underfoot.

Beatrice yanked her granddaughter closer. "Mind your manners! Thank Aunt Prescott properly or people will think Crawford children lack breeding!"

Isabella turned away with a haughty sniff, refusing to acknowledge either woman.

Evelyn checked her watch pointedly. "It's getting late, Beatrice. I should head home before my parents worry. I'll visit again soon."

As Dominic started upstairs, Beatrice shot him a meaningful glare. "Of course, dear. I'd insist you stay for dinner if not for your grandmother's celebration. Dominic, escort Evelyn home and pick up a gift for Elizabeth Prescott on the way."
###Chapter 493

The city lights shimmered against the twilight sky as the sleek limousine glided through downtown traffic. 

Dominic Blackwood personally escorted Lillian Prescott home after the gala.

His chiseled profile remained unreadable as they stopped at a red light. The silence between them stretched comfortably.

Lillian discreetly smiled while watching pedestrians cross the street. Even this mundane moment felt precious when shared with Dominic.

The drive from Blackwood Estate to the Prescott residence normally took forty minutes. Tonight, she wished it would last forever.

Dominic's fingers tapped rhythmically against the steering wheel. "What does your grandmother collect, Ms. Prescott? I brought an authentic Monet from my private collection as her birthday gift."

Lillian's voice softened. "Grandmother shares Grandfather's passion for impressionist paintings. She'll be thrilled with your thoughtful gift." Her fingers twisted in her lap. "Thank you for attending tonight. I know how busy you are."

She'd schemed for weeks to get Dominic here. Their entrance together would cement her status as the most envied woman in high society.

Dominic suddenly turned, his piercing gaze locking onto hers. "Tell me, Ms. Prescott - do you have feelings for me?"

Lillian's pulse skyrocketed, though her voice remained steady. "Haven't my actions made that obvious, Dominic? The homecooked meals I delivered to your office? My frequent visits to Blackwood Estate?" She swallowed hard. "Everything I do... it's all for you."

Streetlights flickered across Dominic's striking features, accentuating the mysterious aura that had captivated her since their first meeting.

In her world of beautiful people, Dominic stood apart - an intoxicating blend of power, intellect, and raw magnetism that left her utterly spellbound.

A shadow of revulsion crossed Dominic's eyes before vanishing behind an impassive mask. "If your feelings run so deep," he murmured, "perhaps we should explore this... officially."

Lillian's manicured nails dug into her palms. "You're suggesting... we date?" Her voice cracked. "This isn't some cruel joke?"

Dominic's lips curved. "I have certain... eccentricities most women find intolerable. I trust you'll be more understanding, Ms. Prescott."

"Don't say that!" Lillian's breath came in shallow gasps. She pinched her wrist to confirm this wasn't a dream. "You're perfection incarnate. I'd consider it an honor to stand by your side."

Even as they arrived at the Prescott mansion, Lillian floated in a daze. Reality only snapped into focus when Dominic escorted her into the glittering ballroom, where envious stares followed their every move.

The normally subdued Prescott estate buzzed with elite guests - all vying for the family's favor.

Lillian clung to Dominic's arm, heart swelling with triumph. Tonight, she'd claimed the most coveted bachelor in the city.

Old Mr. Prescott's eyebrows shot up at their entrance, while his wife beamed approvingly. Only Genevieve Prescott's horrified expression marred the moment.

'Didn't I warn that girl?' Genevieve fumed silently. 'That Blackwood heir is dangerous!'

Dominic presented an exquisitely wrapped painting. "Happy birthday, Mrs. Prescott. I understand Monet holds special meaning for you."

Elizabeth Prescott gasped upon unwrapping the gift. "How did you know? This is my favorite from his Water Lilies series!" Her expert fingers traced the canvas reverently. "Wherever did you find such a masterpiece?"

Dominic inclined his head. "A fortunate acquisition at last month's auction. I'm pleased it meets your discerning taste."

Elizabeth clasped his hands, eyes twinkling. "Such thoughtfulness! You'd make an ideal match for our Lillian. Why not make it official?"

The bold suggestion hung in the air as guests pretended not to eavesdrop. Lillian's cheeks burned with anticipation while Dominic's enigmatic smile gave nothing away.
###Chapter 494

Lillian held her breath as she waited for Dominic to respond. Her heart pounded with the fear of rejection.

He was her addiction, and she was beyond redemption.

Dominic hadn't anticipated Elizabeth Prescott's blunt question. A flicker of irritation crossed his aristocratic features.

With practiced ease, he sidestepped the inquiry. "Mrs. Prescott, Lillian and I are still getting to know each other. We're very different people who need time to adjust. But now that we're together, I'll treat her well. Marriage requires careful consideration. When the time comes, I'll certainly introduce her to my family."

The elderly Prescotts exchanged satisfied nods.

Lillian's lips curved into a demure smile, her face glowing like a freshly bloomed rose. The man had just publicly claimed her as his girlfriend. It felt surreal.

"Grandfather, Grandmother, I'll take Dominic around now."

Receiving their silent approval, Lillian slipped her slender arm through Dominic's. She tilted her chin up proudly. "Let's go, darling. I'll introduce you to everyone."

She couldn't wait to announce that Dominic Blackwood - A City's most eligible bachelor - belonged to her now. She knew paparazzi lurked among the guests, and she intended to put on an affectionate display no one could miss.

First, to showcase her irresistible charm that had captured this extraordinary man.

Second, to ward off any potential rivals.

Dominic fought the urge to shake her off.

Her overpowering perfume disgusted him. It lacked Evelyn's natural freshness.

Circumstances forced him to play along. He endured the social rounds, accepting congratulations with strained politeness.

Lillian basked in the attention, her eyes gleaming with triumph. Among all the beautiful socialites vying for Dominic's attention tonight, she had emerged victorious.

Those other women could only watch in envy.

Dominic regarded her preening with detached amusement. To him, she was merely performing a ridiculous pantomime.

Across the ballroom, Genevieve Prescott stood quietly in her elegant gown and shawl. Though engaged in conversation with Sylvia Kingsley and other friends, her gaze kept returning to Lillian.

Her cocktail remained half-finished after thirty minutes.

"Something troubling you, Genevieve?" Sylvia followed her line of sight to where Lillian clung to Dominic. "Your daughter's grown now, found herself a fine man. You and Jonathan should start preparing for the wedding! I must say Lillian has excellent taste. Dominic's quite the catch - handsome, accomplished. You've nothing to worry about."

Genevieve shook her head slightly. "Dominic is exceptional, Sylvia, but wrong for Lillian. He's too reserved, impossible for most women to read. We've sheltered Lillian too much - she's naive about love and marriage. Anyone can see Dominic doesn't feel that spark for her. How can she find happiness in unrequited love?"

A glamorous woman beside Sylvia patted Genevieve's shoulder. "Don't overthink it. Among our circles, few marriages begin with love. Material comfort suffices. You and Jonathan found rare happiness together. Most men soften with time, especially after children come."

An aristocratic lady scoffed. "Nonsense! A loveless marriage is torture! Take mine - arranged from the start. My husband drinks nightly, reeking of other women's perfume. Claims he's found true love and barely comes home anymore. That mistress's son is older than our daughter! I only stay for the inheritance."

As her friends debated, Genevieve watched Lillian leaning against Dominic, her heart sinking.

Lillian was her precious daughter, her life's meaning for so many years.

She wouldn't let any man hurt her child.

Genevieve knew Dominic loved Evelyn deeply.

He'd declared that love publicly, vowed to marry Evelyn despite family opposition.

Such devotion didn't vanish overnight.

Yet here he was with Lillian. Something felt terribly wrong.

Was he fickle? Cold-hearted?

Regardless, Lillian was completely smitten. Genevieve wouldn't let him break her daughter's heart.

Excusing herself, she moved toward Dominic, studying him carefully.

Dominic suddenly turned, sensing someone's intense gaze.

Seeing Genevieve gave him a startling illusion - as if he were looking at an older version of Evelyn.

'My eyes must be deceiving me...'
###Chapter 495

Genevieve Prescott studied Dominic Blackwood from head to toe. Her piercing gaze swept over him like a laser scan, yet she couldn't deny the young man's striking presence.

Unlike the overdressed men at the gala, Dominic wore a simple white dress shirt with black slacks. The minimalist outfit somehow accentuated his aristocratic bearing.

An invisible frost seemed to radiate from his body, warning people to keep their distance. Yet paradoxically, his magnetic charisma drew everyone's attention.

This dangerous combination of icy detachment and raw masculinity explained why women threw themselves at him. But that didn't give him license to play with her daughter's heart.

Right now, Lillian Prescott was love-struck, believing Dominic's attention meant she'd won life's grand prize. Genevieve saw no genuine affection in the man's eyes.

"Mrs. Prescott." Dominic recovered from his initial shock at Genevieve's resemblance to Evelyn Sinclair and approached with measured steps.

Lillian clung to his arm possessively while he kept one hand casually tucked in his pocket. The pose should have looked arrogant, but on him, it appeared effortlessly elegant.

"Mr. Blackwood, I'd like some clarification." Genevieve's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Have you truly resolved matters with Ms. Sinclair after that disastrous engagement? Lillian is my only daughter - young and impressionable. As her mother, I must safeguard her future happiness."

Dominic recognized the challenge in her frosty gaze.

Lillian's grip on his arm tightened.

'Why can't Mother see how hard I've worked to get Dominic's attention? I finally convinced him to attend Grandma's birthday with me, and she's ruining everything!'

"That's ancient history, Mother!" Lillian forced a bright laugh. "If Dominic chose to be with me, it means he's moved on. I love him, and he's here with me - that's all that matters. Who knows what tomorrow brings?"

She playfully nudged Dominic. "Tell her, darling," she coaxed with feigned annoyance.

Dominic's eyelids lowered, shadowing his expression. Lillian couldn't read his thoughts.

"Dominic..." she pressed, anxiety creeping into her voice.

The man remained silent, his sculpted lips pressed into a thin line.

His reticence unnerved Lillian. She desperately needed him to reassure her mother, fearing Genevieve might forbid their relationship.

Genevieve saw through the charade immediately.

The man couldn't even fake sincerity properly. How could she trust him with her daughter?

"If you're serious about Lillian," Genevieve said coolly, "I expect concrete proof of your commitment. Otherwise—"

"Words alone wouldn't satisfy you, Madam," Dominic interrupted smoothly, flashing a disarming smile.

His hand moved to caress Lillian's hair in a show of affection.

Lillian froze at the unexpected gesture before melting into delighted embarrassment. Overcome, she wrapped her arms around Dominic's waist.

A wave of revulsion threatened to overwhelm him. Fighting it down, he forced himself to return the embrace.

Genevieve's face paled, her expression turning glacial. But causing a scene would only embarrass Lillian. With a resigned shake of her head, she turned away.

Meanwhile, Dominic endured Lillian's clingy presence as they circulated the ballroom.

'Just a little longer,' he reminded himself. He wouldn't fail his mission.

Across town at the hospital, Reginald Sinclair and Gwendolyn Sinclair wept at Evelyn's bedside.

The elderly man hugged his granddaughter while tears streamed down his weathered face, cursing whoever had hurt his precious girl. The sight tore at the heart.

Gwendolyn drowned in guilt.

If she hadn't told Evelyn about Reginald's sudden illness, her niece wouldn't have rushed out and gotten into that accident.

Evelyn gently wiped her grandfather's tears. "Don't cry, Grandpa. Your eyesight's bad enough without adding tears. See? I'm perfectly fine."

Reginald touched the cast on Evelyn's leg mournfully. "You got hurt because you were worried about me. At my age, I've lived my life. The car should've hit me instead—"

"Grandpa!" Evelyn cut him off sharply. "Don't say such things! Do you want me to carry this guilt forever? Promise me you'll never speak like that again."

Reginald sighed, wiping his eyes. "Alright, alright."

Noticing her grandfather's low spirits, Evelyn turned to her aunt. "What exactly happened? Grandpa seemed fine last week. Did you take him to see a specialist? Are you feeling better now, Grandpa?"

Recalling the doctor's diagnosis, Reginald waved a dismissive hand. "Nothing serious. Your aunt overreacts. The doctor said I shouldn't hide my troubles in the closet. I'll just find another place for them."

Evelyn blinked in confusion, shooting Gwendolyn a questioning look.

Since when did Grandpa keep his troubles in a closet? And how would that make him sick?

Gwendolyn burst out laughing at her niece's bewildered expression. "Not 'troubles' - cholesterol! I was busy with work when he went for his checkup. The doctor explained his high cholesterol levels, but our dear patient here misheard it as 'closet troubles'..."

Evelyn facepalmed.

'Grandpa, you're such a comedian!'
###Chapter 496

Reginald Sinclair and Evelyn continued their conversation. He finally breathed easier, reassured his granddaughter was unharmed.

Gwendolyn studied her niece resting peacefully, memories of the disastrous engagement ceremony flooding back.

Curiosity got the better of her. "Evelyn, what really happened between you and Dominic at the engagement? You've always been level-headed. There must be more to your sudden refusal than cold feet."

Evelyn hesitated. "I panicked, Aunt Gwendolyn. Marriage feels like a trap - watching brilliant women become shadows of themselves after wedding vows. I can't lose my identity like that."

It was a lie.

She couldn't risk her grandfather's fragile health by revealing the truth about the blackmail CD.

And her fiery aunt might storm off to confront Lillian Prescott, making everything worse.

Gwendolyn bought the excuse. Evelyn had always been truthful.

Still, she shook her head disapprovingly. "You're too impulsive, child. Marriage isn't a prison. Dominic adores you - he'd never clip your wings."

A bittersweet smile touched Evelyn's lips. "You're right. I'm used to handling problems alone, but I promise to confide in Dominic... or at least you and Grandfather next time."

"Enough, Gwendolyn!" Reginald interjected. "My granddaughter just survived an accident. I'll support her decisions, even breaking off the engagement. Evelyn's brilliant - she'll find someone worthy. The Blackwoods are problematic anyway, especially that dreadful Beatrice."

"You've spoiled her rotten, Father." Gwendolyn sighed. "But Evelyn, remember - marriage thrives on mutual respect, not suffocation."

"I will, Aunt Gwendolyn." Evelyn nodded obediently. "Speaking of which, Olivia went to get dinner but isn't back yet. Could you check outside?"

"Of course." Gwendolyn stood. "Anything specific you'd like, Father?"

"Just something simple. Get Evelyn dessert - she has a sweet tooth."

Outside, Olivia trudged toward the hospital with takeout bags. Near a mall parking lot, she froze.

Preston Worthington Jr. stepped out of a sleek sports car, followed by a voluptuous woman with cascading curls - Cecilia Worthington, his fiancée.

The same woman who'd mocked Olivia during her forced abortion.

Watching them stroll arm-in-arm, Olivia's hands trembled with rage. The memory of her lost child burned fresh.

That monster showed no remorse!

Disgust churned in her stomach. She wanted no compensation - just justice for her baby.

Spotting Preston's car, a dangerous smile curled her lips.

She dashed into a nearby store, emerging with spray paint cans. Within minutes, crude illustrations and vulgar insults covered the luxury vehicle.

As she admired her handiwork, an iron grip seized her wrist.

Olivia spun around to face a man resembling Preston - but more striking, more dangerous.

Her breath caught.
###Chapter 497  

Olivia wasn't the type to swoon over handsome faces, no matter how striking.  

The man's grip on her wrist was painfully tight. She tried to shove him away. "Who the hell are you? Let go of me!"  

Preston Worthington Sr.'s gaze flickered between the vandalized Bugatti and Olivia. His voice was glacial. "You realize you just committed a felony? Destruction of property carries legal consequences."  

Olivia scoffed. "Got proof? Didn't think so. Now unhand me before I scream harassment."  

She'd been careful—no witnesses, no cameras. Luck had been on her side.  

Or so she thought.  

Preston smirked, tapping his luxury wristwatch. A holographic video projected, capturing every second of her crime.  

Damn.  

Of course a rich bastard would own a watch that doubled as a spy gadget.  

Her pulse spiked, but she kept her voice steady. "So what? The owner of that car ruined my life. This was payback. Arrest me if you want. See who the cops side with."  

Preston studied her—young, makeup-free, barely legal. Not his brother Preston Jr.'s usual type.  

Then his eyes dropped lower.  

Ah. Not so innocent after all.  

"Eyes up here, creep!" Olivia snapped, kneeing him hard.  

Preston barely flinched. "First woman to ever try that," he mused darkly. "Know what happened to the last person who laid hands on me?"  

"Let me guess—he neutered you?" She smirked at his crotch.  

To her shock, Preston threw his head back and laughed. The sound was unfairly attractive.  

Olivia's traitorous heart stuttered.  

She forced herself to glare. "Look, I don't care if you're the owner's twin. I wrecked the car. Name your price."  

Preston's amusement vanished. "That Bugatti cost thirty million. You owe three."  

Three million?  

Olivia's stomach dropped. Her mother had drained her accounts. She was broke.  

"Help! He's attacking me!" She screamed suddenly, spotting pedestrians.  

No one intervened.  

One brave cyclist hesitated, then pedaled away at Preston's murderous glare.  

Modern society was useless.  

As Preston dragged her toward Mallory Tower, Olivia's panic surged. If Preston Jr. was a monster, his brother would be worse.  

The takeout bag slipped from her fingers, forgotten.  

---  

Meanwhile, Evelyn paced the hospital room.  

"Olivia's never this late. She didn't do anything stupid, right?"  

Grandfather Reginald patted her hand. "Gwendolyn will find her."  

As if summoned, Gwendolyn rushed in, empty-handed. "I searched everywhere. No sign of her."  

Evelyn's phone rang. Unknown caller.  

"Evelyn Sinclair?" A male voice drawled. "Preston Worthington Sr. We need to talk about your friend Olivia."  

Evelyn's blood ran cold.  

How did Olivia cross paths with the devil himself?
###Chapter 498

Evelyn had encountered Preston Worthington on multiple occasions, though their interactions remained limited.  

The man possessed an unsettling beauty, his charming smile never quite reaching his cold, calculating eyes.  

Rumors painted him as the shadow ruler of A City's underworld—a man whose cruelty knew no bounds.  

She still couldn't fathom how Olivia had managed to cross paths with such a dangerous figure on a simple grocery run.  

Unease coiled in her stomach. With her legs still healing, she had no choice but to call Dominic.  

Preston was Dominic's acquaintance. Surely, he could negotiate Olivia's release.  

Dominic answered on the second ring, his deep voice steady despite the background noise of a lively gathering. Music and laughter filtered through the line.  

After explaining the situation, she exhaled in relief when he promised Olivia would be safe.  

"What's all that noise?" she asked, curiosity getting the better of her.  

"Just a party," he replied, his tone softening. "I'll handle Preston soon. Get some rest. I'll take you and the twins on vacation once you're recovered."  

Her heart warmed at the thought, but then—  

A woman's voice, saccharine and possessive, cut through. "Dominic! There you are! Mother and Father are waiting. The banquet is starting!"  

Evelyn's grip tightened around her phone.  

Even knowing it was all an act, the sting was sharp.  

"Go," she whispered, forcing lightness into her voice. "I'll wait for you."  

She ended the call before he could respond.  

Across town, Dominic's expression darkened.  

His gaze locked onto Lillian Prescott, who clung to his arm with faux innocence.  

The air around him turned lethal.  

Lillian shivered under the weight of his glare—like prey sensing a predator's intent.  

"Dominic?" She bit her lip, feigning confusion. "Why are you looking at me like that?"  

His mask of civility slipped back into place.  

"An urgent matter with Mallory Corporation," he said coldly, extracting himself from her grasp. "My apologies, Ms. Prescott."  

Her smile faltered.  

If it was just a corporate issue, why did the CEO need to intervene personally?  

Suspicion gnawed at her, but she forced a gracious nod. "Of course. Though I'd hoped you'd stay for my performance..."  

"Another time."  

After brief farewells to the Prescott elders, Lillian paraded him out, basking in envious stares.  

Dominic barely tolerated her touch, already mentally calculating how many showers it would take to scrub her cloying perfume from his skin.  

But Genevieve Prescott's watchful gaze kept him in check.  

The moment he was free, his phone buzzed—an unknown number.  

Lillian rejected it twice before answering with a sharp, "What?"  

A gruff voice hissed, "The job's done. Where's the rest of my payment?"  

Her blood ran cold.  

Locking herself in a bathroom stall, she spat, "She's still alive. You call that done?"  

"I crashed into her like you asked. Alive or not—pay up, or I'll expose you."  

The line went dead.  

Lillian hurled her phone against the wall.  

Shattered glass mirrored the fury in her eyes.  

That woman was supposed to die.
###Chapter 499

Dominic escorted Olivia back to the hospital room, her face still streaked with dried tears. She looked like she'd been through hell.

Evelyn's blood boiled when she saw her best friend's condition.

She grabbed Olivia's wrist, scanning her for injuries. "Did Preston hurt you? That bastard..." Her voice trembled with barely contained rage.

Then she shot Dominic a scorching glare, as if this were all his fault.

"He didn't. Just played a nasty prank. No physical harm done." Dominic raised his hands in surrender, his expression sincere.

He'd known Preston Worthington for years. The man was ice-cold and ruthless, but he'd never lay hands on a woman.

Preston had looks, power, money - women threw themselves at him constantly. If he wasn't interested, he'd toss them out without a second thought, even if they stripped naked in his bed.

Dominic remembered one socialite who'd snuck into Preston's bedroom. Before she could touch him, he'd kicked her so hard she broke three ribs. Then bankrupted her family business for good measure.

After that incident, no woman dared scheme her way into Preston's bed again.

Evelyn knew none of this. All she saw was her traumatized best friend.

"Then why is she shaking like a leaf?" she demanded.

Gwendolyn calmed her niece with a touch, then handed Olivia water. "At least you're safe now. What happened while getting food? You're such a sweet girl - who could you have possibly offended?"

Gwendolyn adored Olivia. The girl's fiery personality balanced Evelyn's quiet nature perfectly.

"Child, you're Evelyn's closest friend," Reginald Sinclair said gently. "That makes you family. Tell us what's wrong so we can help."

Olivia accepted the water with trembling hands. "Thank you, Mr. Sinclair, Aunt Gwendolyn... I'm okay, Evie. Mr. Blackwood arrived in time. Preston Worthington didn't... didn't actually hurt me."

Tears welled up as she absorbed their kindness. Her own family only cared about draining her bank account. They wouldn't lift a finger if she were dying.

"Thank God." Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Now explain how you crossed paths with Preston Worthington."

"I ran into Preston Jr. and his fiancée at the mall. After they left, I keyed their car. Preston Sr. caught me. He demanded ten percent of the car's value - three million for a thirty-million-dollar Bugatti. Evie, I'm so sorry for dragging you and Mr. Blackwood into this..."

Olivia shuddered, remembering Preston's "prank" - locking her in a room with his collection of African pythons and Tibetan mastiffs. The snakes might have been harmless, but their slimy coils still haunted her.

Evelyn's expression darkened through several shades of anger.

"Pierre deserved worse," she said fiercely. "I'd have burned that car to the ground if not for the legal consequences."

Dominic blinked. He'd never seen this vengeful side of his usually gentle Evelyn.

"Evie, I..." Olivia looked stricken.

She'd expected a lecture, not unwavering support.

Guilt gnawed at Evelyn. If Olivia never found happiness because of what happened, she'd never forgive herself.

A knock interrupted them.

Sebastian Whitmore entered, greeting everyone politely. Dominic followed him out into the hallway, then into the smoking lounge.

Dominic lit a cigarette, offering one to Sebastian. After taking a drag, Sebastian got straight to business.

"That license plate was fake, as Mr. Blackwood suspected. But traffic cameras gave us a lead - a 5'9" man in his mid-thirties. He was on a call before hitting Ms. Sinclair, using a voice changer. Destroyed the SIM card afterward. This was planned."

Dominic's smoke rings curled angrily. "Dead end then?"

"Not entirely." Sebastian took another drag. "The perp's trained in counter-surveillance. But thirty minutes ago, Sean intercepted a transmission and pinpointed his location..."

Sean Zander - Evelyn's driver - had been assisting Sebastian with the investigation.
###Chapter 500  

Dominic tapped his cigarette against the ashtray with practiced ease. "Find him. And the mastermind behind this. I don't care what it takes."  

His voice was deceptively soft, laced with an icy edge that sent shivers down the spine.  

Sebastian gave a firm nod.  

He knew better than anyone when his boss was truly enraged.  

Dominic returned to the hospital room.  

Reginald Sinclair, weakened by age and stress, had been sent home earlier by Gwendolyn.  

Evelyn had stayed with Olivia until the latter finally calmed down, then asked Sebastian to escort her home.  

Now, only Dominic and Evelyn remained in the sterile white room.  

Evelyn studied him. Even in casual attire, he exuded an air of effortless aristocracy.  

The dim lighting accentuated the sharp angles of his face, making him look even more enigmatic.  

He was dazzling—but that very brilliance attracted too much attention.  

The memory of that coy, feminine voice from the party resurfaced in her mind.  

She wanted to ask about the woman, but after a moment's hesitation, she bit her lip and stayed silent.  

She had promised to trust him completely. If she truly meant it, there was no room for doubt.  

Dominic noticed her hesitation. He crossed the room in long strides, sat beside her, and pulled her slender frame into his arms.  

She was his solace. Just holding her melted the ice in his chest.  

Evelyn was woven into his very being. Every breath she took affected him.  

"Still worried about Olivia?" He pressed a kiss to her temple. "Percy didn’t hurt her—just scared her a little. He won’t dare go too far with me around."  

She clung to him tighter, as if afraid he might vanish.  

Dominic knew her too well. That desperate grip told him everything.  

He tilted her chin up and saw the flicker of sorrow in her clear eyes.  

Then it hit him—Lillian's interruption during their phone call at the party.  

He pressed a series of tender kisses to Evelyn's forehead.  

"It was Elizabeth Prescott's birthday today," he explained. "I attended her party at the Prescott estate. The voice you heard was Lillian's. She clung to my arm, but I scrubbed myself raw in the shower before coming here. Smell me—do I still reek of her perfume?"  

He rolled up his sleeve and held his wrist to her nose.  

Evelyn exhaled, some of the tension leaving her shoulders.  

She took his hand, tracing the lines of his fingers with her own. "I trust you. I meant what I said—no more suspicion. But love is strange. Even knowing it's an act, I can't help feeling possessive. I want all of you. Even a glance from another woman feels like a threat."  

Love was a double-edged sword. It bound two hearts together while cursing them with jealousy.  

Sometimes sweet as honey, sometimes bitter as poison.  

Dominic brushed his thumb over her flawless cheek.  

After a lingering kiss, he vowed, "This charade won’t last much longer. Once it's over, I’ll give you the wedding you deserve. You’ll be Mrs. Blackwood in every way."  

Evelyn buried her face in his chest, smiling like the first bloom of spring.  

The next morning, the twins arrived to visit their mother.  

Dominic brought them to the hospital.  

Isabella clutched her brother’s hand, her small frame trembling as she stood by the bed. Tears streaked her rosy cheeks.  

"Mommy!" Her voice cracked, tears flowing freely.  

Evelyn reached for her.  

She wiped her daughter’s tears away. "Don’t cry, sweetheart. Mommy’s okay."  

At just five years old, Isabella couldn’t fully grasp what had happened—but the sight of her mother’s leg in a cast made her bite her lip hard.  

Guilt gnawed at her. If she hadn’t insisted on going to the bathroom, her mother wouldn’t have been hurt.  

The twins had grown up without a mother’s love until Evelyn came into their lives.  

Isabella adored her—yet she’d caused this.  

What if Mommy stopped loving her because of it?  

Evelyn squeezed her daughter’s small hand. Isabella usually took great care with her appearance, but today her hair was unbrushed, her clothes slightly rumpled.  

It only made her look more vulnerable.  

Evelyn loved both children deeply, but she had a soft spot for her daughter. Alexander was mature beyond his years, needing less attention.  

Isabella, though just as bright, wore her heart on her sleeve.  

That was why Evelyn doted on her.  

Seeing the guilt in Isabella’s eyes, Evelyn’s heart ached. She cupped her face.  

"Listen to me, my darling. You could never make me love you less. You and your brother are my greatest blessings. All I want is for you to be safe and happy."  

As their mother, she would move heaven and earth to protect them.
