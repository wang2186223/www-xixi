###Chapter 1

It was the third year of my marriage to Liam Roland.

The hospital's diagnostic report lay cold in my palm.

"Permanent loss of fertility."

Seven words, like poisoned needles, pierced my heart.

Liam held my hand tightly.

"It's alright," he said.

His voice was so gentle it could melt.

"We can adopt a child."
-------

At Hope's Harbor Orphanage.

A little girl named Olivia hid behind the director.

Her eyes were like those of a frightened fawn.

She timidly offered me a piece of candy.

"For you, Auntie."

My heart instantly softened.

I knelt down and hugged her.

"Let's choose her."

The adoption process went smoothly.

Until Olivia reached for the pen.

There, on the back of her right hand.

A brown birthmark the size of a pea caught my eye.

I snatched the pen back abruptly.

"No."

Liam was stunned.

"Why?" he asked.

His voice was tense.

I stared at the birthmark.

"It's ugly."

My mother-in-law exploded on the spot.

"Ava, have you lost your mind!"

She pointed at my stomach.

"You can't have your own, yet you're still picky!"

"Such a small birthmark can be removed with laser later!"

Liam tried to take my hand.

"Darling, don't make a scene," he pleaded.

His voice was hoarse.

"Olivia is so well-behaved..."

"Divorce."

The word silenced everyone.

Liam's eyes reddened.

"Because of a birthmark?" he asked.

His voice trembled.

"Is it really that serious?"

I laughed coldly.

"Yes, it is."

I gripped my bag strap tightly.

"Choose. Her or me?"

The director hurried to mediate.

"Ms. Fairsprene, Olivia is truly a sweet child..."

My father-in-law joined in.

"Medical aesthetics are advanced now. Removing a birthmark is easy..."

I turned to leave.

Olivia suddenly rushed over and clung to my leg.

"Mommy, please don't leave me..."

I shoved her away violently.

The little girl stumbled and fell into Isabella's arms.

My sister-in-law immediately shrieked.

"How could you push a child!"

She held Olivia tightly.

"What did the child ever do to you!"

I glanced at her coldly.

"You like her so much?"

"You be her mother then."

Isabella turned pale.

"Don't talk nonsense!" she snapped.

She stole a glance at Liam's reaction.

Liam was trembling all over.

"Ava," he said.

He was almost begging.

"Let's just sign the papers, okay?"

"You can punish me however you want when we get home."

I grabbed my bag and walked straight toward the door.

A dull thud echoed from the leather sofa.

Liam knelt on the cold tile floor.

The sound of his knees hitting the ground was heartbreaking.
###Chapter 2

"Please sign."

Liam Roland clung desperately to my legs, his voice hoarse.

My mother-in-law trembled with rage nearby, barely able to stand.

"Liam, get up! This is disgraceful!"

We had been married for three years.
We had argued and fought.
He had never knelt before me.

They say a man's pride is his dignity.
Yet he bent his knee for a stranger's child.

Liam Roland, do you love her that much?

I turned to look at the girl hiding in Isabella Roland's arms.
She had delicate features.
She was quiet and well-behaved.
She looked exactly like her.

I forced a bitter smile.
I bent down and pried his fingers away one by one.
"Stop this."

Liam's eyes were red.
Tears fell onto the floor.
"Darling, please don't do this..."

I scanned the room.
The understanding child.
The furious mother-in-law.
The silent relatives.
My kneeling husband.

It made me look cold and heartless.
Like a monster.

All over a small birthmark.
Pushing us to divorce.

"Divorce."
I turned and walked away.

I returned home alone.
I immediately contacted my lawyer to draft the divorce papers.

They didn't come back until late at night.

Laughter and cheerful voices echoed from outside the door.
Everyone carried bags of gifts.
Olivia was surrounded in the center, adored by all.

Liam's smile vanished the moment he saw me sitting in the living room.
"Darling, the director agreed to let her stay for a few days..."
"Don't worry, I'll send her back soon."

He watched my expression carefully.
I turned my face away.
"Don't send her away. Let her stay."

Liam's eyes lit up.
"You've changed your mind?"

I slammed the divorce papers on the table.
"Sign."

He stumbled backward, shaking his head wildly.
"Darling, I was wrong. We won't keep her. Please don't leave..."
"I can't live without you. Why does it have to come to this?"

My mother-in-law pulled him aside.
She pointed at my face and shouted.
"Are you seeing someone else? Is this your scheme to abandon the Roland family?"
"Have I ever treated you poorly? I never said a harsh word when you couldn't have children!"
"I just want to hear a child call me grandma. Is that wrong?"

She grew more emotional, tears streaming down her face.

Isabella suddenly knelt before me, holding Olivia.
"Sister-in-law, I know you look down on poor people like us."
"You've never experienced life on the streets. I have... It was worse than death."
"Please keep her. I'll leave this house immediately!"

She cried pitifully, her tears evoking sympathy.

I raised my hand and slapped her hard across the face.
"You know exactly why I don't want this child."

Liam sprang to his feet.
He struck me back, sending me crashing to the floor.

My head hit the corner of the table.
A sharp pain shot through me.
Warm blood trickled down from my temple.

"Darling, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to!"
He panicked, trying to press on my wound.

I pushed him away.
I grabbed my bag and headed for the door.

My father-in-law roared behind me.
"If you step out that door, never come back!"
"You won't get a single cent from the divorce!"
###Chapter 3

I dragged my heavy steps back to my parents' house.

My mother noticed the injury on my face immediately.

She rushed forward and embraced me.

"My dear, what happened to your face?"

"Didn't Liam come back with you?"

I threw myself into my mother's warm embrace.

Tears silently streamed down my face.

My mother gently patted my back.

"Did you have a fight with Liam?"

"What happened?"

Her care made me unable to hold back any longer.

"Mom, that child..."

I told my parents everything.

They were left speechless with shock.

"Liam Roland is actually that kind of person!"

"How could he do such a thing!"

My father's face turned pale with anger.

"Divorce! You must divorce him!"

"We don't want a single thing from his family!"

My father, agitated, wanted to go confront the Rolands.

I quickly stopped him.

The next day, I went to the company.

I was there to get the divorce papers.

The elevator went straight to the top floor.

I pushed open the door to Liam Roland's office.

He and Isabella were playing with Olivia.

Seeing me enter, Liam immediately stood up.

He noticed the injury on my face.

"Darling, I'm sorry."

"I didn't mean to do that yesterday."

His eyes were filled with remorse.

"Isabella is our family's most cherished sister."

"I just couldn't stand to see her wronged."

He grabbed my hand and made me slap his face.

"Hit me, as long as it makes you feel better."

I forcefully pulled my hand away.

"I'm here for the divorce papers."

Liam looked utterly incredulous.

"Darling, what's really wrong with you?"

"Please, just tell me."

These past two days had drained all my strength.

"I just want a divorce."

"I don't love you anymore."

Liam shook his head frantically.

"That's impossible! You're lying!"

"If you don't like children, we won't raise any."

He held me tightly in his arms.

The force was suffocating.

"Liam Roland! I want a divorce!"

"Do I need to say out loud what you've done?"

Liam tried to act calm.

But I still caught the panic in his eyes.

Isabella suddenly interrupted.

"Brother, just let her go."

"That ungrateful wretch isn't worth your affection."

She looked at me with contempt.

"We really misjudged her back then."

Liam suddenly slapped her across the face.

Isabella covered her cheek, stunned.

"Apologize to your sister-in-law!"

Isabella stubbornly turned her head away.

"If you won't sign, we'll see each other in court."

With that, I turned and left the office.

In the elevator, employees whispered among themselves.

They kept stealing glances at their phones.

I snatched one of the phones.

Messages kept popping up in the company group chat.

"I heard the child is the CEO's biological daughter."

"The wife is making too big a deal out of this."

"She doesn't even like such an adorable child."

"She can't have her own, yet she throws a tantrum."

Isabella suddenly sent a message.

"Anyone who keeps discussing this will be fired."

The group immediately fell silent.

I let out a cold laugh.

Isabella certainly wielded her power impressively.

She had become the CEO's secretary by clinging to Liam.
###Chapter 4

Several days later.

The doorway was cluttered with a pile of belongings.

My things were thrown haphazardly at the entrance.

My favorite little teddy bear, covered in mud, lay alone on the ground.

I crouched down and looked at it for a long time.

My fingertips gently brushed over the bear's dirty face.

This was the token of love Liam Roland gave me.

On the night we decided to become a couple, I suddenly wanted a stuffed bear.

All the shops were closed late at night.

He ran ten kilometers just to buy this bear.

It was cheap and rough, but it made my heart flutter.

I took a photo and sent it to Liam.

"Acting quite convincingly."

He replied only after half a day.

"Darling, it wasn't me! How could I ever do this to you?"

I blocked him immediately.

That evening, a heavy rain poured down.

The doorbell rang urgently.

I opened the door to find Liam drenched, standing in the rain.

Water dripped from his hair. His lips were pale.

"Come inside."

I pulled him, but he didn't move.

"I won't come in unless you forgive me."

"Then stay there."

I closed the door.

On the security camera, I saw him leave quickly.

I laughed at myself for still feeling soft-hearted.

The rain lasted all night.

Early in the morning, I opened the door to find Liam still in the same spot.

His clothes were soaked. His face was deathly pale.

"Darling, I stood in the rain all night. Can you forgive me now?"

His voice trembled.

"What are you pretending for?"

Isabella Roland suddenly rushed over and supported him.

"Are you insane? Letting my brother get drenched like this!"

"Can't have a child of your own, so you take it out on others?"

Liam pretended to stop her, but his eyes gleamed with satisfaction.

I couldn't be bothered to argue.

Isabella shoved her phone in my face.

"Look what you've done!"

In the video, Olivia was being interviewed.

She cried, saying I disliked the birthmark on her hand.

The director exaggeratedly described my coldness.

The whole internet was cursing me.

"How could she be so cruel to such a lovely child?"

"The birthmark isn't even noticeable. She's just looking for an excuse!"

"My heart breaks for the child, meeting such a vicious woman."

My identity was exposed.

Eggs were thrown at the company's entrance. The stock price plummeted.

My parents came home with worried expressions.

I clenched my fingers.

"On the day of the press conference, I will make them pay."

At the press conference.

Reporters aimed their cameras at me.

The flashing lights hurt my eyes.

The Roland family arrived one after another.

My in-laws ignored me with cold eyes.

Isabella held Olivia, smiling挑衅ly.

Good. Everyone is here.

As soon as I sat down, reporters immediately swarmed.

"Ms. Fairsprene, please explain the incident at Hope's Harbor Orphanage!"

"Did you really refuse to adopt because of a birthmark?"

I picked up the microphone.

"That's correct. I did refuse to adopt her because of the birthmark."

The room erupted in noise.

I slowly lifted my head.

"Now, everyone, please take a look at two things."
###Chapter 5

I retrieved two documents.

The projection screen lit up.

"Ms. Fairsprene, this is your medical report."

"The report indicates you are unable to conceive."

"Is this the reason you decided to adopt?"

The reporter pressed on relentlessly.

"Ms. Fairsprene, why did you refuse adoption because of the birthmark on Olivia's hand?"

"What connection does this have with your medical report?"

Live stream comments scrolled wildly.

"It's just a medical report, right?"

"She can't have children herself, so she's jealous of someone else's birthmark?"

"She's psychologically disturbed. Why even hold a press conference?"

Public opinion swung entirely in Liam Roland's favor.

My mother-in-law suddenly stepped forward, sobbing.

"Ava married into our family three years ago. I never blamed her for not being able to have a child."

"We provided her with the best of everything at home."

"I just want to hold a granddaughter. Is that wrong?"

She successfully won the entire room's sympathy.

Cameras focused on her tear-streaked face.

No one noticed Liam Roland and Isabella Roland's deathly pale expressions.

I gently curved my lips into a smile.

"Mother-in-law, you already have a biological granddaughter."

"I can have her call you grandma right now."

The room erupted in chaos.

"What does she mean?"

The second report was projected onto the large screen.

The paternity test report for Liam Roland and Olivia.

"Genetic similarity 99%."

"Supports Liam Roland as the biological father of Olivia."

I read the conclusion clearly.

The venue exploded instantly.

"She's been cheated on!"

"Olivia is the other woman's child!"

"Liam Roland tricked his wife into raising his illegitimate daughter!"

Reporters frantically clicked their camera shutters.

Liam Roland's face turned as white as paper.

Cold sweat soaked through his shirt collar.

Camera flashes trapped him in their center.

"Mr. Roland, did you have an affair?"

"Is Olivia your illegitimate daughter?"

When my infertility was first discovered, Liam Roland actively encouraged me to adopt.

For three years of marriage, I longed day and night to give him a child.

My mother-in-law's eager eyes for a grandchild were never hidden.

Only Liam Roland never urged me.

After the medical report appeared, he suddenly became eager to adopt.

It was all a calculated plan from the beginning.

Public opinion completely reversed.

"I would have lashed out long ago!"

"So pitiful to wear that crown for so long!"

Liam Roland struggled amidst the swarm of reporters.

His lips trembled, but no words came out.

I raised the microphone again.

Liam Roland violently pushed reporters aside and rushed toward the podium.

The crowded caused him to fall to the ground.

A bruise formed on his face as he scrambled up, still trying to stop me.

He clearly knew what I was about to say.
###Chapter 6

Liam Roland's tears instantly welled up and overflowed.

I watched coldly.

He was truly wasting his talent by not becoming an actor.

"I admit it," he begged me desperately.

"Darling, for the sake of our marriage, please let me keep some dignity."

"Please, stop talking," I cut him off immediately.

"Don't call me darling. We are getting a divorce."

"You dare do it but not own up to it?"

The journalists became instantly excited.

They urged me to reveal the truth.

"Ms. Fairsprene, this press conference is being live-streamed. Every word you say will be on the record."

I produced another report.

The Paternity Test Report for Olivia and Isabella Roland.

"Isabella Roland, this child is yours and Liam Roland's."

"You committed incest with your brother behind your sister-in-law's back."

The room fell completely silent.

Two seconds later, it erupted into loud discussions.

"This child was actually born from sibling incest."

"Not only did he raise a love child, the mistress is his own sister."

"This is utterly inhuman."

Reporters frantically took pictures.

They were afraid of missing any detail.

My mother-in-law stared at Isabella Roland in shock.

Isabella Roland trembled all over.

Her hands loosened, and Olivia fell to the ground.

The child's crying made the scene even more chaotic.

Camera flashes kept going off.

The Roland family was speechless.

I looked coldly at Liam Roland on the floor.

"Do you have anything left to say?"

Liam Roland crawled to my feet.

"Darling, I'm sorry. Please don't divorce me."

He clutched desperately at my trousers.

"I was wrong. I deserve to die."

"It was Isabella Roland who seduced me."

"She deliberately got close to me for a position."

"I couldn't control myself."

I almost wanted to laugh.

He could still say such things.

Was he forced into bed? If he hadn't been willing, could Isabella Roland have succeeded?

There are no flies on an uncracked egg.

Now that things went wrong, he shifted the blame.

Isabella Roland's face turned livid.

Ever since Liam Roland and I started dating.

She had been making trouble behind the scenes.

She had to tag along on dates. She made a scene over gifts.

After marriage, it became even worse.

She argued for Liam Roland to arrange a job for her.

I thought it was just sibling affection.

I never expected them to be so shameless.

Cheating behind my back.

The child was already over a year old.

They had been stealing for a whole year.

It wasn't until Liam Roland came home carrying her perfume scent that I became suspicious.

I hid a camera in the study.

I heard their entire plan.

I will always remember that day.

My husband and his sister-in-law scheming against me together.

They wanted me to take responsibility for their love child.

The two even coupled in the study.

At that moment, I really wanted to push the door open.

To let his parents see what their wonderful children were doing.

What filthy things.

Liam Roland cried bitterly.

"Darling, please forgive me."

"I would never dare again."

"Isabella Roland seduced me. I am not human."

He frantically slapped his own face.

Begging for my forgiveness.

Isabella Roland saw all the dirty water being thrown her way.

She became furious too.

She pointed at Liam Roland.

"You're cleaning yourself up really well."

"Like a dog, you came the moment I beckoned."

Liam Roland's face turned bright red.

"You even wanted it when I was pregnant."

"You said your wife couldn't satisfy you."

"Have you forgotten all that?"

"Should I talk about your lovers outside?"

Isabella Roland grew more agitated as she spoke.

She spilled everything.

"Enough!"

My mother-in-law glared at Isabella Roland.

She clutched her chest and collapsed.
###Chapter 7

"Mom!"

Isabella Roland rushed toward her collapsed mother-in-law.

Her father-in-law shoved her away violently.

Isabella stumbled backward.

Her arm scraped against the table's edge.

Blood instantly beaded on her skin.

"Our family has no daughter like you!"

Her father-in-law's finger trembled.

His voice turned hoarse with rage.

"From this day forward, you are no longer my daughter!"

Tears flooded Isabella's eyes.

"Dad, I know I was wrong. Please don't cast me out."

She dropped to her knees.

She clutched the hem of his trousers.

"Get away from me!"

Liam Roland yanked her back.

"Getting Mom to the hospital is what matters now!"

He shouted at Isabella, his face contorted.

The Roland family descended into chaos.

They tried to leave the venue immediately.

I signaled the security guards to block their path.

Liam spun around abruptly.

His eyes were bloodshot.

"Must you destroy us completely?"

"Mom has already collapsed! What more do you want?"

Guests murmured among themselves.

"No matter how much you hate them, you can't ignore a life in danger."

"This is too heartless."

"I felt sorry for her before, but she's truly vicious."

My expression remained cold.

I motioned for the medical team to take the mother-in-law to an ambulance alone.

Liam tried to follow.

The guards stopped him firmly.

"What do you want?"

He demanded through gritted teeth.

"You've ruined our entire family!"

My whole body trembled.

I walked down from the stage step by step.

I threw the test report in his face.

Papers scattered across the floor.

"Liam Roland, my dear husband."

"You've been drugging my food for two years straight."

"You caused me to lose my fertility permanently."

The room erupted in shock.

The live stream exploded instantly.

"My God, this is murder!"

"No wonder she couldn't get pregnant."

"Making his wife raise his mistress's child while poisoning her?"

"Gold-digger men are terrifying!"

Liam's face turned deathly pale.

"You're lying!"

I lifted my foot and kicked him hard.

"The evidence is undeniable. How dare you deny it?"

"Did you ever think about our child?"

Liam's head jerked up.

"What child?"

I fought back tears.

My voice choked with emotion.

He grabbed my wrist fiercely.

"Explain!"

"The child lost to miscarriage because of the drugs."

"Our child."

Liam's fingers suddenly went slack.

He collapsed to the floor.

Unable to speak another word.
###Chapter 8

Liam Roland stared at me with a wild, obsessive intensity.

He repeated the same words over and over.

"It's impossible. You're lying to me."

"You just want revenge, don't you?"

"How could this be… This absolutely cannot be true…"

My heart felt like it was being crushed.

That was the deepest scar in my soul.

He had pierced it with his own hands, leaving it bleeding and raw.

Back then, he was completely consumed by company matters, overwhelmed every single day.

I endured everything alone, not wanting to add to his burdens.

For two whole years, I believed the problem was with me.

I never imagined the real culprit was him.

Liam suddenly grabbed my wrist.

His grip was so tight it felt like he would crush the bone.

"Say it! Tell me you were lying just now!"

"If you refuse to believe, nothing I say will matter."

I forcefully shook off his hand.

"Just assume I was lying to you."

The press conference ended here.

Reporters gradually left, and the venue slowly emptied.

Liam remained standing in place, muttering to himself.

"Impossible… It must be fake…"

Isabella Roland and my father-in-law tried pulling him away, but he wouldn't budge.

Finally, my father-in-law had enough and slapped him across the face.

"Liam Roland! How dare you embarrass yourself here!"

"Get yourself home right now!"

Liam's scandal quickly topped the trending searches.

The entire internet was condemning his despicable actions.

Paparazzi camped day and night outside the Roland family home.

They captured the entire scene of Isabella being thrown out of the house.

Olivia followed behind her, crying hysterically.

The truth about the orphanage was completely exposed.

Olivia was never a child from Hope's Harbor Orphanage.

It was all a scheme fabricated by Liam and Isabella.

They staged this entire act to make me adopt Olivia.

In the end, they suffered the consequences of their own actions.

Liam stubbornly refused to divorce, pestering me relentlessly.

I had no choice but to file a lawsuit.

I brought solid evidence to court.

This was the last time I saw Liam.

After more than a month apart, he had become gaunt and emaciated.

He looked like a strong wind could blow him over.

He stood in the defendant's box, remaining silent throughout.

The court proceedings went surprisingly smoothly.

As the at-fault party, Liam ended up leaving with nothing.

Once the trial concluded, a fierce wind howled outside the window.

His voice was almost swallowed by the wind.

"This is a gift… for our child."

He handed me a handmade stuffed toy bear.

It looked exactly like the one from all those years ago.

I stared coldly at the bear.

"The manufacturer went out of business long ago. You can't buy the original."

"So I… made one myself."

After a long silence, I spoke softly.

"That won't be necessary. You keep it."

Those were the last words I ever said to Liam.

Later, the Roland Group, unable to withstand public pressure, declared bankruptcy.

The Roland family moved from their luxury villa into an old, cramped apartment.

Neighbors often heard loud arguments coming from their home.

Sometimes it even escalated into physical fights.

But none of that had anything to do with me anymore.

My company grew larger and more successful.

My career was flourishing.

A brand new life was waving to me on the horizon.
