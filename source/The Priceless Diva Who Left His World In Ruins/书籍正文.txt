###Chapter 1 Divorce


"Put your signature on these divorce papers and get out of the MMitchell family's house right now!" Rodger Mitchell shouted, fixing his wife, Emilia Harris, with a cold stare, his eyes sharp enough to cut through her.

"I swear I didn't push Violet. Why won't you believe me?" Emilia's voice trembled. Her reddened eyes spilled with unshed tears, while her chest ached with unbearable sorrow. "She leapt into the pool on her own-she framed me..."

"I've heard enough!" Rodger's patience snapped.His hand shot out, fingers tightening around her neck with cruel force.

Panic crashed into her, leaving her gasping for breath. Despite the suffocating pressure, she stared back at him, refusing to look away.

One lone tear slid down and landed on his knuckl es,burning him enough that he jerked his hand back. Gasping, Emilia tried to breathe, but a different kind of ache gripped her chest. Three years she had given him everything-only for it to end like this.

Was this what her life had become? She had become nothing more than the butt of everyone's jokes. To them, she was nothing more than a pitiful fooI to laugh at.

"If you sign the papers right now, you'll still walk away with thirty million, the beach house, and a new sports car. Drag this out, and you'll get nothing at all," Rodger threatened with cold indifference.

Emilia let out a brittle, sarcastic laugh. "You think that offer is generous?"

Fury lit his eyes, and for a moment he looked ready to strangle her again, but the raw despair in her gaze stopped him short.

Something twisted deep in his chest, though he shoved it down. Maybe it was the sight of Emilia,helpless and broken, that made something inside him hesitate for the first time. "Don't let your greed ruin what little you have left,Emilia. You nearly took Violet's life, and I haven't even started making you pay for that," Rodger said,his tone as cold as a winter storm.

"I never touched her! Whatever happened by that pool isn't on me!" yelled Emilia, frustration boiling over in her voice.

She could have shouted the truth until her lungs gave out, but not a soul here was willing to listen. Nobody in the Mitchell family gave her the benefit of the doubt.

"You're pushing me to my limits! If you hadn't been so heartless, she wouldn't have had an attack so suddenly! You knew exactly how little time she had left, and you still treated her like that!" Rodger's glare burned with accusation.

"You really want to talk about heartlessness?" Emilia shot back, her tone sharp as ice. "When you had the car accident and became a vegetable,she, then still your girlfriend, abandoned you and went abroad.If her time is running out now, maybe that's just fate giving her what she deserves."

"Don't you dare speak ill of her!" Rodger barked, his hand shooting up, ready to strike.

'Emilia moved faster this time, grabbing his wrist before he could touch her. Her gaze met his, eyes fierce and blazing with resolve.

Rodger had never seen this side of her before, and the sight stopped him cold.

She had always seemed weak and forgettable. WVhen did she sharpen into someone who could stand like this?

"You! Who gave you the nerve-" Before Rodger could finish his sentence, her palm cracked across his face with stunning force, painting his cheek with a bright red mark. The slap rang out, echoing in the room.

"I've had enough! From this moment on, I owe the Mitchell family nothing," Emilia said, tearing her hand from his grasp. Just then, his phone buzzed loudly. He answered,the scowl on his face deepening as he listened. "What do you mean Violet's condition has worsened? Still nothing from Asclepius? Pay whatever it takes-get ,him here! We're running out of time for Violet!"

Asclepius-a guy who was rumored to have miraculous medica skills and had thus earned the title-was the only one who could cure Violet's illness.

Rodger ended the call, turning on Emilia with a glare、that could have cut glass.

"If anything happens to Violet, I'll make sure you spend the rest of your life paying for it!" With a sneer,he tossed out his threat and stormed off down the hallway.

Tears shimmered in Emilia's eyes, turning them a deep red. As she watched his retreating back, a hollow laugh slipped from her lips.

If not for everything she'd done, Rodger would still be trapped in a hospital bed, lost in a world of darkness. All she ever gave was loyalty. Still, her dedication meant nothing next to the admiration he reserved for another woman-Violet Morgan.

A memory flickered through Emilia's mind-Violet's voice still echoed, moments before she plunged into the water.

"You might have taken him from me, but getting him back would take nothing but a whisper."
Emilia could never forget that look of victory in Violet's eyes or the sly smile that curled on her lips.

A harsh, bitter laugh escaped as tears slipped down Emilia's cheeks. Under her breath, she muttered,"Violet, you may have won this time. But your fate is in my hands."

The truth was, the real power had always rested with her. Behind the name everyone whispered in desperation-Asclepius-stood Emilia herself, the one healer who could work miracles.
A steely resolve flashed in her eyes. Picking up the pen, she scrawled her signature across the divorce papers, not pausing for a second.
It was all over. Everything was over. The marriage that had consumed three years of her life had ended in ruin.

Her gaze shifted to the portrait of Arthur Mitchell,Rodger's late grandfather.

"Arthur," she murmured, "you gave me another chance at life. Today, that debt is settled. I walk away owing nothing to your family."

She gathered her things without fuss. Head held high, Emilia stepped out of the Mitchell home, never glancing back.
###Chapter 2 Resurface


Inside the hospital's bustling entrance, Emilia strode through with her suitcase in hand.

Once she'd left the Mitchell estate, Emilia made straight for the hospital the moment she learned her bestie, Sloane Stewart, had been admitted.

She barely reached the hallway when Rodger's little、brother,Sebastian Mitchell, blocked her path.

Sebastian had always gone out of his way to sneer at her, finding every opportunity to take jabs.

"You've got some nerve showing your face around here!" Sebastian snapped, his glare brimming with anger. "Violet nearly died because of you!"

Emilia's expression didn't waver. "What happens to Violet is none of my concern," she said, her voice colder than steel. "Now step aside."

"Why would I? You came here to cause more trouble, didn't you?" Sebastian shot back, annoyance twisting his features.

"I'm giving you one last chance. Move out of my way," said Emilia, her gaze hardening with a dangerous edge.

Sebastian squared his shoulders, refusing to give an inch. "I'm not budging!"

Without another word, Emilia seized his arm and flipped him flat onto the floor, moving with unexpected force.

A heavy thud filled the hallway, followed by Sebastian's groan of pain. He hardly had a chance to process what happened.

Without looking back, Emilia stepped right over Sebastian, ignoring him as he writhed on the floor.

From behind, Sebastian's voice, twisted with rage,rang out. "Emilia! You'll regret this!"

Elsewhere in the corridor.

"Well,would you look at that!" Wilbur Collins let out a whistle, his eyes wide with surprise. "When did Mrs.Mitchell become such a force to be reckoned with?I always thought she was sweet and quiet. Guess she fooled all of us."

Elias Dixon's gaze stayed fixed on Emilia, his expression unreadable. His cool stare tracked her every move. There was something about her boldness and swiftness that had caught his eye.

"You're still staring, Elias? Don't tell me you've got an interest in her," Wilbur teased with a sly grin.

Seated in his wheelchair, Elias kept his gaze cool. His slender fingers tapped a steady rhythm against his thigh.

Several years ago, an orchestrated ambush had nearly stole his life, leaving him broken after the crash. Although the accident hadn't killed him, Elias would never walk again.

Without a miracle from Asclepius, he faced a lifetime tied to this wheelchair.

Every time he recalled how his search had led straight to Inferno-the infamous assassin syndicate -a cold, ruthless spark ignited behind his narrowed gaze. There was no doubt in his mind. Lord Inferno-the leader of this organization-had a hand in this mess.

"Any updates on Asclepius?" asked Elias.

Wilbur's usual smirk faded as soon as the words left Elias's lips, his expression turning grave. "Tracking down Asclepius is like chasing a shadow.He vanished completely four years ago. No trace, no leads. If you ask me, finding him now is almost impossible..."

Wilbur let his eyes drift down to Elias's motionless legs,concern creasing his brow.

The only person capable of curing Elias was that arrogant physician, the one who dared call himself Asclepius.

A shadow passed over Elias's features, his voice barely above a whisper. "Let's go."

All hope had been drained from him, replaced by reluctant acceptance. Life in a wheelchair would be his new reality.

Wilbur's hand was just reaching for the wheelchair's grip when his phone went off.

"Yeah, what is it?" He answered, trying to sound casual.

As the words came through the line, his expression transformed-shock, then disbelief, then something close to excitement.

Once he ended the call, Wilbur turned to Elias, a playful spark in his eyes. "So, I've got two pieces of news. You want the good one or the bad one first?"

Elias stared straight ahead, lips set in a hard line. He looked completely uninterested.

Wilbur groaned, throwing him a look of mock defeat."You could at least pretend to care."

"I don't care about either," Elias replied, voice flat and cold.

"Are you sure?" WVilbur's grin widened, a spark of mischief in his eyes.

Lowering his voice, he leaned and whispered,"Asclepius just resurfaced."

For a split second, time stood still. A jolt of disbelief hit Elias. His hands balled into fists, tension written all over him.

He had already accepted that hope was gone,and no one could have foreseen a twist like this.
###Chapter 3 The Chance


"Are you kidding me? How are you not reacting to that?" Wilbur said, eyeing Elias, who looked completely unbothered.

After all, Asclepius was the only doctor with a real chance of healing Elias's legs.

The truth was, Elias only looked composed on the、outside. Inside, he was anything but calm. Beneath the surface, his thoughts churned.

Wilbur shrugged. "You're no fun at all." He didn't bother dragging it out any longer. "Here's the story:Asclepius has finally resurfaced. The catch is, he's going to choose a random patient with a complicated case from the biggest racetrack in Oticester. Only one person will get treatment. Just imagine how many desperate people will show up. The odds of you being picked are slim at best..."

Wilbur cast a sideways look at Eliasand let out a longgh.

With chances that low,it was hard to stay optimistic -bad news indeed.

"Better to have a slim chance than none at all," Elias replied, his voice cold and even.

Wilbur nodded, trying to sound upbeat. "You're right.We'll just have to hope for the best when the day comes. Maybe you'll get lucky." He started pushing the wheelchair down the hall. "He's got a nerve,naming himself Asclepius..."

A distant look settled on Elias's face. "Do you think he's earned that title?"

"If anyone has, it's him. The man's skills are the stuff of legend, especially with tough cases." Wilbur's voice picked up energy, eyes shining with admiration."I mean it, he's in a league of his own."

A slight crease appeared between Elias's brows,almost unnoticeable, as Emilia's determined, frosty face flashed through his mind. Whatever else Wilbur said faded into the background. Meanwhile, in a private hospital suite, Rodger stood at Violet's bedside, worry clouding his expression as he took in her pale features.

Suddenly, Sebastian burst through the door,frustration etched on his face. "Rodger! Emilia has gone too far this time! Where is she? Hasn't she already started making trouble?"

Rodger shot him a sharp glare, silencing him in an、instant. "Enough,Sebastian."

Sebastian recoiled, but couldn't help muttering,"She's the reason Violet's like this, and you're still defending her?"

"I'm not defending her. I just want you to keep quiet so Violet can rest!" Rodger's patience wore thin,veins pulsing at his temples.

Realization hit Sebastian, and his tone softened. "Oh,sorry,Rodger.I got the wrong idea."

Right then, Violet's eyelashes fluttered and her eyes opened slowly.

The first thing she did was clutch Rodger's arm,panic in her voice. "Rodger, where's Emilia? | slipped and ended up in the pool, and she had nothing to do with it..."

Lowering her gaze, Violet chewed her lip, painting a picture of innocence and hurt.

Sebastian's frustration exploded. "Violet! I saw her push you! You almost died because of her. Why are you still making excuses for Emilia?"

Words caught in her throat, Violet looked like she wanted to defend Emilia, but all she did was bite her lip and pretend to look heartbreakingly fragile.

Rodger's expression softened. He pulled her close,wrapping her in a comforting embrace. "As long as I'm around, nothing bad will happen to you. I'll track down the miracle doctor and get you cured. I promise."

A tearful smile trembled on Violet's lips. "You've always been so good to me, Rodger. I never wanted to leave you, I just..." Her voice faltered as if her emotion overwhelmed her, the memories almost too much to bear.

Back then, Rodger might have been a vegetable for life, so she had abandoned him and gone abroad.

Her time overseas started out carefree, but a year ago, her life turned upside down. A rare illness plagued her, leaving her in agony every time it flared.

Doctor after doctor failed her, until she heard、whispers that Asclepius was the only one who could help.

Hoping for a cure, Violet came home, the last rumors of the miracle doctor placedhim in this city.

Along the way, she decided she could also win back the now-recovered Rodger and use him to find Asclepius.

"You don't have to explain. I never held any of that against you." Rodger brushed away her tears.

Suddenly, his phone vibrated. Irritated, Rodger answered, but as he listened, his frustration vanished,replaced by a burst of hope.

Sebastian leaned in, eager. "What is it, Rodger? Did something happen?"

Grinning, Rodger held Violet's hand. "Asclepius resurfaces! Violet, we finally have a real chance.1won't let you suffer anymore. I'll do whatever it takes to save you."
###Chapter 4 The Miracle Doctor


Meanwhile, inside another private hospital suite.

"Why didn't you bother telling me you were admitted?" Emilia gave Sloane a sharp look.

" didn't think it was serious enough to trouble you,my precious Asclepius," Sloane explained, clutching her arm with a pout.

Emilia could only shake her head, letting out a resigned sigh. "Trouble just follows you around,doesn't it?"

"Forget about my problems. Is it really true-you actually signed the divorce papers?" Sloane asked,the question slipping out with a heavy sigh.

For a moment, it seemed incredible that Lord Inferno,the leader of a notorious assassin organization, could be tangled up in atoxic relationship.

Emilia said with a quiet smile, "Yeah. It's true." Sloane retorted, "Arthur's the only decent person in that whole Mitchell family. The rest of them are just fools!"

"That's enough," said Emilia, voice calm and even,signaling she was finished talking about the Mitchells.

"But why did you suddenly announce you'd pick some random patient?" Sloane's tone turned curious.

When Emilia kept quiet, Sloane clutched her hand in alarm. "Don't tell me you still care about him. Is this some trick to win him back? Please tell me you've got over him!"

Emilia let out a soft laugh. "Rest assured. Three years of being a fool was plenty for me. Ever since I walked out on the Mitchell family, I haven't once thought of returning."

Relief washed over Sloane, and her shoulders relaxed as though a weight had lifted.

"So what's really going on, then?" she asked, eyes bright with curiosity. Lowering her voice, Emilia leaned in and explained,"I've managed to pick up a lead-whatever I'm searching for might be with the Dixon family. I need a disguise to get close."

Sloane's mouth fell open. "Wait, you're saying the other piece of-" She stopped herself mid-blurt,quickly whipping out her phone to type instead. "Are you saying the other half of the treasure map is in the hands of the Dixon family?"

Emilia gave a slow nod. "That's the hunch, but I can't、say for certain yet."

"As long as this isn't about crawling back to that bastard, I'll let it go. But if you even waver, I swear I'll cut you off!" Sloane warned, her voice firm.

A genuine laugh left Emilia. "I won't make the same mistake twice."

"Good. That's the Emilia I like to see." Sloane's lips stretched into a smile as admiration glowed in her eyes. "You shine brighter when you're working toward something real. Oh, and-are you going to tell your family what happened with the divorce?" Emilia shook her head, answering softly, "No, let's keep it between us for now. I'd rather spare them the worry."

"Maybe that's for the best," Sloane remarked, a sly grin flickering as thoughts of the Mitchell family's foolishness crept in. "You know, if Rodger ever got a glimpse of your true identity, he'd be groveling in seconds."

With a cold edge, Emilia replied, "Then he'll be waiting at the end of the line, since there are numerous people doing so."

That got Sloane laughing hard. "That's exactly the Emilia | remember-fearless and confident! I wish l could see their jaws drop the day they discover who you really are. That's going to be a show."

Sloane kept talking animatedly, while Emilia listened with quiet focus, adding a word here and there.A week drifted by. The racetrack brimmed with people, but today, the crowd was thick with patients facing their final battles.

It wasn't an exaggeration to say the place looked more like a ward than a track. Each case brought its own grim weight.

"Have you ever seen anything like this? It's as if every critical patient in the country showed up today!"

"Even patients in comas were hauled in with entire medical teams. You can tell they belong to some wealthy family."

"Tsk! Asclepius really is influential."

"Yes! No one can deny his skill. He tackles the worst cases and somehow makes them walk out whole."

"With a name likeAsclepius, you'd expect nothing less. People around here also call him a miracle worker, and they mean it."

People were discussing the various patients and the miracle doctor, Asclepius.
Sebastian whispered, "Rodger, is he really as extraordinary as everyone claims? Or is this reputation nothing but a lie?"

Rodger's eyes hardened, and he replied, "Stop doubting. If he weren't the real thing, the President might have..."

The unfinished sentence told Sebastian enough. He murmured, "So the rumors about him curing the President are true?"

Rodger's reply came flat and cold. "They're true."

Out of the corner of his eye, Rodger spotted a familiar silhouette-Emilia.

That woman again. She just couldn't leave him alone,even following him into a place like this.

Annoyed, Rodger surged forward and caught her by the wrist. "Why are you here, Emilia? What scheme are you trying to pull this time?"
###Chapter 5 Challenge


Rodger's grip clamped down on Emilia's wrist hard enough to sting, and she barked in frustration, "Let go of me."

A mocking snort left Rodger as he stared down at her. "Still pretending, huh? You just can't leave me,can you?"

Emilia rolled her eyes. She could not believe she ever missed how full of himself this man was.

She retorted, "You think I came here for you? Don't flatter yourself."

"What else am I supposed to believe? Your cheap tricks are obvious." Rodger narrowed his eyes.

"You really should get a doctor to check on your narcissism, you bastard!" Emilia snapped.

The insult stung, turning Rodger's face a shade redder."What did you just say?!" "Don't make me repeat myself, you narcissistic bastard," Emilia retorted, her words like a whip crack.

Rodger squeezed her wrist tighter, each word stretched with warning. "Emilia Harris!"

"You'd better release me, unless you want me humiliating you in front of everyone here." Emilia's voice faltered for a moment as pain stabbed through her arm.

"Do it. Show me how you think you'll humiliate me,".Rodger said, staring her down with contempt.
"You asked for it!" Emilia snapped, yanking her free hand upward in a vicious arc meant to slap his face.

But having learned his lesson, Rodger was already prepared for such a move. His hand shot out,trapping her other wrist in an unyielding grip. Now both of her arms were pinned tight.

"Is that all you've got?" he taunted, his voice dripping with mockery.

An almost invisible smirk flickered on Emilia's lips, her gaze turning cold.

Of course, that little outburst was just a ruse. Her real plan had nothing to do with slapping him.

Taking advantage of Rodger's momentary lapse in vigilance, Emilia slipped under his arms. Before Rodger could process what was happening, she drove her heel into the back of his knee.

The sudden pain forced his grip to loosen, and Emilia wasted no time. She tore her hands free and launched another swift kick, pressing her advantage without hesitation.

A heavy sound echoed through the racetrack.Rodger collapsed onto his knees, shocking the crowd into silence.

Watching the CEO of MitcheIl Group brought to his knees by a single woman sent ripples of laughter through the crowd.

"Look at that! A big shot like him beaten by a woman." Sebastian glared at the jeering crowd and barked,"You think that's funny? Try laughing again, and I'll make sure you regret it!"

He rushed to Rodger's side and pulled him up,asking quickly, "Are you hurt?"

Rodger scowled, his jaw set tight. "I'm fine," he muttered.

Watching him struggle, Emilia arched an eyebrow and grinned. "Learned your lesson?"

"You-!" Rodger sputtered, too furious to form a proper retort.

Locking eyes with Emilia, he sensed something new in her. The way she held herself now radiated the presence of a queen in her domain.

A strange tension filled the air, as if her confidence pressed down on him.

The image he once had of her, a timid woman without charm or fire, vanished in the face of her bold and unchained spirit. Murmurs swept through the gathering as people tried to guess who she really was.

Since no one had ever heard about her marriage to Rodger, the truth of her past remained a mystery to all.

"Emilia! How dare you make a fool out of Rodger!"shouted Sebastian,his voice shaking with fury.

"Why wouldn't I dare? Actually, there are plenty of things I dare do." Emilia gave a careless shrug as if none of it mattered to her.

The ease in her tone, that mocking calm, burned Sebastian with shame.

"So you think nothing rattles you? Fine then! Let's see you race Rodger!" Sebastian barked, his anger spilling over.

"Challenge accepted. But simple racing? That's pretty boring. I've outgrown that game. If we're doing this, we're doing it in a thrilling way," replied Emilia with cool defiance.
###Chapter 6 Death Race


"What exactly are you getting at?" Sebastian gave Emilia a wary look, suspicion clear in his eyes.

"Death Race," Emilia answered, her tone steady and composed.

A wave of shock rippled through the crowd.

Has she completely lost it? The Death Race was infamous-far deadlier than any standard racing event. Not only did it demand razor-sharp reflexes,but it also required nerves of steel.

Even the entry-level Death Race was brutal. The course was a straight line, but at the finish waited two gasoline barrels.

Racers had to launch themselves down the track,pushing their cars to the limit, but could only hit the brakes once they crossed a specific mark.

Anyone who slowed down too soon was immediately out, while those who dared to get their bumper as close as possible to the gasoline barrels stood the best shot at victory.

There was zero margin for error. Each racer had to calculate perfectly how far their car would keep rolling after the brakes were slammed, thanks to momentum.

A single mistake-stopping too soon or too late-could send them straight to failure or crashing into the barrels, with a fiery disaster waiting.

And that was just the entry round; the more advanced stages were even more dangerous.

Despite the grim odds and the annual toll of lost lives, adrenaline junkies kept lining up for the challenge, unable to resist the call of the Death Race.

The cash prize was so outrageous that people were willing to gamble with their lives just for a shot at it-not to mention the thrill of raking in huge winnings from side bets.

Rodger's expression turned cold. "Have you lost your mind?"

Emilia retorted, "What's wrong, Rodger? You afraid to go up against me?"

Rodger stared at her in stunned outrage, unable to find the words.

How did a woman who spent her days as a housewife get the nerve to challenge a pro-especially in the most dangerous race on the circuit?

Was this some desperate attempt to make him notice her, or was she simply reckless beyond reason?

Did Emilia seriously think she was on the same level as Racer Ace-the living legend of the track? What a joke. Racer Ace was untouchable!

At that moment, Violet slinked up beside Rodger,draping herself over him with an air of fragile tender.

Her voice was soft and dripping with mock concern."Emilia, you do realize how unpredictable the Death Race is, don't you? Are you trying to punish Rodger by putting your life on the line?" "Stop your disgusting act. Makes me want to punch your face." Emilia's face darkened with contempt.

Feigned tears welled in Violet's eyes as she looked up at Rodger, her voice trembling. "Rodger..."

He wrapped an arm around her shoulders, soothing her in gentle tones. "Don't worry, Violet. I'm right here. There's nothing she can do to harm you."

Once Violet seemed calmer, Rodger turned on Emilia with a glare that could have cut glass. "Emilia, you'd、better watch yourself. Say one more word against Violet, and I promise you won't get away with it. I'm not playing around. If anything happens to her because of you, you'll regret it for the rest of your life."

The fury in Rodger's eyes made it look as if he was ready to go to war for Violet's sake.

"And let's get one thing straight. Don't fool yourself with these ridiculous hopes. There's no world where I'd choose you. Violet is my everything-she always has been, and she always will be." Rodger's mind flashed back to his youth, to the angelic Violet who had once saved him. In his heart,Violet had always been irreplaceable.

The thought that Emilia might ever take Violet's place was nothing but a fantasy.

Still nestled in Rodger's embrace, Violet shot Emilia a smug, triumphant look.

Emilia could never hold a candle to her. Any man she wanted would always choose her in the end. And she would never let Rodger know that the one who had saved him was actually Emilia.

Rodger, meanwhile, searched Emilia's face, waiting to see her break under the weight of his words.

But her eyes remained clear, betraying nothing.There wasn't a trace of sadness, no hint of turmoil beneath the surface.

Emilia's calm, almost distant attitude unsettled Rodger. It didn't match the memory of the woman who once hung on his every word, who would have done anything just to please him. For someone who used to love him with her whole heart, Emilia didn't even flinch at his cruelty.

He convinced himself it had to be an act-maybe she was putting on this cool front to get his attention.That had to be it.

The thought reassured Rodger. There was no way Emilia, who'd once adored him, could simply let go.

He decided she must have shown up at the track,feigning indifference, just to draw his eyes back to her.
He believed that her facade would soon shatter, and then she would be begging for him to look at her.

Did Emilia really think she could play these little games and fool him? How laughable. He was certain he could see right through her.

In his mind, she would always be the same-just a housewife stuck in her routines, too ordinary to ever become the kind of woman others admired. There was no chance she'd ever reinvent herself into someone remarkable.Rodger's imagination conjured up the image of Emilia on her knees, face streaked with tears, begging for a scrap of his affection.

That vision brought a sneer of contempt to his lips as he looked at her.

He was about to unleash another round of cutting words when Emilia's voice cut clean through the tension.

"Enough with the posturing. Do you actually have the,guts to face me in the Death Race?" Emilia scoffed,her voice firm and unwavering.

Sebastian chimed in, raising an eyebrow, "What's the bet?"

Emilia met his gaze with a cool smile. "If you lose,I take twenty percent of the Mitchell Group's shares.Not asking too much,aml?"

A collective gasp swept through the crowd. Not too much? Was she out of her mind?

"You've got to be joking. What makes you think you deserve twenty percent of the Mitchell Group?"Sebastian mocked.

"What's the matter, nervous you'll lose?" Emilia retorted. "If you really have no confidence in your brother, Sebastian, you could always bet on me to win."

Sebastian exploded, voice rising, "Don't be ridiculous! Rodger would never lose to you. If I'm placing a bet, it's on him, not you. You're nothing!"

Rodger's gaze turned cold as he regarded Emilia."Fine. I'll put up twenty percent of the shares. WVhat are you putting on the line?"

Emilia's lips curled in a slow,knowing smile.11A treatment from Asclepius. Does that sound fair enough for you?"

###Chapter 7 Bet Her Win


.Emilia's challenge sent a ripple of disbelief through the entire crowd.

"No way-there's no chance she could really offer a treatment from Asclepius. If she's bluffing, she's just signed her own death sentence."

"She's probably just putting on a show, hoping to、fool us. Asclepius doesn't just hand out treatments to anyone."

"But look at her-she doesn't seem like she's lying.And if what she says is true, then twenty percent of the Mitchell Group's shares is a small price for something so valuable."

In the midst of the whispers, Elias, who had been quietly observing, frowned ever so slightly.

"If Emilia's really got access to Asclepius, we should just strike a deal now." Wilbur leaned closer, keeping his voice low. "No rush." Elias lifted a hand, signaling him to wait.

"How can we not rush? If what she claims is real, the Mitchells would gain so much fromn this!" Wilbur's impatience was clear.

A sly smile touched Elias's lips. "You honestly think Emilia is going to lose?"

"How is she supposed to win? She's just a housewife, facing off against a seasoned racer. The outcome's a foregone conclusion. Heartbreak must have pushed her over the edge, thinking she can survive a Death Race."

Wilbur shot a glance at Elias, puzzled by his calm.Normally, Elias was razor-sharp-why did he seem so detached now?

Wilbur's eyes drifted down to Elias's legs, a wave of quiet frustration passing through him.

Once, Elias had dominated the tracks, racing under the code name TO, smashing Racer Ace's record.

If not for that crash, Elias might still be rewriting history.

Wilbur's greatest hope was that they could win the Asclepius treatment-maybe then Elias would walk again.
"Let's make a bet. I wager Emilia will win, Elias said at last, his voice steady and cold after a long silence.

Wilbur stared at Elias in disbelief, then reached over and pressed the back of his hand to Elias's forehead."Are you feeling all right? Did you hit your head? You must be joking!"

"Are you in or out?" Elias didn't even bother to look up.

A sly grin broke out on Wilbur's face. "All right, let's make this interesting. If Emilia loses, I get that plot of land up north. If by some miracle she wins,you can have the property I just picked up."

Elias's lips twitched with a faint smile. "You've got yourself a deal."

"Don't you dare back out if you lose. Moments like these-when you're not thinking straight-are few and far between." Wilbur couldn't help but tease him.
"You have my word." Elias kept his eyes on Emilia, his voice calm. Her boldness was something to behold.

Wilbur let out a loud laugh. "That land up north is practically mine already!" he exclaimed, overflowing with confidence.

"Don't start celebrating just yet," Elias replied coolly.

Wilbur grinned. "Oh, come on! When I win, I'll finally be able to say l've beaten you. The whole city will hear about it."

Elias kept that mysterious smile on his lips, offering no further comment.

He was convinced-he would win this wager.

"She's putting everything on the line, risking that chance at treatment. If she panics and slams into those barrels, it's all over." Wilbur's real fear was that if the Mitchells got their hands on the Asclepius treatment, Elias might never have another shot at  walking again.

Even with those worries hanging in the air, Elias showed no hint of doubt.

."Are you really so sure she'll win?" Wilbur asked.

Elias met his gaze, unflinching. "I do."
###Chapter 8 Vouch


."I can't shake off my worry, though. One wrong move on the track could mean disaster for her," Wilbur admitted,tension running through his voice.

His greatest fear was that if the Mitchell family walked away with the treatment, his friend would be left without hope.

Yet Elias sat serenely in his wheelchair, as though nothing in the world could shake him.

"You're seriously that sure she'll win?" Wilbur pressed.

At last, Elias answered with nothing more than, "Yes."

On the other side of the crowd, disbelief hung thick in the air.

Sebastian eyed Emilia suspiciously. "Do you think we're fools? Who would fall for a story like that?""Emilia, you can't just give away a miracle doctor's treatment. That kind of opportunity isn't handed out to just anyone," Violet murmured,implying that not just anyone could get the treatment from Asclepius.

"He owes me a favor," Emilia said evenly, her gaze cutting to Violet. "So stop your pathetic assumption."

"That's not what I meant. I just-"

Violet tried to defend herself, but Emilia cut her off."Enough. Stop dragging this out. Are you in or not?"

Sloane let out a sarcastic laugh. "Such scaredy-cats.If you're too scared to take the risk, then bow out now."

Back in her racingdays, people had called Emilia Racer Ace. Only one rival ever gave her a real fight-the elusive TO.

After TO had shattered her long-standing record,Emilia broke his and waited for that challenger to return. Time dragged on. TO never came back, and she eventually stepped away from racing. "Why should we trust you?" Rodger said with a scowl.

All of a sudden, a cool, commanding voice cut through the noise. "I'll vouch for Miss Harris."

All eyes snapped to a striking figure in a wheelchair-his presence alone seemed to shift the air in the room.

Although he sat apart from the action, his energy was unyielding, pressing down on everyone around him.

When Emilia caught sight of Elias, a spark flickered behind her eyes, and a subtle smile curved on her lips, gone as quickly as it appeared. She hadn't expected to kill two birds with one stone today.

"I'll put ten percent of Dixon Group's shares on the table as collateral. Does that satisfy you?" Elias's eyes narrowed, his voice cutting through the air as he fixed Rodger with a frosty stare.

Gasps rippled through the crowd. "Are we talking about the Dixon family from Anburith? Ten percent of that company is worth more than everything the Mitchell family own!"

"Who on earth is this woman? Even Mr. Dixon himself is willing to stake his fortune for her?!"

Discomfort twisted in Rodger's chest. No matter his condition, Elias always seemed to outshine him. And now, Elias was stepping in for Emilia, stirring a storm of conflicted feelings inside him.

"Still not enough for you?" Elias asked, his tone cold and merciless.

The silence stretched before Rodger finally said,"Since Mr. Dixon is willing to vouch for her, then I'll accept the bet."

The prospect of winning tempted him. Even if Emilia's claims turned out to be false, he stood to gain a treasure-ten percent of the Dixon fortune.That single move would vault the Mitchell family to the top of Oticester's wealthy elite.

No matter the final outcome, Rodger saw nothing but gain. He couldn't help tossing out one last taunt. "Emilia,this is your last out. You don't have to go through with this."

Emilia's eyes hardened as she declared, "I'm not walking away, no matter what."

Her defiance darkened Rodger's expression.

"Have it your way. If you're so eager to throw your life away, I won't stop you," sneered Rodger.

Before long, they gathered at the Death Race arena.

Rodger's gaze cut across the space, landing on Emilia. He struggled to recognize this fierce,lively Emilia as the same person he once found unremarkable.

The face was unchanged, yet everything else about her carried a force that felt worlds away.

When Emilia suddenly turned her gaze on him,a jolt of unease struck through his chest.
For an instant, he believed fear might take hold of her and she would retreat. Instead, her lips curved into a smile that dared him to test her.

Disappointment settled in Rodger's chest, twisting together with his frustration.

"You have no one else to blame but yourself for what happens next, Emilia," he said under his breath.
###Chapter 9 Confidence


,"So, who's stepping up first? Or should I pull straws for you?" asked the referee, surveying the contestants with curiosity in his tone.

Rodger started to answer, but before he could speak,Emilia raised her hand.

"He can take the first turn."

A gasp rolled through the audience. This wasn't any ordinary contest. The Death Race was infamous for pushing both body and mind past their limits.Anyone who went up earlier had a distinct edge. The rules were simple but cutthroat-if two scores matched,the one who competed first would always win.

Stepping up sooner meant less pressure and better odds of survival. Year after year, the statistics never changed. Contestants who waited longer to perform had a grimly higher chance of meeting their end.

"Did she just give up her chance to go first? Is she really that sure of herself?"

"I have to admit, that kind of guts is impressive. Even if she loses, I'll respect her for this."

"Maybe she has no clue how these things work.I mean, she's just a housewife. Maybe the rules are over her head."

Rodger stared at Emilia, his surprise obvious.He hadn't expected her to hand him the advantage. A wrinkle of uncertainty crept into his expression.

Was Emilia so confident that she didn't care? Or was this some kind of secret message?

"You do realize what you're giving up, right? Going first could easily decide the outcome. Why give me that edge?" Rodger leaned in, unable to hide his suspicion.

Emilia cut him off before he could say another word."Believe me, I know exactly what I'm doing."
With a teasing grin, she asked, "You don't actually think I'd throw away an advantage just because l've still got a soft spot for you, do you?"

Rodger bristled, his discomfort plain. "Then tell me.Why are you doing this?"
"Because I'm confident enough," said Emilia, arching an eyebrow with confidence. "I know I can take you down, Rodger, no matter what advantage you have."

Her challenge seemed to hit a nerve, and Rodger's frown grew even sharper.

He forced a mocking laugh. "Big talk. Alright then,Emilia. Let's see you try."

Before he climbed into the driver's seat, Rodger tossed a smug glance her way. "You'd better brace yourself, because today's not your day."

Emilia watched him buckle up, her smile never fading. Almost under her breath, she whispered,"Let's see who has the last laugh, Rodger."

The second the green light flickered on, his car blazed off the starting line.

Rodger barreled down the track, knowing the stakes. He could not afford to slow even a second too soon,or it would all be over for him.

Nerves buzzed under his skin. He had never attempted a Death Race, and every muscle in his body tensed as he gripped the wheel, heart thumping wildly.

Rodger locked his gaze on the finish, the line standing between triumph and defeat. Missing it by a fraction would cost him everything.
Too much speed could spell disaster, yet slowing down even a moment early would mean certain loss.

Every beat of his heart echoed the tension in the arena.

Pushing the car past the line, Rodger slammed on the brakes, nerves stretched tight as wire.

He squeezed the steering wheel so hard his hands ached,sweat dripping from his fingers.

The vehicle screeched to a halt, the nose stopping just short of the stacked barrels of gasoline. The referee bent down to check, then called out, "7.5centimeters!"

Instantly, applause and shouts erupted from the stands.

"Did you see that? Rodger pulled it off! First Death Race, and he nails it-pretty

incredible!"
"That's the gap between the pros and the amateurs.With a score like that, she doesn't stand a chance."

Sloane's expression tightened as she watched,anxiety knotting in her stomach and her hands clenched tight.

She had faith in Emilia's strength, but three years of Emilia living quietly, away from the track, left her unsettled.One wrong move could end it all.

"You were incredible out there! I can't believe I get to call you mine!" Violet bounced over to Rodger,practically glowing.

From the sidelines, Sloane rolled her eyes and tossed out a snarky remark. "Is that all it takes to impress you? He barely got close to the barrels. Not exactly worth bragging about, if you ask me."

She'd had enough of Violet's fake enthusiasm and could barely stomach her presence.

"What, you think you're some racing genius?"Sebastian sneered, not missing a beat. "If you had half a brain, you wouldn't be hanging around someone like Emilia. That woman's nothing but a parasite. My brother came out here and crushed his first Death Race, so maybe you should start making plans for Emilia's farewell party. She might crush in a blaze-and nobody will even remember her."

Without warning, Sloane's composure snapped. She struck him hard across the face. "You'd better watch what you say! I won't stand here and let you talk about Emilia like that!"

The knot of dread in her chest only tightened.Between her fears for Emilia's safety and Sebastian's vicious taunts, Sloane's patience had finally run dry.

How dare they look down on Emilia? Who gave themthe nerve?

Sebastian's face twisted with rage. "You've got some nerve laying hands on me!"

Sloane straightened her shoulders, not backing down an inch. "I'll do it again if you open that mouth one more time!"

Within moments, the argument exploded into a brawl, fists flying and chaos erupting around them.By the time it ended, Sebastian was left nursing more than just his bruised ego.

On the track, Rodger basked in his success, thinking the risk and sweat had all paid off. The thrill of victory made him forget his nerves.

A wave of self-satisfaction swept over him as he caught Emilia's eye. In his mind, defeat for her was inevitable. She didn't stand a chance.

He walked up to her, voice dripping with condescension. "Save yourself the trouble and call it quits now. Maybe you'll walk away in one piece."
###Chapter 10 She Wins


.Emilia fixed Rodger with a cold stare. "You seriously think a performance like that is worth bragging about?"

Rodger scoffed, unconvinced, "You honestly believe you'll get closer than I did?"

Her confidence never wavered. "Watch me."

"Didn't know you were so full of yourself, Emilia." He let out a short, mocking laugh.

Emilia tossed him a sidelong glance. "Now you know," she said, slipping easily into the driver's seat of a brilliant red sports car.

The instant the signal turned green, Emilia's red sports car erupted off the starting line, streaking down the track like living fire.

That launch left the crowd buzzing. Rodger stood frozen, eyes glued to the flash of crimson slicing through the air, disbelief flickering across his face.

When did Emilia master moves like that? How had she hidden this from him for so long?

No. It couldn't be real. Surely she was just reckless,slamming her foot to the floor.

But as that blazing red car tore down the stretch, the entire audience held its breath, transfixed by her every move.

Wilbur's jaw nearly hit the floor. "Hold up, she actually knows what she's doing out there?"

He shot a glance at Elias. "You sure you're not hiding something? How could you possibly know she's got skills like that?"

"I don't know. I'm just as surprised as you are." Elias never took his eyes off the track, voice even and detached.

Despite the chill in his words, his fingers curled tightly against his thigh, betraying the tension he tried to hide.

One wrong move at that speed, and those fuel barrels could turn the race into a disaster in seconds.

All eyes remained glued to the massive display,following the red car as it shot past the critical line with no sign of slowing down.

A collective hush fell over the arena. Some spectators couldn't even watch, covering their faces in dread of what might happen next.

Just as the red car seemed destined to collide with the barrels, it glided to a flawless halt, not a hint of panic in Emilia's control.

No one could believe their eyes.

Rodger, Sebastian, and Violet stood frozen, mouths agape at the impossible sight before them.

"6.1 centimeters!" The referee's voice rang out over the roar of the crowd.

"Unbelievable! I've never seen anything like that! She really did it-she outdrove Rodger!"

"She's fearless, she looks like a superstar, and she just smoked the track. That's everything I could ever want in a woman!"

"I was sure Rodger would take the win. I guess I was dead wrong about her."

Sebastian nursed his bruised cheek, muttering in disbelief, "No way. Rodger can't lose to her. There's just no way..."

"Maybe Emilia just got lucky, but you have to admit,that was something special." Violet's voice barely rose above a whisper, sweet on the surface but icy underneath.

Inside, her thoughts seethed. Why couldn't Emilia have just crashed and burned? That woman deserved nothing less.

Rodger stood rooted to the spot, dazed and unable to accept that defeat had come at Emilia's hands.

Emilia approached him with an easy laugh. "Piece of cake."

Rodger's eyes narrowed, bitter and cold. "Don't get cocky.You just stumbled into this win."

·"So what? The scoreboard doesn't lie. I won, Rodger,and you lost. That's all that matters." Emilia didn't flinch. "Now, about the Mitchell Group sares-hand over the 20%. That was the deal."

Rodger's jaw clenched. "Transfers like that aren't instant. It'll take time to put your name on those shares."

Emilia refused to budge. "Not a chance. You're settling this right here, right now."

He bristled, frustration mounting. "You're really starting to push your luck, Emilia."

"I'm just taking what I earned, nothing more. It's not my fault you made such a reckless bet." Emilia flashed him a sly, triumphant smile.
Leaning in, she dropped her voice. "And I've heard today's bets broke records. I'm walking away with at least five hundred million. So thank you, Rodger-not just for the shares, but for making me a very rich woman."
###Chapter 11 Transfer


.Rodger's temper snapped the moment Emilia finished speaking. His face clouded over, every muscle pulled tight with rage he couldn't mask.
"You only pulled through because luck favored you.Don't get too full of yourself," he wNarned,voice low.

A sly grin spread across Emilia's face, and her eyes flashed with challenge. "However it happened,the victory is mine. Now keep your word. You're the CEO of the Mitchell Group, aren't you? Surely a man of your position won't stoop to breaking a promise."

Emilia cut him off before he could object. "You might want to think this over. There are plenty of influential eyes watching, including Mr. Dixon. He vouched for me, and he's more than equipped to hold you to your word. And don't forget-I hold the treatment slot from Asclepius. If I decided to leverage that and partner up with the right people, Mitchell Group might just go under." She delivered each line with the ease of a breeze,yet there was a sharpness to her tone, each word coated in playful ridicule as she locked eyes with Rodger.

Rodger said through gritted teeth, "You really have the nerve to threaten me?"

Suspicion flickered in his mind. If Emilia truly held Asclepius's favor, she could make those heavyweights in the arena turn against him in a heartbeat.

Rodger doubted her claim, but he wasn't willing to gamble everything on a hunch. If he called her bluff and lost, his entire company would be wiped out.

After wrestling with his options, he knew what he had to do.

"That's exactly what I'm doing. I have the upper hand after all," said Emilia, her grin smug enough to make his blood boil.

His whole body trembled as fury swallowed him.Rodger's fists clenched harder until his knuckles whitened. He couldn't believe he had once overlooked how infuriatingly cocky she could be, how her very words made his teeth grind.

"Fine! I'llmake the arrangements at once. I'll contact the lawyers so the share transfer documents can be signed under their witness."

With no escape left, Rodger pulled out his phone and started dialing.

Their words faded into the background, the crowd left guessing at what passed between them. Though most people cared little for the details of their deal.All were waiting to see who would be chosen by Asclepius.

Not a single person dared step away, afraid of missing the moment the announcement broke.

Only when a cluster of sharply dressed men made their entrance did everyone's attention swing back to the center of the arena.

"Those lawyers are the top in Oticester. What business do they have here?" "Must be for the transfer of the Mitchell Group's shares. Still, what I really want to know is which patient the famous healer is going to pick."

"Can you believe that woman? She pulled off a win right before everyone's eyes and then forced Rodger to start the share transfer on the spot."

The audience's voices floated just above a whisper,their excitement barely contained. Meanwhile, a faint,satisfied smile ghosted across Elias's lips.

He admired how Emilia held her ground so fearlessly.That unshakable composure revealed her strength in ways that words never could.

Wilbur let out a soft click of his tongue and nodded with something close to respect. "She's nothing like the weepy, uncertain woman I imagined she'd be," he said.

The only answer Elias gave was a growing smnile,pride glowing in his eyes. Suspicion clouded Rodger's face as he glanced at the formidable legal team assembled in front of him."You think I can't be trusted?"

He always planned to use his company's lawyers, but Emilia had gone above and beyond, summoning the city's best.

Did she truly believe he was that unreliable?

Without sparing him much of a glance, Emilia said courteously to the attorneys, "I'll leave this in your hands. Thank you for your assistance."

"You can rely on us, Ms. Harris. Everything will be managed properly," one of them assured.

Rodger, ignored and dismissed, boiled inside. This was not the scene he had envisioned. How could Emilia be so firm, so indifferent to the history they once shared? That cold finality carved a hollow place in his heart.

It didn't take long before the transfer documents were signed and sealed.

Rodger's expression soured as he shot a final,frosty look at Emilia before walking away.

Then, just as he moved to leave, her voice rang out behind him. The words that followed made his expression sink to its darkest shade yet.
###Chapter 12 Mortal Enemy


.Rodger turned around, eyes wide as if he couldn't trust what he'd just heard from Emilia.

"Come again? What did you just say?" he asked,disbelief and anger etched in every word.

Emilia didn't bother answering him directly. She raised her voice so everyone could hear, saying, "Is Webster Garza here? I'm ready to sell twenty percent of the Mitchell Group shares to you-at a price far below market value."

She had already checked that Webster would be present-her research had been thorough before she ever set foot onstage.

The very mention of Webster's name sent a ripple of shock through the crowd. Rodger's long-standing rival was about to become a shareholder. The news sparked chaos, people. whispering and gawking at each other in amazement. "Unbelievable! She's turning over her prize to the one person Rodger can't stand."
"Isn't that just spiteful? This must be revenge, and it runs deep. I wonder what happened between them."

"Some say Rodger never looked at her because his heart belonged to his first love. Maybe all that love twisted into resentment."

Elias, perched quietly in his wheelchair, caught every word swirling around him. The crowd's gossip about Emilia's feelings made his brow knit with unease.Was it really possible she turned against Rodger out of some wounded longing?

"Emilia! Have you lost your mind? Webster is my mortal enemy!" Rodger yelled in disbelief.

To him, this was not only a personal humiliation but a stain on the Mitchell family name. The thought of his rival holding their shares was unbearable.

"That's your problem, not mine," Emilia answered coolly, one brow arched as though his rage amused her. Rodger's temper flared again, words coming out through gritted teeth. "Are you even aware of what you're about to start?"

He couldn't comprehend how she could go so far,convinced that she'd burn everything down if she couldn't have her way.

"So what if I am? You all keep pushing me, so don't be surprised if I push back harder," Emilia replied with a mocking smile.

Rodger took long breaths, trying desperately to keep his composure from slipping entirely. He dropped his tone, searching for sympathy. "Grandpa would be heartbroken if he saw this. Don't you want him to rest peacefully?"

"Don't try to use the dead to sway me," said Emilia,her expression unchanged. In her mind, the debt owed to Arthur was almost settled. If the Mitchell family had left her alone, she wouldn't have been so relentless. However, they chose to start this, so she saw no reason not to fight back. Rodger's hands curled into fists, frustration bubbling beneath his skin. Not even invoking Arthur's name could budge Emilia now. He wondered if the divorce had wounded her so deeply that all she had left was spite.

"You can sell those shares back to me," Rodger said,forcing himself to sound reasonable, convinced he was offering her the greatest compromise.

"That won't happen. I've made up my mind to hand them to Webster," Emilia responded, not a hint of hesitation in her voice.①

"Emilia Harris!" he growled, her name breaking between his teeth.

"That's my name," Emilia replied, her lips curled in a mocking smile.

"I'll take the shares," Webster remarked, hurrying over with a glint of victory in his eye as he glanced at Rodger.
For as long as Webster could remember, Rodger had cast a long shadow over him. Who would have guessed the tables would turn so completely?crowd might not have known Emilia's past with Rodger, but Webster did. Without Emilia's support,Rodger never would have gained the upper hand.Before she appeared, he and Rodger had been deadlocked, neither able to claim the lead.

Only someone as blind as Rodger could have driven away a woman as powerful as Emilia. Webster had tasted defeat at Emilia's hands before, and she had pressured him not to reveal her marriage to the world.

Watching Webster now, Rodger felt an unease crawl into his chest. His rival stood straighter, carried more confidence, as if a powerful ally had finally stepped behind Webster.
###Chapter 13 Transfer Again


Watching Webster bask in his own triumph, Rodger's gut twisted. There was a time when Rodger had pushed Webster to the edge, leaving him helpless.Now, the tables had flipped. Someone had to be propping Webster up- there was no way he'd act this bold on his own.

Realizing that Emilia actually meant to hand over the shares to his worst rival, Rodger lunged forward,panic written all over his face.

He clamped his hand around Emilia's wrist and demanded, "Do you truly mean to sell those shares to him?"

"You don't have a say in my business," Emilia replied with a chill in her voice.

"You-" Rodger began, his grip tightening as if to punish her, but before he could act further, another hand clamped down hard on his. Rodger looked up and found Webster grinning back at him, smug and unbothered, which only fueled Rodger's frustration.

"Webster! Take your hands off me!" shouted Rodger.

"Look at you-getting all worked up. Aren't you a little old to be picking fights with a woman?" Webster taunted, laughter bubbling in his tone.

"This has nothing to do with you. It's a private mnatter,so stay out of it," Rodger managed to say through clenched teeth, his eyes full of warning.
"A private matter? Funny, I didn't realize Ms. Harris was part of your family." Webster said with feigned confusion, deliberately pretending not to understand.

Rodger could see exactly what Webster was doing but refused to let him get under his skin, even as anger boiled just beneath the surface.

"Let go of me, or you'll regret it," Rodger threatened,his patience running thin.

"I'd like to see how," Webster replied with a soft chuckle, entirely unshaken.

Webster understood perfectly well that Rodger wouldn't last a second against him without Emilia's support. Now that twenty percent of the Mitchell Group shares were set to land in his pocket,confidence washed over Webster like a rising tide.

Frustration tightened Rodger's jaw. The more he watched Webster's smug grin, the more convinced he became that a powerful ally stood behind his adversary.

The crowd watched the three, murmuring their theories about whatever tangled connection might bind them.

Wilbur wrinkled his brow and mumbled, "Wasn't Webster always Rodger's sworn enemy? Since when did Webster start cozying up to Emilia?"

He stroked his chin, sucking in a breath as a wild thought struck him. "What if she belonged to Webster all along? Maybe she drew near to Rodger out of love for Webster, just so she could steal the Mitchell family's secrets for him?" At that, a chill swept over Elias. His stare settled on Wilbur, sharp and unblinking. "If she's able to bring your greatest rival to his knees, I bet you'd be cheering for her louder than anyone," he said.

That snapped Wilbur back to his senses. He chuckled and tapped his forehead."That's right! The enemy of my enemy is my friend. My brain really went off the rails for a second."



Rodger kept his gaze fixed on Emila,refusing to let her walk away. "I'll give you one last chance..."

Emilia's expression darkened as she swatted his hand hard.

"Ouch!" Rodger yelped, wincing as his grip loosened on its own.

Webster stepped back, tossing Rodger a look that shouted,"Serves you right."

"Save that chance for yourself," Emilia replied,finalizing the transfer of her shares to Webster, all under the watchful eyes of the legal team.

Once the deal was sealed, Webster leaned toward Rodger with a sly grin. "Want to hear a little secret about her?"
###Chapter 14 Reach Out


Rodger's brow knit in frustration. What secret could Emilia possibly have? And why would he need to hear about it from someone he despised? Was Webster really trying to claim he knew more about Emilia?

After three years of marriage, Rodger was certain he understood her better than anyone.If there were any secrets, he would have heard them from Emilia herself, not from Webster. Clearly, Webster just wanted to rile him up.

"Secret?" Rodger scoffed, rollinghis eyes. "What could she be hiding that I wouldn't already know about? I don't need you playing messenger."

All patience gone, Rodger grabbed Webster by the collar, his voice low and dangerous. "Keep your distance from her, You'd be smart not to get involved."

"Why should I listen to you? Don't forget, the two of you are done." Webster only shrugged, his grin widening.

Watching Rodger squirm almost made Webster laugh. He found the whole thing entertaining-Rodger was completely in the dark about what he'd truly lost. It was a relief, honestly. If Rodger ever discovered the truth about Emilia, Webster was sure that he would probably spend the rest of his days under Rodger's thumb.

"We're still married until the entire divorce process is fully completed. So here's my advice-back off and keep your schemes away from her," Rodger warned,his glare sharp as glass. "Push me, and you'll regret it."

"That's cute." Webster let out a mocking laugh,rolling his eyes.

Rodger's eyes narrowed. "I hope you're listening."

Webster's grin faded. In a flash, he grabbed Rodger by the collar, eyes blazing. "You seriously think you matter? Face it, Rodger. Without Emilia, you're nothing but a shadow." Rodger completely missed the point, twisting Webster's words to fit his own paranoia-sure that Webster wanted Emilia for himself.

Rage boiling over, Rodger's fist shot out, smashing into Webster. The next second, both men were locked in a fierce scuffle, fists flying as the shouting grew louder.

All around the two, people stared in shock at the screen, which was livestreaming their fight, their jaws dropping as the confrontation unfolded.

"Whoa, what's happening? Are they really brawling over that woman? She must be something else to have those two at each other's throats!"

"Honestly, it's probably more about business than romance. Those two have been rivals forever. Anyone would lose it if their enemy ended up with a chunk of their company's shares."

"True, but let's not kid ourselves. She may have walked out, but the fight didn't stop. She's definitely a catalyst-none of this would be happening if she  hadn't gotten involved." While the crowd kept up their speculation, Wilbur leaned in and spoke quietly. "Should we approach Ms.Harris?"

Before Elias could answer, the crowd erupted,pointing at the giant display.

"Look! Asclepius displayed his message!"

Every eye turned to the massive screen just as a new message appeared. It read, "The recipient for my treatment has been chosen. You'll be contacted in three days. Please remain patient."

Wilbur's brow furrowed. "No name, and now there's a three-day wait. Maybe we should reach out to Ms.Harris now, just in case. We can't risk someone else making her an offer first."

Elias nodded without hesitation. "Do it."



On the penthouse floor of The Gilded Fork.

"Say what you need to say." Emilia didn't waste time. Wilbur managed a bright smile and got right to the point. "Ms. Harris, I appreciate your candor-we actually do need your help." He then turned expectantly to Elias.
###Chapter 15 Rejection


.Elias wasted no time. "I want to make a deal with you."

Emilia arched a brow. "And what sort of deal are you proposing?"

With a cold look, Elias replied, "I want to purchase the treatment rights you secured from Asclepius.State your terms. Whatever they are, I'll accept them."

His fingers drummed a steady rhythm against his thigh as he waited for her answer.
Meanwhile, Sloane lingered over her food with quiet amusement, the curve of a smile tugging at her lips.

Everything was falling into place. Elias took the bait as they wished. Should Emilia choose to accept Elias's offer, she would get the chance she needed to slip into the Dixon family and hunt down the other half of the treasure map. "I'm going to need some time to think about it,"Emilia replied, voice even.

That caught Sloane off guard. She looked up,eyes darting between the men across the table.

Why would Emilia need to think over such a golden opportunity? Hadn't she been waiting for a perfect excuse to step into the Dixon family's world without drawing suspicion?

Wilbur quickly chimed in, "Ms. Harris, if you're willing to give up the treatment spot, we'll handle your husband for you-or just say how much money you want."

Nervous energy bubbled inside Wilbur. Someone else could swoop in and take the treatment away from Emilia at any moment.
Sloane added eagerly, "He's right, Emilia. This is your best chance to bury that scumbag once and for all..."

Still, deep down, she knew Emilia didn't need their help to crush Rodger. Emilia's voice stayed steady. "Treatment from Asclepius is beyond value. I can't agree without weighing it carefully."

Wilbur opened his mouth to say more, but Elias silenced him with a raised hand.

"That's perfectly fine. Ms. Harris, reach out whenever you've made up your mind. Anything you want can be arranged." He offered her a business card."Here. Keep my contact details."

"Alright." Emilia took the card. "Thanks for this meal.If there's nothing else,we'll head out now."

"I'll have someone escort you out," Elias suggested.

Emilia waved him off. "There's really no need.If I ever decide to part with the opportunity, Mr. Dixon, you'll be the first person I approach."

"Then I owe you my thanks," Elias said gratefully.

While the two women disappeared from view, Elias stared after them, his eyes narrowing as he mulled over what had happened. Wilbur slapped his thigh in frustration. "Unbelievable!She wouldn't even bite when we dangled the chance to crush her husband?"

He had been sure that Emilia would have jumped at the chance to embarrass that lowlife and get her revenge.

With steady composure, Elias remarked, "She made the right call. Asclepius's treatment is extremely precious. When life hangs by a thread, it can tip the balance.Anyone with sense would be cautious. If she had accepted without hesitation, I'd have doubted her."

Wilbur grew even more agitated. "I can't believe how calm you are! I'm ready to tear my hair out. What if someone else snatches up her treatment spot?"

Without emotion, Elias responded, "Put someone on her tail. She'll need protection."

"Got it." Wilbur wasted no time pulling out his phone and making arrangements. Just outside the restaurant, Sloane leaned close and whispered, "Why didn't you takehis deal?"

"If I said yes too fast, he would have started doubting my intentions," Emilia answered, keeping her voice low.

Sloane's eyes sparkled as she smiled, then slung her arm around Emilia's shoulders and flashed a quick thumbs-up.

"Sharp and fearless as always," Sloane remarked.

Without warning, a black van skidded to a stop, and a group of armed men spilled out, raising their weapons at them.
###Chapter 16 Being Kidnapped


Sloane shot her hands up, fingers spread, terrified that even a heartbeat's delay could cost her and Emilia their lives.

Were they being targeted for something they did?What had they done to end up getting aimed at by guns?

Those men moved with the recklessness of amateurs rather than the precision of professional killers. For a split second, she wondered if Emilia's secret life as the head of an assassin's group had come to light and drawn all the wrong people.

Emilia's thoughts raced, worried more about Sloane's safety than her own. Instead of jumping into action,she let her whole body shake, fear etched deeply on her face. "Who-" she began.

"Shut up!" A sharp bark from one of the men silenced her. "Both of you, move it! In the van Within moments, they were shoved into the back of the black vehicle, which shot away from the curb and melted into traffic.



Inside the private room at Gilded Fork.

"This is a disaster! They've been taken!" Wilbur blurted out, his hands trembling as he relayed the news.

Elias slammed his wine glass onto the table, his eyes cold as steel. "We're getting them back. No matter what."

Wilbur, already rolling Elias' wheelchair toward the exit, said, "I've got someone tailing the van. We're not letting anything happen to them."

Those thugs had the nerve to abduct the two women just outside Gilded Fork. They were asking for trouble.

By the time they hurried out, the black van had melted into the shadows toward the town's edge. Emilia and Sloane had their hands bound behind them and their mouths sealed with tape.

"You two better sit tight unless you want things to get ugly!" A bald man glared down at themn,his eyes filled with malice. Satisfied with their frightened nods, he turned his back. Bound and gagged, the women had no chance of getting free.

"Boss, the client wants us to rough them up a bit,maybe smack them around and cut them loose?"

The bald man's mouth twisted into a sneer. "That's what the first client ordered, but someone new wants them to suffer even more this time."

"Why don't we have some fun with them? These two are gorgeous. Way better than the usual girls we mess with. This is going to be exciting."

"Looks like it'll take the whole crew to keep them busy tonight,right?"

Their laughter rang out,low and crude.

"Go ahead and enjoy yourselves, but don't go too far. We can fetch a good price for them if they're still breathing," the bald man instructed.

"That's why you're in charge, boss. Always planning for payday. With the cash we'll make off these two,we're set for a while."

Emilia's eyes hardened, a flicker of deadly intent crossing her face.

None of them seemed to realize they were looking straight at their own graves.

Sloane's stomach churned at their words, and she shot a look at Emilia.

That single look from Emilia steadied her, though guilt pinched at her chest. Emilia had given up fighting only to protect her. Otherwise, Emilia would've struck back without hesitation.



On the edge of the city, the van came to a stop beside an old warehouse.

"Get a move on! Slack off and I'll put a bullet in you," snarled the bald man.

Emilia stumbled forward, almost losing her footing as she was shoved along. She worked her fingers behind her back, slowly loosening the ropes.Patience was her weapon now.

Inside the dim warehouse, both women were forced to the floor, their backs pressed against a concrete pillar.

Sloane stayed alert, following every signal Emilia sent her way, ready to jump in the second she was needed.

Before anything else happened, the bald man spoke up. "Keep your hands off them for now. I need to make a call before we move them out."

"Got it, boss." The men lounged nearby, not even bothering to keep a close watch. The thought that either woman could escape never crossed their minds.

In their minds, the women were broken already. They had trembled the whole ride here, nearly in tears, and Free your loved	would never dare try to flee. They assumed both were too weak to stand, nothing left but sobbing wrecks.
###Chapter 17 Rescue


Sloane edged a little closer and murmured, "So,when do you think we should make our move?"

Emilia kept her voice low. "We should hold off for now."

Sloane furrowed her brow and leaned in. "Do you think it's still too early?"

Emilia glanced at her, whispering, "Let's wait. Maybe someone will come saving us."

The silence stretched, and then Sloane's face lit up."Mr.Dixon?"

"That's a smart guess." Emilia smirked, and the corners of her mouth curled up.

She could take action right then if she wanted to,but part of her wanted to see whether Elias would show up. These fools had been reckless enough to snatch them so close to Gilded Fork, and she was pretty sure Elias would never let that slide.

Plus, she held onto something Elias was after, and she was counting on that to bring him here.

The bald man had been gone long enough for the others to notice, and soon one of them looked around, obviously concerned. "What's taking the boss so long? You two, go see what's up."

The two henchmen nodded and hurried out.

A few tense moments passed. Nobody returned, and the silence outside only grew heavier.

Concern flickered in their eyes as the remaining three men glanced at one another.

Each man tightened his grip on his weapon, rising sharply and striding toward the entrance of the warehouse.

Before any of them could reach the door, muffled gunshots rang out behind them. All three dropped to Free your loved  the floor, struck down before they even understood what was happening.

A tense silence settled in, and Sloane's voice shook as she whispered, "Did you hear that? Someone's here."

Emilia leaned closer and spoke in a steady tone."You don't have to be afraid. I won't let anything happen to you."

Relief swept over Sloane. "Thanks. I knew you'd.watch out for me."

Suddenly,shouts and hurried footsteps sounded at the entrance. Then Elias's crisp, commanding voice broke through the chaos. "Leave no trace behind."

His words sliced through the air, leaving no room for argument.

Even seated in his wheelchair, Elias carried himself with an effortless confidence, every angle of his face carved with cool authority.

The tension in the room seemed to thicken,making it hard for anyone to breathe.

Wilbur rolled Elias forward with practiced ease.

"Set them free." Without missing a beat, Elias nodded once at Wilbur, his stare icy.

Wilbur wasted no time and rushed over to Sloane first, working at the knots with practiced hands.

Before he could reach Emilia, Sloane stepped in with a determined look. "Let me."

By then, Emilia had already worked her own wrists free, and Sloane wanted to keep Wilbur from noticing anything out of place.

Sloane fumbled with the last of the ropes, heping Emilia loosen the bindings in a hurry.
Both women looked a bit worse for wear, their hair tousled and their clothes rumpled from the ordeal.

Elias narrowed his eyes and stared straight at Emilia,a hint of doubt flickering in his usually unreadable gaze. Not a trace of fear crossed her face as she took in the aftermath of the violence around them. Maybe she was too stunned to react. Or maybe she just refused to let her fear show.

A shimmer caught Elias's attention, and he realized her eyes looked a little red, as if, she was holding back tears. Something about that struck him hard.She seemed genuinely shaken.

His skepticism faded, and his expression softened.For a moment, a rare warmth surfaced behind his wintry stare.

With a calm and almost distant voice, Elias reached out his hand. "You're safe now."

Emilia glanced at his hand, noticing how elegant and strong it looked. She slowly looked up, her expression shy but steady, her eyes meeting his with quiet resolve.

Elias gently lifted his hand in invitation, signaling her to take it.

With hesitant movements, Emilia slipped her hand into his, unsure yet trusting.

The gentle warmth of her touch surprised Elias,stirring something in him he hadn't expected.

She had kept her composure at the racetrack,and even back at Gilded Fork, nothing had rattled her. But facing the kidnappers now, she looked genuinely shaken.

A cold glint flashed in Elias's eyes as he weighed his next move. He should have made those thugs suffer before their deaths.
###Chapter 18 Uncharacteristic


Those kidnappers deserved far worse than what they got. That same thought seemed to hit both Elias and Emilia all at once.
Elias couldn't shake the feeling that death was too kind for the terror those men had unleashed on her.

For Emilia, the anger ran even deeper. With all the pain they'd caused and the lives they'd destroyed through their crimes, a quick end was nowhere near enough punishment.

Elias offered his hand and helped her to her feet,moving with a calm patience.

Watching from the side, Wilbur could hardly believe what he was seeing. Of all people, he knew just what an extreme clean freak Elias was. If anyone so much as bumped into Elias by accident, he would change into fresh clothes without a word. Touching someone willingly? That was unheard of. Elias made a habit of keeping everyone at arm's length, rarely letting even trusted friends close. Yet here he was, letting a complete stranger grasp his hand as if it was the most natural thing in the world.

If even Elias could do something so out of character,what else was possible?

Wilbur found himself staring at Emilia, his mind racing with questions.

What was it about her that made Elias throw all his rules aside? He'd never seen Elias take anyone's side like that at the track-and now this.

Wilbur couldn't ignore the strange tension building between the two. Everything about Elias screamed uncharacteristic behavior.

"I really appreciate you coming for me. Thank you."Emilia turned to both men, her eyes shining with gratitude.
Instead of responding, Elias tightened his jaw and let go of her hand, an odd wave of irritation rising in his chest. The air around him seemed to grow heavier as his mood shifted, shadows deepening in his eyes.

Emilia picked up on his sudden chill and awkwardly pulled her hand away, confusion flickering across her face.

People always whispered that Elias was impossible to read, and maybe those rumors weren't so far off.

"If you ever want to repay this favor, please think of us first when you decide to cash in the favor that Asclepius owes you, alright?" said Wilbur, eager to.get a word in.

"Wilbur." Elias shot him a cold look.

Wilbur quickly tried to cover for himself. "I just want your leg to get better, that's all. And it's not like I'm wrong,is it?"

Elias turned back to Emilia, his eyes losing none of their sharpness. "Don't let this weigh on you. You owe me nothing."

"Thank you, Mr. Dixon. If I ever let go of that opportunity, you'll be the first person I contact," Emilia said,her voice steady.

Wilbur's face lit up. "That's great news! You have no idea how happy that makes me."

Meanwhile, Elias stayed stoic, his expression unreadable.

His tone turned cold. "Where can we take you? Give me the address."
Emilia replied softly, "I don't have my own place right now. I'm staying with my friend.Just drop me there."

Elias's eyes flicked to Sloane, cold and sharp. "You mean her?"

"That's right," Emilia answered.


Silence filled the car as they drove. Emilia sat next to Elias in the back, both of them staring straight ahead.

She angled her body slightly toward the window,a small movement that Elias picked up on right away.His brow tightened. "Do I make you nervous?" Elias asked without thinking.

Emilia turned toward him, her brows drawing together. "Not at all."

He waited a moment, then spoke again, his voice quieter. "Were you frightened back there?"

"Maybe a bit..." Emilia hesitated, then nodded a little.

As the head of Inferno, she was no stranger to violence and had seen far worse than what happened tonight. Still, she had to pretend in Elias' presence.Her true identity was a secret she guarded fiercely,knowing far too many adversaries waited for any sign of weakness.

The instant Elias moved toward her, Emilia's instincts kicked in, and she silently braced herself to strike if he got too close.
###Chapter 19 Consequences


Thankfully, Emilia managed to restrain herself,resisting the urge to attack and blow her cover.

Elias reached over with surprising gentleness and placed a reassuring hand on her head.

"You're safe now. No one's going to hurt you," he said, his voice carrying a rare mix of coolness and comfort.

Shock flickered in Emilia's eyes as she met Elias's cool, piercing stare. Everything she'd heard about his distant nature seemed to crumble in that moment.No one would have believed he could be so gentle.Clearly, the rumors didn't tell the whole story.

Up in the front seat, the driver couldn'thelp but stare through the rearview mirror, his mind reeling. Never once had he witnessed his boss act so openly gentle,let alone with a woman. It felt as if he'd wandered into someone else's dream-utterly unreal. For a second, it almost seemed like Elias was teetering on the edge of falling for her.

Emilia pulled away, uncomfortable with the unexpected tenderness, and Elias instantly realized he'd crossed a line.

"My mistake," said Elias, voice low.

"No worries." Emilia offered a small, nervous laugh.

The silence in the car lingered until a sudden alert buzzed from Elias's phone. As he read the message,his entire presence shifted-cold and threatening,as if an invisible chill swept through the air.

Emilia could feel the tension radiating from him,something almost dangerous in the way his jaw tightened. She studied him for a moment,puzzled by his change in mood.

Without looking up, Elias slid his phone back into his pocket and spoke in a clipped, emotionless voice."The people who arranged your kidnapping weren't acting alone. There were two behind it." "Who are they?" Emilia asked, her curiosity sharpening.

She had already planned to track down whoever was responsible, but Elias was giving her the answers before she could even ask.

"Your husband's brother and lover," Elias answered,his tone flat as ice.

Emilia's lips curved in a faint smile. "Thank you for letting me know, Mr. Dixon."

"Do you want me to handle it?" Elias's eyes narrowed just slightly.

"No, I'll take care of it myself." Emilia shook her head,her gaze unwavering.

Elias met her determined gaze, letting a moment pass before he spoke. "If you ever need backup,you know where to find me."

Emilia offered a small, appreciative smile. "I'll keep that in mind, Mr. Dixon." The sleek black Bentley rolled to a stop outside an apartment building.

The driver, hands encased in spotless white gloves,stepped out and opened the rear door with a practiced flourish.

"Ms. Harris, please." He bowed, his tone formal.

Emilia climbed out, giving Elias a polite nod. "Thank you for the ride. Take care getting home."

Elias gave a simple nod, his eyes never leaving her.

Arriving earlier and waiting on the curb, Sloane greeted Emilia with a relieved smile. Together, they waved as the Bentley pulled away into the night.

Sloane leaned close and lowered her voice."We know who set this up-Sebastian and Violet are behind it. You're their target. Sebastian's probably still bitter about you beating his brother in that race.Violet wanted the thugs to rough you up and get blackmail material. So, what's your move? Planning to kidnap them and let them taste their own medicine?" A chill crept into Emilia's eyes, though her lips curled with the hint of a smirk. "I'm in no hurry to deal with them. Where's the fun if we move too soon? The best part is drawing out the game. Besides, Elias is sharper than most people give him credit for. If we go after those two right away, it'll be obvious-and he'll connect the dots, even if he can't prove it. I need to keep my options open with the Dixon family for now."

Sloane scowled, clearly frustrated. "So we just let them get away with it?"

Emilia's grin turned icy. "Far from it. Once our contracts with the Mitchell Group end, cut all ties.Make it public. Let them feel the consequences."

"You got it!" Sloane replied, her smile quick and fierce.

The truth was, the Mitchells owed much of their power in Oticester to Emilia's silent backing.

Emilia's voice grew more thoughtful. "There's something else I need you to investigate."
###Chapter 20 Weight


"What's on your mind?" Sloane asked, her curiosity getting the better of her.

A cunning spark flickered in Emilia's eyes. "Word is,Violet's planning to compete in the national ballet championships. Check if her name's on the roster.If it is, make sure I'm registered, too."

"Consider it done." Sloane gave a confident nod.

With a soft chuckle, Emilia added, "If Violet wants to tear me down, it's only fair I strip away everything she cares about."

"No one as cruel as her should walk away unscathed." Sloane's voice grew sharper, her fists clenched tight.

Every word left Sloane more furious. Violet had crossed every line-hiring mnen to hurt Emilia, plotting for blackmail. It made Sloane's skin crawl.Someone that calculated had probably left a trail of broken lives already.

"A quick victory would be too easy. Let's enjoy the slow unraveling, don't you think?" Emilia's tone stayed light, a sly smile playing on her lips.

"I can't wait to watch them lose everything they built." Sloane matched her smile.

...
Later, Emilia stretched out on her bed, eyes lost in the empty space above, letting her thoughts drift.

Quiet settled around her, and memories began to replay in Emilia's mind-snapshots of Rodger and the winding road of their three-year marriage.

She couldn't pretend it meant nothing. She'd poured her heart into that love, and despite everything,traces of it still lingered.

Sometimes old moments surfaced without warning,stinging her heart with the pain of old wounds.
But she saw things differently now. Loving someone who would never love her back wasn't just foolish-it was a betrayal of herself.

Self-respect mattered. Her willingness to put up with Rodger wasn't simply because she still cared. More than that, she'd felt indebted to Arthur for saving her life all those years ago.

Three years was long enough to carry that weight.It was time to let it go.

A sudden ringtone shattered the quiet,yanking her from her thoughts.

Whatever sorrow lingered in her chest vanished,leaving only the faintest redness in her eyes.

Emilia brushed away the moisture quickly and reached for her phone on the nightstand. She paused when she saw the caller ID. Her lips pressed into a thin line.

Rodger's call-not his name but the word "Honey"lighting up the screen.

Night after night, Emilia had found herself caught between missing Rodger and suffering the sting of love that never went both ways. At some point,she'd changed the custom ringtone she'd set just for him.

Even so, she never bothered to update his contact-the intimate word remained.

Drawing in a steady breath, Emilia picked up the call,he voice cool and unreadable. "What is it?"

Rodger didn't answer right away. When he finally spoke, his words were ice. "Get to the courthouse now.I want this divorce finalized today."

Clearly, he couldn't wait to make Violet official,terrified she'd be branded as the homewrecker if they waited any longer.

Emilia let out a tired sigh. "I'm exhausted, Rodger.Let's handle it tomorrow. I just want to get some rest."

Sleep was all she could think about lately-her whole body craved it.

Rodger's frustration crackled through the line."Stop dragging this out! The agreement's signed and you're still stalling. How much longer do you plan on clinging to the Mitchell name? Without my grandfather, you have no one left on your side.Don't make me push you harder. I'm only being civil because of everything you did these past three years."

His words drew a short, bitter laugh from Emilia."Spare me the act, Rodger. While Arthur was alive,you were already sneaking around with Violet. Don't talk to me about civility. Throughout our marriage,you paraded her around, lavished her with gifts, gave her everything she wanted, and didn't care who saw it. You treated me like I was nothing-like garbage to be tossed aside. And now you say I'm making you be cruel? Look in the mirror and try to find a shred of shame."
###Chapter 21 Settled


An uncomfortable silence lingered on the line,giving Emilia a flicker of hope that Rodger might show an ounce of regret. But her hope vanished with his next words.

"So what? If you hadn't dangled my grandfather's wishes over my head, Violet and I would've had our own happy ending. Face it, Emilia. You were always the outsider forcing your way between us."

Rodger's audacity left her stunned for a heartbeat,but Emilia's laugh rang out, bitter and sharp, as she bolted upright in bed.

"Let's get the facts straight. You were the one left for dead after that wreck-Violet was long gone.I stayed when no one else would, dragging you back from the edge. Now you want to erase all of that, just because you're standing on your own two feet again? Where was your big talk about true love back when you couldn't even sit up without help? Why didn't you leave then?"

Pausing for a second, she continued, "Don't even start blaming me for anything with your grandfather.If you had an ounce of courage, you'd have fought for the woman you claim to love. Crawl if you had to,but don't pretend you didn't want the Mitchell family fortune. But you didn't. You just folded like a coward.Face it-you took everything handed to you, and now you're desperate to make me the villain? That's not what a real man does."

For the first time in ages, Emilia finally let all the resentment pour out, leaving her feeling lighter inside.

A moment of silence followed before Rodger roared,"Emilia!"

With deliberate sweetness, Emilia drawled, "Still here,Mr.Mitchell."

Rodger sounded like he was about to burst, fury practically radiating through the phone.

Through clenched teeth, he warned, "Watch yourself. Push me any further, and you'll walk away with nothing!"

A cold smile curled on Emilia's lips. "Don't waste your breath. Legally, I'm entitled to half of everything,and I wouldn't touch your offer if you doubled it.The more you break your promises, the stronger my position gets. I can hold off on divorcing forever. So tell me, Rodger, who's really the outsider now? No matter what you do, Violet will never be anything more than the other woman."

Emilia gave an exaggerated eye roll, not even slightly rattled by his empty threat. Was he seriously under the impression that he could scare her? Had it not been for Arthur's interference, she would have gone to war for her share of the Mitchell fortune.

If she had, Violet would have been stuck in the shadows, hidden away as nothing more than Rodger's nameless mistress. Knowing him, Rodger would never have let Violet bear such disgrace.

For a split second, Rodger thought he could back her into a corner, only to realize he was outmatched. Emilia's confidence flipped the script.

In his mind, she was nothing but a greedy, superficial woman who finally showed her true intent. She wanted the Mitchells' riches, nothing more. Only Violet, he thought, loved him for himself.

But Rodger wasn't foolish enough to provoke her further. Tricking her into proceeding the divorce was his only option now.

"You promised you'd go to court tomorrow. You're not planning to break your word, are you?" asked Rodger.

As soon as she heard his taunt, Emilia's lips curled into a silent, mocking smile. "I'll be there. Unlike you,I don't back out. All I need is the settlement paperwork, and I'll wrap this up tomorrow."

"Emilia, don't let me down. I expect you to keep your promise."

"Rest assured. A man like you never deserved to be named as my husband in the first place." "You really think you're something special?"

"I know I am. By the way, rumor has it Webster put you in the hospital. I guess you're not nearly as tough as you make out."

"Emilia, don't push me-"
"Relax. Try not to work yourself into a stroke. I'd hate to read about your meltdown in tomorrow's news."

"Enough! We'll settle this at court, Emilia. I'll see you there!" Rodger slammed his phone down, boiling with rage over her biting jabs.

A quiet laugh escaped Emilia as she tossed her phone to the side and stretched out on her bed,feeling a wave of satisfaction.

Nothing felt sweeter than watching a scoundrel suffer, and she was already eager to see Rodger's battered face when tomorrow came.
###Chapter 22 Compassion


The following morning arrived with Emilia sitting in the passenger seat, her phone buzzing insistently.

"Is that guy seriously calling again? What's his deal,ringing you nonstop before the sun's even up?"Sloane muttered, shooting an annoyed look across the dashboard.

Emilia's patience was wearing thin. She swiped to answer and snapped, "Why are you so desperate?I said I'm on my way. Stop blowing up my phone!"

Before Rodger could get a single word in, she ended the call.
Rodger, still battered from the previous night and stuck sulking in the back seat of his own car, was left fuming-his response cut off before it even started.

Sloane caught Emilia's calm as Emilia slipped her phone into her bag. "You mean to tell me you still have his number saved?" asked Sloane. "Not at all. I wiped his number ages ago," Emilia answered, her voice even, gaze never leaving the road ahead.

She'd cleared out every trace of Rodger-his contact, their conversations, every reminder.

Whatever came next, she was determined to move forward. Rodger was nothing more than a footnote in her past.

Without warning, Sloane slammed on the brakes,jolting the car to a sudden halt.

"Looks like there's a pileup up ahead," Sloane muttered, peering out at the gridlocked street. "No way to turn around here. What's the plan?"

Emilia weighed her options quickly. "I'll hop out and grab a cab at the next corner. Just swing by the courthouse to get me after I finish."

"Yeah, that's probably best," Sloane replied with a sigh.

Emilia stepped out of the car and threaded her way forward through the cluster of stalled vehicles. Up ahead, she spotted an old man crouched on the curb, clutching a little girl who couldn't have been more than six. His whole body shook as he sobbed,grief written across his wrinkled face.

"Please... please help my great-granddaughter," the old man pleaded, his voice raw and desperate.

Emilia's eyes landed on the child's bloodied clothes and pale face. In a heartbeat, she sized up the severity of the wounds.

Even if they made it to the hospital, she doubted any regular doctor would dare touch a case this bad-except maybe Landon Green, a legendary surgeon with hands steady enough for miracles.

Emilia knew she could save the girl if she tried. But she was supposed to be at the courthouse, finalizing the end of her marriage.
Normally, she kept to herself and never got involved.But the old man's tears struck a chord, bringing back a rush of memories-Arthur, the grandfather of her husband who had loved her fiercely, more than blood ever could. Her eyes stung with emotion.

Arthur used to say his only real regret was never having a daughter or a granddaughter of his own,but he'd thank Emilia over and over for filling that empty space in his life.

On his deathbed, he'd gripped her hand with everything he had left, pouring out memories, hopes,and quiet wishes-most of all, that he could have lived long enough to meet her future child, the great-grandchild he'd dreamed of holding.

Arthur's illness had struck with brutal speed, offering no time for goodbyes or second chances. Emilia knew there was nothing she could have done to change the outcome. Still, she found some comfort in the thought that he hadn't suffered for long.

Looking at the wounded child in the street, Emilia saw echoes of the love Arthur had given her-this little girl must mean everything to her grandfather.Her resolve melted away.

Without hesitating, Emilia pulled out her phone and dialed a number she hadn't touched in ages. ·..
Inside Oticester's most prestigious hospital.
"Dr. Green, there's someone offering a hefty sum for a meeting with you-"

The hospital director stood respectfully in Landon's office,barely hiding his nerves.

"Not interested. StilI nothing from Asclepius?"Landon cut him off with a wave, irritation etched into every line of his face.

He'd traveled all the way to Oticester chasing whispers that Asclepius had resurfaced here.And he was one of the few people who knew that Asclepius was actually a woman.

But just as quickly as Asclepius had appeared, she vanished-leaving behind nothing but rumors and dead ends. No one had been able to reach her.

A dark worry gnawed at Landon. What if something had happened? What if she was gone for good?

The hospital director adjusted his glasses, clearly at a loss. "I'm sorry, Dr. Green. Asclepius moves like a ghost. We ordinary people don't stand a chance of finding him."

He'd burned through every contact, turned over every stone, and still had nothing to show for it.
Suddenly, Landon's phone started to ring. "HHonestly,these telemarketers are relentless."
###Chapter 23 Landon Green


Rumors had started swirling about Asclepius turning up in Oticester, but Landon couldn't find a single solid lead to confirm it. The whole thing felt like chasing shadows.

His day had already taken a turn for the worse,and those nonstop spam calls were only making his mood darker.

He had every intention of ignoring his phone,but that relentless ringing wormed its way into his head,grating on his nerves.

Normally, Landon's temper burned hot, but something about performing surgery always brought him back down to earth, like the one thing that could truly steady him.

Finally fed up, he snatched up his phone, fully prepared to give the caller a piece of his mind.

Nearby, the hospital director did his best impression of a statue, hoping he wouldn't become the next target of Landon's outburst.

People in the hospital all knew Landon's reputation-he didn't care if one was rich, powerful, or just another doctor; if someone got in his way, this person was in for a tongue-lashing.,

Some wondered aloud how someone with Landon's reputation could be so abrasive, as if every harsh word chipped away at his legendary status.

Landon couldn't care less about the whispers or what anyone thought of his blunt approach. He believed in settling things directly, never backing away from a confrontation.

Nobody ever criticized him to his face, though.With his status as one of the top surgeons in the world, it wasn't worth the risk of making him an enemy.

Everyone knew there was no telling when they-or someone they loved-might need his steady hands in a life-or-death moment.

When it mattered most, Landon's skill in the  operating room could tip the balance between hope and despair.

Outside of surgery, Landon was unpredictable, his temper never far from the surface. But the moment he stepped up to the operating table, everything about him changed.

In the operating room, he was the embodiment of calm and control, his focus razor-sharp, and his record for saving lives unmatched.

Landon braced himself as the line connected,expecting nothing but another pitch from a persistent caller and preparing to let his frustration boil over.

He knew telemarketers had it rough, but their endless calls day after day left him with no patience.Even blocking them felt like a losing battle.

"Landon..." the caller began.

The familiar voice on the other end stopped Landon cold. Every muscle tensed with disbelief and hope. Without thinking, Landon blurted out, "Asclepius!"His voice shook, and emotion prickled at the corners of his eyes.

It was really her-Asclepius. She was alive, and she was reaching out.

The hospital director, who had been quietly eavesdropping and half-expecting Landon to snap,nearly jumped at Landon's reaction.

When Landon spoke the name, the director almost stumbled in shock.

Was it possible? Asclepius was reaching out to Landon? Why on earth would he be contacting Landon directly? Was Landon the one Asclepius had chosen?

But Landon was healthy, and Asclepius was famous for taking on only the most complicated, unsolvable medical cases.

As the director tried to make sense of what he'd just heard, Landon couldn't hide his happiness. His entire attitude shifted, and even through the phone, his respect was obvious.

Not even a meeting with the president had ever pulled this much genuine warmth from Landon.Could it truly be Asclepius on the other end of the line?

The director felt a jolt of excitement run through him,his heart pounding so hard he was sure everyone could hear it. Sweat slicked his palms as the possibility sank in.

Meeting Asclepius in person was something most doctors only dared to hope for.

"I've got it covered. Leave the rest to me," Landon responded, his voice steady and sure.

After hanging up, Landon fixed the director with a grave look. "Get an operating room ready. I want the area clear-no one gets close except my team and me."

The director nodded so. many times it looked like he might sprain his neck. "Absolutely, right away." Still, he couldn't shake his curiosity and ended up asking, "Will Asclepius be performing?"
###Chapter 24 Desperation


Landon fixed the director with a stern look."Asclepius will be working with my surgical team under disguise. Until the operation is done, this stays between us. Not a word to anyone. After the surgery,you can release a statement that.Asclepius performed a procedure here. That'll bring the hospital some positive attention. But that's where it ends. There are details you keep quiet about-and l expect you know the line."

"I understand, Dr. Green. Not a single detail will leak.I'll take care of it right away," the director said, then hurried out the door.

He knew better than to breathe a word about Asclepius-people who talked too much in this world tended to disappear without à trace.

Not that it mattered. He'd never even seen Asclepius himself. Even if someone tried to pry it out of him,he had nothing concrete to offer. There was no way he'd mention Landon's secret contact, either. A blessing could turn into a curse in an instant; one rumor, and chaos would descend.
He hadn't climbed to the top of Oticester's medical world by being reckless.



Inside the hospital, chaos buzzed through the hallways.

"If this young woman hadn't stepped in with first aid,there's no way the little girl would have survived the trip here!"

"Quick, boring her into the ER!"

The medical team rushed the child away,disappearing behind swinging doors as every second counted.

Emilia paced the hallway, nerves fraying as she waited for Landon's call.

The child's injuries were so grave that not a single doctor in Oticester dared take on the operation. Suddenly, a loud thud startled her.

The elderly man-his clothes soaked in blood-collapsed to his knees in front of Emilia,eyes swimming with tears. "Thank you, miss. If you hadn't stepped in, my great-granddaughter would be-"

"Please, you don't need to do this," Emilia said quickly, reaching to help him up.

Before he could say another word, the ER doors burst open.
"We're sorry. The injuries are too complex. We don't have anyone here who can perform the surgery..."

The news hit the old man like a sledgehammer.

"Doctor, please! I'll pay anything-just save her.I have money, whatever you want!" He broke down,pleading desperately as the medical staff exchanged helpless glances.

"It isn't about money," the doctor said softly. "We simply don't have the expertise for this case. We wish we could do more, but..." No doctor ever wanted to give up, but this was beyond their reach.

Emilia stepped in, her tone urgent. "Is Dr. Landon Green in the building? Please, could you ask the director to bring him here?"

The staff exchanged startled glances. None of them had heard that Landon was actually in the hospital today. All they knew was that someone important was paying a visit. CouId it really be Landon himself?

Within the medical word, Landon was a revered figure. Every doctor and nurse secretly dreamed of crossing paths with him.

But none of them knew for certain if Landon was actually on site today-and even if he was, who among them had the nerve to disturb him?

A nurse turned to Emilia, uncertain. "You must realize Dr. Green isn't easily called upon. Hle's practically retired, and even the most influential people struggle to get him to show up-let alone folks like us..."

As the minutes ticked by, Emilia looked for an opening so she could slip past the crowd and try calling Landon one more time.

"I am..." Feeling backed into a corner, the old man was ready to reveal who he was just to get straight to the director and ask Landon for help.

Before he got the words fully out, someone shouted,their tone sharp and impatient.

"Why are all of you standing around here?"
###Chapter 25 Serve As An Assistant


Landon's serious gaze stopped the doctor and nurses in their tracks, but it did not take long for genuine excitement to break through their professional front.
A ripple of anticipation crossed their faces,even though they tried to mask it with calm.

"Dr. Green!" said the doctor, nearly tripping over his own enthusiasm.

The nurses exchanged amazed glances, hardly able to believe they were meeting Landon up close.

Emilia acted as though Landon was a complete stranger and quickly reached for his hand, saying,"Dr. Green, there's a girl here who needs an operation. We were hoping you could help her. No one else can do it but you."

Everyone was caught off guard by her boldness,especially since Landon was known for his fiery temper.
No one expected him to lash out, but most thought his words would be biting.

Instead, they watched as something in Landon shifted. He surprised everyone by giving a gentle nod. "Alright. If fate brought me here today, then it's not her time yet. I'll take care of her."

Everyone around the room wondered if Emilia might actually know Landon, and they struggled to understand why he treated her so kindly.

The doctor and nurses stood frozen, unable to process what they were seeing, almost certain they had slipped into some impossible dream.

Landon had never seemed this approachable, not even around influential people.

"Get things ready right away," Landon ordered.

The team shook off their surprise and immediately began preparing for the procedure. Before long, the medical specialists Landon had assembled were getting their equipment ready for the operation.

As he neared the operating room, he glanced at Emilia and asked deliberately, feigning doubt, "Did you ever study medicine?"

Emilia answered with a nod, "I did."

"Then suit up and come inside." Without waiting for her response, Landon walked straight into the operating room.

Emilia hurried after him while the others stared,trying to make sense of what they just saw.

"Can you believe it? Dr. Green just picked her to help him in surgery," one of the nurses whispered.

"I'd give anything to watch Dr. Green work up close,"said another. "Who knows what we could learn?"

"Dr. Green's entire team-every one of them is handpicked and top of their field. Honestly, she's got luck on her side." Nobody wanted to leave the corridor outside the operating room. Their faces were full of awe, each one hungry to absorb anything they could.

"But I have to admit, there's no one I admire more than Asclepius. That's the real legend-the one who can pull someone back from the edge of death.I'd give anything to watch him work," said one ofthe younger doctors.

"Absolutely. I don't even know what Asclepius looks like. I'm willing to pay anything for a chance to learn from him."

Their voices lowered as they/ talked, every word tinted with admiration for the mysterious healer.

None of them had any clue that Asclepius was already inside, working quietly in that very operating room.

Had they known, not a soul would have stepped away from that hallway.

When they finally found out the truth later, regret kept them tossing and turning at night, wishing they could go back.

"Don't worry, sir. With Dr. Green on the case, your great-granddaughter couldn't be in better hands.We'll leave you to it-we've got other patients to check on." Once the doctor finished speaking, he signaled for the team to follow, and together they exited the hallway.

The elderly man stood rooted to the spot, shaken and dazed, the idea of contacting his family completely forgotten in the chaos.

Eventually, his trembling hands found his phone, and he managed to place a call.


..·
Meanwhile,at the Edwards Group headquarters.

Without warning, the door to the conference room slammed open. An assistant rushed in, his expression twisted with worry.

"Mr. Edwards, there's a problem! Miss Edwards had a car accident!"
###Chapter 26 Credit


Oliver Edwards' mood soured the instant his assistant barged into the meeting, but the news jolted him upright.

A chill swept over the room as his gaze hardened,cold and sharp behind his gold-rimmed glasses.

"This meeting is over," remarked Oliver, cutting through the tension before snatching the phone from his assistant and making his way out the door.

"Grandpa, tell me what happened to Allison," asked Oliver.

"There's been an accident. Allison got hit by a car.The doctors rushed her into surgery at the hospital.You need to get here as soon as you can. Thank goodness Dr. Green happened to be on duty, or things could be much worse."
"Hang in there. I'm on my way. As long as Dr. Green is handling it, I trust everything will work out," said Oliver, ending the call, his jaw clenched.

He stepped into the elevator, stone-faced, and the staff hurried to clear his path. No one wanted to be caught in the wake of his fury. It was clear to everyone that something serious had happened.

Even the most curious employees kept their distance, deciding that staying safe was far more important than finding out what was wrong.

Even Jeffry Nash, Oliver's assistant, did his best to look invisible, keeping his eyes down and staying several paces back. Trying to talk to Oliver now would be pure suicide.

Inside the slow-moving elevator, Oliver stared at the glowing floor numbers, each one ticking by far too slowly.

Why did it feel like the elevator was crawling along at a snail's pace?

Until now, Oliver had never noticed how painfully slow the elevator could be. He loosened his tie, each tug a silent release of growing irritation as his glare grew sharper by the second.

Cramped walls seemed to close in, filling the small space with an almost unbearable sense of pressure.

Trying to ease the tension, Jeffry spoke up in a gentle voice. "Mr. Edwards, I really believe Miss Edwards is in good hands. She's got luck on her side."

"That kind of luck ran out for her mother. I won't let Allison end up the same way," said Oliver, his words cutting through the quiet like a blade.

Jeffry shrank back, not daring to challenge theicy finality in Oliver's tone. He held himself as still as possible, barely even breathing.

Nobody at the company had ever heard Oliver mention a romanticrelationship-he didn't even have any gossip swirling around him. Yet, out of nowhere,he had suddenly appeared with a young daughter years ago Even Jeffry, who had been by Oliver's side for ages,couldn't figure out who Allison's mother might have been.

The truth was, nobody knew where Allison Edwards came from. All anyone could see was how, as she got older, she looked more and more like Oliver.

Sometimes,Jeffy caught himself wondering if Oliver had a hidden love story he kept buried in the past.



At the hospital, Oliver joined his grandfather in the corridor outside the operating room. He couldn't stay still, pacing back and forth as the seconds crawled by.

He found himself torn, desperate for the doors to open but dreading whatever news might be waiting on the other side.

Allison was his last tie to the past. If she slipped away, he would lose the only piece of Allison's mother he had left. He forced himself not to follow that thought any further. Nerves left him lightheaded, his breath shallow, his hands trembling without relief.
"It's going to be alright. Allison's strong. She'll pull through," he whispered, trying to convince himself,though his doubt only grew with each passing second.

Every moment dragged on, each one stretching his patience thinner, until at last the operating room doors slid open.

The wait had felt endless, and now he braced himself for whatever verdict was coming.

"Dr. Green, please tell me-how's my great-granddaughter?" Samson Edwards couldn't hold back and hurried over.

"The operation went smoothly. She's stable and recovering," Landon answered, voice steady and composed.

He gestured for his team to step outside. Among them, Emilia slipped away, her face hidden behind a mask, moving quickly down the hallway without a backward glance.

All she could think about was changing out of her scrubs and finishing her divorce before the day ended.

With Landon staying behind to handle the rest, Emilia knew she could leave everything in his hands.

"We can't thank you enough for saving my daughter.I'm Oliver Edwards, and this is my grandfather. We'll make sure to visit and thank you in person. If there's ever anything you need from the Edwards family, just reach out," said Oliver, extending a grateful hand.

As Oliver spoke, Landon's eyes lingered on them a moment longer, realizing who he was dealing with.

So,these wee the Edwards-the wealthiest family in Oticester.

He gave a polite smile, refusing to take credit for what he hadn't done. "You're giving your thanks to the wrong person. I wasn't the one who performed the operation. I only stepped in to help."
###Chapter 27 The True Savior


What? Everyone in the room stared, too stunned for words.

Landon's name was known all over the world, yet here he was, admitting he'd only played a supporting role in the surgery.

Who could possibly have the influence to make Landon step aside?

The question lit uup in Oliver's mind. He cleared his throat and asked quietly, "Was it Asclepius who operated on Allison?"

Samson and Jeffry looked even more stunned, struggling to process what they'd just heard.

Landon nodded. "You are right. Your daughter was unbelievably lucky. Asclepius resurfaced just in time and took on her case. Honestly, her injuries were so serious that even I didn't think I could save her. Only Asclepius stood a chance."

The moment Landon confirmedi1everyone was left reeling. The legendary doctor had actually been here,performing the surgery himself.

Oliver couldn't help but shudder, imagining the outcome if Asclepius hadn't been there for Allison.

He stepped forward, his voice tense with hope."Dr.Green, is there any way you could introduce us? I want to thank him face to face."

Landon's demeanor instantly cooled. He shook his head and waved the suggestion away.

"That's not possible. What you can do is remember the debt you owe him. If he ever wants to collect, he'll let you know."

Oliver opened his mouth to say something else, but Samson laid a hand on his arm, stopping him.

"We won't forget what he did for us. And we're grateful to you and your entire team, as well," Samson said,his voice filled with sincerity. Then he paused, glancing around the room in puzzlement. "What about that young woman who helped me earlier? If not for her quick thinking, Allison never would have made it to the hospital in time."

Landon scanned the hallway, his brow furrowing pretendingly. "She might've left with the rest of the team.I wasn't really paying attention. Allison's already been moved to her room, so you should go be with her now.I've got something important to deal with and haye to go." Without another word, Landon turned and strode away.

Samson turned to Oliver, determination in his eyes. "We need to check the hospital's security cameras. That woman saved Allison's life at the scene. We have to thank her properly."

"I understand, Grandpa. I'll look into it as soon as we see how Allison's doing,"Oliver replied, pushing his glasses up on his nose.

Meanwhile, word about Asclepius's presence at the hospital spread like wildfire, sending ripples of excitement and regret through the entire medical staff.

Doctors at every level mourned the missed opportunity to meet a living legend.

Those working at this hospital felt the sting most of all, wishing for a second chance to witness greatness up close.

The sharpest regret was reserved for the handful of staff who had actually crossed paths with Landon's team,never realizing Asclepius had been right there, hidden in plain sight among them.

If they had known the truth, every doctor and nurse would have swallowed their pride and pleaded for even a brief moment inside that operating room.

But fate had other plans, News.soon spread that Landon had scheduled a major operation for the next day-and several of them had been picked to assist.

It felt like winning the lottery, a chance most would never even dare to hope for.

The envy rippled through the hospital staff. Not only had they nearly brushed shoulders with the mysterious Asclepius, now they had the honor of scrubbing in alongside Landon himself. Whispers passed from one department to the next-maybe, just maybe, they would one day meet Asclepius in person.


···

Meanwhile, in a hospital room across the hall, Rodger sat by Violet's bedside, his body aching but his attention focused entirely on her.

"Rodger, I'm so sorry. You're hurt, and I still called you back to take care of me." Violet offered a weak,apologetic smile.

She knew Rodger was going to see Emilia, so she played up her illness to bring him running.

All it took was one phone call, and he would drop everything for her. Emilia didn't stand a chance.

Violet imagined Emilia stewing in frustration, powerless to change anything.

Just one little gesture from her, and Emilia would end up utterly defeated.
###Chapter 28 Get Him By Her Side


"Honestly, it's barely a scrape. Nothing for you to worry about," said Rodger, his tone light.

"That Webster has gone too far! How could he treat you so violently?" Violet cried out, her face full of fake worry.

The moment Webster's name came up, Rodger's mood soured. Twenty percent of the Mitchell Group's stock had slipped into his rival's hands, and the thought made his blood boil.

None of it would have happened if not for that foolish, spiteful Emilia. She was the reason Webster held those shares.

For years, the Mitchell family and the Garza family had been locked in a battle for second place among Oticester's wealthiest families. The Mitchells had finally pulled ahead, forcing the Garzas to settle for third.

Lately, though, Webster's sudden windfall had tilted the balance-he'd even managed to snatch a key project from Mitchell Group. Now, the man strutted around with newfound arrogance.

At the heart of it all was Emilia, whose devotion had curdled into spite. Her betrayal felt like a knife in the back.

Deep down, Rodger knew he had brought some of this on himself. If he hadn't overestimated his strength,he never would have risked so many shares in a bet. Looking back, he regretted ever challenging Emilia in the first place.


Violet had been speaking for several minutes, but no reply came from Rodger. A long silence stretched between them before Violet finally noticed how far away he seemed. Her teeth sank gently into her lower lip,fingers curling in on themselves.

Was Rodger thinking about Emilia? The idea stung. Still, she reminded herself, Emilia had always been invisible to him. Not once in those three years had Rodger given Emilia more than a passing glance. Nothing could ever shake her place in his affections. That certainty settled her nerves. Drawing closer, Violet pressed herself into Rodger's arms, her voice dripping with sweetness. "Rodger,darling!"

Her words snapped him out of his thoughts, the sound of her affection echoing through his chest.

"Did something happen?" he asked, his arms wrapping gently around Violet as warmth filled his eyes.

"Don't you think Emilia will be angry if you come running to me like this?" Violet asked, her tone feigning innocence.

"Angry? She'd be thrilled if I vanished from her life completely. We were supposed to meet at court for the divorce today, but she kept stringing me along. Claimed she was on her way, then shut her phone off,"Rodger said, his voice tightening with irritation.

Hearing that, Violet blinked in surprise. So he'd actually gone to meet Emilia to end the marriage. That was not what she had expected.

Regret gnawed at Violet. If she'd realized they planned to settle the divorce, she never would have faked being sick just to get Rodger by her sideagain.

The fools she'd hired hadn't accomplished anything-no kidnapping, no dirt, not even a single photo for leverage. They'd pocketed her money and vanished without a trace.

"What do we do.now? The court's stilI open. Maybe you could try calling Emilia again?" Violet suggested,forcing her voice to stay calm while panic churned inside her.

All Violet wanted was to snatch the phone from his hand and dial Emilia herself, but she kept up the anxious act instead.

"I'd rather stay here with you. We can deal with it tomorrow," Rodger replied, unhurried.

Rodger seemed content to let time slip by, showing no urgency. Meanwhile, Violet grew increasingly anxious. The longer the divorce was, delayed, the greater the risk something unexpected might happen. She desperately wanted their divorce finalized-only then could she finally feel secure.

With the paperwork unfinished, what if Rodger and Emilia rekindled something from their past? Even if ess pursuit.

Curled up close against Rodger, Violet's mind worked fast. An idea for how to nudge him surfaced just as Rodger's phone buzzed.

He answered, his face turning cold. Whatever he heard made his eyes widen."What did you say? Asclepius is here at this hospital?"

After the confirmation, Rodger's mood shifted in an instant. Ecstatic, he turned around with Violet still in his arms. "Violet, this is it! Asclepius is here. I'll find him and bring him to treat you right away!"
###Chapter 29 Distrust


Excitement lit up Violet's face as the news sank in. Finally, she had a real chance at escaping the grip of her illness with the help of Asclepius. Every flare-up had been a nightmare she couldn't wake from, but now hope glimmered on the horizon.

"Thank you, Rodger..." she whispered, clutching him tightly, her reddened eyes brimming with tears.

Her voice trembled as she said through tears, "I honestly don't know what I'd do if you weren't by my side."

The fragile desperation in her tone tugged at Rodger's heart, stirring his instinct to shield her.

He brushed away her tears with gentle fingers and murmured, "You don't need to worry, Violet. I'I stay right here.Nothing's going to happen to you."

"Alright." She looked so delicate in that moment, any man would have felt compelled to protect her.

"I'm going to find Asclepius. Please, just stay here in your room and don't go anywhere," said Rodger softly.

"Okay," Violet answered quickly, nodding like an obedient child.

The moment Rodger left and the door clicked shut, Violet's expression melted into a cool, triumphant smile.

As if Emilia could ever steal Rodger away-not when his devotion was so obvious. Winning against Emilia had never been difficult. She was hardly a threat.

.··
Elsewhere,Emilia changed out of her surgical gown and grabbed her phone,switching it on.

Her first instinct was to call Rodger, hoping to catch him and finally settle the divorce at the courthouse.

Each attempt ended in a quick disconnect. After three tries, she gave up, annoyance twisting her features.

Was he dodging her calls out of spite? Determined, Emilia strode out of the changing room, intending to hunt him down at the Mitchell Group offices.

But before she could leave the building, she spotted Rodger in the bustling lobby.

He stood tall, easy to spot in any crowd-maybe not as imposing as Elias, but handsome in hís own right.

Moving quickly, Emilia intercepted him, blocking his way."1thought we agreed to finalize this divorce. Let's go. We've still got time to get it done."

Rodger seemed genuinely stunned to see her, his brow knitted tight and a stormy look shadowing his face.

"Back to your usual games?" he snapped, suspicion dripping from his voice.

Caught off guard, Emilia straightened her shoulders. "Games? I'm not playing around. Didn't you say you wanted this divorce desperately? The courthouse is still open. Let's get it over with."

"I don't have time for you. Get out of my sight," Rodger warned coldly.

"Are you serious right now? You're the one who demanded this divorce, and now you want me to leave?Changed your mind, or are you just looking for a fight?" Emilia shot back, her patience thinning.

"Enough! You keep saying you're coming, but I've been waiting forever. Admit it, you're just stalling for time.You think I can't see through your tricks?" Rodger snapped angrily.

Emilia explained, "That's not it. Something urgent came up and I had to handle it, but it's all sorted now."

He scoffed, not buying a word. Rodger seemed convinced she was simply trying to drag things out and torment him.


"You're always making life difficult for everyone. Don't tink you can get away with it-once I'm done here,you'll answer to me." He shoved past her, cold eyes full of contempt.

The sudden force nearly toppled her. She stumbled back several steps, fighting to keep from crashing to the floor.

Emilia watched him disappear down the corridor, a deep ache rising in her chest. That same old disdain in his eyes haunted her memory.

Nothing had changed-after all her sacrifices, he still refused to trust her. Not once did he apprecate the years she'd spent tending to him, morning and night.

It made no difference what she said; Rodger's doubt always found its mark, and somehow she always ended up to blame.

Tears threatened, stinging her eyes, but Emilia forced a shaky smile and turned away, refusing to look back as she walked off.
###Chapter 30 Gone


Violet reclined in the hospital bed, looking perfectly at ease as she popped another grape into her mouth.Each grape had been carefully peeled and rinsed by Rodger.

She placed her faith in his fortune and powerful contacts. With Rodger pulling the strings, she believed she could count on Asclepius to save her from this relentless illness.

The moment she heard the door creak open, she quickly set aside her plate of fruit. Shearranged herself to appear as weak and delicate as possible.

Violet had assumed Rodger would bring Asclepius straight to her bedside. Yet when he walked in alone, her composure nearly slipped.

She hesitated at first, the question hanging on her lips before she managed to soften her tone."You came back alone? Tell me, where is the doctor?"

"He was already gone." A tired sigh slipped out as Rodger took a seat at the end of her bed. Worry seemed etched into every line of his face.

Shock flashed in Violet's eyes, and her lower lip began to quiver. "This can't be true... why does this keep happening to me?"

For a moment, Violet had convinced herself that relief was finally within reach-that she would finally face the one they called Asclepius and be freed from this relentless sickness.

Instead, Rodger being late meant she was trapped again, forced to bear the unending torture that felt worse than dying.

Tears welled up in her eyes and spilled down her cheeks, silent but heavy.

Rodger watched the tears, alarmed, and drew her into an uneasy hug. "Please don't cry. I promise I'll find Asclepius, and you'll get better." Choking back sobs, Violet buried her face in his shoulder. "When it starts, the pain is more than I can handle..."

Hearing her broken voice, guilt clawed at Rodger. All he could think about was how Emilia had delayed him."If Emilia hadn't held me up in the lobby, I would have caught Asclepius. This is all because of her."

He sounded as though every ounce of frustration and anger had settled on Emilia's shoulders, and he longed for someone to blame.

"You mean... Emilia stopped you?" Violet's eyes went wide,dread crawling into her voice.

Maybe Emilia had known all along what Rodger planned, keeping him from meeting Asclepius. Such cruelty seemed beyond belief.

"That's exactly it. Today was supposed to be the day we wrapped up the divorce, but she ignored everything we agreed on and disappeared. While I was looking for Asclepius, she suddenly stepped in front of me and refused to budge.I couldn't believe it," Rodger explained, his frustration simmering.

He had scoured every hallway in the hospital, asking anyone who might have answers, but Asclepius was nowhere to be found. Even the hospital director had no clues to offer.

The only piece of information he picked up was that Asclepius had disguised as Landon's staff, working on a surgery for a child who'd suffered a terrible accident.

Rodger wasted no time, instructing someone to look into Landon and the child, hoping to track down Asclepius,

Violet shivered, her words barely a whisper, asking, "Do you think Emilia did it on purpose?"

Feigned emotion tangled in her voice as she said, "Is she still mad about what happened at the pool? | tried to explain it was never her fault. I don't understand why she still hates me..."

Rodger watched her tears spill and felt his heart twist with sympathy. He held her tenderly. "You don't have to defend her. She's jealous and spiteful, and you know she pushed you. There's no reason to make excuses for someone like that." "Rodger... I can't take this pain any longer..." Violet's expression turned to one of extreme distress, and the next moment, she was scratching at her skin. "I can't stand the itching..it won't stop..."

Panic washed over Rodger as he grabbed her wrists. "Stop, Violet, you can't scratch! Please, hold on. I'll get you to a doctor right now!"

With trembling hands, he lifted Violet into his arms and hurried from the room, his face pale with terror.

Rodger never suspected she was faking every symptom just to turn him further against Emilia.

She knew that if Emilia hadn't stalled Rodger, Asclepius could have treated her, sparing her from more suffering.

The idea that her one hope for relief slipped away because of Emilia left her seething with anger, wishing she could see her rival suffer in return.
###Chapter 31 Meet Her


The following morning, a black Rolls-Royce Cullinan rolled up to the curb in front of an unassuming apartment complex, radiating a quiet authority that was impossible to ignore.

If that car alone was not enough to draw attention, a brilliant red Pagani-easily worth more than fifty million -sat parked right beside it, one of just five in existence.

When the Pagani's gullwing doors swept open, jaws practically dropped on the spot.

People living in the neighborhood had spotted high-end cars speeding by before, but never had they seen them parked together outside such an ordinary building.

Most folks around could not dream of affording anything close to these cars, no matter how many years they put in at work.

Plenty of residents were already hustling out the door, skipping breakfast in their rush to clock in, only to be reminded that some people lived in a completely different world. The sight made the daily struggle feel even heavier.

Downstairs, Emilia and Sloane shuffled out of the building, both of them still wrapped in sleep, hair tousled and leisure-wear wrinkled.

The instant Sloane's gaze landed on the luxury cars, any trace of tiredness vanished. Her eyes danced with amazement."Are you seeing this? Who in the world just won the lottery around here? Two luxury cars at once..."

Astonishment colored Sloane's face. Their neighborhood was filled with ordinary tenants, folks who struggled to pay rent on time. Wealthy people had no reason to set foot in a place like this.

Buying even a tire from one of those cars was beyond reach for most.
"That's not a local license plate. That Pagani's practically a unicorn-there are only five worldwide.Whoever owns it, it's not just about money. That's someone powerful making a statement." Emilia didn't need to  look twice to recognize the rare car.

"Well, let them flaunt it. I'd rather get breakfast and fill my stomach," Sloane said, laughing as she linked arms with Emilia,ready to leave.

Before they could make it to the corner, a calm, clear voice called out behind them.

"Ms.Harris."

Both women turned at once and found themselves facing a strikingly handsome man.

Gold-rimmed glasses sat perfectly on the bridge of his nose, giving him an air of refinement and quiet confidence.

Stepping out of the Rolls-Royce Cullinan, the striking man immediately drew every gaze as he strode toward the women, who stood rooted to the spot.

"Would you look at him! That man's got the kind of looks and presence that could make Rodger disappear in a crowd. Plus, he's rolling up in a Rolls-Royce!" Sloane whispered, nudging Emilia with her elbow and winking at her.

"So, is this mystery man your secret admirer? Didn't realize you had it in you, Emilia," Sloane teased,a mischievous sparkle in her eye.

A wry grin tugged at Emilia's lips. "You're making things up again. I swear, I've never seen him before."

"Seriously? Then how come he knows your name?" Sloane's confusion quickly melted into delight. "That's it! He's probably been secretly in Jove with you this whole time."

With a dramatic roll of her eyes, Emilia replied, "Maybe you should cut back on those romance novels."

Sloane stuck out her tongue in mock protest, trying to look innocent but failing miserably.

Turning to the refined stranger, Emilia called out, "May I know your name?"

The man stood tall in a perfectly cut charcoal suit, every detail tailored to perfection.

"My name is Oliver Edwards. Wlould you mind if we stepped aside for a quick chat?" Oliver asked, his tone gentle and composed.

From the sidelines, Jeffry's eyes widened in shock. He could not recall the last time his boss had spoken so softly to anyone.

It must have been Emilia's role in saving his daughter that had left such an impression on Oliver.

Sloane's eyes grew wide as the realizationstruck her."Wait-Oliver Edwards? The CEO of Edwards Group?"
###Chapter 32 Treat Money As Nothing


Oliver's gaze was as calm as ever when he answered, "Yes."

Emilia flashed a smile and said, "Well, let's grab something to eat and chat."

"Maybe we should change our clothes first." Sloane looked down at the cartoon prints on their leisure wears.

Neither of them had expected more than a quick trip forbreakfast, so they hadn't bothered to dress properly.

"Would you rather wait for us while we change into something else?" Emilia asked.

"There's no need. Just tell us where you're eating and we'll come along," Oliver replied, his tone unexpectedly warm.

"You're serious?" Emilia asked, her eyes narrowing in disbelief as she studied him, then glanced at the sleek luxury cars lined up nearby.

Everything about his designer suit screamed that he belonged somewhere far fancier than the cozy breakfast spot she had picked out.

Even the watch gleaming on his wrist, a Patek Philippe worth a fortune, felt laughably out of place here. The priciest dish on her usual menu hardly cost more than pocket change.

"Of course," Oliver said, his gaze steady behind the rim of his golden glasses.

...
A tiny eatery stood by the road.

Oliver's brow furrowed as he took in the cramped setting, his unease plain as he hovered above the flimsy plastic stool. In that moment, he realized he had agreed too quickly. Jeffry fished out some wet wipes and scrubbed every inch of the table and stool, going over the job more than once.

Oliver had never once lowered himself to eat in surroundings like this, not when his entire life had been steeped in fine dining and prestige.

Most of the people in the shop wore comfortable clothes-some even lounged in their pajamas. Spotting someone in a suit was not something anyone would expect.

Customers inside the shop couldn't help but stare, not only because of the suits the two men wore but also because of how good-looking the four were.

Even in their silly leisure wears, the two women still carried a kind of elegance that couldn't be hidden.

Those who had only come to pick up food found themselves lingering, sneaking in an extra glance or two before leaving.

"Take a seat. Otherwise, you'll just end up standing the whole time," Emilia said, giving him a pointed look.

Her eyes swept over the window where she noticed a small cluster of onlookers. A few timid girls peeked in,only to scurry off in embarrassment before daring to come inside.

At this rate, finding an empty chair would soon be impossible.

With a stiff expression, Oliver finally sat down, his frown showing how unwilling he was.

Soon after, the waiter arrived with four steaming bowls of seafood noodles.

On the way over, Oliver had insisted he was paying and told them to order freely. Emilia hadn't planned to hold back in the slightest.

It wasn't long before the cramped eatery filled up completely.

Some of the younger boys and girls walked in withno intention of eating, only to steal a glance at Oliver.

Because his back faced them, Oliver didn't notice the phones lifted in secret to snap his photo.

"Yesterday, Ms. Harris, you gave first aid to a little girl. She's actually..." Oliver faltered when he tried to say it,which was unusual for him.

"She's my daughter. I appreciate what you did for her,"Oliver finally said,laying a car key on the table.

"That's for the Pagani. I heard you know your way around a race track, so I thought you'd appreciate it. If that's not your style, you can pick another supercar. I've also got a villa ready for you. We could sign the transfer papers this afternoon if you have time. Plus, this card holds fifty million111he said, slipping a bank card toward Emilia.

Jeffry was astonished by the two girls' calm demeanor in the face of such wealth. He couldn't tell if they were frozen by shock or simply unimpressed by wealth of this scale.

Was it really possible that some people could treat money as nothing more than a passing thought?
###Chapter 33 Appreciation


It was not that Emilia and Sloane treated money as nothing-they were simply rich enough to think of Oliver's offer as unimpressive.

"If you ever need anything else, just speak up. As long as it's something I can handle, I'll do everything l can," said Oliver, a glint of sincerity showing through the lenses of his gold-rimmed glasses.

"I'll take the car key, but the rest isn't necessary. What I do hope is that, when the time comes and I'm the one asking, you'll be there to help me," Emilia replied, her gaze steady though a quiet test lingered beneath her words.

"No problem. As long as it doesn't go against my principles, I'll stand by you,"Oliver answered, agreeing without hesitation.

With a soft laugh, Emilia said, "Appreciate it. Eat up before it gets cold. It's best while it's hot."

For a moment, Oliver paused, eyes flicking down at the food, uncertainty etched across his face.

Jeffry, catching on, leaned closer and whispered, "Mr. Edwards, if you're not comfortable eating here, I can take your breakfast back to the office for you."

Truthfully, Jeffry would be more than happy to take Oliver's share. He'd already sampled the food and decided this humble shop served some of the best breakfast he'd ever tasted. He planned to bring some extras with him when he left.

Oliver stayed silent, eyes following Emilia as she ate with obvious enjoyment. Her contentment made him curious enough toreconsider.

Eventually, Oliver reached for the utensils. When he looked over at Emilia again, she was nearly finished.

With deliberate care, Oliver lifted a portion to his mouth and finally tasted it. The sauce carried the depth of fresh seafood, each bite rich with flavor. One taste was enough to awaken his appetite. Strangely enough,this modest eatery had prepared a dish far better than what he had found in the most exclusive restaurants. The sight of Oliver eating without complaint left Jeffry stunned for a moment. Was this really the same
Oliver he'd always known?

Of the four at the table, Oliver took the longest to finish his meal.

Once Jeffry paid the bill, the group stepped out of the shop.

Not until the group had stepped outside did the remaining diners start chattering among themselves.

"My god, did you see them? Those people looked better than any celebrity I've seen. Honestly, they were something else-like walking works of art."

"Could it be they were filming something? People like that wouldn't normally eat here. They should be in some five-star restaurant."

"I doubt it. I didn't notice any cameras. Whatever-let's just post these photos online. Shame I couldn't catch a clear picture of the guy's face."


...

Inside the Dixon family mansion, Wilbur stood in the hallway, grinning as he tapped on the study door with his other hand holding atablet.

"Come in," Elias said, his tone flat and cold.

Wilbur wasted no time swinging the door open.

"Take a wild guess what I just found out," Wilbur said, wearing a mischievous smile.

Elias kept his focus on his paperwork, barely acknowledging Wilbur's arrival and refusing to answer.

A minute ticked by. Wilbur's patience snapped, irritation showing on his face. "Unbelievable! You're not even going to ask? You'd really let me walk out without saying a word?" His grin vanished.

"Get to the point," Elias replied, still staring at his work.

Irritated by the cold shoulder, Wilbur made a show of turning away with the tablet clutched to his chest."Forget it, then. The news is about Ms. Harris, but if you're not interested, I'll just keep it to myself." The moment Emilia's name left his lips, Elias finally set his pen down, his gaze lifting to Wilbur's retreating back. When it became clear Wilbur was actually heading for the door, Elias's cold voice cut through the air."Stop."
###Chapter 34 Faith


"Do you honestly think a single word from you is enough to make me stop? Now that would make me look pathetic," Wilbur said, striding forward without slowing.

"Wilbur." Elias pronounced his name with a deliberate sharpness, each syllable cutting through the air.
The sound of his name felt like a command that rooted Wilbur to the spot. The weight of Elias's presence bore down on him, a suffocating force that felt like a blade poised above his head, ready to fall.

"Fine! I hear you," Wilbur said with a forced grin, quickly turning back and hurrying to the desk. "You have no idea what I went through to get this scoop for you. Go ahead-see for yourself." He set the tablet down in front of Elias.

Elias didn't react to Wilbur's usual antics. His eyes froze on the screen as a photo came into view-Emilia's radiant smile was turned toward Oliver, and the way they looked at each other carried an unspoken connection.

Two more faces appeared in the picture, yet Elias dismissed them without a second thought.

With a smooth motion, he slid his finger across the screen. Even as more images appeared, only Emilia and Oliver seemed to catch his attention.

The air seemed to drop in temperature, as if the room itself had caught his mood.

He pressed his lips together, pausing before he finally asked, "Tell me, how did the two of them end up together?"

"Wasn't it just yesterday that his daughter got into a car accident?" Wilbur hopped onto the desk, earning a chilling glare from Elias, though he carried on unbothered. "Ms. Harris happened to be there and gave her first aid right on the spot. Thanks to her, the girl made it to the hospital in time. After that, the girl was lucky enough to be operated on by Asclepius."

Wilbur let out a breath of admiration. "Imagine the luck of the Edwards family. Without Ms. Harris buying the girl that time and then crossing paths with Asclepius, Oliver's daughter never would have survived.He must be overflowing with gratitude toward her, and since he knew about her passion for racing,he decided to reward her with a Pagani."

Elias scrolled through the images, his stare cold and unyielding.

"Did she agree to take the car?" His voice cut through the silence, carrying a chill that made Wilbur uneasy.

"She did!" said Wilbur. "Why didn't we ever think to impress her with a supercar before anyone else could?"

Suddenly, a new worry hit Wilbur, and he blurted out, "Do you think that Oliver's trying to secure his daughter's future by striking some secret deal with Ms. Harris for the treatment opportunity from Asclepius?That would be disastrous! if anyone deserves that arrangement, it should be us. We were the first to approach her."

Regret flooded his face as Wilbur slapped his own leg and groaned, "Can't believe we didn't come up with the idea to send her a luxury car first."

"I have faith in her," Elias replied without hesitation.

Wilbur blinked, startled. "Faith? What exactly are you saying?"

"She promised that if she chose to sell, we'd be the first she considered. I believe she won't break that promise." There was a rare certainty in Elias's words when it came to Emilia.

"That's a first. I've never seen you put this much faith in anyone," said Wilbur, leaning in, curiosity etched on his face.

Their faces hovered near each other, nearly aligned.

Wilbur glanced down at Elias, a grin teasing his lips, while Elias met his gaze with a chilling look and a chin lifted ever so slightly.

Each of them had features that looked as if they'd been carved out of stone, their Adam's apples standing out, sharp and striking.

A playful glint,flashed in Wilbur's eyes as he asked, "Don't tell me you've actually taken a liking to her." Not bothering to answer, Elias straightened his cufflinks, letting the gemstones catch the light, and rolled away without another word.

"Wait-where are you headed? Don't tell me you're ditching your work just to chase after Ms. Harris?"Wilbur hopped down from the desk, his long strides quickly carrying him after Elias.
###Chapter 35 Cuckolded


Sebastian stormed into the hospital room, his frustration obvious from the way he flung open the door."Rodger, tell me you've already divorced Emilia."

Rodger was carefully wringing out a towel, tenderly wiping Violet's hands. The warmth faded from his face at the mention of Emilia's name. His features hardened, irritation settling in his eyes.

"I'l take care of it after Violet gets out tomorrow. Emilia and I will be done for good," he replied, his tone ice-cold.

"Don't waste any more time. That woman's reputationis filthy enough-don't let her drag the Mitchell name down with her," Sebastian scoffed, clearly impatient.

Rodger's frown deepened, but he stayed silent. Violet, catching the accusation, jumped in.

"Filthy? Are people really spreading those rumors again? This is getting ridiculous-why do they always have to drag Emilia's name through the mud?" Violet sad, sounding genuinely outraged, though her eyes glinted with calculation.

"You think this is just talk? There's evidence everywhere,"Sebastian said, thrusting his phone in their faces."She hasn't even finalized the divorce, and she's already cozying up to every rich man she sees. She's got no shame at all!"

Sebastian shoved his phone at Rodger, but before Violet could grab it, Rodger snatched it away,his grip tense.

On the screen, a photo splashed across a gossip site showed Emilia eating breakfast at a bustling little diner -with two men.

Rodger's jaw tightened the instant he recognized how wealthy the man sitting across Emilia was. Though the man's face was turned away, the expensive Patek Philippe on his wrist was impossible to miss. The suit alone screamed money-discreet but unmistakable, a fortune in subtle tailoring. The idea that Emilia might already be entertaining another man, and doing so openly before their divorce was even official, sent fury burning through Rodger's veins.

Violet leaned closer, her eyes narrowing as she examined the man's silhouette.

Even from behind, he radiated wealth-every detail, from the polished shoes to the custom cut of his coat,marked him as a man used to getting what he wanted.

The unfairness of it made her chest tighten. How could Emilia, of all people, catch the eye of someone like that? It didn't seem real.

Hadn't Emilia lost everything after Rodger left her? Wasn't she supposed to be miserable, desperate to get him back? How could she move on so quickly, turning to someone else with such ease? It was infuriating-this wasn't how things were supposed to play out.

Rodger's sense of betrayal flared white-hot. Without another word, he flung the phone onto the bed and stalked toward the door, completely forgetting about the towel or Violet's half-washed hands.

"Rodger..." Violet called after him, her voice trembling.

"Rodger! Where are you going?" Sebastian blurted, wvatching as Rodger came to an abrupt stop and took a steadying breath.

He'd let his temper nearly carry him out the door. Visions of Emilia's supposed betrayal had blinded him to everything else.

"I'm going to settle this once and fora∥,′′said Rodger, his jaw set. "She won't be allowed to embarrass the Mitchell family any longer."

Those words washed a hint of relief over Violet, her shoulders loosening just a little.

"Don't waste any more time, Rodger. The sooner you cut ties with her, the sooner Violet can take her place where she belongs," Sebastian insisted, eager to see Emilia gone for good.

Sebastian's lip curled in contempt at the thought of Emilia. To him, she was nothing but trouble-vain,manipulative,and always tangled up with men. If it hadn't been for the way she charmed his grandfather, she'd have never made it through the Mitchell doors.

As Rodger left, the room fell quiet, and Violet suddenly dissolved into tears, her sobs quiet but aching.

Witnessing Violet's sudden tears, Sebastian pressed her for answers until she finally revealed what had happened the day before.

His face twisted in outrage. "Unbelievable! Emilia really is heartless. She knew you needed Asclepius for your illness, and she still got in Rodger's way-on purpose! Thanks to her, Rodger missed the only chance to bring that doctor here for you. I always suspected she was up to no good, but I never thought she could stoop this low! I'm going to find her and make her answer for this!"
###Chapter 36 Ridicule From Rodger


"Sebastian, let it be," Violet murmured, her fingers trembling as they held onto his wrist. "I really believe Emilia had no ill intentions."
"I refuse to let it slide." Sebastian yanked his hand free, his expression hardening. "You always see the best in people. That's exactly why she keeps walking all over you. Trust me. I won't let her get away with it."

Violet faltered, fake worry lining her voice. "But... if Rodger hears about this, he'll be furious. He and Emilia shared three years together,,so there's still a connection between them."

Leaning in,Sebastian lowered his tone. "That won't be a problem. Rodger won't hear a thing. After her last match against him, I hired a few thugs to rough her up, but those fools took my mnoney and vanished.I haven't tracked them down yet, but once | do, Tyrone will deal with them for good."

At that, Violet's eyes glimmered with something unspoken. She realized those bastards had pulled the same trick on both of them-taking cash and disappearing.

"I'm hiring Tyrone for this. There's no way he'd take the payment and then not come through," Sebastian sneered.

"You mean Tyrone Newman? But he is involved in some shady dealings. What if he does something worse to Emilia?" Violet asked, her tone lined with fake worry.

"He won't go too far. All I'm paying him for is to scare her. If he decides to do something beyond that, it's out of my hands: Besides, Emilia loves to flirt with men. Maybe that's what she wants," Sebastian answered coldly.

There was no hint of concern in him for what Emilia might endure under Tyrone's hands.

"Get some rest here. I'll bring you good news soon." With that, Sebastian turned and strode out,brushing off Violet's feigned attempt to call him back.

The second Sebastian vanished from sight, Violet dropped the act. A wicked smile crept across her lips. Twisting men like the Mitchell brothers around her finger took hardly any effort.

Emilia, who'd been cast out by Rodger, would soon find herself crushed and humiliated, left longing for escape from her disgrace.

She would never allow another woman to steal away her man and live in peace.

...
When Rodger stepped out, he tried to call Emilia, only to find that her phone had been switched off.

He even stopped by her apartment, but she was nowhere to be found.

Every familiar spot he could think of was checked, yet she seemed to have vanished.

Annoyed and out of options, Rodger made his way back to the hospital.

When word reached him that Landon was in surgery, he decided to stop by. Maybe Landon could tell him something about Asclepius.

On his way there, fate threw him a surprise-Emilia walked out in surgical attire. If she hadn't tugged off her mask at that very moment, he never would have realized it was her.

Without thinking, Rodger stepped into her path, his tone sharp as he asked, "Emilia! Why are you here at the hospital? And what's with the surgical getup?"

"I'm helping out in the operating room today," Emilia replied directly.

Truth was, Landon had invited her to observe today's procedure. He also planned to consult her on a few complications he couldn't quite solve.

"You?" Rodger scoffed, his eyes running over her with open disdain. "Since when do you know anything about medicine? Don't tell me you're trying to pass yourself off as some medical student."

"Who says I can't learn it myself?" Emilia retorted.
Her response only made Rodger laugh harder, the sound edged with mockery. "You surely have no clue how tough medical school is. Learn it yourself? Do you think you're a prodigy or something? To me, it looks like you've lost yourself in some fantasy of playing doctor."

Deep down, Rodger's bitterness colored every word. After what he saw as betrayal, he couldn't bring himself to believe she was capable of anything in medicine.

He doubted she could even handle the basics, much less step into a surgeon's shoes. Even working as a nurse seemed out of reach to him.
###Chapter 37 Blind


Emilia kept her eyes locked on Rodger, her mind turning bitter. If Violet had been the one standing before him, he wouldn't have questioned her, let alone mocked her. Violet wouldn't even need to say she was a doctor-Rodger would be the first to brag about her brilliance, reeling off every medical specialty as if she'd invented them all. To him, Violet could do no wrong and shined brighter than anyone else.

"What's it? You don't have anything to say for yourself?" Rodger's gaze tightened, mistaking her silence for weakness, convinced he had struck a nerve.

"Isn't it Asclepius you've been so desperate to find? You don't have to look any further. She's standing right in front of you," Emilia said firmly, refusing to look away from him.

Rodger didn't so much as flinch. Instead, a derisive laugh spilled from him, sharp and mocking."Doyou honestly expect me to believe that? Don't make me laugh!"

His laughter rolled on, dripping with scorn. "If you're Asclepius, then I'll swallow my hat whole."

To him, the idea was laughable. Why would someone as legendary as Asclepius waste herself being a housewife? If Emilia truly were Asclepius, she would have become a legend by now, showered in accolades.She wouldn't have spent her days quietly suffering in the Mitchell household.

As far as he was concerned, Emilia was making up stories because she knew how much he needed Asclepius to cure Violet's disease. In Rodger's mind, it was nothing but a cruel stunt, a heartless way to torment the woman he adored.

Staring at Rodger's cold disbelief, Emilia felt emptiness seep through her. Even standing face-to-face,confessing the truth, she realized he would never believe her. To him, Violet was the only one worth trusting,while she-the woman who once dragged him from brokenness back to health-meant nothing at all.

While Emilia drifted in her own thoughts, Rodger suddenly stepped forward and seized her by the throat.Her first instinct was to break free and send him flying, but the chilling contempt in his stare made her think otherwise. She forced herself to wait, to hear him out, needing the final blow that would kill any trace of hope still buried in her chest. Each gesture felt like a blade, cutting away whatever remained of their connection.

"If you want to throw your life away, leave the Mitchell name out of it," Rodger warned, pressing her against the wall with a threatening edge in his voice. "Pretending to be Asclepius will ruin more than just your own life. Stop running your mouth with this nonsense and think about what you're risking."

Rodger shoved her to the side, his eyes colder than before. "I'll ignore what you said for now. Until the divorce is done and we're nothing to each other, I expect you to keep your head down. If you drag the Mitchells into trouble, I promise you'll regret it. Remember, our marriage isn't over yet. Stop throwing yourself at other men. Can't you keep it together for a single day? I'll call you when I finish work tomorrow.Don't let me down again. Once the divorce is settled, you can chase after whoever you want. It won't matter to me anymore."

Not sparing her another look, Rodger spun around and walked off, each step radiating icy finality.He never noticed the weight of what he left behind.

Watching him disappear, Emilia's lips curled in a bitter, almost mocking smile.

"Oh, Rodger," she muttered to herself. "How blind you are to the truth standing right before you."
###Chapter 38 Willingly


At the hospital parking lot.

"Ms.Harris."

Just as Emilia reached for the car door, a voice she recognized called from behind.

Turning, she spotted Wilbur, who was pushing Elias's wheelchair across the lot.

With an easy grin, Wilbur said, "Imagine bumping into you here at the hospital. What are the odds?"

Their visit wasn't by chance. They had come searching for Landon, hoping he might give them a lead on Asclepius. Every question was met with a dead end. No offer seemed to sway Landon. He simply said Asclepius couldn't be found, even if he wanted to help.

"Yes, what are the odds? Are you checking in foryourself or visiting someone?" Emilia asked, letting her eyes linger on Elias's legs.

On most days, that kind of stare would have ticked Elias off. For some reason, though, he showed no sign of irritation-not with her.

Wilbur picked up on the silent exchange, noticing that Elias hardly seemed to mind Emilia's boldness.

"Just visiting," lied Elias, his voice quiet, lips barely parting:

His gaze swept over Emilia's neck for a fleeting moment, completely unreadable.

"Is that so?" Emilia nodded, her voice calm though her words carried a lie. "I'm here visiting a friend as well."

What she said wasn't completely false-Landon was indeed an old acquaintance,though not a patient.

"Did something happen to your neck, Ms. Harris? How'd you get that mark?" Wilbur suddenly asked,catching sight of the red mark against her skin.

Almost at onoe, Emilia's hand flew up to her neck. She rubbed the spot with a stiff smile.′′|scratched myself earlier while trying on a scarf."

"Trying on a scarf?" Wilbur's brow furrowed, suspicion tugging at his face.

The story didn't add up. Who would try a scarf in weather like this? Even with the air conditioning blasting,Emilia's excuse felt flimsy, and the redness on her neck didn't look like it came from a scratch. If anything, it looked more like...

Wilbur's eyes widened as the thought struck him. The mark mirrored the shape of fingers pressing hard against her skin. Considering Emilia's abilities, the only man she'd allow that close was her husband.

If she'd crossed someone dangerous, there would be more to see than a mark on her neck. Anyone out for vengeance would have done much worse.

"Anyway, I'm meeting a friend, so I'll be going now." Emilia offered a quick farewell before slipping into her car and pulling away.

Wilbur watched her taillights fade into the city, then murmured to himself, "No scratch could make those marks. Someone grabbed her, I'm sure of it."

Leaning down, excitement flickered in his eyes as he whispered, "It had to be Rodger. Nobody else could leave a mark on her like that unless she let them. Even after everything, she still covers for him. She's got it bad for Rodger-getting tossed out, signing divorce papers, and still, she finds a way to protect him. That's the kind of loyalty you don't see every day. Rodger's not worth half of what she gives. Honestly, I think-"

A single cold glare from Elias froze the rest of the words in Wilbur's throat. Without it, he might have gone on endlessly.

"Alright, alright, I'll shut up. No need to glare at me like that," Wilbur said in surrender as he helped Elias into the back seat and folded away the wheelchair.

Sliding behind the wheel, he leaned back dramatically."Oh, the tragedy of being such a loyal attendant. No one knows my suffering."

Silence stretched from the back. When Wilbur glanced over, Elias already had his eyes closed,resting. "Not even a comment? You're no fun," Wilbur muttered, chuckling as he started the engine.

He didn't really mind the trouble. Truth be told, if Elias hadn't put himself in harm's way to protect him back then, he would never have made it out alive. Looking after Elias for the rest of his days felt like a small price to pay.

The hum of the road carried them along for a while. Suddenly, Elias's eyes snapped open, cold and distant,and he broke the silence with a few measured words.
###Chapter 39 Rough Up


"Get someone to rough him up." Elias's sudden order caught Wilbur off guard, and for a second he thought he misheard.

"Wait, who exactly are you talking about?" Wilbur blurted without thinking.

"Rodger," Elias replied, his gaze sharp and dangerous.

The name startled Wilbur, and he asked, "Are you planning to get back at him for what happened to Ms.Harris?"

"He's not left-handed," Elias suddenly said.

If Wilbur didn't know Elias well, he might have thought Elias's answer was completely unrelated.

"I understand. I'll make sure the same hand he used on Ms. Harris is the one that gets crippled," Wilbur replied, a determined look settling on his face.

He checked the rearview mirror just in time to catch Elias already drifting back into silence, eyes closed and features unreadable.

Focusing on the road, Wilbur's expression tightened. He let out a sigh, the weight of his worry pressing heavy on his chest.

The thought of Elias confined to a wheelchair for life gnawed at him. Deep down, he hoped Emilia's words about Asclepius were real. If she'd lied, there would be consequences.

For an instant, a hard, ruithless light burned through Wilbur's normally gentle gaze.


..·

The night stretched on. Inside a karaoke bar, Emilia and Sloane were singing in their private booth.
Without warning, the door slammed open and eight men surged inside. Two of them instantly sealed off the door.

Over the pounding beat, Tyrone's scowl cut through the noise. "Shut that music off," he ordered.

"Right away, Tyrone!" his man replied, reaching for the controls.

Sloane shot Emilia a knowing look, both of them instantly on guard.

Tyrone's eyes flickered between the two women, sizing them up. "Which one of you is Emilia Harris?" he demanded.

A quick glance from Emilia to Sloane said everything. She rose from her seat, standing tall.

"That's me. Is there something you want from me?" Emilia replied, her voice steady as she eyed the rough-looking men around him.

"Unbelievable. He paid me to deal with a woman like you?" Tyrone muttered, spitting to the side in contempt.

He observed them, noting their youth and beauty, and sensed their initial fear when he and his men entered.The client had warned him that Emilia trained in martial arts, but she appeared fragile. Expecting someone tougher,he had brought seven men. Instead, he found a stunningly delicate woman.

His orders had been simple: rough them up enough to scare them. However, after laying eyes on them,Tyrone's thoughts grew sinister. He figured these women would fetch a hefty price even after being roughed up.

"Tyrone Newman? If you're smart, you'll walk away now. Otherwise, you'll be the one regretting this," Emilia said, her voice as cold and sharp as ice.

Tyrone let out a laughthat filled the air. He turned toward his men, waiting for them to join in, and their laughter bounced around the room, not taking Emilia's threat seriously at all.

"You guys hear that? She actually thinks she can put a scare in me. I'm trembling," Tyrone said, laughter stopping shor as he reached for a beer bottle. A dark look came over him. With a swift motion, he smashed the bottle on the table's edge.

Glass exploded across the table, its shards catching the light like teeth.

One wrong move with that bottle, and someone would be hurt badly.

With the sharp glass aimed their way, Tyrone stared at Emilia and Sloane, a twisted grin on his face. "You two really think I, Tyrone, am someone who backs down easily? Mark my words-if you don't end up begging for mercy today, they can toss me in the river and let the fish have me."
###Chapter 40 Finished

Nobody expected these two women to show any courage. Most thought they would be clinging to each other, too scared to even look up.

Instead, both of the two held their heads high,their eyes calm and unbothered.

Were they so scared that their minds had gone blank?

Right when Tyrone settled on that idea,Emilia leaned back into the sofa and folded her arms,looking perfectly at ease.

With her chin up, she said, "Go on. Give it a try.I promise you'll get exactly what you said."

For a split second, Tyrone lost his scowl. He seemed completely thrown off. He tried to make sense of it. Was she really not scared at all?

"Are you really that clueless about who you're dealing with? One more word out of line, and we'll make sure you vanish without a trace." The henchman's voice rang out, thick with threat. Emilia's eyes stayed sharp as she retorted, "It makes no difference to me. Anyone who tries to lay a finger on me will never leave this place alive."

Tyrone burst out laughing, loud and mocking."You've got no idea who I am, do you? Keep acting tough. You're in for the shock of your life."

The henchman let out a quick laugh and sneered, "Are you really this dumb? Everyone in the underworld knows Tyrone. Go ask around if you don't believe me."

"Oh?" Emilia lifted her eyebrow. "Soon enough,nobody in the underworld will even remember the name Tyrone."

Tyrone shot her a smug look and rolled his neck."You've got a smart mouth. Let's see if you keep it up."

A dangerous light flashed in his eyes as he raised his arm. "Grab them. Bring those two bitches over here. Once I'm finished with them,you all can have your turn-these women are a real prize."

"Thanks, Tyrone!" His crew grinned in approval and moved in without hesitation. Before Emilia could react, the door to the private room flew open with a loud crash. The sound threw everyone off.

Tyrone's face twisted in anger. "Who the hell is messing with me now? Whoever it is, you're finished!"

Words froze in his throat as he suddenly found a gun pointed straight at his face.

Tyrone's menacing look vanished, replaced by pure terror. Survival instincts kicked in, pushing him to grab for his own gun.

A single shot cut him off, shattering his wrist before his hand got anywhere close.

"Ahhh..." A scream escaped him, sharp and raw,while sweat streamed down his face.

He squeezed his bleeding wrist, trying not to buckle from the pain that shot through his body.

In a matter of seconds, his entire crew dropped,each of them groaning and rolling on  the floor in agony. Not a single weapon was left untouched. The new arrivals swept through the room, collecting every hidden gun with the swift, practiced movements of professionals.

Casting a wary glance at the women, Tyrone's blood ran cold when he saw them lounging on the sofa, their faces untouched by worry or fear.

Did these attackers come for them?

Tyrone's chest tightened. Teeth chattered uncontrollably as panic threatened to overwhelm him.

Nothing about these invaders resembled the street thugs he was used to. Their eyes were icy and hollow, making every gang boss he'd ever met seem tame by comparison.

He realized there was no escape this time.

Voice barely steady, Tyrone stammered, "Who sent you? What do you want?"

Silence answered him. The group in black split apart, forming a clear aisle through the chaos.

Tyrone could do nothing but watch his henchmen writhe on the floor.

Blocking the way, one groaning thug tried to rise, only to be kicked hard by a stone-faced man in black.

The imnpact sent the one flying into the wall.He hit the floor, coughed up blood, then went limp,completely out cold.

Tyrone's entire body shook. Sweat streamed down his face, soaking through his clothes.

For the first time in his life, he truly believed the end had come for him. Death had never felt so close-like a blade hanging over his neck, just waiting to fall.
###Chapter 41 Boss

Fear knotted in Tyrone's throat as his eyes darted to the doorway of the private room.

Through it stepped a towering figure wrapped in a black trench coat, a man who looked to be in his forties.

His face carried sharp lines and a rugged edge,the slit in his left eyebrow and the thick beard giving him a dangerous sort of allure.

The sight of him sent Tyrone's legs buckling. He collapsed to the floor, his expression drainedof any hope.

This was Luis Welch, a name whispered across Oticester's underworld with growing dread.

People often remarked on two things about him -the scar-like slit in his brow and the beard that shaped his face.

Three years had been all it took for Luis to turn his small-time crew into one of Oticester's three major factions. Now the criminal world in Oticester was held in a tense three-way standoff among Curtis Howe,Leroy Graham, and Luis.

Had it not been for Curtis and Leroy forming an alliance, Luis might have taken full control of Oticester by now.

Luis's name was spoken in whispers. His reputation for cruelty and ruthless efficiency made rivals shiver.

Oddly enough,despite operating outside the law,Luis's organization stayed clear of typical rackets and vices, yet its influence ballooned.

People who dared to cross Luis soon discovered there was no forgiveness-only a swift,merciless end.

Seeing Luis intervene for these women meant they were probably more than acquaintances.They might even be his lovers or fav/orites.

Challenging anyone close to Luis bordered on suicide. Tyrone realized he was finished.

A crushing atmosphere settled over the room as Luis strode forward, menace radiating off him like heat from blacktop in July.

Out of nowhere, the man everyone feared
<###Chapter 41 Boss
dropped to his knees in front of Emilia. "Boss!" Luis called out, voice strong and clear.

The rest of his men immediately followed suit,their voices rising in unison. "Boss!"

Tyrone could only stare, his mind reeling as he stared at the woman on the sofa.

She looked almost fragile, with a cool, careless air as she kept sipping juice, unconcerned.

How in the world could this be real? No one would have guessed that this delicate-looking woman actually sat at the head of Luis's entire operation.

Tyrone felt as if reality had slipped from his grasp, the shock hitting him like a punch to the chest.

A moment ago, he had thought of laying hands on both women. Now he realized one of them commanded a man feared across the city's underworld.

Luis's reputation was already soaked in blood. If even he bowed to this woman, how terrifying must her power be? What sort of monster had he stumbled upon tonight?

His gaze locked helplessly on Emilia, despair spreading through him until his body betrayed him with a dark stain on his trousers. He stood frozen,drowning in terror.

Stumbling to the floor, Tyrone clasped his hands together, pleading, "Please, I didn't realize who you were! I made a mistake, have mercy. I promise it won't happen again."

"Oh, so you're done making threats now?"Emilia's mouth curled in a sly, mocking grin.

"I swear, I'm done! Let me go and I'll do whatever you say. I'll serve you, just don't hurt me!" Panic stripped him of all dignity. Sweat poured from him as he crawled into the role of a pathetic supplicant.

"You certainly grovel well." Emilia rose abruptly,extending a graceful hand toward Luis with polished elegance.

Understanding her intent, Luis immediately placed a silenced gun in her slightly open palm."It's a shame you never grew out of being a thug.People like you are only good at causing pain."

Her voice had barely faded before the gunshots cracked.

Four gunshots rang out. Each bullet found a limb, Emilia's hand steady and unhurried as though this were routine.

"Ahhh!" Tyrone's wails split the air, his body shuddering while sweat streamed down his face.

He realized, too late, that the woman before him was far deadlier than Luis himself.
###Chapter 42 To Impress Her

Emilia cradled the silenced pistol with a lazy grace, a cold smirk tugging at her lips.

After giving the barrel a gentle puff, she spoke in a slow, measured tone. "If I just let you walk away, who's going to pay for all the lives you've destroyed? You know how we operate. We may run with a gang, but we don't stoop to peddling drugs or selling people. Money earned from that filth always comes back around."

A thought flickered through her mind. Emilia raised the weapon again and fired another shot at Tyrone's crotch without a flicker of hesitation.

"Ahhh!" A guttural scream erupted from Tyrone,pain twisting his faceas he nearly bit through his tongue.

"Funny, I nearly missed that you used this to destroy all those innocent girls," Emilia sneered.Her eyes followed the fresh blood staining his pants, lips curled in disgust.

That one shot had finished him-he'd never harm anyone again. Tyrone's strength failed him; his sight blurred,and he slumped to the floor, completely out.

"Didn't even last a minute. Pathetic," Emilia remarked, tossing the pistol back to Luis with a flick of her wrist.

"Boss, want me to dump a bucket of ice water on him and wake him up?" Luis kept his tone polite.

For someone known for his brutality, Luis barely looked the part now-standing there as docile as a house pet when Emilia was near.

The men in black, especially those seeing Emilia for the first time, could barely hide their shock.

Here was a woman, young and striking, who commanded the kind of respect that turned the notorious Luis into a model of obedience.

They had all just watched her fire a gun as if it were nothing, barely glancing at her targets, yet never missing.

The way she handled that weapon-quick and unerring-was almost supernatural.

No barricade or hiding place could protect them if she ever decided they were a threat. Even in a crowd, she'd pick them off one by one.

Some found themselves wondering if she might just materialize behind them, silent as a shadow,and end them without warning.

The thought alone made their skin crawl.

"Don't bother waking him. Make sure they're no threat anymore-the whole lot of them.Every single one has terrorized the helpless and hurt too many innocents. Give them a taste of their own medicine. Once it's over, dump their bodies in the river and let the fish clean up." Emilia's mouth curled into a faint smirk as she flopped back onto the sofa. Sloane passed her a beer and she finished it in a single gulp.

"Guess I'm feeling generous today. It's only right to honor his last request," Emilia said.

That unsettling smile froze the room, making everyone quietly thankful they'd never ended up on her bad side. If they had, they might not even realize how they died.

A quick look from Luis was all it took for his men to leap into action, following her orders without hesitation.

"Boss, any chance you'll take the reins again and read us yourself?" Luis edged closer, eager to lease. He poured her another drink, his posture umble and eyes almost pleading, as if ready to neel down and beg.

Vith Emilia at the helm, it was common nowledge she'd take control of all Oticester in ess than half a year.

Not right now. I've got my own things to take are of. You keep running the show. The past ree years have gone better than I could have oped. Don't let up." Emilia offered a rare nod approval and gave his shoulder a reassuring at.

he look Emilia gave him-a mix of approval nd expectation-set Luis's heart racing. Earning raise straight from the boss was no small thing.

le thought back to when Emilia had handed him is mission. Her words were clear: carve out a ace in Oticester within five years. Luis had one it in three, lifting their crew to the upper nks of the city's gangs.

the two rival outfits hadn't joined forces,he ight've claimed the number one spot by now.hat would have made Emilia even prouder.

e stayed hungry for a chance to take out the competition once and for all.

Every day, he watched for an opening in Oticester, plotting his next move.

Only by climbing to the very top could he hope to truly impress her.
###Chapter 43 Concern

The car pulled up in front of the old apartment building. Emilia and Sloane climbed out, both flushed and unsteady from the drinks they'd shared.

"Honestly, Emilia, you never let anything slip through the cracks. It's like you've got everything figured out all the time." Sloane's gaze lingered on Emilia, admiration lighting up her face.

Emilia's tone dropped, gentle but serious."There's something on my mind I want to share."

"You know you can say anything to me. We're practically joined at the hip." With a quick grin,Sloane hooked her arm through Emilia's and leaned closer.

With Emilia by her side, she felt an overwhelming sense of security.

Emilia's voice dropped to a whisper. "Once I join the Dixon family, I'll need some help behind the scenes. Your family might have to play a part if I'm going to pull this off." "Whatever you have to do, don't let me hold you back." Sloane's cheerful expression faded,replaced by a look of quiet resolve.

Memories flashed through her mind-a father who drowned his regrets in booze and cards,who'd driven her mother past the breaking point, and a younger brother who had become his father's mirror image.

Letting Emilia use them felt almost like giving that mess of a family some purpose.

"It could drag you into something messy..."Before Emilia could finish, Sloane cut her off.

"Nothing you ask for could ever be too much.I owe everything to you, Emilia. If you hadn't pulled me out, I probably wouldn't even be here,"Sloane said,her voice steady.

Had Emilia not stepped in, Sloane would have been swallowed whole by that wreck of a family,left with nothing but pain until it broke her completely.

Instead,she'd found her strength-and now she was ready to settle the score for her mother. Meanwhile, across the street, a sleek black car sat quietly in the shadows,hidden from view,watching and waiting.

"Not planning to say hi?" Wilbur asked, casting a sidelong look at Elias through the rearview mirror.

Rodger had already gotten what was coming to him-his right hand was out of commission,which meant he'd be fumbling with his left for a long while.

"Let's get out of here," Elias replied, his voice sharp and ice-cold.

A laugh bubbled out of Wilbur. "This is new for you. Never seen you act this way over anyone.Is she really that special, or is this just love at first sight?"

Elias cut him off with a look so cold; Wilbur fell silent at once, though he couldn't wipe the grin from his face.
"Okay, okay, I'll zip it," WVilbur said, firing up the engine,his amusement plain as they rolled away.

There was no doubt in his mind-Elias was worried about Emilia.Why else would he have dropped everything and raced to the club the second he heard there was trouble, all because Emilia was there?

Watching her walk out unharmed didn't put his mind at ease. He followed her all the way home,making sure nothing else happened on the way.

They drove in silence for a stretch until Elias finally broke it. "All for the treatment opportunity from Asclepius."

Realization dawned on Wilbur. "So that's what's eating at you. You're not worried about her-you're worried about missing out on Asclepius.For a second there, I thought you were finally catching feelings.I should've known better. The infamous iceman isn't about to melt for anyone.I can't help but wonder what kind of woman would actually manage to break through that armor of yours."

Wilbur's chatter kept going, until Elias pinched the bridge of his nose, clearly running out of patience.

"That's enough," Elias said, shutting his eyes and leaning back against the seat.

Wilbur kept quiet after that, and a calm hush settled over the car. They'd made it halfway home when a phone rang sharply, shattering the peace.

Wilbur answered, voice low as he listened through the earpiece. His expression darkened,a storm brewing behind his eyes.

Catching the shift, Elias snapped to attention,icy stare fixed forward.

Before he could get a word out, Wilbur's voice cut through the tension, sharp and cold. "We've got a lead on Inferno's boss."
###Chapter 44 Lead

Elias's gaze, already stripped of warmth, sank into an even harder, colder edge.

Word on the street was out-Inferno's leader,Lord Inferno, had finally emerged from the dark after years spent underground.

Throughout the long silence, Elias never gave up hunting the elusive Lord Inferno.

Fragments from the car crash years before had pointed straight toward Inferno, then the trail had vanished. The evidence still pointed to him.

A thin slit narrowed Elias's eyes as murderous intent radiated off him, so fierce it seemed to press against the car's cramped space.

"Where is he?" His voice was icy, echoing like a cursefrom the abyss.

"His movements were traced to Ceesall,"Wilbur answered, his tone flat.

"Prepare to move on Ceesall," Elias said, each word edged with lethal purpose. "Bring Lord Inferno in alive." "I'll get right on it," Wilbur replied, already preparing the orders to locate the exact whereabouts of the Lord Inferno.

Fingers tightened around the wheel as Wilbur's jaw tensed. At last, they had a real chance to get even for everything Elias had suffered.

In Wilbur's mind, revenge would be served one lash at a time. He pictured patching Lord Inferno up between sessions, just to start over.

He swore he would break Lord Inferno's legs to crush his pride as thoroughly as his body.

The pain Elias endured had left him unable to walk, and Wilbur wanted nothing less than to cripple Lord Inferno the same way, stripping away every shred of arrogance.

The thought of capturing and torturing Lord Inferno filled Wilbur with a fierce energy, his blood boiling with excitement. He believed their trap this time could not be escaped.


...
By the following morning, Sebastian shook off the hangover and switched on his phone, only to be met with a message that sent him racing to the hospital.

Halfway there, his day took another sharp downturn. Word reached him that Tyrone-the man he'd hired to deal with Emilia-had gotten caught up in a violent turf war. Apparently,Tyrone was gone for good.

With no call from Tyrone, Sebastian had no way of knowing whether the man had reached Emilia or if he had been gunned down before ever meeting her.

"Damn it!" Sebastian exploded, smacking his palm against the steering wheel as anger welled up inside him. It felt like everything in his life was unraveling.

It started with his brother, who was attacked out of nowhere and left stuck in a hospital bed,nursing a busted hand.

Now this-news of Tyrone's death felt like fate was piling on every bit of bad luck it could find.

Bursting through the hospital doors, Sebastian stepped into Rodger's room and was met by the sound of Violet's tearful voice.

"I'm sorry, Rodger. I keep messing things up,even the easy ones..." Violet had been tending to Rodger as best as she could, but her inexperience showed every time she jostled his broken hand. She'd never needed to look after anyone before, and the awkwardness of it weighed heavy on her.

"Don't cry. You're doing fine," Rodger told her gently, his chest tightening at the sight of her red,swollen eyes.

For a moment, memories of Emilia tending to him flashed through his mind.

She never claimed to be an expert in the kitchen, but when it came to nursing him back to health, Emilia managed everything with confidence.

Through all that time, she had never once faltered or caused him pain. Emilia had handled his recovery with the competence of someone who had done it a hundred times before.
###Chapter 45 Culprit

Rodger drifted off, his mind replaying moments when Emilia had looked after him. He didn't even notice the faint smile forming on his lips.

Violet shot Rodger a sidelong glance, suspicion twisting in her chest. It hadn't even been that long,but here he was-zoning out and grinning to himself.

Who exactly was occupying his thoughts? Was it possible he had Emilia on his mind?

The idea made Violet's face go pale, her teeth pressing nervously into her lower lip as she debated whether to say something.

"Rodger, what's got you lost in thought over there?" Sebastian's voice cut in, echoing her own worries before she could work up the nerve.

Jolted back to the present, Rodger quickly wiped the smile from his face.

"Oh,nothing much. Just got lost in the memory of how Violet and I first crossed paths." Rodger forced a grin, hiding his unease behind the smile. All the while, he wondered what had come over him to let Emilia invade his thoughts like that.

"It's good seeing you two find your way back to each other. Honestly, if Emilia hadn't stirred things up, you'd probably have kids by now."Sebastian's jaw clenched the second he heard Emilia's name.

Violet shook her head, her voice soft."Sebastian, don't put all the blame on Emilia.She got dragged into things, too. Really, it's all my fault..."

"How is it your fault? You never had a choice-you were forced to leave everything behind.Don't blame yourself." Sebastian was quick to reassure her.

"I'm really sorry," Violet murmured, her eyes growing wet with fake tears.

"Violet..." Rodger reached for her hand and pressed a gentle kiss to her forehead. "You have nothing to be sorry for. None of this is your fault."

"Alright, enough about the past. Rodger, what happened to you? How'd you end up getting roughed up like that?" Sebastian waved off the gloom with a sigh.

"I wish I knew. The police are still looking into it."Rodger shook his head, frustration clouding his features.

All he could remember was being jumped by a group who never even said a word-just blindsided him and left his hand busted.

Suddenly, a memory flashed. He'd grabbed Emilia by the throat earlier with that same hand.Could she have had something to do with his injury?

Rodger's eyes widened for a split second,surprise flickering across his face before he forced himself to relax.

No way,he thought. Emilia wouldn't go after him like that. If she'd wanted to break his arm, she would have done it right there in the parking lot,not let him off easy only to strike from the shadows later.

Sebastian clenched his fists, anger flashing in his eyes. "Whoever did this won't get away with it. I promise I'll make things right for you."

Violet leaned in, her voice gentle. "Did you upset someone without realizing it?" Rodger shook his head, still trying to piece it together. "I've gone over it a dozen times.Can't think of anyone I've crossed lately."

"Maybe it's someone holding a grudge? Or an old rival coming back to settle the score?"Violet wondered aloud.

Sebastian's face suddenly lit up with realization."I've got it! This has Webster written all over it.He also ended up at the hospital, so he's harboring a grudge and secretly retaliating."

Besides Webster, Sebastian couldn't think of a single person with enough reason to go after Rodger.

"That actually makes a lot of sense," Violet said,her suspicions now firmly pointed at Webster.

It wouldn't be the first time those two had locked horns-Webster and Rodger had a long history of butting heads, sometimes in broad daylight, othertimes in the shadows.

Rodger's fingers curled into a fist, the anger simmering just beneath the surface. Deep down,he was starting to believe Webster was the one behind the attack. "Don't lose sleep over it, Rodger. If we catch Webster in the act, I'll make sure he regrets ever messing with us. He wants to play dirty?Fine-we'll show him what that really means!"Sebastian tried to offer some reassurance.

He lingered beside the hospital bed, but his mind wandered, irritation twisting inside him. He still hadn't settled things with Emilia, and the thought of it gnawed at him.

"What rotten luck! I even paid Tyrone last night to put Emilia in her place, and he winds up dead before he can lift a finger. All that money down the drain."

Rodger's eyes widened in disbelief as the words sank in. Without thinking, he shot up from his seat and grabbed Sebastian by the collar, his grip tightening.

"Hold on-what did you just say? Who's dead?"
###Chapter 46 Plant

Sebastian turned to Rodger, his face full of confusion. "Rodger, what's going on?"

The way Rodger reacted seemed completely out of place.

"Don't get upset, Rodger. Sebastian said 'he,'not 'she,'" Violet murmured, even as her own heart ached so badly she could hardly breathe.

"Tyrone's the one who died?" Rodger finally let go of Sebastian's collar, smoothing the fabric with a quick apology. "Sorry, it's not Emilia's life I was worried about."

Sebastian narrowed his eyes. "Then why are you so agitated? Are you actually worried about Tyrone?" He studied Rodger closely, unsure what to make of it.

Rodger and Emilia had spent three years under the same roof. Even if he had never shown her any kindness, who could say there were no feelings left? Only someone as gentle as Violet deserved a place in the Mitchell family. Emilia,with all her plotting and games, had no right to remain as Rodger's wife.

"So, how did Tyrone die?" Rodger ignored Sebastian's question, shifting the subject with a tense look. It was so abnormal that he lost his mind over Emilia's death.

"They're saying there was a gang fight, and Tyrone was caught in it," Sebastian explained,his voice straightforward.

Violet's hands balled into fists, and her teeth clenched tight. Somehow, Emilia always managed to slip away unharmed.

Even so, Violet forced a look of soft concern onto her face, her words dripping with practiced sweetness. "Is Emilia alright?"

With a frustrated shake of his head, Sebastian replied, "She's completely fine. Not even a bruise."

Violet let out a long, fake sigh of relief. "That's a relief."

Truthfully,Violet wished nothing more than for Emilia to meet a miserable end. The way Rodger lost his composure earlier proved he felt something for Emilia, even if he refused to acknowledge it. If he ever discovered that Emilia had been the one who rescued him all those years ago, Emilia believed that everything she had worked for would be threatened. She could not let that happen. Whatever feelings Rodger had for Emilia needed to be wiped out completely.

A flash of malice passed through Violet's eyes as she made up her mind.

Sebastian turned to Rodger, voicing what was on his mind. "Rodger, are you sure there's nothing between you and Emilia?"

Rodger locked eyes with Violet and spoke with unusual gentleness. "Don't listen to him, Violet.You're the only woman I could ever care for."

Violet kept her voice low and trusting. "I believe you."

Sebastian gave Rodger a warning look. "You'd better not, Rodger. Violet saved your life. She deserves your loyalty."

Rodger squeezed Violet's hand in reassurance."I haven't forgotten," he replied.

Yet, in that moment, a strange thought crept into his mind; he had never held Emilia's hand with the same tenderness.

Before he could linger on that idea, Sebastian broke the silence.

"You know, I have a theory about Emilia. I think she's a plant from Webster. She can drive like a professional, and she's got fighting skills, but she kept that all hidden. Thanks to her, we lost twenty percent of our shares, and then she handed them straight to Webster. There's definitely something suspicious going on there."1
Rodger's expression hardened at once. The worry he had felt over Emilia's possible death was instantly replaced with fury. Rage burned inside him at the thought of her betrayal.

Looking back, he felt duped, and his anger made him want to erase every memory of her.The possibility that Emilia had been Webster's spy all along left him reeling.
###Chapter 47 Everything Lined Up
 "Do you really believe she'd go that far? Emilia just doesn't seem like the type," Violet said,putting on a look of surprise as she came to Emilia's defense.

Deep down, though, she felt a flicker of satisfaction. If Emilia really had joined forces with Webster, Rodger would go after her with everything he had.

Rodger and Webster's feud was no secret-those two had always been locked in a battle,each determined to take the other down.

Back in the day, neither side could gain an inch.Only in recent years had the Mitchell family started pulling ahead, casting a shadow over the Garza family and leaving Webster stewing in his own resentment.

"And you honestly believe she's innocent? You all saw how she treated Webster at the racetrack. There's definitely something going on!I saw the news too-a blurry photo of some man's back. Don't try to tell me that wasn't
<###Chapter 47 Everything Lined Up
Webster. Emnilia isn't even divorced from Rodger  yet and she's already running around behind his back. She's shameless!" Sebastian's voice rose with each word, his anger boiling over.

As far as he was concerned,Emilia was throwing Rodger away and dragging the Mitchell name through the mud.

"Maybe that man really was Webster. He does wear a Patek Philippe just like in the photo. Still,I want to beleve Emilia has her reasons." Violet kept her tone gentle.

Even in a blurry photo, the man in the news looked like someone impossible to ignore-tall,confident,every bit the center of attention.

Webster might have been easy on the eyes and in decent shape, but he couldn't match the commanding presence of the man in that photograph.

Violet could tell they weren't the same, even if the watch in the picture matched Webster's exactly.

Still, she nudged Rodger and Sebastian to believe otherwise, carefully fanning the flames of suspicion so Rodger would turn even further from Emilia.

She was determined to make sure there was no future for the two of them.

"You can't deny it now! Webster's been in on this from the start. The guy even dropped a fortune on a red Pagani for her. That kind of gift? No way they're not on the same side."Ethan fumed, his voice tight with anger. 2

Rodger's fists clenched as he tried to fight off the doubt. His anger grew, but a stubborn part of him still resisted believing it all. "But that's not just any car-it's one of five in existence.Could he really have pulled that off? I haven't heard a word about Webster buying a Pagani."

"Who knows how he pulled it off. But that Patek Philippe watch-there's no mistaking it,"said Sebastian.

Rodger went quiet, his mind in turmoil.Resentment warred with disbelief. Had Emilia's three years with the Mitchell family all been a performance? Had he been fooled the whole time?

Maybe Emilia had swallowed her pride for Webster,playing the long game as a spy inside the Mitchell family all this time? Rodger's mind jumped to the big contract that Webster had snatched out from under them.Suddenly,everything lined up in his head.

It had to be true. Emilia must have been a plant - someone Webster embedded with the Mitchell family to steal their secrets, working in silence for years just to bring them down.

"I really think you're misunderstanding Emilia.She-"

Rodger's tone was sharp, slicing through Violet's words. "That's enough. I don't want to hear her name again. Don't try to defend her."

Sebastian immediately chimed in, his voice cold,"Violet, stop wasting sympathy on someone who trampled on her vows. Emilia isn't worth your concern."

Right then, Rodger's phone rang, cutting through the heavy silence. He snatched it up,listened for a moment,then stormed toward the door,expectation etched across his face.

"Rodger! Where are you going?" Sebastian shouted after him, worry creasing his brow.
###Chapter 48 Bump Into Her

Rodger called out over his shoulder,determination in his voice, "I just got word-Asclepius was spotted in the hospital. We can't let this chance slip by."

Sebastian immediately fell in beside him. "I'll help you look. We'll cover more ground together."

Violet trailed behind, her voice light and teasing."Don't leave me behind, Rodger."

"We'll have better luckif we split up. Let's each search a different floor." Rodger paused,glancing back at them both.

Without another word, the three of them fanned out in separate directions.



After half an hour of searching every corridor and peering into every room, Violet was out of breath and no closer to finding Asclepius.

Doubt began to creep in-maybe it was all just a rumor. No one had ever seen what Asclepius looked like,so how could anyone know for sure he was here? Hunting for a mystery man in the chaos of a hospital felt hopeless-like chasing after a ghost.

Jealousy gnawed at Violet as she thought about those fortunate enough to receive Asclepius's legendary healing. The unfairness of it made her blood boil.

Word around the hospital was that this time,Asclepius had picked someone who came from nothing. Not only had this ordinary person caught his attention, but they wouldn't pay a single dime for the miracle cure-it was all on the house.

Why did luck always seem to favor people like that? Why not her?

Violet truly believed her life carried far more weight than some nobody's. She couldn't fathom why Asclepius would waste his talent and resources on people who brought him nothing in return.

No matter how hard she tried, Violet couldn't figureout what motivated him. He had his pick of powerful politicians and rich elites, but instead, he insisted on helping those at the bottom-and for free.

Treating the ailments of the wealthy could buy him fortune or connections. Tending to the sick and poor only drained his own pockets, and she just couldn't see any sense in it.

Violet's irritation bubbled over as her thoughts spiraled, and she didn't even notice someone stepping into her path until it was too late.

"Ouch!" she shouted and landed hard on the floor. Without bothering to look up, she yelled,"Why don't you watch where you're walking? At least give me a hand!"

Emilia regained her footing and folded her arms,casting a cool gaze down at Violet sprawled on the floor.

"You're the one who came barreling around the corner," Emilia replied with a chilly chuckle."Not really my problem,is it?"

Just a few paces earlier, Emilia had turned the corner, and Violet's lack of attention had sent them crashing together. If Emilia hadn't caught herself, she might have ended up flat on the floor,too.

The sound of that voice snapped Violet's head up. There stood Emilia, looking as unfazed and self-assured as ever.

"You did that on purpose, didn't you?" Violet accused, bitterness in her tone. "Can't get Rodger back, so you go around causing trouble for me?"

Emilia didn't miss a beat. "I don't have time to waste charming him all day like you do," she retorted, a hint of ridicule in her smile. "Some of us actually have better things to do."

"Keep telling yourself that. You'll never be good enough for Rodger, no matter how hard you try.You're nothing but a joke to him." Violet's lips curled in a sneer.

"If you're so desperate for him, be my guest,"Emilia retorted, her tone icy.

She started to walk away, but Violet suddenly wrapped herself around her leg, sobbing.

"Emilia, I'm so sorry! It's all my fault. I shouldn't have stolen Rodger from you. If you want to yell at mne or slap me, I'll take it. I deserve it."

Emilia's brow knitted together in confusion.What was Violet playing at now? Before she could process it, someone gave her a hard shove from behind.

The force slammed Emilia into the wall, pain shooting through her arm as it struck the surface.

She winced and immediately checked her arm,anxiety flaring. If she injured her hand now, her days as a surgeon could be over for good.
###Chapter 49 Interfere

Emilia drew in a soft breath of relief, grateful her hands were still unharmed. If her hand had been injured, the Mitchell family would be facing ruin now!

"Violet, are you hurt?" Rodger asked,his worried eyes scanning her face.

"I'm okay. Please don't blame Emilia for this.I tripped because I wasn't watching my step,not because of anything she did." Violet's words shook with fake sobs, her body trembling uncontrollably.

"How can you say it's not her fault? Emilia was the one who pushed you, wasn't she?" Sebastian snapped angrily.

In his mind, Violet's shaking was a sure sign that Emilia had threatened her.

"Emilia!" Rodger lost all control. He stormed forward,arm swinging up, ready to slap Emilia.It was one thing for her to betray her marriage,but to turn her malice on Violet as well proved she was petty to the core.
Violet and Sebastian stood together, watching with cold satisfaction as if Emilia deserved every bit of punishment. In their minds, Emilia had earned every bit of the punishment about to come.

Before Emilia could even lift her arm to shield herself, a figure rushed forward and caught Rodger's wrist in midair.

"And who dares interfere?" Rodger snarled,only to lock eyes with Wilbur's calm, mocking smile.

"I'll interfere whenever I feel like it. Does that bother you,Mr. Mitchell? "Wilbur replied,raising an eyebrow in defiance.

Rodger's face turned grim, his voice icy as he said, "This is a family matter. I suggest you mind your own business, Mr. Collins."

"Unlucky for you, I enjoy getting in the middle of other people's business. What will you do about it? Swing at me?" He looked Rodger up and down, gaze pausing on the cast wrapped around Rodger's arm. "With only one good arm,you're not much of a threat. If I decide to get rough,you'll need someone to hold it for you while you pee." Rodger's cheeks burned red."You-!"

Tears rimmed Violet's eyes as she stammered,"Mr. Collins, why do you have to talk like that?"

"I'm just telling the truth," said Wilbur, tossing her a look of disdain.

Violet bit her lip, letting the tears fall as her sorrow swallowed up her words.

"Being a part of the Collin family doesn't give you the right to boss around! Picking on Violet when you're a grown man is beneath contempt!"Sebastian's voice rang out with fury.

"Ha!" Wilbur scoffed, his words sharp with mockery."Really? I guess you two believe it's perfectly fine to gang up on someone yourselves. If you've got no shame,why should I pretend otherwise? You've got a lot of nerve criticizing me."

He sent a sharp look in their direction, making it obvious what he thought of both men.

"Emilia, say you're sorry to Violet, and I'll consider this settled," Rodger said coldly, his eyes fixed on her.

Emilia met his eyes,refusing to back down."I have nothing to apologize for. I didn't do anything wrong."

Rodger's glare deepened, his frustration mounting as he remembered the divorce papers sitting unsigned and Emilia already moving on.

Old questions echoed in his head. There had been nights when he doubted his own judgment about her.

Wilbur stepping in to defend Emilia only seemed to confirm what Rodger feared most-she was indeed unfaithful, and she was probably tangled up with Webster.

"You're inthe wrong here, Emilia! You shoved Violet, and now she's hurt. Do you really expect her to be the one saying sorry?" Rodger shouted.

"I never laid a hand on her. If the two of you can't see straight, maybe it's time for an eye exam," Emilia retorted, her finger pointing toward the security camera overhead. "There's a camera over there that recorded everything.Take a look at the footage if you want the truth."
###Chapter 50 Not Bothering Check
Violet's eyes darted up,and she spotted the security camera perched in the corner. The color drained from her face.

That camera had the perfect angle-every second of what happened would be caught in crystal-clear detail.

If someone reviewed the footage,her carefully crafted image as the gentle, innocent victim would be ruined in front of Rodger.

Violet's hands twisted nervously in her lap. No matter what, she couldn't let anyone check that recording.

Sebastian let out a mocking laugh. "Think that will daunt us? Everyone saw you push Violet!"

Rodger stepped closer and took Violet's hand in his, his touch gentle. He could feel her trembling and leaned in to comfort her. "It's alright, Violet. You don't have to be scared."

Fake tears glimmered in Violet's eyes as she stammered, "Rodger..."

"Tell me, was it Emilia who pushed you?"Rodger's voice grew soft, full of care.

Violet shook her head, fresh tears sliding down her cheeks. "No, it wasn't her. I lost my balance and fell."

Rodger squeezed her hand,his jaw set. "Alright.I understand."

When he turned to Emilia, his stare was as cold as ice-a silent warning that she was on thin ice with him. "Violet has always stood up for you.l don't need security footage to see what's happening-I know you're the one who pushed her. It doesn't matter how much you try to deny it. Emilia, I've put up with your behavior before,but if you keep targeting Violet and scheming against her..."

His gaze turned icy as it landed on Wilbur. "It won't matter who you turn to for help. If anything happens to Violet, you'll answer for it -with your life."

Without waiting for a reply, Rodger led Violet away,leaving Emilia behind without so much as a backward glance.Emilia watched them go, a sharp ache blooming in her chest as her fists clenched tight.

No matter what, Violet was always the one Rodger cared about most. His faith in her never wavered, not even for a moment.

Even with evidence right in front of him that could clear her name, he refused to look-choosing instead to believe the worst of her, no matter the truth.

In his eyes, Violet shone brighter than anyone,while she was just something to be scraped from the bottom of his shoe.

She had given Rodger her heart, only to have it trampled underfoot, met with nothing but his cold contempt.

Sebastian threw a look her way, his voice dripping with scorn. "Don't get too comfortable,Emilia. You think you can run around with all these men and get away with it? Sooner or later,it'll catch up with you."

He tossed one last glare at Wilbur before hurrying after his brother and Violet, his parting words hanging in the air like a warning. "Are you... alright?" Wilbur asked quietly, unsure if he should even break the silence.

He could only imagine how painful it must have been-having someone she cared about turn on her so publicly.

Rodger really had no idea what he'd just thrown away. He couldn't see the rare treasure right in front of him.

"I'm okay. And thank you for stepping in." Emilia managed a soft smile, tucking her hurt deep inside.

With her last ally in the Mitchell family gone,she knew she was truly on her own now. Not a single person left who would stand by her.

Wilbur shook his head. "If anyone deserves thanks, it's not me-it's my friend." He nodded toward a shadowy corner.

Emilia followed his gaze and caught a glimpse of a shoe sticking out from behind a pillar.

So Elias was there after all, not even trying to hide his presence completely.
###Chapter 51 Crave

Hidden behind the pillar, Elias sat in his wheelchair,his face unreadable and cold.

His long fingers curled tightly around the armrests, betraying a rare hint of nerves.

Wilbur's sudden gesture in his direction had caught him off guard, making him instinctively wheel himself back, eyes darting away like a boy caught sneaking sweets before dinner.

He couldn't remember the last time he'd felt so unsettled.

Why had Wilbur given him away like that?

Elias's thoughts raced in a quiet panic, but after a moment, he forced himself to settle down.

By now, Emilia was probably long gone.

Maybe Wilbur had only pointed him out to let her know he was nearby. Did Emilia really leave without even a word to him?

Pushing past his doubts, Elias rolled his chair forward, wanting to see for himself whether she was still there or if she'd already disappeared.

A sudden voice called out from behind. "Mr.Dixon!"

Elias jolted in surprise, his hand slipping as the wheelchair shot forward uncontrollably.

"Oh no!" Wilbur exclaimed, his face drained of color as he saw what was about to happen.

Before he could move, Emilia rushed in. She grabbed the back of the wheelchair and, with a quick twist,brought it to a halt. The abrupt stop sent Elias tumbling straight forward.

Without thinking,Emilia rushed to catch him in her arms, but her balance gave way. Both of them toppled back together, landing on the floor.

Their faces hovered just inches apart, close enough to share the same breath.

For a moment, time seemed to freeze as their eyes locked, the rest of the world fading into silence.

Elias leaned his head back just a touch, his eyes drawn to her red lips. He swallowed hard, the movement of his Adam's apple betraying a sudden tension.

The soft scent of her perfume drifted between them,weaving its way into his thoughts and tugging at something he didn't dare name.

"Mr. Dixon, are you hurt anywhere?" Emilia asked, straightening up, setting him back to the wheelchair and giving him a quick once-over.

"I'm alright," Elias replied,quickly glancing away to mask the flush of embarrassment on his face.

Wilbur hurried over, his relief obvious."Whew!That nearly gave me a heart attack. Glad you're okay. This wheelchair must be on its last legs-definitely time for a new one."

"I'm just relieved you're okay," Emilia said with a faint smile. "Your friend lent me a hand earlier,and now I've returned the favor. That makes us even."

"Right," Elias answered, his gaze dropping to the floor, carefully masking the flicker of disappointment in his eyes.

She was making it clear-she didn't want any deeper connection with him.

Emilia took a small step back. "Well, if there's nothing else, I'll get going."

"Alright," Elias replied, his tone clipped and cool.

Watching in silence as she walked away, Wilbur asked, "Why didn't you just ask her where she stands?"

"If she's made up her mind, she'll let us know,"Elias replied quietly.

"This is soaggravating. If we hadn't wasted time in Ceesall, we might've actually crossed paths with Asclepius."

"You know as welI as I do-Asclepius doesn't show himself to just anyone. Chasing after him is pointless unless he wants to be found.Sometimes you have to let fate do its thing."

"What really ticks me off is getting duped by that faker in Ceesall. We should've taught him a lesson for pretending to be Lord Inferno."

"Just keep searching. Sooner or later, his real trail will show up."

"Yeah. You have my word-I'll do everything possible to track himn down and make sure he pays," Wilbur said, determination etched into his features as he pictured hunting the man down himself.

Meanwhile, Elias's eyes stayed glued to the hallway where Emilia had vanished.

He kept replaying that fleeting moment in his mind-their bodies close, the spark of tension that neither of them dared name.

He'd always hated people invading his space,but when it came to Emilia, he didn't mind at all.

If he was honest with himself, maybe he even craved it.
###Chapter 52 Waiting

The following morning, just outside the courthouse.

Emilia sent out message after message,her calls going straight to voicemail every time.

All last evening, she had tried to get through to Rodger.Since nothing had worked, she had sent him a message, suggesting they meet up next day to wrap up the divorce documents.

Now, with plenty of time already gone,she still had not heard a single word back from him.

Sloane glanced over, her brow furrowed."He still hasn't answered anything?"

"No. I've called and texted him, but there's been nothing. We agreed on a time last night, but now I can't even tell what he's thinking," Emilia said with a sigh, shaking her head.

Sloane asked, "You're sure he promised to show up?"

"Yes, he sent me a message confirming everything.You can read it yourself," Emilia said, holding out her phone to let her see the screen.

"Is it possible he's ignoring you on purpose because you left him hanging before?" asked Sloane,her tone thoughtful.

"That's not it. He's the one who's desperate to end things. He's terrified that people might see Violet as the reason for our split. Even if he felt slighted, he wouldn't risk missing this chance,"Emilia said, sounding sure of herself.

Between them, this sort of drama felt pointless -something that happened with people who had just started dating, not with a pair like her and Rodger.

For Violet to secure her place, Rodger would never gamble with her good name.

Every extra day this divorce dragged on only increased the risk of people digging up rumors about Rodger cheating during the marriage.

If Violet ever got branded as the "mistress",those whispers would never die down online.Her reputation would take a blow she could not repair.
"You'd expect him to show up, even if he had to crawl out of a wreck. That man's never been
shy about wanting this over," said Sloane,scanning the crowd and folding her arms.

"Let's just give him a bit more time," Emilia responded,calm as ever.

Suddenly, a stranger appeared, pressing a colorful flyer into both of their hands.

Emilia handed hers to Sloane without glancing at it.

"This is amazing!" Sloane said, clutching Emilia's arm. "The new club just opened, and the deals are wild. These guys in the ads look unbelievable. We should hit the place tonight and see if it's as good as they say."

Emilia took a quick peek, and she had to admit,the men pictured were pretty striking.

Before she could stop herself, Emilia said, "They still don't compare to Rodger."

Sloane rolled her eyes. "Rodger? Please. Oliver outshines him any day. And Elias is the real stunner, but too bad he's got a limp. Wilbur isn't far behind either-he's got the looks to turn heads."

"Guess you have a point," said Emilia, giving in with a small nod.

"So,what do you think of this lineup? You know what people say-when you let someone new into your life, the last one fades into the background. Maybe you'll find one who makes you forget all about Rodger," Sloane teased.

A single memory crept into Emilia's thoughts,uninvited. She remembered being at the hospital with Elias, close enough to catch the heat of his breath.

That moment carried his scent-intoxicating and inviting, with something untamed and captivating about it. Everything about him suggested a quiet strength, and the air around him seemed to spark with a kind of restless energy.

Emilia's chest tightened as her cheeks warmed,embarrassment and excitement mixing together.



Meanwhile, over at the hospital, Rodger stretched out on the bed, his eyes flicking to the phone beside him.
 
A shadow crossed his features. He wondered why Emilia had not tried reaching out again. She had spent most of the morning blowing up his phone, practically demanding that he show up at the courthouse. Now, nothing but silence hung between them.
###Chapter 53 Stand Her Up

Rodger fought to appear calm, though a faint restlessness gnawed at him beneath the surface.

There was no question-sooner or later, Emilia would reach out again. At the very least,a message would come through.

Seconds dragged by, and the wait seemed endless, each moment lingering as if time itself had slowed.

His mind ran circles. Why hadn't Emilia bothered to call him back yet?

For a brief moment, he reached for his phone but hesitated, withdrawing his hand before touching it.

He was about to dial her number to find out what was happening when the sharp chime of a text message interrupted his hesitation.

Rodger's lips curled into a smile, softening the chill in his expression.

In his heart, he believed Emilia's passionate love for him would always pull her back. Without delay, he picked up his phone and opened the message.

His expression shifted, a hint of disappointment creasing his forehead-it turned out to be another curt reminder telling him to get to the courthouse.

Annoyance prickled inside him. Was Emilia really that desperate to cut ties, all for the sake of being with Webster?

In her dreams!

The memory of her standing him up before still stung, and in childish defiance, he tapped out a reply,claiming he was on the way and would arrive soon.

Once the message was sent, he put his phone aside.
She had humiliated him before. He was set on giving her a taste of her own medicine. If he let this slide, she'd think he was nothing but weak.

When Violet stepped into the hospital room,she found him brooding, so deep in thought he didn't notice her presence.

Her eyes narrowed with suspicion. Was he still hung up on that manipulative Emilia?

Violet crossed the room in quick steps, her voice soft and sweet as she said, "Rodger..."

"Hmm?" Rodger snapped back to reality,instantly adopting a gentle demeanor, his eyes filled with deep affection.

"Didn't Emilia ask you to handle the divorce papers?" Violet asked, feigning casual curiosity.

"She mentioned it, but I'mn in no state to deal with that now. I figured I'd wait until l've recovered," Rodger admitted plainly.

Violet's tone turned playful as she leaned closer."You know, Rodger, maybe Emilia's not all that eager to let you go. Back when you were well,she kept stringing you along. Now that you're laid up, suddenly she's chasing after you again."

Her words brought back memories of Emilia's desperate calls. It almost felt like she was trying to keep him guessing rather than truly wanting a divorce.

Rodger's thoughts wandered. Maybe Emilia had been tangled up with Webster before their marriage,but after saying their vows, she must have gotten swept up by his charm. Why else would she keep the Mitchell family's secrets safe all this time and never tip off Webster? If her feelings had been fake, she would've handed everything over to the Garzas and watched the Mitchells fall.

When she sold those shares to Webster, it seemed like nothing more than a petty move meant to get under his skin.

For the first time, Rodger felt certain-Emilia was hooked on him as much as ever.

"Rodger, your phone is ringing," Violet reminded softly.

He blinked, pulled from his thoughts, glanced at the screen, and pressed the phone to silent.

"Who was it?" Violet asked, her voice tentative.

"Nobody important. Just a spam call," Rodger said flatly, hiding the truth behind an unreadable face.

Emilia had stood him up before, so now he was doing the same to her-it was only fair.

"I see," Violet answered, unconvinced but unwilling to press further. Changing the subject, Rodger asked gently,"Violet, aren't you preparing for the national ballet competition? Word has it the runner-up from the global competition is visiting Oticester's top dance academy to scout for talent. If you manage to become that person's student, the national title will be yours without a doubt."

Violet hesitated, her teeth grazing her lower lip."There's a catch, though. Getting into Oticester's elite academy isn't just about dance skills. They want good grades, or at least some powerful family ties."

Her dancing came naturally, but her academic performance always fell short.

Money was never the issue, but her family had never set down deep roots in Oticester. Their wealth hadn't bought them the kind of influence that opened doors at the city's top dance academy
###Chapter 54 Exam

Rodger took Violet's hand in his, his voice gentle and full of promise. "You don't have to worry about a thing. Everything's set. You can start at the academy tomorrow."

"Are you serious?" Violet looked at him in surprise, her emotions surging.

She didn't need to be in Oticester's top dance academy for its own sake-what really mattered was that the world's silver medalist in ballet was coming to scout for new talent.

Once she claimed the national title, Violet was determined to earn a place as that gold medalist's apprentice, setting her sights on the global stage.

"Of course." Rodger smiled softly, brushing his thumb along her cheek. "I would never mislead you,Violet."

Violet beamed, throwing her arms around him and peppering his face with eager kisses."You're amazing,Rodger!"

He pulled her in, and the two got swept up in a kiss, the rest of the world fading away.

Just as the moment deepened, his phone buzzed, slicing through their bliss.

"Rodger, your phone," Violet murmured, leaning into him, her longing clear.

"Let it be," he whispered, drawing her closer as their lips met again, lost in each other.

...
Outside the courthouse.

"What? He still hasn't picked up?" Sloane's tone sharpened with irritation.

"No. He sent a text saying he was on his way,but now he's ghosting me." Emilia shook her head,brows knitting together.

"He's totally playing games with you, Emilia. I'd bet on it." Sloane huffed, barely hiding her annoyance.

Emilia tried again-sent another message, dialed his number-nothing. This time, the call was cut off, and then his phone went straight to voicemail. "He switched his phone off," said Emilia.

"I knew it! He's stringing you along. Let's go to his place and make him face us."

Emilia caught Sloane's arm before she could storm off. "Don't. It's not worth it."

"We're just supposed to sit here and let him waste our time? He's the one who wanted this divorce so badly, but now he's got you waiting around like a fool," Sloane scoffed, her frustration simmering.

"If he doesn't want the divorce, that's fine by me. Sooner or later, he'll be the one chasing after me for it." Emilia's lips curled into a cool smile and blocked his number.

She had all the time in the world, but Violet didn't have that luxury. As long as she held onto the marriage, Violet was stuck playing the other woman-forever in the shadows, always facing judgment.

"I can't stand this! You have to come out with me tonight. We need to hit the club. Nothing cures frustration like a few hot guys and some chiseled abs. I'm not going home until I've squeezed at least one!" Sloane declared, feigning outrage.

That drew a genuine laugh from Emilia. "Alright,alright, I'll splurge for you tonight. You can have the pick of the top escorts-my treat."

"You really are the best." Sloane grinned and slung an arm over Emilia's shoulders.

"Before that," Emilia said, "take me to the city's top dance academy. I want to register for the independent entrance exam and check out their studio."

"You're really going for the independent track?You haven't danced in forever. Are you sure you'll pass? I heard their exam is even stricter than what their teachers have to go through."Sloane raised an eyebrow.

That academy only offered two ways in: nail the grueling independent entrance exam, or earn a spot through the teachers' evaluation.

For the exam, one had to perform a ballet routine while a machine scored their every move-no room for error, no chance for bias.

Passing the ballet exam required a score of no less than ninety-five, and even the smallest error in posture or movement could mean failure.

On top of that,both the ballet portion and the other subjects had to be finished within a strict time limit, and applicants were expected to score 15 points higher than what the teachers usually required.

By comparison, the teacher evaluation was far more forgiving, allowing students with slightly lower marks a chance at admission.

Because of this, most students chose the safer route of teacher evaluation, unless they were certain of their skills and dared to take on the independent entrance test.

Hardly anyone managed to pass through the entrance exam, and for the past two years, not a single student had succeeded at this academy.
###Chapter 55 Challenge Tower

Emilia stayed collected and gave a halfhearted shrug. "I'll give it a shot."

"Why not turn to Oliver? His wealth and connections could smooth this over in a second,and you wouldn't even need to take the exam,"said Sloane.

If Emilia wanted to rely on her status, she could get whatever she wanted without asking anyone else. The problem was that Elias would catch on immediately.

Emilia had once saved Oliver's daughter, so asking him for support would have been simple and beyond suspicion.

"If I don't pass, I'll think about it then." Sliding on her sunglasses, Emilia slipped into the back seat with practiced ease. "Drive."

"Yes, Your Highness! The Sloane Express is fueled up and ready to launch." Sloane pressed her lips together, fighting back her laughter as she saluted dramatically. Their laughter spilled into the air,filling the car with lightness that made the moment feel untouchable.



At Oticester's Dance Academy.

"Did you hear? Someone actually stepped into the Challenge Tower. I wonder which dance she's going to be tested on."

"Who dares? No one's cleared that tower in two years."

"Word is it's a girl. Pretty, graceful. Want to sneak over and watch?"
"I'll pass. Looks aren't enough in there. She's too full of herself, and she'll be in tears before long."

"Or maybe she's just another influencer desperate for views. That's all they ever do-chasing attention without offering much else."

Word of a challenger inside the Dance Academy's infamous tower spread quickly,but most people weren't socked. Every year brought waves of hopefuls, and almost every year ended in disappointment. The few who dared often walked in with inflated egos or a thirst for online fame.

The ones who had spent years at the academy rarely paid attention to anyone stepping into the Challenge Tower. It was usually the newer students who gathered to watch, drawn in by the thrill of it all.

Hidden in the shadows, Sloane kept her eyes on the tower's entrance, her chest tight with nerves.

She worried that Emilia's long break from dancing might cause even the smallest slip,which would be enough to ruin her chances.

The exam left no room for error. The clock was merciless, and everything had to be finished flawlessly in one attempt.

Under a teacher's assessment, there would have been pauses between the dance trial and the written portions, but this exam offered no such mercy.

The crowd's chatter was harsh, mocking Emilia before she had even stepped out.

Many dismissed her as nothing more than a pretender looking for fame,and their words cut deep.

If Sloane weren't trying to avoid a scene, she would have already confronted them.

Once Emilia succeeded, it would silence every sneer and sting every skeptic, and Sloane couldn't wait to see that.

Minutes crawled past like hours.

At last, Emilia emerged from the Challenge Tower, her face calm and impossible to read.

"She's back! Look at her-so calm! Did she actually pull it off? Hurry,give us the results!"

"I kept track of the time. She finished ten minutes faster than the last person who cleared it three years ago. No way she passed."

"Yeah, I don't buy it either. Breaking that record is impossible."

Above them, the giant screen in front of the Challenge Tower continued its relentless countdown.
###Chapter 56 Pass

The crowd held its breath as the countdown reached its end, the glowing numbers fading into a single digit-1.

A bright message stretched across the screen: "Congratulations! You cleared the challenge!"

"No way! She actually pulled it off? It's been two whole years since anyone managed this."

"I figured it was just another wannabe influencer chasing views, but she is the real deal. She even finished ten minutes quicker than the veteran who passed three years back. Now I'm dying to know what style she used."

"The tower never reveals the details, only whether you passed or failed. We could just ask...wait, where did she disappear to?"

The crowd scanned the plaza, but Emilia and Sloane were already gone, their car slipping into the street before anyone could stop them.

Inside the car. "I honestly thought you might be out of practice and fall short, but clearly I was worrying for nothing," said Sloane, grinning as he glanced her way.

"I guess I was a little out of practice. I only managed to finish 10 faster than the one who cleared it three years ago," said Emilia, slumping against the seat with a faint trace of sadness in her tone.

"Oh, cut it out! You were holding back on purpose. If you'd gone all in, you would've shattered the record, made headlines across the country, and had every academy principal knocking on your door before sunrise,"remarked Sloane with a knowing look.

Had Emilia chosen to unleash her full ability,her record might have stood as an untouchable mark for years to come.

"Come on, I'm not that good," Emilia teased with a crooked smile.

"In my eyes, you are the best. No matter what anyone else says, you'll always be the best in the world to me," Sloane said with a laugh.

Their banter soon turned into an exchange of playful exaggerations, both tossing out over-the-top compliments until the car was filled with laughter.

The lighthearted mood broke as the apartment building came into view. Sloane's grin faded in an instant.

"What the hell is that bastard's brother doing here?" Her eyes narrowed, her displeasure plain as she caught sight of Sebastian lounging against a sleek black Ferrari.

"Look at him, trying to pull off the cool act with his hands stuffed in his pockets. Too bad he's nowhere near Elias' league," Sloane muttered,tightening her grip on the steering wheel and rolling her eyes with deliberate annoyance.

For a fleeting second, she imagined slamming her foot on the gas and sending Sebastian flying.He had been nothing but a nuisance to Emilia,and she'd been itching for an excuse to wipe that smug look off his face.

The mention of Elias' name stirred something in Emilia, her mind painting the image of his strikingly defined face.

His features seemed as though they were chiseled from stone-sharp lines, bold and commanding, with a proud nose and thin lips that came together in near perfection.

Sebastian might have been handsome in a conventional sense,but when measured against Elias, he was just ordinary.

Sebastian drummed his fingers against the Ferrari, irritation building as he debated asking Rodger for Emilia's number. Just then, a plain black car rolled into viewv. He wouldn't have spared the vehicle a thought if not for the sight of two familiar figures stepping out-the very women he couldn't stand.

Neither Emilia nor Sloane spared him a glance.They closed the car doors and strode off as if he didn't even exist.

Still propped againstthe hood, Sebastian had expected them to come over, maybe even demand an explanation for his presence.Instead,they brushed past him without the slightest acknowledgment.
"Hey, wait up!" he shouted, the sting of being ignored reddening his face as he rushed forward.

"What do you want now?" Sloane retorted,her eyes narrowing with open contempt. "Move it! This doesn't concern you," Sebastian snapped,giving her an irritated glare.

Turning to Emilia, Sebastian asked, "Do you have the guts to place a bet with me?"
###Chapter 57 One-On-One Match


"What's the bet?" Emilia asked, her tone steady,almost indifferent.

′′Aone-on-one match! Just you and me," Sebastian retorted with confidence.

From what he knew, gaming wasn't her thing. If she dared to accept, he was certain he'd crush her without breaking a sweat.

Sloane burst into laughter at the sight of his smug grin.

Did this fool have any idea who Emilia really was? To think he could challenge her in a solo match was laughable.

"What's so amusing? You'll be the one bawling when you lose!" Sebastian screamed, glaring at her in irritation. In his eyes, Emilia was infuriating enough, but her friend was worse. He hadn't forgotten the humiliation on the track, and he still seethed at the fact that his hired muscle had failed to make them pay.

"We won't be shedding any tears. But when you're the one who loses, don't start whining about it,"Sloane scoffed with a smirk, folding her arms.

Her confidence unsettled Sebastian, and for the first time, doubt crept in. Could Emilia actually be good at this?

He furrowed his brows, thinking back to the Mitchell estate. She never had games on her phone or her computer, not even something simple like candy-matching apps. No, there was no way-she had to be a total novice.

Sebastian smirked to himself, convinced Sloane was just trying to mess with his confidence. She clearly wanted him to second-guess Emilia, to imagine she was some hidden gaming expert and back away from the bet. As if he'd fall for such a cheap trick. He wasn't nearly as gullible as they were.

"So what's the deal? Are you too scared to face me?"Sebastian taunted, his voice dripping with arrogance.To him, Emilia's hesitation spoke louder than words.If she were truly skilled, she'd have accepted the challenge instantly. Hesitation only proved she was bluffing.

"What are the terms?" Emilia asked coolly, her expression giving nothing away.

His eyes lit up with mischief as he declared, "If I lose,you'll get five million. But if you lose, that red Pagani of yours belongs to me."

"You've lost your mind. That car is worth fifty, maybe sixty million, and you think five million covers it?"Sloane scoffed, rolling her eyes so hard it hurt.There were only five of those in the world, and money alone wouldn't buy one.
"Sebastian, even if I practically gave this car away, it wouldn't go for less than five million. If you want to make a bet, at least come up with something that isn't an insult," Emilia remarked with a sharp laugh.

She knew beating Sebastian would be effortless, but there was no way she'd let him believe five million was enough to buy her Pagani, a car worth ten times that. To him, not only was she worthless, even her car was something beneath his status.

"Admit it, you're scared," Sebastian sneered, hoping to provoke her.

She wasn't about to take the bait. A cold smile curved her lips as she answered, "Cheap tricks won't get to me. If you want this bet, then put thirty million on the table. Otherwise, don't waste my time."

"Thirty million? You think you're worth that much?"Sebastian's voice dripped with disdain as he looked her up and down.

He could afford it, but in his mind, Emilia would always be cheap.

"Then don't bother trying to gamble with me," Emilia answered, her laugh as sharp as broken glass.Sliding her sunglasses into place, she turned to Sloane. "Come on, we're leaving."

When they moved to walk past him, Sebastian lunged forward to block their way. He was certain Emilia was bluffing. She must be desperate to avoid the challenge. If he cornered her into agreeing,the Pagani would be his. One easy victory, and the car would fall into his hands for free. Even if he couldn't stand the idea of her driving it before him,he could hand it off to another wealthy heir and buy himself influence for the Mitchell family.

"Fine. Thirty million it is. I'll take that bet," Sebastian declared, puffing up with confidence.
###Chapter 58 Witness


.Emilia tilted her head and wagged her finger with a sly smile. "Not enough now."

"You're just too scared to take the bet!" Sebastian snapped, frustration burning in his eyes.

"That's not the problem. I was willing to put down thirty million earlier, but now the pot's up to forty,"Emilia replied, her grin never fading.

Sebastian's chest tightened with anger. The urge to lash out was written all over his face. "You..."

"Fifty million now." With sunglasses in place, Emilia raised her hand, showing five fingers and flashing a.daring grin.

Grinding his teeth, Sebastian could only accept."Fine, fifty million. You've got a deal."

He knew if he hesitated, Emilia would just keep pushing the amount higher until she talked herself out of the wager.

"Let's cut to the chase. One round, winner takes all,"Emilia suggested.

"That works for mne," Sebastian growled, glaring at her.

She could talk big for now, but he planned to humiliate her during the game.

Sloane tugged on Emilia's arm and pointed in a direction. "Hey, isn't that Mr. Dixon? Why not have him be the witness? Then nobody can back out if they lose."

Looking in the direction Sloane indicated, Emilia spotted Wilbur wheeling Elias toward them.

Her heart skipped as she met Elias's cold,penetrating stare, memories of her holding him flickering through her mind. She quickly dropped her gaze.

Sebastian noticed Elias's arrival and felt a wave of dread. He had thought about backing out if things took a turn for the worse, but Elias's presence ruined any chance of that. Then again, why was Elias here in this part of town?

His attention drifted to Elias's legs. He remembered Emilia saying she had an opportunity for treatment by Asclepius. Was Elias here for that reason? If the Dixons and Emilia teamed up, she would have powerful allies. Sebastian knew he couldn't let that happen.

Sloane gave Emilia a nudge forward and called out,"Mr. Dixon, do you have a moment? Would you mind being the witness for our bet?"

Elias fixed his cool gaze on Emilia, showing no emotion. "What's going on?"

"Sebastian's made a bet with Emilia. If he loses, he pays fifty million, but if we lose, he gets a Pagani."Sloane jumped in with the details.

A flicker of irritation crossed Elias's face; he seemed more interested in hearing from Emilia herself. Mistaking his irritation for unwillingness, Emilia quickly spoke up. "If you're busy, don't worry about it."

"I'm available." For a split second, Elias's expression softened. "So, what's the wager?"

Wilbur piped up, eager to guess. "I bet it's another car race!"

Emilia shook her head. "Not this time. It's a one-on-one match, just one round in a game."

Wilbur's curiosity spiked. "Wait, you play games too?What kind? I never took you for a gamer."

The talk about games made Wilbur think of his idol,the legendary Cloudstrider.

Ever since that player disappeared, he'd never seen him online or heard any updates.

With a curious glint in his eyes, Wilbur gave Emilia a slow once-over. "I never took you for someone who plays games. Are you any good at it? I'm into gaming too. We should play together sometime. I could teach you a few things. I mean, I'm decent. Not on Elias's
level or anything. But then again, he's not really into
it. All he cares about is business and chasing money."

Elias's mouth tightened, his mood turning frosty
again.

"I'm honestly not much of a gamer," Emilia answered,
her tone light. She had rarely played before, and after
quitting,she had giyen up games altogether.

Hearing this, Elias relaxed, a faint smile tugging at his
lips.

Sebastian grew restless and asked, "Can we get on
with this? Emilia, are you stalling because you're
scared to go through with the bet?"
###Chapter 59 Victory


."I'll need someone to stand by, just so you don't wriggle out of this later," said Emilia, her voice sharp as she fixed Sebastian with a cold stare.

A stab of unease shot through Sebastian, but pride got the better of him. "Why would I back out? I'm not as shady as you are," he snapped.

"Let's hope you're better than me, then," Emilia replied,her tone biting.

Deep down, Emilia knew his nature. If anyone was likely to run from paying the wager, it was him.

With Wilbur acting as their witness, the two of them settled on a bench beneath the shade of a broad tree.

"So what are we playing? Tell me quick," Wilbur asked,his eyes gleaming with anticipation. Sebastian held up his phone, the glow of the screen reflecting in his eyes. "This one. We'll both use the same hero. Pick whoever you want."

"I'll mirror your choice," said Emilia evenly. She borrowed Sloane's phone and account since hers didn't even have the game downloaded.

"Don't accuse me of picking on you. We'll go with the simplest mage. All her attacks lock on. No need for fancy predictions," Sebastian sneered.

"Works for me," Emilia replied without a pause,setting up a private 1v1 room.

Wilbur's excitement fizzled out once he saw the hero choice. Watching such plain characters battle felt boring, though he reminded himself it was typical for women to pick the easier options.

"Who's your money on?" he asked Elias, not caring that Emilia and Sebastian could hear every word.

All attention shifted toward Elias, waiting for his answer. "Emilia," Elias said in a low, certain voice.

"Of course. Knew you'd say that," Sloane added with pride, her grin daring anyone to disagree.

."You really think she'll win?" Wilbur raised his brows."Fine. Then I'll take Sebastian's side. Loser buys lunch."

Sebastian gave a proud look and smirked as he said,"Mr. Collins, you really don't miss a thing."

"Don't flatter yourself. I just can't have everyone betting on Emilia," Wilbur interjected, shattering Sebastian's moment of pride in an instant.

Even if Emilia stumbled, Wilbur had no intention of siding with Sebastian. A bet needed balance, nothing more.

Sebastian's expression darkened, and for a moment,he wished he could vanish. The sting of humiliation burned, though Wilbur wasn't someone he could lash out at.

"Begin," Elias commanded, his voice steady but carrying a cold weight that settled over the group.

Sebastian couldn't stop the chill that ran through him as he met Elias's cold, piercing sare.

Sebastian entered the room Emilia had set up and quickly locked in his choice of hero.

Once the match started, Wilbur gave it a lazy glance before leaning back with his coffee,more interested in the drink than the screen.

Sebastian charged in brimming with confidence,certain he would demolish Emilia.

Minutes slipped away, and his smug grin slowly faltered. A sheen of sweat broke out across his forehead as he realized he was fighting tooth and nail just to keep up.

For all the simmplicity of the mage they were using, he was being pushed to the edge by someone he thought had no clue how to play.

A deep frown settled on Sebastian's face. Emilia wasn't supposed to know a thing about games-so how was she beating himso easily?

He had always prided himself on his skills, certain a win like this would be effortless. But instead of cruising to victory, he was being outmatched at every turn.

Then the triumphant victory jingle cut through the air.

Wilbur sputtered into his coffee, nearly spilling it.Wait a second. Did that really happen so quickly?

Wilbur snatched a look at the timer and shook his head in disbelief. "Under ten minutes? You've got to be kidding me."

What no one realized was that Emilia had been pulling her punches. She could have wrapped the game up in just a couple of minutes, but she deliberately stretched it out. Sebastian wasn't a weak player, and crushing him too quickly would risk exposing her secret-that she was none other than the legendary gamer everyone knew as Cloudstrider.
###Chapter 60 Proper Appreciation


Sloane flashed Wilbur a mischievous smile and said,"Wilbur.You lose."

"Alas, lose again," Wilbur muttered with an exaggerated sigh.

Catching the defeated look on Sebastian's face,Wilbur still struggled to believe that Emilia had actually won.

"Time to pay," Emilia said, her gaze fixed squarely on Sebastian.

Frustration clouded Sebastian's face. He had been certain he'd walk away with Emilia's red Pagani,yet now he was fifty million in debt instead.

"Emilia! You swore you weren't any good at games,"Sebastian snapped, anger laced with embarrassment. "Did I ever say I couldn't handle a game? It's just not
something I do often. You were the one who said l
was hopeless and not fit to join your team." Emilia
sent him a cold look. "Funny, though. The same so-
called hopeless one just beat you."

Back then, Sebastian had once played games with
his friends, and the group needed another player.
They invited Emilia, only asking her to join as
support, telling her all she had to do was stick around
and not mess anything up.

Sebastian didn't hold back and mocked her right in
front of everyone, telling them she was hopeless.
The whole group broke out laughing.

"Don't get ahead of yourself. You just got lucky,
that's all," said Sebastian, bitterness clear on his
face. The thought of admitting Emilia bested him
stung worse than anything else.

"Let's skip the drama and just pay what you owe,"
Emilia replied, not bothering to trade more words
with him. In her eyes, he would always come up
short. Elias let a smirk play at his lips as he remarked, "The Mitchells are not only shameless, but they're stubborn to the core."

Sebastian retorted, "What makes you think I'm either of those things?"

"You wrote Emilia off, challenged her to play, and then lost. That's pretty shameless. And when you lost,you blamed it on luck instead of facing the truth.That was stubborn," Elias answered, his tone as cold as steel.

Watching the whole thing, Wilbur snickered and said,"It's probably the first time I witness such shamelessness."

Sloane couldn't hold back a laugh, adding, "Same here."

Sebastian was left fuming, his lips pulled tight, but he finally sent the money over to Emilia, swallowing his pride with every tap.

"You just wait!" he snapped, teeth clenched,before storming off in a fury. His pride burned with the urge to redeem himself.

"Ms. Harris, I must say, your skills match mine.Why don't we add each other as friends?" Wilbur said and winked at her.

"Honestly, I haven't touched a game in ages," Emilia replied.

"What a shame. I thought we might pull off a few team runs together," Wilbur teased, though he suddenly sensed the mood shifting.

Suddenly, a prickly tension settled around Wilbur,making his skin crawl. He scanned the group,confused by the sudden chill.

He had no idea that Elias's cold glare was the true source of the uncomfortable feeling.

"I appreciate you all being here today. We'll be heading out now," Emilia said, rising from her chair.

Elias's lips parted as if he wanted to say something,but the words just wouldn't come. "Hold on! After helping you get that money, all we get is appreciation? Come on, you should at least treat us to dinner!" Wilbur cut in, trying to lighten the mood.

"Of course, but not at Gilded Fork. We'll have to pick somewhere more modest," Emilia said, wanting to set the ground rules before anyone got carried away.

"Anywhere works for me," Wilbur said, more interested in the company than the food. Spending extra timne with them seemed like his best shot at earning their trust, and maybe getting the help he hoped for down the line.

"Wait for me outside. I need a quick stop at the ladies' room," Emilia said.

"I'll come along," Sloane said, trailing after her.

As Sloane refreshed her makeup in the restroom,Emilia reopened a gaming account she hadn't touched in years.

Her eyes lingered briefly on the familiar homepage before she signed out again.

Even in that fleeting moment, the gaming circles online erupted with chatter.
###Chapter 61 Back Online


.Word spread like wildfire online-Cloudstrider, the legendary all-round king, had just logged in.

Inside crowded cybercafes, players who had been glued to their screens ripped off their headsets and leapt to their feet, buzzing with excitement.

"Hold on! Did I hear that right? Cloudstrider's back online!"

"Are we sure this isn't some kind of hoax? People have faked screenshots before just to stir things up."

"No, this one's the real deal! My buddy actually has him on his friend list and showed me a screenshot.Cloudstrider popped online just a few minutes ago!"

"Wait, I'm lost here. Who exactly is Cloudstrider? Is he really as big of a deal as you're making him out to be?" "If you actually played games, you'd already know the name Cloudstrider. He isn't called the all-round king for nothing. It's not just one title he's mastered-he dominates every single game he touches!"

The crowd wasted no time filling in the clueless,recounting Cloudstrider's insane track record and the countless times he'd stunned the gaming world.

Even people who normally didn't care for gaming found themselves impressed, giving nods of approval and admitting that the guy sounded downright legendary.

#CloudstriderlsOnline

#ReturnOfCloudstrider

Within minutes, the news of Cloudstrider's comeback shot to the top of the trending charts,creating a buzz that spilled far beyond the gaming community.


... 
At a quiet cafe, Wilbur lazily scrolled through his feed. His thumb froze mid-swipe when the bold headline about Cloudstrider's return appeared on his screen.

"No freaking way! This can't be happening!" Wilbur nearly dropped his phone, his eyes bulging as his whole body shook with excitement.

"What's gotten into you?" Elias asked coolly, a faint crease forming between his brows.

"It's Cloudstrider! He's back online! I need to log in right now and see it for myself!" Wilbur blurted out,his face glowing as he frantically tapped the game icon.

He'd once spent a ridiculous sum just to buy his way onto Cloudstrider's friend list.

Elias, who couldn't care less about Cloudstrider or gaming, sat unmoved.

As Wilbur's excitement mounted, Elias only gave the occasional glance toward the restroom, his expression  as frigid as ever. "Holy crap! It'sreal! He's actually online! My idol is back, oh my god!" Wilbur shouted, his laughter spilling out in chaotic bursts.

Elias muttered under his breath. All he knew was that the noise grated on his nerves. His frown deepened,the chill in the air around him intensifying.

All he wanted was for this loudmouth to get as far away from him as possible before he did something drastic.

...
Out in the hospital parking lot, a gleaming black Ferrari screeched to a halt.

The door swung open, and Sebastian stepped out with a stormy look on his face.

The sting of losing to Emilia gnawed at him, and with a surge of anger, he turned and kicked the Ferrari hard enough to make the frame shudder.

The sharp crack of metal echoed through the lot.Pedestrians flinched at the sound, their eyes darting to Sebastian's furious expression before they hurried off, wanting no part of a spoiled rich kid venting his rage on a Ferrari.

"Emilia, you'd better enjoy this while it lasts," he muttered under his breath. "There's no way I'm going to be beaten by some housewife."

Sebastian's phone buzzed in his pocket, and with an irritated grunt he snatched it up. "Talk already, I don't have all day!"

His expression twisted with fury, his jaw tight as though he might explode at any second. But in the blink of an eye, the anger drained from his face,replaced by wide-eyed shock.

"What? Repeat that! I need to hear it again!"
###Chapter 62 Gaming Pro And Top-Tier Hacker
Sebastian's eyes gleamed, his whole expression alive with a rush of excitement he could barely hold back."Tell me this isn't some kind of prank. Cloudstrider really logged in?",

The moment he got the confirmation, Sebastian darted into his account. There it was, plain as day-Cloudstrider had logged in just minutes ago. Relief spread across his face as a grin finally broke free.

His idol was back, and the thought alone made his chest tighten with joy. All that money and time he had poured into snagging this rare account,which was in Cloudstrider's friend list, had been worth it.

For minutes on end, Sebastian hovered over the chat box, typing a line and erasing it, then starting again.At last, he settled on something simple."Cloudstrider, is that really you?" Sebastian kept clicking the chat box open and shut,his eyes lingering on the screen for what felt like forever before he finally logged out of the game.Even so, the thrill and eagerness stirring inside him refused to fade.

He kept logging back in every now and then,checking obsessively to see if there was a response or even the faintest sign his message had been noticed.

Collapsing into the couch, he scrolled through social media feeds packed with Cloudstrider's name.

The endless stream of praise gave him a strange sense of pride, as if the spotlight shining on his idol was brushing over him too.

"Sebastian, what's got you grinning like that? Come on, let us in on the secret," Violet asked, her tone laced with curiosity.

Since stepping into the hospital room,Sebastian had barely spoken beyond a quick hello. He sprawled across the sofa, eyes locked on his phone, a  ridiculous grin plastered on his face.

"Nothing big," Sebastian said at last, lifting his head with a smile that refused to fade. "But the legend of the gaming world-the one who ruled every major platform years ago-just came back."

"Who are you talking about?" Violet asked, her brows knitting together as she tried to place the name.

Sebastian's smile faltered. A flicker of disappointment crossed his features. Violet used to remember without hesitation. She had even teased him about it, sometimes digging up news about Cloudstrider just to watch him light up.

That bond had been one of the things that tied them together. Yet only a few years later, Cloudstrider had slipped entirely from her memory.

"You mean Cloudstrider is back?" Rodger's voice cut in,tinged with genuine surprise.

Rodger had never been much of a gamer, but even he recognized the name that carried such weight in  the community.

A pause followed before Violet's eyes widened."Wait, Cloudstrider? He's actually appeared again?"

Violet lifted her hand to her lips as if shocked,feigning excitement that never reached her eyes.

Inside, she scoffed at the idea. What good was being brilliant at video games? Without wealth or status to back it up, it all seemed pointless.

Professional gamers only shone for a handful of years before fading, and Cloudstrider didn't even have the courage to reveal his face.

He was probably someone who might not live up to the glamorous image. To her, skill in gaming could never compare to the power that came with influence and money.

"Yeah," Sebastian answered quietly. Realizing she had forgotten everything she once knew about Cloudstrider drained the joy from his words, and the eagerness to talk to her slipped away. Violet's exaggerated excitement clashed awkwardly against his subduled tone, leaving her unsettled.

With a strained smile, she tried again. "Isn't he your hero? Don't you ever dream of meeting him?"

"Of course I do. But he's impossible to track down.I even paid a hacker once to dig him up, and instead of finding him, they got hacked themselves. That's how good he is!" Sebastian's voice lifted, the spark returning as his admiration spilled out.

There was a shine in his eyes, glowing with unmistakable admiration.

That incident had only cemented his belief. To Sebastian,Cloudstrider wasn't just a master gamer-he had to be an elite hacker as well, someone untouchable on every level.
###Chapter 63 Indulgence


"I can set up a meeting for you," Violet said with absolute confidence, her chin lifted as though the matter were already settled.

Sebastian narrowed his eyes, suspicion flickering across his face. "Yǒu can? From what I've heard, he doesn't see anyone."

"How would you know if you never try? Now that he's resurfaced, and since you admire him so much, I'll do whatever it takes to give you that chance," Violet replied smoothly.

In her mind, it was inconceivable that a man could resist her. With her beauty, her body, and the family name she carried, there was no way Cloudstrider could turn her down. Men were ruled by desire, no matter where their preferences lay.

If she couldn't sway Elias, who preferred men, then how could she possibly fail with some gamer who had shut himself away from the world? Winning him over might require nothing more than a glance, and once that happened, he'd be hopelessly entangled.

"Violet, if you really pull this off, I'll be forever grateful," Sebastian said, his voice laced with sincerity.

"As someone who'll soon be part of your family,helping you is only 'natural," Violet answered sweetly,pressing herself against Rodger's chest as though to seal her words.

Rodger sighed, a half-smile tugging at his lips, "You spoil him far too much."

"You've always spoiled me, so of course I'll do the same for the people who matter to you," Violet murmured, slipping her arms around him with practiced grace.

Rodger's smile softened, his hand lifting to brush against her cheek, his gaze brimming with tender affection. "Rodger, tell me... will you keep spoiling me forever?"Violet asked, her voice light and teasing, sweet enough to melt butter.

"You really need to ask? You saved my life. For that alone, I'll treasure you for the rest of mine," Rodger replied with warmth.

Her lips curved into a radiant smile, but behind it her hand tightened into a fist. The truth gnawed at her-it had been Emilia who pulled Rodge back from death.If that fact ever came to light, would he cast her aside without hesitation and run back to Emilia?

The thought made her blood run cold. For the briefest moment, venom flashed in her eyes. As long as Emilia lived, she was a threat. And Violet knew she would have to find another chance to erase that threat once and for all.


···
Night fell.
 
Emilia and Sloane stepped into the glitzy lobby of a newly opened KTV club.

The male escorts lounging inside immediately perked up, their eyes gleaming at the sight of two women whose beauty and striking figures made them stand out like queens among commoners.

After circling the available options, the pair finally made their choices-five escorts in total, each tall,broad-shouldered, and undeniably handsome.

The escorts who hadn't been selected wore their disappointment plainly, some muttering under their breath as the two striking women ignored them.

"I'll claim two, and you can take the rest," Sloane teased,tossing Emilia a playful wink.

"One will do for me. The rest are all yours," Emilia replied coolly. Her finger singled out a clean-cut young man with an innocent face and a hint of shyness. With a simple command, she instructed,"You.Come here."

The chosen escort shuffled over and sat beside her, his posture stiff, hisevery movement clumsy with nerves.

A faint smile tugged at Emilia's lips as she lifted her hand, tilting his chin upward with her fingers. The contact sent a rush of color flooding his cheeks, his ears burning bright red.

"First time at this kind of thing?" she asked softly.

His eyes darted downward, avoiding her gaze as he nodded."Yeah."

The nervous fidget of his fingers betrayed how unsettled he was, and Emilia found his awkward honesty almost amusing.

"You any good at drinking?" Emilia teased, leaning closer until her breath ghosted across his ear,making his shoulders stiffen.

A faint shiver ran through him, his cheeks and ears burning hotter as he kept his gaze fixed anywhere but on her. His long lashes quivered with every stolen glance."Not... not really," he mumbled, his voice faltering with shyness.

Just then, a shadow moved outside the door. A phone lifted, the shutter clicked against the glass,and within seconds the figure vanished down the hall.
###Chapter 64 Find Out


Inside the hospital room, Sebastian logged off the game just as his phone buzzed with an incoming call from one of his friends.

"Count me out for today. You all go ahead without me," said Sebastian.

"So, are you really going to spend the whole night glued to your screen, just hoping Cloudstrider shows up?" asked his friend.

Sebastian cut him off with a huff. "Worry about yourself. If you're just calling to nag, I'm done talking."

"Hold on! What's got you so worked up? You'll never guess who I just spotted at the KTV club."

"Just say/ what you want to say. Don't make it so suspenseful..." "Haha! Check the group chat-I dropped a photo for everyone to see."

Before Sebastian could answer, the call ended with a click.

"Crazy idiot," Sebastian muttered under his breath,brows drawn tight.

He hadn't planned to check the group chat, but seeing Emilia's name pop up in the preview caught his attention. Did she really go to a club and actually order escorts?

Curiosity getting the better of him, Sebastian opened the chat and scrolled through the new messages.
The moment he saw the photo, his entire expression darkened. Heat surged through his head, and fury swept over him in waves.

"Something wrong? Why do you look so worked up?"Rodger noticed Sebastian's unusual expression and asked.

"Emilia is unbelievable! She's out there making a fool of you, Rodger. Take a look at this!" Sebastian shoved his phone toward him.

Rodger's eyes narrowed as he studied the picture.That woman-she really had some nerve. From the angle, it looked as if Emilia and the young man beside her were locked in a kiss, practically glued together.

Truthfully, there hadn't been anything between them.No kiss. Not even a touch. The camera just happened to capture the scene in the worst possible way.

"She hasn't even finalized the divorce, yet she's already running around looking for a new man. Now she's ordering escorts. She's dragging our name through the mud," said Sebastian, his voice growing rougher as anger built inside him. "Rodger, get her.on the phone. If she keeps acting out and refuses to come home, we're done playing nce."

Already boiling with anger, Rodger already swung his legs out of bed and sat up, realizing he could reach Emilia by phone. He scrolled through his contacts and pressed her number. The call went unanswered.

He shot off a message instead, but the reply never came. When he checked, he realized Emilia had blocked him.

His expression darkened further. The nerve of her to block him! Was she that angry just because he stood her up today? So she'd blocked him and headed off to a KTV club to relax?

"The call isn't going through. Get the car out front.I'm going to change clothes." Not waiting another minute, he made up his mind to handle things personally. Sitting around would only drive him crazy.

·.·
At the KTV club.

The door to the private room burst open with a loud crash, and three men swaggered in, cigarette smoke trailing behind them. A half-dozen bodyguards followed close, each one radiating menace. "All five men,get out!"

As chaos erupted, four of the five male escorts scattered, bolting for the door. Only Edwin Morrison,quiet and awkward, remained at Emilia's side,throwing his arms out to shield Emilia and Sloane.

"What's your problem? If you're here to make a scene, I'll get the manager and call the police!" He glanced over his shoulder at Emilia and gave her a reassuring nod. "Don't worry. I won't let anything happen to you."

Emilia's eyes widened in disbelief. She never imagined the quiet young man would turn out to be the bravest of them all.

Yet she knew too well that stepping up against men like these was reckless. With their power and connections, they could do whatever they pleased and walk away untouched.
###Chapter 65 Play Hero


Emilia recognized the three men instantly. They were Sebastian's usual companions-Emilio Burgess,Brixton Loftus, and Slater Quimby. Each came from money, though none of their families could rival the prestige of the Mitchell family.

Now their attention was on Edwin, their eyes filled with ridicule, treating him like a fool too blind to realize his own weakness.

Brixton plucked the cigarette from his lips and flicked the smoldering butt straight at Edwin, who slipped to the side just in time to avoid it.

"Oh? Guess you're not entirely foolish," he sneered.

Their laughter rang out-Emilio, Brixton, and Slater linking shoulders, their grins wide with contempt, not even bothering to mask how little they thought of him. Snatching a baseball bat from one of the bodyguards, Brixton strutted forward, pressing the tip hard against Edwin's forehead.

"Think you're some kind of hero? Do you even know who you're dealing with? If you don't want your face smashed in, then disappear right now."

Brixton patted Edwin's face sneeringly. "Pathetic.Who do you think you are? Some no-name punk playing the savior? I'm here fo them, not you. While I'm still feeling generous, crawl out of my sight!"

Emilio and Slater closed the distance between them,arms still thrown over each other's shoulders.

"Cut the speeches. Just rough him up and have the guards carry him out."

"Totally. I hate weak types pretending to be brave.He's just a pretty face playing hero."

Heat and humiliation washed over Edwin, his cheeks flickering between pale and flushed as anger and embarrassment warred on his face. Regret gnawed at him for stepping forward so impulsively-after all, his father was still lying in a hospital bed. But now that he had stepped up, there was no reason to back down.

"I am not going to stand by while you pick on them,"Edwin said, planting his feet and meeting their jeers with steady resolve.

From behind him, Emilia felt his stance make him seem larger, and a small, approving smile tugged at her lips.

"Looks like you need a lesson," Brixton scoffed.He swung the baseball bat with brutal intent, only to have Edwin duck, pivot, and send Brixton crashing to the floor with a hard, practiced kick.

The bat hit the floor with a metallic crash that echoed through the room.

"Brixton!" Emilio's and Slater's faces twisted in shock as they pulled him up.

"Get that bastard! Teach him a lesson! You had your chance, now you're finished!" Brixton shouted, his bloodshot eyes blazing with fury.

The bodyguards surged forward, but Edwin squared his shoulders and shouted back toward Emilia and Sloane, "I'll hold them off! Go! Call the cops,hurry!"

Edwin was frantic, but they stood frozen, seemingly paralyzed by fear. Seeing the menacing bodyguards charging toward him, he felt they were all doomed.

His father was still in the hospital waiting for bills to be paid, and here he was, a male escort throwing himself into a fight he had no business starting. Still,he couldn't back down now.

Determination hardened his gaze. He snatched a beer bottle from the table, his eyes blazing red as if he were ready to fight until the end.

The first guard swung his bat at him. Edwin ducked on instinct and shattered the bottle across the man's shoulder,shards scattering.

He never saw the second guard coming from behind, bat already raised.

Before the blow could land, Emilia's hand shot out.She gripped the weapon mid-swing, her fingers locking tight around it. Her eyes were glacial,her presence radiating a deadly calm that froze the room.

Edwin turned in time to witness it, his breath catching. She looked striking, fierce, almost terrifying -an image seared into his mind.
###Chapter 66 New Realization


.Emilia didn't hesitate; she launched a swift kick at one of the bodyguards and snatched the baseball bat right out of his hands.

Another guard lunged at Edwin, but before Edwin could react, Emilia yanked him out of harm's way and swung the bat hard at the man's wrist.

The bodyguard yelped as pain shot up his arm,dropping his weapon with a clatter on the floor.

Edwin stood there, gaping in silence,still frozen by the shock. Emilia's voice cut through the tension as she snapped, "Why are you just standing there? Pick up the bat and help out!"

Snapped back to reality, Edwin scrambled for the fallen bat. He clutched it tight, adrenaline flooding his system as he finally joined the chaos.

At the same time, Sloane had knocked out another bodyguard and claimed a bat of her own, gripping it like she'd been waiting for this moment.

With Emilia leading the charge, Sloane knew exactly how to play her role, let Emilia clear the path, and then finish the job.

One by one, the bodyguards ended up sprawled on the floor, groaning in agony, twisting like stranded fish as the pain settled in.

Across the room, Slater, Brixton, and Emilio stood frozen in disbelief, every muscle locked in place.

Emilia's glare, icy and unwavering, pinned them where they stood, the bat in her hands was promising trouble if any of them dared to move.

None of them could process what they were seeing.Emilia, the quiet one, was always so meek, never talking back, no matter how much they teased her.The same woman they'd once joked about, telling Sebastian his sister-in-law was too soft for her own good. But this Emilia? She was fierce, untouchable. How had she transformed overnight? Just a while ago,Sebastian couldn't stop complaining that Emilia was nothing but a leech, living off the Mitchells and bringing nothing to the table.

Lately, all anyone said was that she'd picked up a strange hobby like race car driving. But nobody mentioned she'd become a fighter who could clear a room.

Emilia opened her mouth to speak, but before a single word left her lips, the three of them dropped to their knees, panic written all over their faces.

"Please, Emilia! I swear I won't do it again! Just let me off this once!"

"I was out of line. I shouldn't have shouted, please,I'm begging you!"

"You have no right to hit us! Everything that's happened is because you brought shame to the Mitchell family by cheating on Rodger!"

That accusation made Edwin freeze. For a split second, he stared at Emilia as if seeing her for the first time. Was this really the Mitchell family he'd always known? And was she really Rodger's woman?

A sharp, humorless laugh escaped Emilia. She smacked the bat lightly against her palm. "So let me get this straight. He can sleep around all he wants,but I'm supposed to stay loyal? Does that really sound fair to you?"

Slater shot back, unable to help himself, "It's not the same! Men have pride; being cheated on is the worst thing that could happen to a guy!"

The absurdity of it almost made Emilia laugh.

"Oh, come on," she scoffed. "You think women don't have pride? We're all human beings, aren't we? If you can't handle the game, maybe you shouldn't play."

"That's easy for you to say! You're nothing but a freeloader. You don't get to act like you're family just because you married in. You don't have any rights here! " Slater spat, glaring at her. In his eyes, Emilia was nothing beyond a servant brought in by the Mitchell family, not even worthy of being called a mistress. And yet, she dared to crave the privileges that came with the family name. What .a laughable fantasy.

Emilia had never been the type to waste time talking.She believed in letting her actions speak for her.Without a word, she drove her foot into him and sent him crashing to the'ground.

Her cold, unblinking glare sent the other two scrambling backward on their knees, sneaking anxious glances her way.

Meanwhile, Edwin watched her, admiration blazing in his gaze, his heart pounding with something dangerously close to awe.
###Chapter 67 Compensation


Emilia fixed her gaze on Slater, Brixton, and Emilio,and her voice cut cold as she asked, "Did Sebastian send you?"

"No." Brixton replied.

They hated watching her charm everyone around,and after she beat Sebastian's brother in the race,they'd come to rough her up for their friend, though none of them would admit that motive aloud.

"Each of you will transfer one million into my account," Emilia instructed.

Emilio ground his teeth and retorted, "Why would we do that?"

"You trashed my food, spread lies about me, and tried to pick a fight-charging each of you a million is me being generous," Emilia said, her tone icy as she shot them a scornful look. "If you're not willing to pay, then you can each kiss one of your hands goodbye."

She picked up a baseball bat, her eyes glinting with menace.

"We'll pay! We'll pay, I swear!" Slater, Brixton, and Emilio all shrieked at once, scrambling over each other to agree.

In their eyes, coughing up the cash was a whole lot better than losing a hand-especially since Emilia looked just unhinged enough to go through with her threat. For now, they'd pay up and bide their time,hoping for a chance at revenge down the line.

A sly grin crept onto Emilia's face as she lightly tapped each of their cheeks with the bat. "That's more like it."

Slater, Brixton, and Emilio exchanged furious glances, but none dared to disobey. They grudgingly sent over the money, seething inside. They'd come to put Emilia in her place, but ended up roughed up and out a million apiece instead. Damn it! When had she gotten so fierce?

"Get lost!" Emilia exclaimed and leveled the bat at the door, her eyes cold.

Slater, Brixton and Emilio scrambled up, tripping over each other as they bolted for the exit.

Their bodyguards, not wanting any part of Emilia's wrath, hurried after them in a mad rush.

"Those guys are thick with Sebastian. I refuse to believe they came on their own." Sloane crossed her arms, glaring after the group.

"Doesn't matter who put them up to it. Anyone who picks a fight with me better be ready for the fallout."Emilia looked over the wrecked room, her earlier excitement fading.

"Still want another drink?" Emilia asked, glancing over at Sloane.

"Nah, let's just call it a night. A little sleep sounds better than more booze." Sloane shook her head,letting out a sigh. Emilia's attention shifted to Edwin, who sat quietly off to the side, cradling his arm and avoiding her gaze.

Her brow knit with concern. "Did you get hurt?"

Edwin looked up, caught off guard by her question.He shook his head, trying to play it off. "It's nothing-really."

"Don't try to brush me off." Emilia wasn't buying it,reaching for his arm and pushing up his sleeve. A deep bruise had already started to form.

Clearly, he'd taken a hit during the chaos. At least it wasn't too serious-some ointment and a bit of rest would take care of it.

Edwin's cheeks tinged pink, an awkward gratitude shining in his eyes.

"Send me your bank information," Emilia said suddenly.

"That's not necessary. It's not your fault I got hurt."Edwin shook his head, flustered. Don't argue. Just give me your account info," Emilia insisted, making it clear she wouldn't take no for an answer.

With no way out, Edwin rattled off his details.He was still watching her when she asked, "And your full name?"

"Edwin Morrison," he replied, his gaze lingering on her face.

"Got it." Emilia tapped at her phone, and a moment later Edwin's phone buzzed with an alert. His jaw dropped as he saw the transfer-three million deposited straight into his account.

"This is way too much... I can't accept this," he stammered, already thinking about sending the money back.

Emilia, not even glancing up, cut him off. "That's their compensation for what you went through, not a gift from me. And don't even think about returning it.I can't stand it when people send my money back." Edwin blinked, his eyes suddenly shimmering with gratitude. So she'd made each of those guys pay up just to  make things right for him...
###Chapter 68 Act Recklessly


"Your generosity means more than I can say. I'll carry this debt in my heart and find a way to repay you someday," Edwin remarked, bowing deeply in gratitude.

The money meant his father's treatment would finally be secured. To him, Emilia wasn't just a benefactor-she was the reason his family had hope again. He swore he'd never forget.
"You don't owe me anything. Just help someone else in need when you get the chance," Emilia replied.

For her, the amount was barely noticeable, but to others, it could mean the difference between hope and despair.

"You have my word!" Edwin replied, his voice firm. He felt a true sense of duty to honor her wish and find a way to repay her someday. "Find a different job. This line of work doesn't suit you,"Emilia added before turning away.
Sloane hurried after her, brushing off the whole affair as nothing more than a passing moment.

Yet,Edwin knew he would remember this for the rest of his life.

He stood frozen, watching as Emilia disappeared down the hallway, his fists balled at his sides.

Their worlds were miles apart, and he couldn't deny it. A woman who could join a family like the Mitchells had to come from real wealth. No matter how much he dreamed, the reality of their difference weighed heavily.
In silence, Edwin made a quiet promise to himself-one day, he'd climb high enough to meet her as an equal, and maybe even be the one to protect her.



Not far from the club, a sleek black sedan sat parked in the shadows. "I've been told she handled those thugs on her own,so she should be safe now. Are you really going to sit here until she comes out?" Wilbur asked, glancing over at Elias.

"She has something I want, and I won't relax until l know she's all right," Elias answered, his tone chilling.

"Suit yourself," Wilbur said, leaning back with his arms folded, letting out a lazy yawn.

The silence inside the car stretched out, broken only by the sudden sound of Elias's voice.

"Add this section to the redevelopment plans."

"What!" Wilbur jolted upright, eyes widening as he swiveled toward him. "Did I just hear you right?"

He wondered if his ears were playing tricks on him.
Elias never greenlit projects that didn't promise a solid return. Every investment had to meet his standards-no exceptions.

Plans for the redevelopment had been mapped out already, and the blueprints were all but finalized. That part of the city hadn't even been considered. If they included it now, it meant starting over, revising the design, and deciding what purpose it would serve.

On top of that, they would have to pay a hefty sum for demolition compensation.

Wilbur almost laughed-had Elias completely lost his senses?

"I'm going to have the plans changed. That area will be included," Elias said, his gaze locked on the doors of the club, every word clipped and sharp.

A crease formed between his brows. Emilia was taking too long to appear.

"See to it that everything gets underway first thing tomorrow," Elias instructed.

Wilbur looked stunned. "Hold on, are you really going through with this? Shouldn't we talk about it? This will cost a fortune..."

One look from Elias-cold and uncompromising- shut him up instantly.

"Alright, whatever you say. It's not coming out of my pocket after all," Wilbur grumbled, shooting Elias a sideways look as he flopped back against the seat."Unbelievable. Never imagined you'd throw caution out the window like this.I mean-"

"Wilbur."

That was all it took. Wilbur immediately snapped his mouth shut, dragging a finger across his lips as if locking them tight.

Elias's eyes stayed glued to the entrance, a shadow crossing his face.

Maybe this move seemed reckless, but nothing else would quiet the uneasy storm brewing inside him.
###Chapter 69 Stopped


Stepping through the front doors of the club, Emilia found her exit blocked by two tall figures, both staring her down with cold glares.

Without thinking twice, Sloane moved in front of Emilia,ready toshield her from trouble.

"Move aside," snapped Rodger, his glare fixed on Sloane.

Emilia caught Sloane by the arm and pulled her behind, facing Rodger head-on. "If anyone needs to move aside,it's you."

"You shouldn't be here. Come with me now," Rodger demanded, annoyance all over his face as he tried to grab her hand.

Emilia jerked her arm free, smacking his hand away."Don't touch me." Rodger hissed in pain, recoiling as irritation flickered across his face. "Remember, the divorce isn't finalized. Like it or not, you're still my wife. You need to think about your reputation."

"Those warnings suit you better than me," Emilia retorted with a cold laugh.

Rodger's patience finally snapped. "Enough, Emilia!This isn't up for discussion! You've been shameless,chasing after every guy in sight, and now you're clinging to this little pretty boy. Have you got even a shred of respect left for me or the Mitchell family?"

"Neither you nor your precious Mitchell family matters to me," Emilia replied coldly.

"You!" Rodger clenched his fists, barely holding back the urge to force her to leave with him.

Right before things could escalate, a tall figure stepped between them, placing himself protectively in front of Emilia.

"Are you alright, Miss Harris?" Edwin asked, concern written all over his face.

"Yeah. I'm alright," Emilia answered with a calm nod.

If Edwin hadn't rushed over, Rodger would have found himself in serious trouble. Someone had already taken care of breaking one of his arms.Rodger never seemed to learn, and Emilia would gladly make sure he remembered, even if she had to wrench his other arm out of place for good measure.

"Is this your new kept man now?" Rodger sneered,his voice laced with jealousy and anger.

"And what if he is? Last I checked, that's none of your concern," Emilia retorted, her tone dripping with disdain.

"It absolutely is my concern! You're still my wife. It's your duty to uphold the Mitchell family's reputation and stay loyal to me," Rodger snapped, his voice rising with each word.

A humorless laugh escaped Emilia. "Oh yeah? And since when did you do exactly the same thing?" "Anyways, until our divorce is finalized, I forbid you from getting close to any man," Rodger said, puffed up with self-importance.

"Fuck off. Look in the mirror before you call anyone out. You're in no position to order me around."Emilia's expression turned cold.

Rodger fumed in silence, but then Sebastian jumped in, voice sharp and threatening. "You blackmailed my friends for money. I swear,I could have you thrown behind bars this instant!"

Edwin, eager to defend her, spoke up. "Miss Harris didn't blackmail anyone. If it's about the money-"

Emilia caught his arm, gently pulling him back,silencing him with a pointed glance.

Edwin opened his mouth to continue, but after seeing her warning look, he clamnped down and said nothing more.

"Here's your chance. Put the cuffs on me. Call the police. I'm waiting," Emilia said, stretching out her hands with a smirk. "If I go down, I'm dragging all of you with me. Your brother's going to end up with an ex-con as his wife, and as for your friends, their families will watch their companies go up in smoke after that nightclub brawl. Losing a million wvill be the least of their worries."

When faced with unreasonable people, she matched their venom with an equal measure of resolve. They caused a scene, hurt people, and destroyed her expensive liquor. Of course, they had to cough up the money.

Emilia's bold stand pushed the Mitchell brothers to the edge, but they could do nothing about it.

The risk was too high. If she landed in jail, their reputations and their businesses would suffer serious blowS.

Edwin couldn't look away from her, awe written all over his face,

To him, she blazed like a force of nature, and that light was reflected in his wide, admiring eyes.
###Chapter 70 Made Up His Mind


"You realize Rodger's going to divorce you, right? At best, you'll end up as nothing more than his ex. Try causing trouble for my friends, and you'Il have to deal with their entire families. Are you really that reckless?" Sebastian looked down his nose at Emnilia,smirking with superiority.

A faint, amused smile flickered on Emilia's lips as she held up her phone. "If you're so confident, why not see what happens?"

The glint in her eyes sent a chill through Rodger.He reached out, pulling Sebastian back before things could escalate. He knew better than to provoke Emilia when she was in this mood; there was no telling what line she might cross.

Jail was never his endgame; the last thing he wanted was to go down in history as the man whose ex-wife dragged him through a scandal. Sebastian turned on Rodger, frustration boiling over."You're really just going to stand here and let her walk all over you?"

Rodger's jaw clenched, his gaze hardening as he turned to Emilia. "Get that kid out of here. I don't want to see himn near you."

Seeing Edwin so close to her made Rodger's skin crawl. As far as he was concerned, Edwin was just a prop, someone Emilia paraded around to get under his skin. And, as luck would have it, Sebastian's friends just happened to witness the whole scene. It was too convenient.

Emilia didn't even blink. "Why should I care what you want?" she said, taking a deliberate step closer.

Rodger's patience snapped, "Fine, have it your way.If you're so eager to play with men, we'll settle this divorce right tomorrow."

"Can't. My schedule's packed." Emilia shrugged.

As far as she was concerned, she didn't owe him a single thing, not her time, not her compliance. If Rodger wanted to end things, she was going to make him work for it.
Edwin stood off to the side, his eyes resting on her with a quiet trace of sorrow flickering in their depths.

Was she holding back because she didn't truly want the divorce after all?

"The day after tomorrow," said Rodger, his expression still clouded with tension.

Emilia didn't miss a moment. "No can do. I'll be busy the day after tomorrow. And the day after that.You'll have to get in line."

Rodger's temper flared. "You're dragging this out on purpose, aren't you?"

"That's right. And what exactly do you think you're going to do about it?" Emilia shot back without hesitation.

"You!" Rodger burst out, his voice shaking with fury. But after thinking it over again, he grew more certain that Emilia was simply coming up with excuses to stall the divorce.

The entire act with the charming young man was nothing but a performance, staged to provoke him and push him exactly where she wanted.

"Go ahead, Emilia. Drag it out as long as you want!None of your schemes will work on me. Not in this lifetime! I'd rather rot than fall for someone as manipulative as you!" With a scowl, Rodger turned on his heel and stormed off.

"You'd better think twice before you embarrass my brother in public again. Next time, you won't get off so easily," Sebastian warned before following Rodger,his glare icy.

Once the two brothers had vanished, Sloane let out a sharp sigh. "Honestly, those two need to have their heads checked."

Emilia shrugged, unfazed. "Agreed." Her gaze landed on Edwin. "We'll be leaving."

Without a second glance, she walked away, treating the whole encounter as nothing more than an inconvenience. Helping Edwin hadn't meant anything; she doubted their paths would ever cross again.

What she didn't realize was that Edwin had already made up his mind to fight his way forward,determined to become someone who deserved a place beside her.

His eyes followed her as she walked away, burning with intensity that refused to fade.

A fierce resolve settled in his eyes, and his fist tightened at his side, as though locking in a promise he had no intention of breaking.

Not far away, inside a parked car, Elias sat in silence,lips pressed together as he watched Emilia's figure disappear. His glare shifted to Edwin,cold and bitter,tinged with resentment. His fingers curled tight against his lap, clenching without thought, but no matter how hard he tried, his legs remained numb, void of pain, void of feeling.

The icy sharpness in his eyes slowly vanished,leaving behind a dull, lifeless gaze.

Because of his limited mobility, he always found himself lagging behind whenever there was a chance to lend a hand.
###Chapter 71 What A Coincidence


.Wilbur watched the street, then shifted his gaze to Elias. "Ms. Harris just got into a car. Should we go after her?"

"Go ahead," said Elias, leaning back and closing his eyes, needig a moment of quiet.

Before long, Wilbur's brow creased in concern."Looks like someone else is on Ms. Harris's trail."

Their vehicle maintained a safe gap, careful not to draw attention while making sure Emilia stayed in view. But further up the road, a taxi trailed close behind Emilia's car. That cab had slipped in behind them a minute ago.

As soon as Wilbur spoke, Elias's eyes flew open, the coldness in his stare clear as day.

"Make sure they won't notice us," instructed Elias. Wilbur nodded right away. "Got it."

Both of them watched in silence until the driver brought Emilia to her apartment. They waited until she disappeared inside.

Elias's shoulders eased just a bit. His attention moved to the taxi that was still parked ahead.

A few moments passed. Then the door swung open and Edwin stepped out.
After taking a long look at the apartment, Edwin slid back into the taxi, and it pulled off into the night.

Elias's lips curved in a faint, hard line. "Find out who he is."

"Right away." Without wasting any time, WNilbur made the call to dig up information about Edwin.

In a short while, he returned with Edwin's details and handed Elias the phone.

Reading through Edwin's background, Elias's frown deepened. Nothing about the man seemed out of the ordinary, and there was no hint of a questionable past.

Edwin's father was gravely ill, and his mother suffered from mental health issues after one of her children had gone missing. With the weight of the world on his shoulders, Edwin had no choice but to take on part-time work as a male escort just to keep his family afloat. Today marked his very first shift.

Annoyance flickered in Elias's eyes as he squeezed the phone tighter. Of all days, Edwin's path crossed Emilia's on his first assignment. What a coincidence.

"Did you find anything dangerous about him?" Wilbur asked quickly, noticing Elias's expression.

A suspicion crept into Wilbur's mind that Edwin might have been planted by a rivalfamily hoping to snatch away Emilia's chance at receiving Asclepius's treatment. That possibility tightened his chest with unease.

"No," Elias said flatly, his tone leaving no room for debate. "Then what if he was purposely sent to get close to Ms. Harris?" Wilbur pressed, still voicing his doubts.

The reports they'd gathered offered nothing to back up that theory. Even so, Elias wasn't about to let down his guard. He issued his orders in a steely tone."Put someone on him. I want his every move tracked."

"Understood." Wilbur wasted no time making the call,relaying the orders without hesitation.

Thirty minutes ticked by while their car sat idle in the same quiet spot.

Not knowing what else to do, Wilbur peeked at Elias,who still looked as if he might be asleep.

In a low voice, Wilbur asked, "Are we camping out here till morning?"

"Head back," Elias replied, his eyes still closed, voice steady as ever.

Saying nothing more, Wilbur started the car and pulled away from the curb. ···
The following morning arrived.

At Oticester's Dance Academy, Violet caught 'snippets of gossip about a woman who had stunned everyone by nailing a tough routine the day before.

"That woman who succeeded in the challenge-she's here now. Any idea what her main dance style is?"

"Word is, she's waiting by the north entrance. She smashed the record. That's unbelievable!"

"I want a look for myself! People say she's gorgeous and carries herself like a star. I'm curious if she's really as dazzling as everyone claims."

Violet lingered by the door, caught between leaving and giving in to curiosity.

With so many whispers flying, she wanted to see for herself whether this newcomer lived up to her reputation. More importantly, a question tugged at her: Did the woman dance ballet too? As long as their styles didn't overlap, Violet figured her own spotlight would remain undimmed, no matter how gifted the newcomer might be.
###Chapter 72 Curiosity


.Violet leaned slightly toward Sebastian, her voice smooth and sweet. "Sebastian, why don't we check it out too?"

"What's the point? Rodger's still at the hospital waiting for you." Sebastian barely glanced her way.

Rodger's injury had kept him away; otherwise, he would have been right by Violet's side, making sure she got through registràtion without a hitch.

"But I really want to see for myself. That woman seems extraordinary. Who knows, maybe we'll hit it off, and I'll learn a thing or two from her." A playful pout appeared on Violet's lips as she clung to Sebastian's arm. Her voice held that familiar, sing-song tone, the kind she knew always had an effect on him.

"Alright, if you're that curious, I'll go with you."Sebastian caved with a reluctant sigh. "You really are the sweetest, Sebastian." Violet's smile brightened.

He looked away, embarrassed by the praise. "It's the least I can do."

Violet had saved his brother's life and treated him kindly. He figured he owed her every bit of loyalty he could give.

"Let's not waste time, then," Violet said, slipping her arm through his and flashing another gentle smile.

A stray thought crossed her mind: what if that woman was a ballet dancer too? The idea set off a spark of venom in her chest, though her smile never faltered.

If this woman entered her world, she would befriend her, get close, and then quietly sabotage her at every turn. She wasn't about to let anyone threaten her standing, be it on a national or international stage,the spotlight belonged to her alone. At the north entrance, Sloane kept pace beside Emilia. "Are you sure you don't want me to stick around?"

Emilia shook her head. "No need. Just swing by after my practice."

Sloane looked around, noticing the curious crowd."Why is everyone watching you like you're the headline act?"

"It's probably just the aftermath of yesterday's challenge," Emilia replied, her tone even. "People are nosy. Give it a day or two, they'll move on."

"Alright, I'll see you later," Sloane said, giving her a quick nod.

"Yeah, thanks." Emilia watched as Sloane disappeared down the hallway, then turned to head for her class.

She had not gotten far before someone stepped directly into her path.

"Emilia! What are you doing at the dance academy?" Sebastian snapped, glaring as if she'd committed a crime.

He was still fuming from last night and clearly thought Emilia was here for no good reason, maybe to pick a fight with Violet on her big day. His resentment simmered just beneath the surface.

Emilia didn't flinch."Why do you care?"

"You're only here to make trouble, aren't you?"Sebastian snapped back.
"Please. I don't have time for your nonsense. Get out of my way, l've got better things to do." Rolling her eyes, Emilia shot him a look of pure annoyance.

"Watch yourself, Emilia. You're pushing your luck."Sebastian's jaw tightened.

"Keep talking, and I'll show you just how unlucky you can get. Move it, or you'll regret it," Emilia said,raising her fists for emphasis.

Violet rushed forward, clutching Sebastian's arm.Fake tears pooled in her eyes as she looked at Emilia with a desperate, trembling expression.

"If you're angry, take it out on me instead. Leave Sebastian alone, he's just a kid and didn't mean to upset you," she pleaded, her voice quivering,perfectly pitched for sympathy.

All at once, Violet reached out and took hold of Emilia's arm, stepping in closer until part of it disappeared behind her.

Before anyone had time to respond, Violet collapsed to the floor, as though an unseen force had shoved her from behind.
###Chapter 73 Make Emilia Apologize


"Ouch!" Violet exclaimed, tumbling to the floor.

Lifting her head, she locked eyes with Emilia. Violet's eyes shimmered with unshed tears, their redness making her look wounded and betrayed.

No words slipped from her lips, but the silent accusation in her tearful stare spoke louder than any complaint.

People standing nearby exchanged glances, their attitudes toward Emilia shifting on the spot.

"Why would she shove someone out of the blule?That's downright cruel. What a shame. For someone who just set a new record here, her attitude is disgraceful."

"She probably thinks she's untouchable now that she's broken the record. It's a joke, really. Life hands talent to people like that?" "Don't be fooled by her looks. Sure, she's stunning,but underneath that, she's heartless. If she's willing to humiliate someone right here, I can't imagine what she does when nobody's watching."

Emilia found herself surrounded by pointing fingers and icy stares.

Sebastian rushed to Violet's side. "Violet!" he called out, his hands helping her to her feet.

Violet kept her head bowed, quiet sobs slipping out,while she carefully revealed her scraped hand for everyone to see.

A faint, satisfied smile tugged at Violet's mouth, her eyes gleaming with hidden triumph. Right here, in the open, she was determined to ruin Emilia's reputation.

"You're bleeding..." Sebastian's eyes narrowed as he swung around to shoot Emilia a murderous glare.
His anger erupted. "Did you really come here, Emilia,just to start something with Violet because you heard she would be at the academy? You wanted to hurt her so you could get your sick satisfaction, isn't that right? You're foul. You're already in the mud and want to drag the rest of us down there with you. Pathetic!"
Sebastian looked about ready to lash out, but Violet caught his sleeve and spoke up, her voice trembling,barely holding back tears. "Sebastian, please, don't blame her. I was the one who lost my balance. Emilia had nothing to do with it."
Violet's intervention wasn't for kindness. Deep down,she hoped to throw more fuel onto the flames.

"Why would you say that?" Sebastian shot her a look of disbelief. "You always stand up for her, and she only gives you grief in return."

"I..." Violet's gaze dropped, and her teeth pressed into her lip, matching her phonily wounded expression.

Without missing a beat, Sebastian aimed another sharp glare at Emilia. "You're getting off easy because Violet spoke up for you. You owe her an apology." There was something in the way he barked his demands that reminded Emilia of Rodger. She found it downright grating.

With a dramatic flourish, Emilia pretended to clear out her ear, then flicked her eyebrow up and grinned."Give me one reason I should say sorry. She admitted herself that she fell on her own-so why am I getting blamed?"

Violet hadn't counted on Emilia twisting her own statement back at her. She ground her teeth together, careful not to let anyone notice. The more Emilia pushed her point, the more she managed to sour the crowd against herself.

Sebastian was bound to back her up, and it was clear the others would rally behind her as well. People rarely looked for the real story. Most just felt sorry for whoever seemed most helpless. She understood exactly when to let her weakness show, and she wielded it like a secret weapon.

Emilia, though, never softened. Her stubbornness grated on everyone around her. Men, especially, seemed to bristle at women who refused to play gentle.

There was a certain power in appearing delicate-it made men want to step in and protect the weak.Emilia never figured out how to make that work for her. She clung to her sense of justice with both hands, but that only made her situation worse every time.

"If you don't apologize right now, you might find yourself shown the door," warned Sebastian.

Violet chimed in, her voice coated in false concern,"Sebastian, please don't do this."

He straightened his shoulders and replied, "I won't let anyone walk all over you. You'll get the fairness you deserve today."

With a flicker of amusement in her eyes, Emilia answered, "Alright then. If that's what you want, P'll say sorry."
###Chapter 74 Fight


.Emilia agreed so quickly that Sebastian and Violet exchanged nervous glances. Something about the way Emilia gave in made it seem like she was planning something.

Most people figured Emilia had accepted her mistake and was ready to make things right. But then,in the blink of an eye, everything changed.

Without warning, Emilia shoved Violet hard, sending her crashing to the floor.

A sharp yelp escaped Violet as she hit the floor again, her hands scraping against the tiles, her elbows catching the brunt of the fall.

The sting made her face twist in pain. Tears slipped down her cheeks one after another, the sight pulling at the heartstrings of everyone watching.

Sebastian snapped, "Is this your idea of an apology, Emilia?"
With a wicked grin, Emilia lifted her brows. "That's right. I haven't done anything wrong, so I had nothing to apologize for before. Now that I've actually pushed her, I can finally say sorry naturally."
She bent down just enough to meet Violet's eyes, her smile as bright as ever. "Sorry for the shove. My bad.I hope you accept my heartfelt apology."

Through the haze of her tears, Violet managed to answer, "It's okay, Emilia. I shouldn't have upset you.This is all on me."
"I'm glad you understand. Next time, try not to point fingers at me for no reason." Emilia straightened and let out a cold laugh, brushing off Violet's words.

Pretending to be fragile had always seemed pointless to her. She believed power deserved to be shown,not hidden behind a mask of humility.

Those who held little authority tended to put on meek airs, hoping to please the ones above. For someone like her, high on the ladder, there was no need to stoop or pretend for the approval of people beneath her. On the rare occasion she bothered to show weakness, it was nothing but sport, a way to amuse herself by watching others scramble.

If those at the bottom played up their misery, it was just desperate pleading, a bid for scraps from those in charge. But when the powerful pretended to be soft, it only highlighted their control. The weak watched their superiors' moods, constantly afraid they'd be tossed aside, while the ones in charge tossed out favors only when it suited them. If the underlings became an eyesore, they were gone without a second thought.

Emilia's attitude, so openly defiant, had the onlookers buzzing among themselves. Yet, for all their whispers and sideways glances, nobody dared speak up too loudly.

Suspicion lingered in the air. No one could tell who she really was or whether she would seek revenge against anyone who crossed her. Some people seethed in silence, just waiting for the moment she might slip up.

Someone in the back, thinking they could start a firestorm, secretly filmed the whole confrontation,hoping the internet's sharp-eyed crowd would unmask Emilia and destroy everything she had.

Sebastian gently lifted Violet to her feet,but his patience was gone. The anger in his eyes was unmistakable.

His fists clenched, and with a burst of frustration, he threw a punch straight at Emilia.

She reacted with almost casual skill, sidestepping and catching his wrist before shoving him away with one quick motion.

Sebastian stumbled but managed to steady himself.He rushed back, determined, swinging again.

Unfazed, Emilia's lips curled into a smirk. Her leg shot up, stopping mere inches from Sebastian's face.

Only quick reflexes kept his nose from colliding with the sole of her shoe, which hovered just out of reach.

A sudden chill ran down Sebastian's spine. Sweat prickled at his brow. On instinct, he reached out,intent on yanking Emilia's leg and making her crash to the ground.

He barely moved before Emilia snatched her leg back,leaving him empty-handed and rattled.
###Chapter 75 Coward


Sebastian lunged forward, but Emilia moved like lightning and caught him square in the gut with a sharp kick, knocking him flat on his back.

Gasps rippled through the onlookers, their faces twisting as if they felt the blow themselves.

No one questioned now why Emilia acted so boldly-her fighting skills left no doubt. Ordinary people would have stood no chance against her speed and power.

Lucky for them, they had stayed on the sidelines,content to gossip from afar. Anyone who tried to step in would've ended up sprawled out just like Sebastian.

Violet darted to Sebastian's side, panic draining the color from her face. She bent down, her hands trembling as she helped him to his feet. "Sebastian,are you alright?" she asked, her voice tight with worry.
Examining him for injuries, Violet caught sight of a nasty scrape on his hand. Tears sprang to her eyes.

"Does it hurt badly?" Violet's voice quivered as she fought to hold back a sob. With a wounded look, she turned to Emilia. "If you're angry, take it out on me instead. Why did you have to go so far with Sebastian?"

A dry laugh escaped Emilia. "He asked for it, and I have been restrained enough not to send him right into unconsciousness. You keep testing my patience -what did you expect, a pat on the back? Try hassling me again, and next time, I won't be sO gentle. Maybe go tell Rodger to teach his two dogs some manners before they snap at the wrong person again."

Violet and Sebastian both bristled, their cheeks flushed with fury at being likened to wild dogs.

"Emilia!" Sebastian spat her name through clenched teeth. "What now? Want me to lay you out again?" Emilia lifted her fist, and Sebastian's first instinct was to shield his head.

Rolling her eyes, Emilia lowered her hand. "What a coward," she mocked.

With no further interest in their drama, Emilia strode away, confidence radiating from every step.

When she brushed past Violet, she lifted her hand as though to slap her.

Violet turned pale and slapped her palms over her cheeks in panic.

The moment Emilia tossed a teasing grin her way,Violet suddenly understood that she was being played for a fool.

"Emilia! You bitch! I'll make you pay for this!" Violet screamed internally, but she kept up that pitiful expression, presenting herself as helpless.

Most people around believed Violet was the one who'd be en hurt. To the men watching, she looked like a girl in need of rescuing, stirring up every bit of chivaly they had left.

The group of men who had captured the scuffle on their phones traded quick looks before making a decision. Since they couldn't take down that stunning, wild woman in person, they figured the internet could do their dirty work. Online ridicule could break anyone without ironclad resolve-it drove some to ruin and others to the edge of death itself.

Watching Emilia leave as though she owned the place, Sebastian clenched his jaw until it ached. He wanted nothing more than to fight back, but Emnilia had become far too tough. If he kept clashing with her, he'd only humiliate himself and drag the Mitchell name deeper into disgrace.

"I'm sorry, Sebastian. I never meant for you to get hurt because of me," Violet whispered, her eyes brimming with tears.
"This has nothing to do with you, Violet," Sebastian replied, his voice burning with resolve. "If she thinks she can get away with treating you like this, she's in for a shock. I won't let her do it again."

A quick, secret smile played at the corners of Violet's mouth, a shadow passing through her gaze.

On the outside, she stayed soft and innocent, the picture of gentle sorrow. "Let's just forget it. I can handle a little pain. She's still bitter about what happened with Rodger. Once she cools off, this will probably blow over."
###Chapter 76 Drive Her Out


Watching Violet endure the bullying with quiet grace only made Sebastian feel even more protective.

"We can't let her have her way. I can't stand to watch it anymore. The more you let her walk all over you,the bolder she gets. Can't you see how out of control Emilia's become?" Sebastian muttered, frustration creeping into his voice.

Violet lowered her head, tears slipping silently down her cheeks.

Sebastian sighed, softening a little, "Let's just get out of here. She came to the academy just to stir up trouble for you. I'll go straight to Rodger and let him know what's happening."

Violetgripped his arm, fake panic flaring in her eyes."Don't. If you tell Rodger, he'll blame Emilia for everything." "Why do you keep worrying about her? All she's done is make your life miserable." Sebastian shook his head, clearly exasperated.

Violet's voice was barely above a whisper. "But after Rodger's accident, it was Emilia who stayed by his side,nursing him back to health. I owe her for that..."

Sebastian let out a heavy sigh. "Well, maybe that's the only decent thing she's ever done."

As they made their way toward the main entrance, a few students glanced over, whispering behind their hands.

Annoyed by the attention, Sebastian reached out and grabbed a male student at random. "What are you staring at? Got something you want to say? Or do you just get a kick out of spreading rumors?"

"N-no, I was just surprised that the woman who won the challenge could be so fierce..." The young man shrank back, caught off guard. He'd just been hoping for some gossip, never expecting to get called out. "What challenge are you talking about?" Sebastian asked, his brow creasing as he looked the student up and down.

Violet's mind flashed back to the whispers she'd overheard earlier-something about a challenge tower and someone succeeding.
Could it be Emilia who had entered the Challenge Tower and actually come out on top? Was she now setting her sights on the national ballet competition?
What the hell did Emilia want?

The idea gnawed at Violet, making her jaw tighten with frustration and disbelief.

"The same woman who roughed you up and strutted out like she owned the place-she's the one who passed the challenge yesterday," the student explained.

"That's impossible..." Sebastian's grip loosened, his face a mask of shock.

Sebastian was convinced he'd heard wrong. There was no way Emilia had pulled off a feat like that.Did she even know the first thing about dance? He honestly didn't believe she could dance at all.

During all the time she'd spent with the Mitchel family, she'd never once shown an ounce of talent for dancing. Even Violet, who was gifted enough to shine on stage, doubted she could get through that bruta test-so how could Emilia of all people manage it?

"When Emilia was swinging at us, I swear I hearo someone mention she was the one who conquered the challenge. I honestly thought I was just imagining things." Violet's eyes filled with tears again. "It's my fault.I must have upset her all over again.Now Emilia probably won't want anything to do with me."

"So what? We don't need her around. As long as she's not doing ballet, she won't be a threat to you.Sebastian tried to reassure her.

"But what if Emilia really is competing in ballet? Still,can't believe she'd ever want to hurt me on purpose Once this misunderstanding is cleared up, I'm sure things will go back to normal," Violet said, feigning a smile.

Sebastian's face hardened at her words. He grabbed Violet's hand and set off at a quick pace.

"Sebastian, what's the rush? Where are we going?"Violet asked, though deep down, she already knew exactly what he was planning.

"We're finding Rodger. I want him to make sure Emilia never gets another chance to step foot in this dance academy. So what if she managed to pass the challenge? She doesn't run this place," Sebastian said, his tone cold.

"That's not right, Sebastian. We shouldIn't stoop to that level," Violet responded, putting on her most innocent expression-even as she secretly felt a thrill of satisfaction.
She knew both Mitchell brothers would take her side,and Emilia could never really belong in their world.

Even if Emilia somehow clawed her way into the academy by her own hard work, the Mitchell family's power could easily force her out, making sure she'd never show her face here again.
###Chapter 77 Violet's Weapon


"She's been stepping on us long enough-why should we let it slide? Rodger will make sure she pays for it,"Sebastian urged before climbing into the car and speeding away with Violet.

They arrived at the hospital and went directly to Rodger's room.

Rodger glanced up, surprised to see his younger brother seething while Violet looked as if she had been wronged.

"What's going on with you two?" Rodger asked, his brows knitting as he studied their faces.

The bandaged wound on Violet's arm immediately caught his attention. He scrambled out of bed so fast he nearly lost his balance.

"Careful, Rodger," Violet said quickly, reaching to steady him.

"Your hand..." Rodger's voice faltered as he gently took hers, his heart tightening at the sight.

His grip hardened, and fury clouded his features. "Who did this?" he asked, his voice breaking through clenched teeth, eyes reddening with anger.

Though she saw how upset he was, Violet still spoke softly. "It's nothing. Don't be angry. I fell on my own..."

"That's a lie!" Sebastian cut her off, unable to hold back.

He had expected her to reveal everything to Rodger, but even now she was trying to protect Emilia.

If that wretched woman had even a fraction of Violet's grace and warmth, putting up with her would have been far less of a burden.

"Who did this?" Rodger's face grew darker when his eyes shifted to Sebastian's injured hand. His frown deepened."You're hurt too?"

"Yeah. It was Emilia..." Sebastian launched into an explanation, telling him how she had found out about their trip to the dance academy and picked a fight.

He carefully left out the part where Emilia had actually earned her way in. In his mind, there was no way she had truly succeeded on her own. It had to be dumb luck. In his eyes, details like that were unimportant to Rodger, hardly worth his concern.

"Her again!" Rodger exclaimed, anger boiling over.

She kept pushing, testing how far she could go. Emilia's refusal to give up her place as his wife was the only reason she created such outrageous scenes. Not only had she refused to finalize the divorce, but she also kept clashing with Violet, as if making trouble would somehow guarantee her place in the family and drive Violet away.

It was nothing short of venom.

How blind and absurd she was, acting as though schemes and defiance would make him choose her. If that was her plan, then Emilia was living in a fantasy. His heart belonged to Violet, and there was no chance he would ever fall for Emilia.

"Rodger, what are you going to do about this?" Sebastian asked.

If Rodger stayed passive, he planned to take action himself. He refused to accept that Emilia was beyond his reach.

"Give me a moment to think," Rodger said, casting a quick, worried glance at Violet's scraped hand.GO fetch some ointment for those scratches.I need to clean them."

"Alright," Sebastian responded and left the room.

When Rodger reached out and brushed Violet's arm, she flinched and drew in a sharp breath."Ouch!"

Only then did Rodger notice the raw scrape along her elbow, and seeing it pulled at his chest with sudden sympathy.

"Why didn't you tell me? I never saw this. Were you planning to hide it? Do you have any other injuries?"Rodger asked, his voice rough with both anger and worry at the way she acted like it was nothing. ...I was scared you'd blame Emilia,"Violet stammered,deceitful tears welling and making her seempainfully fragile.
Those tears were a tool she knew how to use.Carefully wielded,they could chip away at Emilia's positionuntil she was gone.
###Chapter 78 Cyberbully


Rodger drew Violet close, pressing a gentle kiss to her forehead. "Forgive me. I didn't mean to sound harsh.I only worry about you too much," he murmured.

"I understand. I don't blame you," Violet whispered back, her voice trembling with emotion.

A shadow passed through Rodger's eyes, sharpening with a glint of cruelty. "I'll see to it that Emilia pays for this."

Inside, Violet's heart fluttered with quiet triumph. With just a handful of carefully chosen words, she could steer the Mitchell brothers into doing her bidding.

Her lips curved into a mask of tenderness as she said softly,"It's really not Emilia's fault..."

Before she could say another word, Rodger silenced her with a kiss, swallowing her protest.



The following morning, Emilia was awakened by urgent pounding on her door.

Half-asleep, she stumbled to open it, only to hear Sloane's frantic voice spill out before she could even focus.

"We've got a serious problem."

Rubbing her tired eyes, Emilia frowned. "And what's so dire it has you in a panic this early?"

Sloane tugged her by the arm and pulled her out onto the balcony, then pointed below. "Take a look."

Blinking against the morning light, Emilia peered down-then the sleep drained right out of her.

Good grief. The street was packed with people, a restless sea of faces, and several of them were holding cameras.

One of the crowd caught sight of her and shouted,"Upothere! That's her!" Emilia jerked Sloane back inside and yanked the curtains shut with a snap.

Had her secret as Cloudstrider-the undefeated figure of online gaming-been exposed? Or had someone discovered she was the viral singing sensation blowing up the internet?

How had the apartment building suddenly become so crowded overnight? And judging by the way they kept looking around, there was no doubt-they were here because of her.

"What's happening? Did someone uncover my hidden identity?" Emilia asked, turning wide-eyed to Sloane.

"Not even close," Sloane groaned, rolling her eyes with exasperation. "They're not here to cheer you on.They came to cause trouble."

"All these people, just to come after me? What crime could I possibly have committed?" Emilia racked her brain, bewildered, trying to recall anything that might warrant this madness.

Whenever disaster struck, Emilia was always one of the first to send help and organize relief. She had also put her money into building several schools.

"Someone filmed you schooling Violet yesterday without your knowledge and uploaded it," Sloane said."The clip went viral, and once people started fanning those flames, everything blew up."

Sloane scrolled through the trending searches and news headlines to show her. "This is insane. Trash-talking you online wasn't enough, so they tracked you down. Someone even leaked your address,and now they're all gathered to confront you."

With each sentence, Sloane grew more furious, itching to drag the hidden instigator into the open and give them a piece of her mind. "Do not read the comments. They are vicious and cruel, and they are dragging your family into it."

The attacks did not stop at Emilia; her family was being smeared, and Sloane herself faced harsh criticism simply for being associated.

They claimed that anyone close to Emilia was guilty by association and deserved to be pulled down with her.

Online mobs were being rallied to unmask whoever backed Emilia, hungry for the spectacle of a public downfall.

Because Emilia had acted so brazenly in their eyes, the crowd insisted she should be ready to face the consequences.
###Chapter 79 Let The Story Blow Up


Emilia absentmindedly flicked through headlines, viral clips, and trending posts. Every comment section was a minefield, overflowing with venom.

It wasn't just her name being dragged through the dirt-her families weren't spared. Sloane caught plenty of fire, too. Every cruel insult, every bitter accusation, rained down like a relentless storm, each one nastier than the last.

"So what's your move? You still heading to the dance academy? I could show up as you and run interference," Sloane suggested.

"No need for that. With all the heat on me right now, I'm sure half the city is waiting outside the academy doors, just hoping for a spectacle," Emilia said, her voice steady.

"Then why not stir up a little chaos to throw them off? Or maybe report the gossip, try to get those videos taken down, maybe wipe your name from the hot list?" Sloane remarked.

"Wouldn't that just make me look even more guilty?" Emilia's lips curled in a sly smile, a spark of defiance in her eyes."The people pulling these strings aren't about to let those videos disappear. If they want to play this game, I'll let the story blow up as big as they want."

Sloane leaned in closer, her voice tinged with curiosity and mischief. "Alright, what's your master plan this time?"

Emilia's smirk widened. "I'm going to prove every one of them wrong. But let's not rush-let them run their mouths a little longer."

Sloane chuckled and flashed a thumbs-up. "Only you could handle things with that much style."

Sloane couldn't quite guess what. Emilia was planning, but she had faith she'd find a way to flip the whole situation on its head. Emilia always managed to surprise everyone with what she pulled off.

"With all these people hanging around, let's just stay in for breakfast," Emilia said, glancing out the window at the growing crowd while rifling through the fridge to see what was left.

"You don't need to cook. Let me do it today. I promise, you're in good hands." Sloane waved her off, puffing out her chest.

"Worried I'll burn the kitchen down?" Emilia cast Sloane a sideways look, the corners of her mouth twitching with barely hidden laughter.

"You know, real friends don't have to spell everything out," Sloane teased, giving Emilia a gentle shove toward the sofa.

With a dramatic flourish, Sloane dipped into a playful bow. "Madam, what would you fancy for breakfast this morning? Allow your loyal butler to handle all your culinary needs," she said, hamming it up.

Emilia couldn't hold back any longer-she grabbed a bag of chips and tossed it at Sloane, laughing."Cut it out with the butler routine, you're making my skin crawl."

Sloane caught the bag with a flourish, struggling to keep her face straight. "Thank you for this generous gift,milady," she answered with exaggerated politeness.

A second later, both of them burst into laughter, the sound echoing through the apartment.

Once the giggles faded, Sloane wiped her eyes and asked, "Alright, what's on the menu? What are you actually craving?"

Emilia thought for a second, then grinned. "Pasta sounds perfect."

"Coming right up! Go get ready-and I'll work some magic in the kitchen," Sloane said, already moving to gather the ingredients.

It didn't take long before the pasta was cooked just right-each strand with the perfect bite. The two of them made quick work of their meal, not a single noodle left behind.

"Sloane, you're seriously leveling up in the kitchen. That was amazing," Emilia said, patting herstomach and letting out a satisfied sigh.

Sloane beamed. "Coming from you,the queen of picky eaters, that's the highest praise I could get." Emilia grinned, then stretched and stood. "Alright, time to change and get ready for the big day!"

Sloane snapped her fingers as something came to mind. "Oh, I almost forgot-one of the Mitchell Group's entertainment companies wants to sign you."
###Chapter 80 Queen


Emilia's face gave nothing away as she asked, almost lazily, "So, which one of my personas are they hoping to sign?"

Sloane shot her a mischievous grin and gave her a conspiratorial wink."Why don't you take a wild guess?"

Emilia laughed, a little smirk forming, "Not interested."

"Come on, just humor me," Sloane insisted, her tone sweetening with that pleading note Emilia knew alI too well.

Emilia sighed in surrender, knowing Sloane wouldn't quit until she got her way.

"Fine, fine, I'll' play along. You happy now?" Emilia paused, pretending to give it some thought before tossing out her answer. "Queen?"

Sloane let out an exaggerated gasp. "You are unreal! One guess and you nailed it!"

"Tell them no," Emilia replied instantly, not missing a beat.

She was well aware of why the Mitchell Group wanted her on their roster. It wasn't jus about her sudden popularity-there were other motives at play.
"Consider it done. I'll make sure they get the message loud and clear." Sloane flashed an◯ksign with a wink.

"They'll probably try to buy up the rights to my music next," Emilia said, her tone firm. "Don't let them get their hands on anything. Hold the line."

"You can count on me." Sloane gave her a quick nod.

···
Down on the street in front of the apartment building. "Are you sure this is where she lives? What if we got the wrong place?"

"We've been camped out here since sunrise, and still no sign of her."

"She's definitely inside. Someone spotted her out on the balcony earlier. Maybe she's just too scared to show her face."

"Anyone got a plan for getting in? Should we send someone up to snoop around?"

"That might've worked before, but not now. The front's all locked up, and there's a security guard watching the door."

The crowd milling outside grew restless, a mix of eager onlookers and a handful of troublemakers Violet had slipped in on purpose.

Violet had been the one to quietly leak Emilia's address to the world. She'd spent the night plotting every detail, certain that this time Emilia would finally be destroyed-and Emilia's disgrace would be splashed across every headline by morning.

Violet was convinced this would be Emilia's undoing.

Cyberbullying was already a nightmare for most, but once someone's address got out, the fallout escalated fast.Suddenly, strangers were lurking outside your door, making home feel like a prison.

Most people would break under that kind of pressure-online hatred alone was enough to shatter someone's confidence, let alone when the threats showed up in person.

···
When the elevator doors parted, Emilia strode out in a jet-black suit.

She was all long lines and quiet power, the fit so precise it looked tailor-made. Black sunglasses covered her eyes, adding an extra layer of mystique.

A classic black umbrella dangled from her hand, the faintest smirk on her lips bringing a spark of mischief to her cool exterior. Sloane walked at her side, dressed in a white top and blush-pink cargo pants.

She had her own air of confidence, but there was something soft and loyal about the way she stuck close to Emilia.

Both women wore dark glasses, though Sloane's pink umbrella gave her a playful, carefree vibe that contrasted Emilia's sharp coolness.

Side by side, they had the composure of models about to rule a runway.

At the entrance, the security guards froze for a second, taken aback by their presence, only snapping to attention as Emilia and Sloane closed the distance.

"Heading out this morning? Looks like most of them are waiting for you. Maybe you should lay low for a while-just in case someone out there gets out of hand," one of the guards asked, concern in his eyes as he glanced at the crowd outside.

He'd seen the swirling storm of online gossip, all those ugly words and accusations aimed at the two women. But deep down, he doubted either of them were anything like the people in those rumors.
###Chapter 81 Fight Back


To the security guard, Emilia and Sloane always came across as respectful and genuine, treating everyone the same no matter their job. He just couldn't picture either of them as the heartless villains painted by the internet.

If Emilia had lashed out at someone, he figured it was only because she'd been pushed past her limit.

Another guard chimed in, his voice low with concern, "Some of that crowd looks like they're out for blood.I'm worried they might actually try something. Maybe it's best you two don't go out right now."

He'd been watching the group, noting the way a few glared-like they were just waiting for an excuse to pounce.

"We'll be fine. We can take care of ourselves." Emilia's lips curled into a calm smile.

Sloane nodded in agreement. "Thanks for looking out for us. Can you open the door?"

They were ready for whatever chaos waited outside. If anyone wanted to start something, they wouldn't back down.

Reluctantly, theguards unlocked the glass doors, uneasy about letting two women face a hostile crowd alone. Still,they hesitated just long enough to decide to tag along, determined not to let anything happen on their watch.

"We'll walk with you," one suggested as they stepped outside.

Emilia gave a grateful nod, tucking away the kindness for later.

No sooner had they exited than someone rushed toward them. Instantly, both guards shifted in front,blocking Emilia and Sloane from harm.

A second later, a handful of half-empty water bottles came flying from the mob, their weight and momentum enough to break a nose if they landed. Emilia didn't hesitate-she stepped forward, opening her sturdy black umbrella right in front of the guards.

Water bottles thudded against the fabric, but her umbrella held strong, shielding everyone behind her.

At the front of the crowd, a handful of thugs bared their teeth and suddenly brandished iron rods, their eyes locked on Emilia.

"They're coming straight for us!" Sloane shouted, swinging her pink umbrella with surprising force. She cracked a man across the neck, then followed up with a sharp kick while he was doubled over.

Emilia snapped her umbrella closed, then spun it in her hand like a baton. She jabbed one attacker in the chest and knocked another to the floor witha swift strike.

Another would-be assailant lunged at her, rod raised, but Emilia mnoved like a dancer-spinning, ducking,her movements graceful but full of power. She blocked his swing with the umbrella, then dropped into a flawless 360-degree kick that sent him sprawling.

Yet another man barreled toward her, iron rod gripped tight.

With the same calm elegance, Emilia used the tip of her umbrella to strike his wrist.

He howled, the rod slipping from his fingers and clattering to the pavement.

Without missing a beat, Emilia delivered a sharp kick, sending the man flying back into the crowd and toppling several others like dominoes.

Cries of pain echoed through the air. In a matter of seconds, most of the attackers were sprawled on the floor, groaning and clutching their injuries.

The two security guards could only watch, barely getting a chance to act-none of the remaining thugs dared come any closer, shrinking back in wide-eyed fear.

People in the distance froze, phones raised to capture every second of the spectacle.

When one of the men tried to crawl away, the guards lunged after him, pinning him down before he could escape. The sight of iron rods scattered across the pavement left no doubt-these guys had come looking for real trouble.

Another thug, realizing the tables had turned, tried to scramble to his feet and make a run for it.

A wicked grin flashed across Emilia's face as she broke into a sprint. She moved with the force and agility of a skilled fighter-every stride as quick and powerful as a champion on the track.

The crowd stood frozen in awe, jaws dropping as she shot past. With that kind of energy, they half-expected her to tear through anyone in her path.

Emilia vaulted off the pavement, took a few steps up the wall, and launched herself into a flying kick. Her foot connected with a sickening crack, sending her target crashing to the floor.

Blood spilled and two teeth skittered across the pavement, the man too dazed and broken to even try crawling away.
###Chapter 82 Amazement


The silence in the air felt almost painful. Nobody made a sound, too afraid to even breathe.

People looked terrified that making any noise might make themselves the target, while some bystanders stared at Emilia, their eyes wide with amazement.

A few of the ones who thought bullying online was not enough and had come in person now stepped back on instinct.

Nobody dared to get any closer. The idea of trying to teach her a lesson vanished completely.

After seeing the way she fought just now, they all felt that getting out of this place in one piece would be a miracle.

The two security guards who wanted to step in just looked at each other, feeling embarrassed. They thought the two young women might need help, but now it was clear their worry had been pointless.

Instead of worrying about those girls, they started thinking it would be more dangerous if the girls got carried.away and actually killed someone. They both knew going to jail because of these thugs was not worth it at all.

Emilia grabbed the man who had tried to sneak away and dragged him back, dropping him onto the heap of defeated men.

With her trademark black umbrella in hand, she pressed the tip against the man's cheek and said, "If any of you try to run, this is what's waiting for you."

The men quickly shook their heads, too terrified to say a word, tears running down their cheeks.

All they wanted was to make some quick cash. Why did it turn out to be this hard? The person who hired them never said anything about the girl being able to fight.

If any of them had hesitated for even a second, it could have cost them their lives. This kind of job definitely deserved hazard pay, if not more. The employer had left out some pretty important details-details that could have gotten someone killed.

Emilia's trademark black umbrella hit the ground with a heavy thud as she slowly scanned the people in front of her.

A gentle smile rested on her lips, and her eyes almost looked soft, but the tension she carried made everyone shift uncomfortably.

Nobody who showed up to cause trouble felt safe now. Everyone's hands were clammy, and nerves were getting the best of them.

Their minds screamed for themn to bolt, but fear kept their feet glued to the floor.

Most of them found that their legs had turned to jelly, and even if they wanted to move, their bodies wouldn't cooperate.

Facing this woman, every one of them felt real fear for the first time.

A single kick from her looked powerful enough to split someone in two.

Each punch and kick that landed earlier made everyone flinch, almost like they could feel the pain themselves.

No one could say Emilia didn't have a reason for her confidence.She'd earned it.

She suddenly swung her umbrella up, aiming the tip straight at the group. "Does anybody else think they can take me?"

Not a soul in the room said a word. The silence was absolute.

Nobody dared to lift their eyes, each one fixed on the floor as if it could save them from Emilia's attention.

It reminded them of those tense moments in school when the teacher searched for a victim. Catching the teacher's eye meant getting called on, and that was scary enough.

Now,locking eyes with her felt far more dangerous. A single glance, and they risked becoming her next target.
Sloane watched, struggling not to laugh as this group, who'd been so loud earlier, now stood meekly in line,hands folded and heads down.

How quickly they lost their boldness. People always seemed brave when they thought they held the upper hand, but that confidence disappeared the moment real strength stepped in.

Bullies crowded around the weak, but ran from anyone stronger.

"I already called the cops," said Sloane.

"Well done." Emilia grinned,, flashing her a thumbs up. "I guess we'll have to stick around and talk to the officers before we can get over to the dance academy."

···
Inside the Dance Academy. At Dean's Office.

"What a waste. She had so much potential." A long sigh slipped from Melina Aguilar as she set her phone aside.

Emory Calderon took off her sunglasses with deliberate care, sunlight catching the rim of her hat."Ms.Aguilar, I know she's gifted, but if her actions damage the academy's reputation, there's only one thing to do. She should be permanently expelled and lose her standing as a dancer."

As soon as Emory finished her statement, someone knocked on the office door.
###Chapter 83 Refuse Emory's Offer


"Come in," said Melina.

The door eased open, and Emilia stepped into view, immediately capturing the room's attention.

Her appearance was unforgettable-every feature seemed sculpted, and the poise in her tall, slender frame made it impossible to look away. What drew every/ eye most was the long, graceful curve of her neck. She looked every bit like a regal swan, dignified and mesmerizing.

Both Melina and Emory found themselves briefly lost in the sight of her.

A thought crossed Emory's mind: this woman must have the perfect form for ballet. Emilia seemed to fit the image of an ideal ballerina so well that Emory almost wanted to ask her to dance right then and there.

It would be no exaggeration to say Emory considered inviting Emilia to join her own training program. As someone who had nearly taken the top spot in the world of ballet, Emory had come here hoping to discover a new prodigy-someone who might even outshine the current champion one day.

She knew her own chance had come and gone, but that only fueled her ambition for her future student's victory. Watching someone she'd coached reach the pinnacle would be the ultimate reward, a balm for every disappointment.

Melina checked the phone in her hand, glancing between the screen and the young woman standing before her. "Emilia?" she asked, recognizing her as the woman everyone had been talking about online.

The photos didn't do her justice. In person, Emilia had a magnetism that felt almost otherworldly-she looked like she belonged on a stage. There was no doubt in Melina's mind: if Emilia ever took up ballet,the results would be breathtaking. She had the neck and grace that only true dancers possessed.

Calmly, Emilia met her gaze. "Yes.Emilia Harris."

After stepping inside, Emilia's gaze briefly flickered toward Emory, but she soon fixed her attention directly on Melina. Meanwhile, Emory cared little for courtesy or attitude; her only concern was scouting out the next rising star. Usually, Emory would have taken offense at someone ignoring her, but this time she let it slide.

"So you're the one everyone's talking about online? The student causing all the controversy and dragging the academy's name through the mud?" Emory gave her a thorough once-over, not missing a detail.

Truth betold, Emory thought, if this woman could master ballet and truly shine, all this drama would blow over. Talent always mattered more than gossip-unless the scandal went too far.

"I didn't do that," Emilia answered. Her expression grew sharper, coldness settling in her eyes.

"Yet here you are, about to get expelled, and you're still denying it?" Emory rose from her chair and slowly circled Emilia, her eyes weighing everything from Emilia's bearing to her posture.

No matter how hard she tried, Emory couldn't find a single flaw-Emilia's presence was truly exceptional.

Without giving Melina a chance to speak, Emory continued, "Let me make you an offer. If you're willing to train under me and dedicate yourself to ballet, I'll see to it that this whole mess goes away. The expulsion will be off the table. What do you think?"

"Thank you, but I have no intention of accepting you as my mentor," said Emilia, her tone cold and unwavering.

A shadow crossed Emory's face, and her eyes narrowed at Emilia, radiating clear annoyance with an edge of hostility.

She couldn't believe this. Dozens of dancers would give anything for the chance to call her their mentor,and yet Emilia had turned her down without a second thought.

What made Emilia so confident? Who did she think she was to brush off an offer like that?

Were it not for Emilia's exceptional potential-and Emory's fierce determination to train someone who could topple her old rival-she would have dismissed the woman right then and there.
"Think carefully, Emilia. You shouldn't rush to say no. This is a rare opportunity. With someone like Emory,the silver medalist of the global ballet competition, guiding you, your dancing would reach another level entirely," Melina said, her tone gentle and sincere.

From Melina's perspective, expelling such a gifted student felt like a waste. Meeting Emilia face-to-face only made that feeling stronger.

If Emory's involvement could settle this situation, she saw no harm in letting the problem shrink into nothing.

There might even be a way to clear things up and keep everyone's reputation intact, which would be the best outcome.

Above all, she cherished real talent, but she also wanted those she supported to show strong characterin every way.
###Chapter 84 Hidden Story


Emory's eyes narrowed as she leveled a sharp stare at Emilia, but her tone stayed forced and controlled.

"I'm not the type to hold grudges," said Emory, trying to keep her voice steady. "If you just say sorry, that'll be the end of it. I'm not so unforgiving that I'd let a little disrespect ruin your future. If you really have what it takes in ballet, I'd still consider teaching you."

Every word sounded like Emory was doing Emilia a favor she never asked for, her posture dripping with superiority.

A flash of amusement crossed Emilia's mind. Even someone with trophies lining their shelves would think twice before talking down to her like that.

Why was Emory acting like some grand champion when she was only a runner-up with a questionable reputation? Frankly, Emilia thought she wasn't even worth befriending, let alone taking advice from.

On the sidelines, Melina watched the exchange, genuinely stunned. Emilia didn't so much as blink, not even after hearing Emory's lofty title.

Was Emilia already aware? If so, why didn't she seem the least bit impressed?

Maybe there was some history between them, or maybe Emilia was just being arrogant?

But Melina quickly dismissed the thought; after all, Emilia had treated her with respect.

None of it had caught Emory's attention. With her arms folded and her chin lifted just enough to show it, she stood there exuding quiet arrogance.

After revealing who she was, she fully expected Emilia to light up with excitement and plead for a chance to become her student.

Feeling quietly satisfied, Emory had expected things to go her way, but the result was nothing like she imagined. "Save your breath. A despicable person doesn't qualify to be my mentor," Emilia replied, her words icy and final.

Emory was left sputtering, lost for words, her cheeks flushing with humiliation.

How could Emilia, just a student, dare to snub her like this?

A shiver ran through Melina as she watched, a pit of worry settling in her stomach.

Emilia's boldness could easily spark another wave of backlash online. Not only were people dragging her online already, but she still had the nerve to act like she was untouchable.

Emilia's situation genuinely tore at Melina, but she couldn't ignore how overly confident the girl seemed to be.

Could it be that the online comment about how heartless Emilia was was actually true?

"I said nothing but the truth." Emilia held her gaze steady on Emory, a small, knowing smile flickering at the corner of her mouth. "Don't tell me you've already forgotten what you did to Cecilia."

A shiver ran down Emory's spine. Did Emilia really know? She couldn't tell if it was the force of Emilia's gaze or just raw nerves, but she instinctively backed away, putting a little distance between them.

Melina's brow tensed the moment she heard the name Cecilia, her mind was already working through what it could mean. Was Emilia talking about Cecilia Dobson, the international ballet competition champion?

Rumors floated around that Emory and Cecilia used to be inseparable, but somewhere along the line, their friendship crashed and burned. Since then, they'd acted like bitter rivals, never making peace.

Could Emilia actually know Cecilia? Was she privy to the secrets that split them apart?

"I have no idea what you're implying." Emory's eyes turned cold, a flash of hostility surfacing as she spoke.

Years ago, she and Cecilia had been equally talented, their abilities constantly neck and neck.

Everything shifted when Cecilia, as if touched by magic, suddenly advanced in leaps and bounds, all under the guidance of some mysterious teacher she kept hidden. It already stung that Cecilia was a bit more captivating, and the one person Emory cared abot had eyes only for her former friend.

Bitterness festered. Emory couldn't stand the idea of being left behind. Cecilia's secrecy about her mentor only fueled Emory's desire to act.

What made Cecilia so deserving that life kept handing every chance to her?

Nothing about it felt right! No part of Emory was willing to go along with it!

With the odds stacked in Cecilia's favor and fate offering no mercy, Emory decided she'd take matters into her own hands and claim it all for herself.
###Chapter 85 Her Name Is Cleared


"Is your head really that empty, or are you just playing dumb on purpose? Maybe I need to spell it out for you," Emilia snapped, shooting a sharp look at Emory.

Melina couldn't help herself. While Emory fixed her with a cold glare, Melina leaned in, eager for details."What actually happened back then?"

Emory chimed in before Emilia could answer, "There's nothing to tell. People should learn to keep their noses out of trouble. She ought to worry about not getting herself kicked out."

"Getting expelled isn't something I'll have to worry about," Emilia answered smoothly, her tone brimming with certainty.

"Even if you came in through the independent track and enjoy more freedom, if the rumors online turn out true, the school can still expel you," MAelina said with a careful note of caution.

Students who earned admission through independent exams enjoyed wider choices, but they still had to respect certain boundaries.

Emilia lived differently from the rest. She had no need for instructors hovering over her, and there were no strict schedules tying her down. She moved in and out of the campus as she wished.

Yet while others took advantage of the full range of resources, her chosen freedom left her with little more than unrestricted access to the dance studio.

"I know the rules. I'm here to clear my name," Emilia said with steady conviction.

"Really? Then what's your plan for proving it?" Melina pressed, her curiosity stirring at the thought of Emilia's defense.

Emory let out a derisive laugh. "What a joke. The evidence is everywhere. The video shows you hitting someone for no reason at all. It's undeniable. Still going to act like nothing happened?" "I'm not running from the truth. I'll let the evidence speak on my behalf," Emilia replied, sliding her phone from her pocket.

Just as she prepared to show the video, Melina's phone started to ring.

"I need a minute. I've got to answer this," said Melina as she stepped aside, lifting her phone to her ear.

While the voice on the other end spoke, her expression shifted into startled disbelief.

"Alright, I understand," Melina murmured, ending the call before immediately scrolling through the latest news about Emilia.

Moments later, she lowered her phone and fixed her gaze on Emilia.

"There's no reason for you to defend yourself anymore, Emilia. A new video just went public. It shows the other student/picking a fight with you first-you were only trying to protect yourself. Everyone's talking about it now. At first, the school leaned toward expelling you, but now that everything is clear, you're no longer in danger," Melina explained, her eyes lingering on Emilia with both respect and envy.

She couldn't deny that Emilia's headstrong boldness was strangely appealing. Youth gave her the freedom to act recklessly, to fight whenever she pleased.

Unlike Emilia, she herself had spent her life caged by expectations, bending herself into what others demanded instead of embracing who she really was.

Emilia blinked in shock and quickly pulled up the same news. To her surprise, the video clearing her name matched the one she had planned to show Melina. Yet she hadn't releasedit. Who had stepped in on her behalf?

Emory scrolled through the updates, her mood souring with every headline she read. It seemed impossible that Emilia could stumble into such fortune, with the cameras catching every detail of her being wrongly accused.

Out of spite, Emilia shoved the woman aside and then tossed out a mocking apology. Emory could not make sense of her reasoning, but the sheer boldness and lack of shame made her blood boil.
Meanwhile, Melina kept darting glances at Emilia, as if something weighed heavy on her mind but she just couldn't say it out loud.

"Go ahead and say it. I can tell you want to," said Emilia, watching Melina struggle to find the words.
###Chapter 86 A New Enemy


"Let me be honest with you, Emilia. Even with your skill, you can't keep charging ahead without thinking about the fallout. There are people in this world you simply can't provoke," Melina said, her voice lined with worry.She questioned whether Emilia would even take her caution to heart.

Serving as the academy's dean did not give Melina immunity. Even she knew to steer clear of those with too much influence.

Provoking the wrong person could end not just a career but a life. Regardless of how fiercely Emilia could fight, a single pair of fists stood no chance against a crowd.

It was admirable for the young to show fire, yet wisdom came in knowing when to temper it with careful thought.

Emilia replied with a respectful nod, "I hear you, Ms. Aguilar. I know you mean well."

Still, Melina doubted the lesson would sink in. Emilia's air suggested she would carry on unchanged.

Letting.out a sigh she had been holding, Melina accepted that everyone walked their own road, no matter the advice offered.

"You're free to get back to practice if you don't need anything else,"said Melina, her tone gentle but final.

"Alright." Emilia turned to leave, not sparing a glance at Emory.

A sigh slipped from Melina as she watched Emilia go. Trying to rein in Emilia's bold and brash style proved nearly impossible. By standing up to Emory, Emilia had probably made things more difficult for herself.

Wanting to pave a smoother road for Emilia, Melina gave Emory an apologetic smile. "Try not to hold her actions against her, Emory. She's young, she acts on impulse, but her potential is undeniable."

Although Emory's lips curled into a smile, her gaze flashed with something sharper-a warning hidden beneath politeness. "Ms. Aguilar, there's no problem. I know it wouldn't suit me to quarrel with someone younger.I'll let it go."

Emory would never lower herself to pick a fight with Emilia in public,but that did not mean she wouldn't settle the score in her own way.

"That's wonderful news. Let's go out and try every specialty dish in town today," said Melina with a bright laugh, doing her best to win Emory's favor and hopefully smooth things over.

···
The moment Emilia stepped out of the dean's office, curious eyes followed her.

Students milling in the hallway paused to watch, their voices dropping to urgent whispers as she walked by.

"Did you catch that fight video? She was incredible-totally ruthless. I bet she could knock me across the whole courtyard."

"That's nothing! She'd probably kick me all the way across the city. Anyone who dates her will have their hands full."

"I take back every bad thing I ever said about her. Turns out she was forced to apologize for something she didn't even do. The girl she pushed really played everyone for a fool."

Even after Emilia disappeared down the hallway, the gossip didn't fade. Faces wore a mix of admiration and wariness.

Plenty admired her skill, but nobody dared approach, not wanting to get on the bad side of someone with such a fierce edge.

People felt a strange thrill-a pull between wanting to get close and being afraid of her power.

Meanwhile, tucked away behind a corner, Violet watched Emilia slip away unharmed, her own fists balled in frustration.

How did Emilia always manage to get so lucky?

The tide had. shifted online too. Where once commenters hurled insults at Emilia, now they turned their anger on Violet.

The insults against Violet now were even more vile than those once directed at Emilia.

Afraid of being cornered or shamed at the academy, Violet had no choice but to disappear for a while and take a leave from her classes.
###Chapter 87 Rodger Was Captivated


At the hospital.

"Rodger, I can't believe the kind of filth those people are posting about Violet online." Sebastian's anger flared, his voice sharp and restless.

When the internet turned on Emilia before, he barely blinked. Sometimes, he even found it amusing.

Now that Violet was in their crosshairs, all he wanted was to call Emilia out for every ugly comment.

Rodger barely responded. His eyes stayed glued to a video of Emilia in a black suit, her umbrella resting on her shoulder as she faced down a crowd.

He seemed almost mesmerized by what played out on his phone. He kept watching, replaying the same scene-never once looking away from Emilia.

There was something different about her now. When had she started radiating this kind of strength?

He could not tear his eyes away from the intensity she showed in that video.

"That so-called clarification has to be a forged one. Emilia's behind it, trying to ruin Violet on purpose,"
Sebastian remarked,growing more agitated with every word. He itched to take action and confront Emilia.

After venting for several minutes, he finally noticed Rodger had checked out of the conversation.

"Rodger?" Curious and annoyed, Sebastian stepped closer. Rodger was still watching the same footage of Emilia, her boldness on full display.

The men in the video-his own hires meant to stand up for Violet-had not managed to stop Emilia at all, and now they were coming back to demand more payment. The realization pushed Sebastian's temper to the limit.

Without warning, Sebastian yanked the phone from Rodger's grasp. "Rodger, are you just going to ignore me?" "Give it back," said Rodger, scowling as he reached for his phone.

Noticing Rodger's annoyance, Sebastian hesitated before returning the phone, but he couldn't help adding,"Do you seriously not care about Violet? She saved your life, you know."

"I don't need you throwing that in my face," Rodger retorted, growing more irritated.

"So what do we do now? If we keep stalling, Violet's going to get buried under all this hate." Sebastian ran a hand through his hair.

"Release some juicy industry gossip to shift the attention. Delete any clarification videos, and get people talking about how they're fake," instructed Rodger, hisvoice flat and cold.

He gave Sebastian a pointed look. "You're supposed to be next in line for the entertainment company, but you can't even handle a mess like this?"

"I'm freaking out here, alright? Besides, I thought you were supposed to have my back." Sebastian let out a weak laugh.

Running the family business had never appealed to him. All he wanted was a life filled with luxury and freedom from responsibility.

Rodger shook his head. "You're not a kid anymore. You can't expect me to clean up after you forever."

If Sebastian were a girl, he could have been pampered into adulthood, eventually marrying into a wealthy family and living a worry-free life.

But as things stood, Rodger figured that if anything happened to himself down the line, Sebastian might at least be able to step up.

"I get it, Rodger," Sebastian responded.

"Head over to the dance academy and bring Violet back yourself. I want you to make sure nothing happens to her." Rodger fixed Sebastian with a grave look.

If he hadn't hurt his hand and had to keep a low profile, he would have gone to get her in person. Sebastian nodded right away. "I'll take care of it."

Before he could step outside, someone pushed open the door to the hospital room.

Violet walked in, her face mostly hidden beneath a black cap and mask, but her eyes were puffy and rimmed with red.

"Did someone mess with you? Tell me what happened," said Rodger, his worry spiking as he moved toward her.

"No." Violet tried to hold it together, but the moment she reached for him, tears started spilling down her cheeks.

His chest tightened at the sight, and his tone softened though there was a flash of anger behind it. "Is Emilia causing trouble for you?"
###Chapter 88 Elias's Interference

Violet pressed her face against Rodger's chest, clinging tightly as her tears seeped through the thin fabric of his hospital gown.

Not a single word left her lips, yet the quiet said more than she ever could.

The Mitchell brothers exchanged worried glances, each suspecting that Emilia had once again made Violet's life miserable.

Still, Violet kept her mouth shut, unwilling to let them turn their anger onEmilia. Though her eyes stayed puffy and red, she never allowed herself to betray the truth. It was just like her to put others first.

"That Emilia is the worst. She's always popping up, making trouble for Violet. And she still won't let Rodger go-how shameless can a person get!" A flicker of contempt darkened Sebastian's gaze.

"Don't forget what I told you to do. Handle it now," Rodger said, his tone cold.

"Already on it. Emilia won't get off easy this time!" Sebastian let out a huff before striding out of the room.

"What's Sebastian planning to do? Rodger, please don't let him do anything rash. Emilia hasn't done anything to me," Violet said, her voice trembling with forced anxiety.

Her words held truth, but her pitiful performance was meant to mislead the brothers further.

"Stop worrying. He's only running an errand for me at the company," Rodger said, his tone meant to soothe.

"That makes me feel so much better," replied Violet, her smile softening as she tucked herself comfortably against Rodger.

···
Outside the dance academy, a black car sat parked without attracting a single glance.

"Planning to run to Ms. Harris and show off what you've done for her?" Wilbur asked with a knowing grin, glancing at Elias through the rearview mirror.

Elias had uploaded the security footage that cleared Emilia's name.

"I'm not telling her. That's not my intention," Elias replied, his voice sharp as cold.

"You really shouldn't keep quiet about something good you've done.If nobody hears about it, you'll end up wishing you'd spoken up," Wilbur explained, rambling without pause.

Irritation flickered across Elias's face as he knit his brows. "I don't live with regrets. And you're talking too much."

"Alright, alright! I'll shut up," Wilbur muttered, leaning back with a sigh and clasping his hands behind his head.

Time crawled by, and there was still no sign of Emilia.

A chime broke the silence. Wilbur picked up his phone and shot Elias a look, finding him sitting still with his eyes shut, as if lost in thought.

"There's trouble. Someone's trying to have the video taken down, calling it a fake. On top of that, a scandal with some famous star is hogging all the attention," said Wilbur.

At that, Elias's eyes snapped open. A cold, heavy tension filled the space.

"Make sure people keep watching. Push the video back into the spotlight."

"Consider it done," Wilbur answered without hesitation.

It wasn't long before the video was trending again. Executives at major sites and media outlets, knowing who was behind it, backed away fromn interference. No one dared provoke the fury of someone with that much influence.

··.

While Sebastian was bragging to Rodger about how smoothly things were going, a sudden report drained the color from his face.
"Rodger, that video is blowing up again! There's no way to make it disappear now. People are saying some big name is behind all this. How did she manage to get someone so powerful on her side? Who could it possibly be?!"

Sebastian felt like he was losing his mind. How could Emilia, just an ordinary housewife, be so difficult to take down? Had she really found herself an ally with this much influence, or was fate simply mocking him?

Even the men Sebastian sent hadn't been able to lay a finger on her, and every last effort had gone up in smoke.

Frustration burned in his chest. Unable to hold it in, he kicked the spotless white wall, furious at how everything had unraveled.

He could hardly believe how outrageous the situation had become.
###Chapter 89 Emilia's Back-Up Plan


"Do you think Webster had a hand in this?" Violet kept her voice low.

"No chance." Rodger dismissed the idea at once, shaking his head. "He's nowhere near capable enough.The moment our family steps into the situation, even Webster wouldn't be able to stop us. But now,everything we set up has fallen apart. We can't even trace who's working behind the scenes. Whoever is backing Emilia has real power."

An edge flickered in Violet's gaze, sharpand fleeting.

Why did Emilia, sly as she was, always seem to land on her feet? How did she end up finding someone even more impressive than Rodger?

Violet could not make sense of it, though on the surface, she wore her usual gentle mask. "This is all on me,Rodger. Please, let's not go after Emilia. I don't want you getting tangled up with whoever is supporting her.If that person's as powerful as they seem, the Mitchells could get pulled into something dangerous."

Violet let her voice trail off, and Rodger's frustration only deepened.

"She's already found someone else, yet she refuses to let go of me. Does she really think she can have it both ways?" he snapped.O

Rodger's temper spiked. The thought of Emilia clinging to a new, influential man while still holding up the divorce left him seething. What was she really aiming for?

"You know what she's thinking, right? If that guy ever tosses her aside, she'll just come running back to you.You're her safety net, Rodger." Sebastian didn't hesitate to offer his opinion.

A muscle ticked in Rodger's jaw as he processed Sebastian's words. "Does she really thinkI'm just a backup for her?"

Suspicion narrowed his gaze. Emiia's refusal to end the marriage suddenly made perfect sense. This was her strategy from the very beginning. "Please don't let this upset you, Rodger. I'm worried about your health. Honestly, it's all on me. I never should have returned..." Violet tried to steady her voice, but it trembled with emotion.

"Don't say that. None of this is your fault." Rodger reached for her hand, trying to comfort her.

Her tears gathered and spilled over, her eyes full of sorrow as she looked up at him. Seeing her like that made Rodger's heart twist painfully.

"I'll take care of the divorce soon. You deserve to have your place beside me, Violet," he said, his voice softer now.

Rodger's voice firmed, and his expression hardened. "This marriage is over. Emilia won't get away with stringing me along. I've let her do as she pleased for too long, but that ends now."

Violet tilted her head, forcing a note of concern into her voice. "What's going to happen to Emilia now?"

"She'll have no choice but to sign those divorce papers. I'll make sure of it," Rodger answered, his eyes darkening.

Divorce had become Rodger's only option. Letting Emilia string him along while she juggled another man felt unthinkable. There was no way he would settle for being anyone's backup plan.

Whatever affection he once held for her had burned out. Once their marriage ended, he would wipe her from his life for good.

"You always treat me with such care, Rodger. I'll never forget your kindness, no matter what happens."Violet's voice grew soft, filled with gratitude.

He reached out and pulled her close, his tone warm and gentle. "Violet, you're the most sincere and compassionate person I've ever known. Don't ever doubt that."

"Sometimes I wonder how I got so lucky. I'm afraid I could never measure up to you, Rodger," she replied,a quiet smile touching her lips.

"Don't be silly. Out of everyone in the world, you're the only one I could ever truly care for. Emilia's not even in the same league as you," Rodger muttered. "Can you two pause the romance for a second? The video's still out there, and everyone's talking nonstop.What's our next move?" Sebastian rolled his eyes at their exchange, cutting in with impatience.He started pacing,frustration clear in every step.
###Chapter 90 Her Mysterious Supporter

"Nothing online is dying down, and that video is still everywhere. If the drama keeps spreading, it'll end up ruining Violet's chances of going out in public," Sebastian said, his worry obvious.

There was something else bothering Sebastian, and he spoke up about it. "Violet has to compete in the national ballet competition soon. If this gets any bigger, she might not even be allowed to join."

He shot Rodger and Violet a look so stern it demanded attention.

"Put out something even juicier. I'll handle whatever comes next," Rodger said.

"Understood," Sebastian replied.

"We have to track down whoever started all this. Only then can we hit back the right way," Rodger explained,his face all serious.

He started to wonder about Emilia's connections. The memory of Emilia securing a one-in-a-million shot at life-saving treatment came back to him. If she used that as a bargaining chip, someone powerful would want to help.her out.

Was Emilia using that opportunity to reel in someone with real influence? The idea made Rodger's lips curl into a coId smile.

Emilia really was crafty-dangling that hope just to get close to someone rich. No wonder she found a new man so fast while still keeping him in the background.

There was no way he would let her win. Not only had Emilia left him as a backup, but she was also clinging to that rare treatment instead of letting Violet have it. The thought made him furious.

With a woman like that, full of tricks and spite, he knew she couldn't stay in the Mitchell family. He needed to end their marriage as soon as possible.

A long pause stretched between them before Sebastian finally gave a small nod. "Alright. I'll make sure the investigation keeps going."

In truth, Sebastian hadn't stopped searching for the one helping Emilia. But every effort had turned up nothing.Now, he could only keep digging, even though he had little faith anything would come of it.

Whoever Emilia's new lover was, he must be far more powerful than anyone in the Mitchell family.

Suspicion darkened Sebastian's gaze. He couldn't help but think Emilia had nerve-still married to Rodger,yet she had already moved on, keeping Rodger waiting in the wings.

And she had the nerve to hold onto Asclepius's rare medical chance instead of giving it up to help Violet.

There was no doubt in his mind: Emilia played by her own rules, always scheming,always unpredictable.

---
At the dance academy, Emilia had just slipped through the door when a familiar voice called her name.

"Emilia."

She froze, glancing over her shoulder to spot a tall man in a loose white tee and black sweatpants. With his baseball cap pulled low and a black mask hiding most of his face, she still knew right away-it was Edwin.

What could he possibly want with her now? A crease formed on Emilia's forehead as she regarded him coolly. "What brings you here? Were you looking for me?"

She remembered that she'd already stepped in for him once before. The money she had given was more than enough to help him break away from his old life and start over. If he showed up now hoping for more,she wouldn't show any mercy.

"That's right. I saw the online attacks against you and wanted to make sure you were safe. I was worried someone might try to mess with you," said Edwin, a shadow of disappointment flickering in his eyes.

Emilia's attitude stayed cold and detached, making it clear she wanted distance between them. The coldness stung, but Edwin could hardly blame her-they came from completely different worlds.

Still, it didn't matter to him. He was determined to improve himself, whether that meant standing with her or simply supporting her from afar.

"Emilia, I'm not here to bother you. Please don't get the wrong idea. If you want, I'll go right now. Just promise me you'll be careful-" Edwin explained, his voice tinged with nervous sincerity. Then something caught his attention, and his expression shifted to alarm. "Look out!"
###Chapter 91 Protected Her


Edwin reacted even before he shouted the warning,reaching out to pull Emilia protectively into his arms.

Moving fast, he spun her away from danger and positioned himself in front, making sure she was completely covered.

Something slammed into his back instead of hers, making him wince and bite back a groan.

When the attackers saw that they'd missed their target, they scattered in frustration, clearly not wanting to stick around and get caught.

"Emilia, are you hurt?" Edwin asked, quickly letting go and checking her over, not even thinking about his own pain.

She shook her head, but her face grew serious. "I'm alright, but... what's that horrible smell?"

Looking down, Emilia spotted bits of eggshell and sticky residue at their feet.

It was eggs. Some people had tried to pelt her with them. The idea made her stomach turn.

Edwin, suddenly realizing the state he was in, shifted uncomfortably. His eyes darted to the mess on the ground as he nervously said, "The only thing that matters is you didn't get hit. I should probably go before this gets any worse..."

Before he could leave, she caught him by the arm. "Why so hurry?"

He hesitated, looking embarrassed. "I smell terrible... I don't want to bother you with it."

"It's only a smell. You can clean up. Turn around-let me check your back," Emilia responded.

Even though he felt awkward, Edwin did as she asked, turning so she could see, his head lowered in embarrassment.

His pulse hammered in his ears, every nerve attuned to the light pressure of Emilia's graceful fingers A sudden rush of memory flooded his mind-the gentle touch of her hand that night, the way she'd liftedhis chin.

That memory sent his heart into overdrive. He felt warmth creeping up his neck, coloring his ears a bright shade of red. Unsure where else to look, he kept his gaze glued to the sidewalk, hoping she wouldn't notice how flustered he felt.

Anxious that Emilia might realize just how much her touch affected him, he did his best to stay composed.

Emilia, meanwhile, seemed entirely focused.on the sorry state of his once white T-shirt, now smeared with stains.

"This shirt is ruined," she said matter-of-factly, already steering him in the direction of the bus stop.

Edwin blinked in confusion, a flicker of hope lighting up his eyes. "Where are you taking me, Emilia?"

"We're getting you some fresh clothes," Emilia answered simply.

He realized she was doing this because he had protected her, and a quiet pride welled up inside him.

"I really don't mind. I can just go home and change," he replied, though he followed her without protest.

All the while, he watched her, wishing this walk together would never have to end.

"No more arguing," Emilia said, her tone steady and cool.

Edwin clamped his lips shut right away, but a genuine smile crept onto his face beneath the black mask, his eyes lighting up with quiet happiness.

A gentle rush of warmth spread through him, leaving his chest full of something sweet and bright.

···
Across the street, tucked away in a sleek black sedan, Elias gripped his knees so tightly that his knuckles stood out white against his skin. "It looks like Sloane's giving them a ride. Should we just call it a day and go back?" Wilbur risked a glance in the rearview mirror, catchinng sight of Elias' frozen glare, and instantly felt the heavy tension filling the car.

"Circle around and park by her apartment. We'll wait for her there," Elias instructed, his voice sharp enough to brook no disagreement.

"You know, you really-" Wilbur caught himself as Elias' eyes locked onto his in the mirror, all icy challenge,and decided not to finish his sentence.

Wilbur let his gaze drift from those clenched fists to the blur of city lights outside the window.

For all his stubbornness, there was no hiding how much Elias cared about Emilia.

But how long could he keep pretending otherwise?
###Chapter 92 Is He Unwelcome


Outside the entrance to the apartment building, Sloane slowed to a stop. "Isn't that Elias? What's he doing here?" she asked, her brows knitting together as she shot Emilia a curious look.

"I guess he's probably here for me," Emilia replied, her tone thoughtful as she considered the possibility that Elias wanted to talk about the Asclepius treatmnent. She couldn't imagine any other reason he'd be waiting outside her building.

A hard edge settled in Edwin's eyes as he glanced at Elias, who sat quietly in his wheelchair a short distance away.

Was this the legendary Elias Dixon from Anburith's most powerful family?

Edwin pressed his lips together and made sure not to drift far from Emilia's side.

It amazed him,sometimes, that Emilia's life had become so entwined with someone like Elias-a man who'd always lived surrounded by wealth and privilege.

A subtle shadow flickered in Edwin's expression. No matter how hard he tried, he'd never rise to Elias's level. He could give everything he had and still come up short against someone who'd always belonged to society's elite.

In a world where men like Elias stood at the top, what hope did someone ordinary like him have?

The thought of ever taking Emilia away from Élias seemed almost laughable.

As worry crept into his chest, Edwin's lips faded to white. His hands clenched and loosened in turn, weighed down by a deep sense of defeat.

Surpassing Rodger had already seemed like a long shot, but now Elias stood in the way too.

While Edwin wrestled with these uneasy thoughts, Emilia approached Elias without hesitation. "Mr. Dixon, I haven't decided yet." "I understand," Elias replied, his eyes as cold and sharp as steel, locking onto Edwin with chilling intensity.

When Edwin met that cold stare, an involuntary shiver crept down his back.

The weight of Elias's presence was almost suffocating.

But Edwin refused to back down. He returned Elias's gaze with quiet resolve, a flicker of determination burning in his eyes.

Regardless of how outmatched he felt, he had to keep fighting for his place. If he didn't even try, he would lose any chance to stand with Emilia.

Catching the tension in the air, Emilia turned to Sloane and suggested; "Why don't you take Edwin upstairs first? I need to talk to Mr. Dixon alone."

"Come on." Sloane nodded in agreement and motioned to Edwin. "Let's head inside."

She couldn't help but notice how striking Edwin looked, his quiet loyalty to Emilia a far cry from Rodger's reckless ways

Even without flashy clothes or money, Edwin had an unspoken charisma-a presence that set him apart.

"I'll go clean up first," Edwin said quietly, his voice soft just for her as he offered Emilia a gentle smile.

Elias felt his ears burn at Edwin's words.

Was the guy deliberately challenging him?

A faint crease appeared on Elias's brow, and his grip tightened on the arms of his wheelchair.

Didn't Edwin have a place of his own? Why was he heading upstairs with Sloane, acting like he belonged there?

"Go on, then," Emilia said, watching as Edwin and Sloane disappeared into the building.

She'd already bought Edwin a couple of new outfits, tossing the egg-stained shirt straight into the trash.

"You know Edwin?" Emilia asked, turning back to Elias without bothering with small talk as she caught the way he had looked at Edwin.

"No. We've never met," Elias answered, his tone flat.

"For a moment, I assumed you two might be acquainted," Emilia remarked in an even tone. "Is there anything else, Mr. Dixon? Otherwise, I'll be going upstairs now."

A chill settled over Elias, his jaw tightening as his lips formed a hard, silent line.

Did Emilia truly want nothing to do with him?

He watched Edwin walk in so easily-invited, accepted, even trusted enough to head upstairs and clean up-while he remained outside, unwelcome.

The thought nagged at him-childish, yet hard to ignore. Why was he stuck outside while someone else walked right in? His lips parted, but the words never came.
###Chapter 93 Ask For An Invitation


"I was the one who handled the rumors online for you, Ms. Harris," Elias said, his voice cool and composed.

Wilbur stared in disbelief, nearly gaping. Just a little while ago, Elias had insisted that he'd never breathe a word to Emilia-he even acted irritated by the idea.

Now, here he was, owning up to it without a hint of hesitation. So much for never going back on his word!Was Elias actually trying to score points with her?

He could only mock Elias in his head, unwilling to say anything out loud and risk getting on Elias's badside.

A hint of surprise flickered in Emilia's eyes. "So it was you."

"Who else did you expect?" Elias replied, brows drawing together ever so slightly as he pinned her with a sharp, searching look.

"I didn't really have a guess," Emilia answered with a gentle smile."I just knew someone was looking out for me, but I had no idea who it was."

Of course, Emilia kept her real thoughts to herself. There was no way she'd confess that she'd first suspected Oliver, especially since she'd once saved his daughter-that had seemed the logical guess.

"Now that you know the truth." Elias's words cut through the air, colder and sharper than before, his presence almost overwhelming.

"Yeah. I appreciate what you did, Mr. Dixon. Thank you," Emilia replied, her voice earnest.

Elias arched an eyebrow, clear disappointment flickering across his face. "That's it?"

A hush settled between them as Emilia hesitated, glancing at Wilbur before returning her gaze to Elias.

Was he hinting that she owed him more-maybe even that rare Asclepius treatment?

When the silence stretched too long, Elias finally spoke, impatience creeping into his tone. "Aren't you going to invite me in?"

He hardly recognized himself-he had never wanted something so openly before.

"Oh!" A look of surprise flashed across Emilia's face as the realization hit her. A little flustered, she tried to recover her composure.

With an apologetic smile, she motioned toward the door. "Come on in, both of you."

Wilbur didn't waste a second, steering Elias's wheelchair forward, a faint grin tugging at his mouth.

Was this really the same Elias he'd always known? The man he remembered would never have claimed credit out loud, much less pushed for an invitation like this.

Wilbur never would have imagined witnessing something like this. If anyone had described Elias's behavior today, he'd have dismissed it as fantasy.

Yet, here it was, unfolding right in front of him. Suddenly, anything seemed possible. Elias was different now -breaking away from the man he used to be.

...

The sound of the door swinging open drew Sloane into the hallway. She stopped short when she saw Emilia had brought the two men with her.

Surprise flickered in Sloane's eyes. Why were the two here?

Casting a quick, questioning glance at Emilia, Sloane silently asked for an explanation.

"Mr.Dixon took care of the rumors online, so I thought I'd invite them up for some coffee." Emilia flashed her a reassuring smile.

Understanding dawned on Sloane's face and she offered a more genuine welcome. "Thank you both for stepping in and sorting things out. We really appreciate it."

Elias's jaw set a little tighter, his entire presence turning ice-cold. He was the one who'd dealt with everything, not Wilbur. Annoyance flashed in his eyes as his brow creased, barely hiding his irritation. Sloane, meanwhile,was too caught up with Emilia to notice the cold creeping into Elias's expression.

"Emilia." With an easy grin, she slipped an arm around Emilia's shoulders and gave her a playful wink. "You know, Edwin volunteered to make dinner tonight. All we have to do is sit back and wait. I'm curious to see what he'll whip up."

Watching Edwin out of the corner of her eye, Sloane felt a growing sense of approval. He seemed genuinely thoughtful, and the more she saw, the more she liked the idea of him.

If Emilia ended up falling for him, she would give her blessing without a second thought.
###Chapter 94 Elias Will Cook


No one picked up on the way Elias's grip tightened ever so slightly on the arms of his wheelchair.

Wilbur, looking pleasantly intrigued, broke the moment with a light-hearted grin. "When it comes to food,there's honestly only one chef I hold in high regard."

He watched Edwin for a moment, suspecting there was more to the man than met the eye. With that thought, Wilbur decided he'd help tip the scales in Elias's favor. He couldn't stand the idea of someone else swooping in and overshadowing everything Elias had done.

Sloane's curiosity was instantly piqued. "Oh? Who might that be?"

Wilbur, grinning with obvious pride, gestured straight at Elias. "That would be him."

The answer caught both Emilia and Sloane off guard. Their surprise showed in their faces as they turned to Elias, their disbelief plain as day.

"Are you serious? You're not just hyping up your friend, right?" Sloane shot Wilbur a doubtful look.

The idea of a privileged heir, someone who had never needed to do anything for himself, actually knowing how to cook? That was hard to swallow. Who would believe-such a thing?

With all the resources the Dixon family had, they could hire the best chefs in the city. What reason could Elias possibly have to set foot in a kitchen?

The whole idea seemed absurd, the very image of a privileged socialite toiling in a kitchen almost laughable.

"I promise I'm not making this up. You'Il see for yourselves-once you've tried his food, you'll be convinced,"Wilbur explained.

Emilia's eyes drifted down to Elias's.legs before she spoke up. "We believe you."

"I don't-not unless I actually see him cook..." Sloane started to protest, but Emilia quickly reached over to cover her mouth. With a pointed glance, Emilia urged Sloane to notice Elias's wheelchair.

Only then did Sloane glance down, her realization dawning as she caught sight of his immobile legs.

Even if his skills were real, it felt wrong to expect him to cook-it would be asking too much, given his circumstances.

Emilia offered an apologetic look. "I'm sorry, Mr. Dixon. She didn't mean-"

"It's fine. My legs might not cooperate, but my hands work just fine. If you'd like, I can make something for everyone to try." Elias waved off her concern.

A quiet determination simméred beneath his calm words. He wanted to prove he could do more than people assumed. Part of him was also itching to outshine Edwin, who always seemed to be hovering near Emilia.

Sloane stared/at him in disbelief. "You're actually up for this?" She hadn't expected him to volunteer,especially given his limitations.

An unmistakable chill came off Elias, his aura turning sharper and more commanding with every word.

"That's what I'm talking about! If he wants to prove his skills, there's no better way than by stepping up to the stove," said Wilbur, jumping in with enthusiasm as he sensed the shift in the room.

Ever since the accident, Elias had always bristled when people paid attention to his legs or brought up his disability.

Wilbur, all too aware of Elias's temper, felt a twinge of anxiety. He'd seen before what happened when Elias was truly pushed too far.

"Mr. Dixon, I have no doubt your food will be amazing. I'm actually excited to try something you make-it's not every day we get an opportunity like this." Emilia broke the tension with a warm smile.

Just like that, the cold air around Elias seemed to thaw. His shoulders relaxed, and the hard set of his features eased.

He knew she was only being gracious, but her words brought a quiet satisfaction he hadn't expected. "With that much confidence in me, l'Il make sure not to disappoint you, Ms. Harris," Elias replied, the faintest hint of a smile curving at the corner of his mouth.

What?! Wilbur almost did a double-take. Did Elias just... smile? And so quickly after all that tension?

By the time Wilbur looked again, the smile had vanished, replaced by Elias's familiar, distant calm.

Maybe he'd just imagined it.
###Chapter 95 Love Rivals Meet


Edwin walked out of the bathroom, water still streaming down his hair. Just as he did, he caught Emilia's voice drifting through the hallway, filled with warmth as she showered Elias with praise. He found himself standing there, a tangle of feelings stirring inside him.

Edwin ran his fingers through his wet hair, then quietly moved closer, positioning himself in front of Emilia.

"I'm finished now. What would you like to eat?" said Edwin.

Emilia took one look at his messy, damp hair and shook her head. "Hold on. Let me grab the hairdryer. Dry your hair first before you do anything else."

Without another word, Emilia hurried off to find the hairdryer, missing the cold stare that passed between Edwin and Elias behind her back.

The moment their eyes met,Edwin let go of the gentle front he showed Emilia. He locked eyes with Elias,neither willing to back down.

Elias's expression turned cold in an instant, and the sharp edge in his stare left no doubt about his mood.

Emilia returned seconds later, holding the hairdryer out for Edwin. "Here, use this," she said, her return breaking the silent standoff between the men.

Even so, Elias's cool gaze lingered, and the tension between him and Edwin refused to vanish completely.

"Thanks," Edwin said quietly, his tone soft but lively, the kind of voice that drew people in as he took the hairdryer from her and gave Emilia a sheepish grin.

Emilia paused and finally took a good look at Edwin. He looked much fresher than the last time she had seen him at that KTV club.

His hair was still damp, his cheeks carried a healthy flush, and there was a pleasant scent about him that seemed to fit him perfectly.
It was almost a shame, she thought, that someone with his looks and presence was stuck working in a place like that. If Edwin hadn't needed so much money for his family, he would never have ended up choosing that rough, demeaning job.

"Ahem!" A sharp cough from Elias cut through the room, the sternness in his eyes impossible to ignore.

Emilia snapped out of her thoughts and turned to look at him,confusion flickering across her face.

Something was off. Why did Elias look so irritated?

"YOU-"

"YOU-"

Both of them started speaking at the same time, only to fall silent in surprise.

Breaking the awkwardness, Emilia spoke first. "Go ahead, you can talk first."

Elias got straight to the point. "What do you want toeat?"

"As long as it tastes good, I don't mind what it is," Emilia answered with a small smile.

It didn't matter if a dish was supposed to be her favorite. If it didn't taste right, she couldn't force herself to eat it. For her, flavor always took priority over name or nostalgia.

Elias clamped his mouth shut after that, saying nothing more as he pressed his lips together in a thin line.

All the while, Edwin busied himself with the hairdryer, though he was listening in on every word, pretending not to notice the tension in the air.

Lowering his head, Edwin let his bangs cover those striking eyes, hiding whatever thoughts lingered behind them.

A flicker of amusement played at the edge of his lips when he noticed Elias stumbling to ask Emilia about her preferences.

Cooking happened to be one of Edwin's true joys, and he was sure he could whip up something that would impress her.Running a hand through his now-dry hair, Edwin casually ruffled it, his features coming into full view.

While he was every bit as good-looking as Elias, there was a gentle charm about him, so unlike the sharp intensity that Elias wore.

"So, you both plan to handle the kitchen for real?" Emilia asked, glancing between them with a touch of hesitation.

Letting guests cook felt odd to her, and the thought of leaving everything up to Sloane weighed on her conscience. Cooking wasn't exactly her strong suit, and eating out sounded easier, but she was torn.

"We'll take care ofit," Edwin and Elias said in perfect unison, determination clear in their eyes.

Wilbur, ever eager, chimed in, "Don't worry, Ms. Harris. He could use some more practice, and I'll lend a hand."

The chance to taste Elias's cooking again was something Wilbur wasn't about to miss.

But with Elias's health uncertain, Wilbur figured they'd have to keep it simple-maybe just a couple of dishes at most.

With any luck, Emilia would notice how much effort Elias put in and might feel moved enough to grant them access to Asclepius's treatment.
###Chapter 96 Battlefield On The Dining Table


When Edwin and Elias made it clear they wanted to handle the cooking, Emilia let the matter drop.

Refusing to stand by while others did all the work, Emilia joined Sloane at the couunter to start preparing a pot of soup.

Everyone soon got involved, from washing leafy greens to chopping vegetables and setting up the ingredients.

Edwin set to work with energy, putting together a plate of blackened shrimp bursting with Cajun flavor,slow-roasted pulled pork glazed in barbecue sauce, and grilled clams tossed in garlic butter and spice.

Elias, sticking to comfort food, cooked up garlicky spinach and scrambled eggs loaded with melted cheese and sun-dried tomatoes.

Because maneuvering the kitchen in a wheelchair posed a real challenge, Elias kept his menu short,with Wilbur standing by his side to heIp however he could.

Once the meal was finished, Emilia looked over the colorful dishes spread across the table. "Thank you,everyone, for putting in so much effort."

"It was nothing. Go on, Emilia, have a taste." Edwin flashed her a bright look.

Across the table, Elias grew quiet, a chill settling into his features.

"I'Il start with the clams," said Emilia as she reached for the plate and took a bite.

The moment the flavors hit her tongue, she couldn't hide her delight. Her eyes widened with genuine surprise at just how good Edwin's cooking was.

"This is amazing!" she said, and her.voice left no doubt she meant every word.

Not missing a beat, Wilbur glanced at Elias's tense expression and nudged the conversation along.′′MHarris,you should really try what Elias made too." Catching Wilbur's enthusiasm, Edwin's cheerful expression faltered for a second. He shot Wilbur a sharp glare, making it clear he wasn't fooled by Wilbur's intentions.

"Emilia, you should try the shrimp and the pork too. They turned out really well," Edwin suggested gently,trying to recover.

"I'll get to those next, but let me taste these first." Emilia gave him a reassuring smile. She took a forkful of the eggs and followed it with a bite of spinach.

As she sampled each dish, Edwin's gaze dropped, lashes lowering as he masked the hint of disappointment that crept across his face.

After savoring the spinach, Emilia spoke up. "This is excellent. I never would have guessed you had such talent in the kitchen, Mr. Dixon."

"Thanks for saying that," Elias replied softly, managing a small nod.

"Is the food i made too heavy for your taste, Emilia? I hope I didn't overdo it," Edwin said, a touch of worry creeping into his voice.

"Not in the slightest," replied Emilia, sampling the pork and then reaching for a shrimp without hesitation to put Edwin at ease.

"These are honestly incredible." She flashed Edwin a bright grin and gave him a thumbs up. "I'd say you and Elias could both give professional chefs a run for their money."

"If you're enjoying it, let me get you some more," Edwin responded.

A shadow flickered across Elias's face, and his mouth pressed into a harder line. The sight of Emilia complimenting Edwin, on top of that enthusiastic thumbs up, grated on him.

Not willing to let Edwin win all the praise, Elias took the initiative, urging Emilia to taste more of his food."Not just meat. You should eat vegetables a little more," he said, voice steady and blank.

Watching the two's urge, Emilia gave a resigned smile."Okay, okay. No one is going tobe overlooked."

Sloane hardly glanced up from her plate, savoring every mouthful with the kind of focus reserved for life's greatest pleasures.

Wilbur joined her, shoveling food in with a quiet determination, both of them lost in the flavors,barely noticing anything beyond the next bite.

At the opposite end of the table, Edwin and Elias locked eyes. Neither said a word, but the look they exchanged said it all.

An unspoken rivalry crackled between them, thickening the air with competition as if the meal itself had become a new battlefield.
###Chapter 97 All His Frustration Vanished
Emilia glanced across the table and realized that both Edwin and Elias had barely touched their meals. Leaning forward a bit, she said,"You two haven't even started. Food's best when it's fresh off the stove, so go ahead and help yourselves."

That simple encouragement finally broke their deadlock. Edwin and Elias dropped their intense stares and began eating in silence.

Emilia looked them over. Something felt off,like there was unfinished business hanging in the air.

Letting her eyes settle on Edwin, she grew even more puzzled. She'd looked into his life and found nothing unusual-his background was plain as day. Everything matched the story he'd shared with her: a father bedridden with illness,a mother carrying the weight of losing a child and sometimes struggling to keep herself together.

There wasn't any sign Edwin's and Elias's lives should have crossed before, much less that they'd share this sort of cold rivalry.

"Emilia, are you staring at me because I missed something on my face?" Edwin asked, quickly brushing his fingers over his cheek in embarrassment.

Emilia offered a gentle shake of her head."Nothing's wrong. Just finish your meal."

"Sure." A shy smile crossed Edwin's face as he picked up his fork.

From his spot at the table, Elias watched the exchange, his eyes turning icy, and the space around him seemed to chill several degrees.

Whatever hunger he had left seemed to vanish in an instant. Elias pushed his plate away after only a few half-hearted bites. "I'm done here.Take your time with the rest."

Without waiting for a reply, he turned his wheelchair and rolled quietly into the living room.

Elias refused to sample anything that came from Edwin's side of the kitchen, while Edwin steered clear of every dish Elias had made.

Their silent avoidance went unnoticed by everyone else, but both men felt the tension simmering beneath the surface.

From her seat, Emilia watched Elias disappear into the living room, then studied his barely touched plate.

"Did he reallymean it when he said he was full?"She turned a questioning look on Wilbur, her thoughts drifting back to the last time they dined at the Gilded Fork.

Back then, Elias had eaten with enthusiasm. Was he just being picky tonight? That seemed unlikely-he'd cooked some of the dishes himself, and every dish was delicious. Their talent in the kitchen left her in awe, highlighting her own lack of skill.

"He probably isn't that hungry tonight. Most days, he eats more than this," Wilbur responded without raising his head.

Edwin leaned over, offering Emilia a soft word of encouragement. "You should have some more,Emilia."

She gave a gentle nod and replied, "You as well,Edwin."

A quick glance toward the living room was all Emilia needed before she rose from her seat and ladled some soup into a bowl.

Letting Elias leave her house with an empty stomach, especially after helping in the kitchen,simply didn't sit right with her.

"I'll go take this to him," she said, balancing the bowl in her hands as she stepped away from the table.

She found Elias by the window, gazing outside with his back turned.

"Even if you're not that hungry, you should at least try a little soup," Emilia suggested, her voice gentle as she approached.

A subtle wave of relief washed over Elias,the tightness in his chest loosening for the first time all evening.

Turning his wheelchair to face her, he caught sight of the bowl she held out, and the irritation on his face faded.

Emilia stopped beside him and held out the soup. "Here, have some while it's still warm."

She reminded herself to stay on good terms with him-her plans to get into the Dixon family estate and hunt for the missing half of the treasure map depended on it.

Elias kept his expression stoic, but a touch of gratitude warmed his heart as he accepted the bowl and took a careful sip.

Emilia watched him hopefully. "Do you like it?"

Meeting her hopeful eyes, Elias let the usual polite dismissal fall away and replied in a quiet voice, "It's really good."

"There's plenty more if you want seconds. Just ask and I'll bring you another bowl. I should get back to the table-I haven't had enough yet,"Emilia said with a small grin before turning to leave.

"Okay," replied Elias, watching her walk away.Though his face gave nothing away, a trace of warmth lingered in his eyes, his earlier frustration all but gone.


...
When they reached the front door, Wilbur paused and gave Emilia a friendly smile. "Thank you for inviting us over. It was a wonderful meal." "Take care on your way home," Emilia remarked,standing in the doorway to see them off.

Elias stood by silently, his lips pressed together,eyes drifting to Edwin, who lingered in the entryway as if he wished the evening could last just a little longer.
###Chapter 98 Hire Edwin As A Cook
Edwin had started to act like he belonged in Emilia's family, and that did not sit well with Elias. His expression turned sour.

Wilbur reached for the handles of Elias's wheelchair,ready to move him, but paused. "Is he staying here?"

Everyone's eyes shifted in the same direction as Wilbur's, and it was obvious who he meant.

"He isn't staying. I just need to talk to him about something," Emilia explained quickly,jumping in with an answer.

Elias shot her a cold look. "What is it?"

What could be so important that he couldn't hear it?

"Mr. Dixon, this is personal. I hope you understand it's not your place," Emilia said,setting a boundary.

"Alright." Elias's lips pressed together, and the distance between them only grew. W/e'll catch you later," Wilbur responded,steering Elias out of the room.

Emilia only shut the door once the elevator doors slid closed.

"Emilia, if you ever need help, just let me know,"Edwin remarked sincerely.

Emilia rested her gaze on Edwin. "How would you feel about becoming our cook? I want to hire you."

She knew it was a rare stroke of luck to come across someone so talented in the kitchen, and she would not let that chance pass by.

Sometimes, she wondered how things would have turned out if Elias came from a simpler life.Maybe then, she could have brought him onboard as well. In another life, they might have launched a restaurant together-she would supply the funds, and the two men could handle everything else.

"I'd love that," Edwin said, his face lighting up as he nodded so quickly it seemed like he feared she might change her mind at any second "I only need you to handle two meals a day.I'll pay you twenty thousand a month," muttered Emilia,making her offer clear.

"That's way too generous." Edwin shook his head and held his palms up. "Honestly, you don't have to pay me. After everything you've done for me, I'd be willing to cook for you for the rest of my life, and it still wouldn't feel like enough."

To Edwin, what Emilia gave him was far more than money. She had offered hope when his father's life hung in the balance. Without her,he could not say for sure his father would have survived long enough for him to gather the money for his care.

She was not just the woman he adored. She had become the light that made his dark world a little brighter. Nothing could change that.

"That was not my money. It came from the people who hurt you. If you want to remember the kindness, that's fine. But you have to accept the pay, or I'll find someone else for the job."Emilia kept her voice gentle but firm.

Edwin nearly stumbled over his own words."Okay, I'll take the job. Please, let me start," he said, eager to accept before Emilia had second thoughts.

Emilia smiled and nodded. "That's settled,then.I'll arrange a place for you in this building. Just know, I tend to get sudden cravings, so you might end up making more than two meals a day."

Edwin's answer was quick. "You don't have to worry about the rent. Let me handle that part."

She could see he was serious, so she decided not to argue.

"We'll have you start tomorrow. Is that alright with you?"

He gave her a confident nod of the head."Tomorrow works for me. I'm ready."

Once their agreement was set, Emilia let Edwin head back home.



A short distance from the apartment complex,a plain black van sat quietly on the street.

Wilbur glanced sideways at Elias. "So, are you planning to spend the whole night out here?" Elias stayed silent, his lips pressed in a hard line while his eyes never left the apartment's entrance.

If not for the slight movement of his chest,Wilbur might have mistaken him for a statue.

"You were so sure you'd win Emilia over with your cooking. I figured she'd give you that spot for treatment right away. Guess you didn't expect that guy to be just as talented in the kitchen," Wilbur said, stretching his arms behind his head. "Looks like you've finally got some competition. Maybe your love story ends here."

That was enough to snap Elias out of his silence.He glared at Wilbur with ice in his eyes. "If you can't say anything helpful, then don't say anything at all."
###Chapter 99 Late Night Order
"Cananybodyreally understandhowloveworks?"Wilbur asked, unbothered by the tension.

Elias shot him a warning glare that made Wilbur immediately look away. That was when Wilbur noticed Edwin stepping outside.

"Look at that," said Wilbur, focusing on Edwin's cheerful stride. "He's leaving, and he looks over the moon.Something must've gone right for him.You think Ms. Harris finally told him how she feels?"

Those words barely hung in the air before a chill settled over the van, turning the inside colder than before.

Wilbur pulled his jacket tighter, sneaking a glance at Elias, whose stare could have cut glass.

"I ŝwear, that's just a guess," Wilbur stammered."It's not like Ms. Harris would actually do that."

His thoughts raced as he realized he might have just signed his own death warrant. If possible,
Elias's expression grew even icier.

Before Wilbur could dig himself any deeper,
Elias spoke up. "Drive. We're leaving."

Wilbur blinked, thrown off. "Wait,what?"

Elias's unyielding gaze left Wilbur no choice. He started the car without another word.

"We're just heading back? You're not even the least bit tempted to corner that guy and get some answers?" Wilbur asked, unable to keep his curiosity in check. "Maybe I should go and find out what made him so happy."

Elias kept his eyes closed, barely moving. "Stop talking."

That was all it took for Wilbur to button his lips.He wondered how Elias could stay so collected,especially after how agitated he used to get whenever Emilia was around.

Not long after, they left the van behind. Elias made his way to the study, rolled inside, and quietly turned the lock, shutting out the world.
"This is wild," Wilbur whispered under his breath as he watched the closed door, shaking his head. "How does he manage to act like nothing bothers him? Where did all that nervous energy go?"

He hung around for a bit, hoping Elias would come out, but the study remained silent and the door stayed shut. With nothing else to do,Wilbur headed back to his own room.

...
Sometime in the middle of the night, Wilbur,barely awake, became dimly aware of a shadowy figure standing next to his bed.

At first, Wilbur thought his imagination was playing tricks on him. After blinking a few times,he realized someone really was standing by his bed.

Panic shot through him as he shot upright and fumbled for the lamp, flooding the room with light.

When he saw it was Elias, his shoulders slumped,though his irritation was plain. "You can't be serious right now. What are you doing here in the middle of night? Watching me sleep is not normal,you know."

If Wilbur didn't know Elias so well, he might have bought into the gossip swirling around about Elias. Who stayed up in the middle of the night just to stand and stare at someone sleeping? If he hadn't spent so much time with Elias, he would have suspected something strange.

Elias, unable to rest, had only one thing on his mind-he needed answers about what had left Edwin looking so pleased.

"Go find out what Emilia and Edwin discussed,"Elias instructed, his voice sharp and cold.

Still groggy from sleep, Wilbur tried to keep his annoyance in check. Lashing out at Elias would get him nowhere.
Wilbur could not keep the frustration out of his voice. "What did I ever do to deserve this? Why not just send a text? Did you have to wake me up like this?" He sounded ready to break down.

"I want answers. Get to it now." Without another word, Elias turned his chair toward the door.

As the wheels rolled out, Wilbur muttered a vow under his breath. From now on, he would never go to bed without locking that door. Defeated, he grabbed his phone and began making calls, following Elias's orders. Deep down, he knew he owed too much to Elias to ever refuse.


.·.
The following morning.

Inside the bright, glass-walled office of the Edwards GGroup, Oliver's gaze was unreadable.

"Jeffry, bring me a coffee," Oliver said, his voice flat.

"Right away, sir." Jeffry turned and left at once.

Oliver leaned back in his chair, pressing his fingers to his aching forehead.

Pulling out his phone, he caught a headline about Emilia that made him pause.

His mood soured as he scanned the stories, his expression tightening with every line.

A chill settled behind his glasses, and the cold glint in his eyes grew sharper.
###Chapter 100 Oliver Decides To Interfere
Emilia's husband had gone out of his way to protect the woman he kept on the side.

While Emilia bore the brunt of the blame, he did nothing to stop the waves of online criticism that crashed down on her.

Any time a video surfaced to clear her name,her husband was quick to use his influence to bury it deep.

He even went so far as to manufacture another celebrity scandal, all to keep attention off his lover.

But for all his efforts, someone was working hard to upset his plans.

Oliver put the pieces together quickly, his eyes falling to Emilia's photo on his phone. For a moment, the cold sharpness faded, and real concern shone through.

The news had passed him by until now. By the time he caught up, it was clear that someone had been pulling strings to steer the whole story.

Remembering the cruel things people had posted about her, a pang of guilt ran through him.

It stung to realize he had not noticed that his daughter's rescuer had become the internet's latest target.

When Jeffry returned with a cup of coffee, he spotted a storm brewing on Oliver's face-so unlike the man's usual calm and elegance.

Oh no! Who in their right mind would risk angering Mr.Edwards?

With shaking hands, he managed to serve the coffee and plaster on a nervous smile. "Here's your coffee,Mr.Edwards."

"Get the car. I'm going to the dance academy."Oliver pushed up from his chair, his stare as sharp as glass.

A chill crept up Jeffry's back. There was no way he would question that order.

"Right away, Mr. Edwards."

Oliver's cold stare lingered a moment longer, leaving Jeffry uneasy.

Did he miss something? Was there some task he had forgotten? No matter how hard he tried,Jeffry could not remember making a single mistake.

"Have you been keeping up with what's happening to Ms. Harris online?" Oliver adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses, his refined appearance belying a ruthless nature beneath the surface.

"I'm sorry, sir. I missed it completely." Jeffry bowed his head in apology.

"From now on, I expect every single update about her on my desk as soon as it happens,"Oliver insisted,his tone glacial.

"Understood," Jeffry replied, quickly wiping the nervous sweat from his hands.

For all his gentlemanly charm, Oliver never hesitated to use a heavy hand when he needed to.




Meanwhile, at the front of the dance academy,a gleaming Rolls-Royce Cullinan pulled up,instantly attracting a crowd of curious eyes. Phones came out quietly as onlookers tried to sneak a few shots, all hoping to catch a glimpse of the mysterious passenger behind those blacked-out windows.

Someone in the crowd murmured, "We see fancy cars all the time here, but a Rolls-Royce?That's something special."

Another voice chimed in, "Probably some spoiled heir showing off. Who else rolls up to dance class in that kind of car?"

"You never know. Maybe it's some sugar daddy waiting for his girl."

Everyone knew their academy was not just a sanctuary for talent. Money and influence opened doors just as easily as skill did.

It was not unusual to see students who owed their spot to wealthy sponsors, not just family fortunes.

Oliver's gaze locked onto Emilia as soon as she stepped into view.

"Bring Ms. Harris to me," he instructed calmly.

"Right away." Jeffry wasted no time, stepping out and weaving his way toward Emilia. All eyes watched him, and for a split second,the crowd wondered if he was the owner of the luxury car-until they realized he was just the driver. With that kind of money, no one expected the owner to sit behind the wheel.

A wave of curiosity followed Jeffry as he made his way through the crowd and intercepted Emilia.

"Ms. Harris, Mr. Edwards would like a word with you,"Jeffry said,his tone polite.

"Mr. Edwards?" Emilia echoed, her eyes darting to the sleek Rolls-Royce parked nearby. A hint of confusion flickered across her face.

What could have brought Oliver here today, of all days?
